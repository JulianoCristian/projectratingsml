I   IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.
                                                                                                                               I
    About this Report
           The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
    first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
    expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
    dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
    the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
    that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
    which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
    important lessons.
           To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
    documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
    and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
    in local offices as appropriate.
           Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
    internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
    relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
    the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
    the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

    About the IEGWB Rating System
         IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
    lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
    arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
    (additional information is available on the IEGWB website: httD://worldbank.orq/ieg).
         Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
    achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
    relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
    objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
    sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
    Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
    the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
    were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
    extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
    and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
    operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
         Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
    outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
    Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
         Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
    operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
    transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
    achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
    Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
         Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
    agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
    agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
    performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Petformance: Highly
    Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
    unsatisfactory.

project completion and appraisal reports, the Development Credit and Loan Agreements,
a review o f Bank files, and discussions with beneficiaries, Bank staff, government
officials, non-governmental organizations, institutions, banks, donors, and private sector
managers. The cooperation and assistance o f all stakeholders as well as the support o f
World Bank Country Offices in Nicaragua, Peru, Colombia and Brazil is gratefully
acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, a draft o f the main report and the respective PPAR
was sent to each Borrower for comments before being finalized. The Borrowers'
comments are presented in Appendices to the individual country Project Performance
Assessment Reports. The final report will be available to the public following submission
to the World Bank's Board o f Directors.

Summary
This report assesses the performance o f four agriculture projects that used a similar approach
to support agricultural research in Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua and Peru and draws
conclusions based on a comparative analysis o f the four projects.

The unifying theme for this assessment i s the performance o f nationwide systems o f
agricultural research with particular reference to the use o f Competitive Grant Schemes to
fund a wide range o f generally small-scale initiatives for developing and transferring
agricultural technologies.

Competitive Grant Schemes (CGS) typically entail nationwide contests, inviting a wide range
o f potential service providers to submit proposals for technical review. Selection o f proposals
financed i s made according to transparent procedures and i s based on rigorous criteria. The
aim i s to bring greater contestability and increased efficiency to bear on agricultural
knowledge creation. CGS complement traditional "block" funding allocated annually to
specified public research organizations for their core research programs.

Since the early 1990s Latin America has pioneered the CGS approach, with significant
support from the Bank, including the four projects assessed in this report.

The main evaluation findings are six-fold. First, although the design o f the projects was client
responsive, outreach to the poorest groups and regions was problematic. Second, an IEG p o l l
o f persons knowledgeable about the projects found a widespread conviction that the rigor and
transparency o f subproject selection was enhanced by the competitive model, but IEG found
no evidence that this model led to higher quality and more cost-effective research than
alternative approaches.

Third, the assessed projects sought, in varying degrees, to promote decentralization in order
to be more client responsive and to balance regional priorities. But progress was uneven.
Brazil made the greatest progress in developing research capacity in the individual states.

Fourth, although the projects were generally conducive to the diversification o f service
providers, they did not lead to a significant increase in participation by the commercial
private sector. O n the other hand, to the extent that the projects helped to improve skills,
increase capacity, and elicit co-payment financing involving farmers and their organizations
as well as other private nonprofit organizations, they contributed to a broader process o f
private sector development.

Fifth, with the exception o f Peru, there i s no evidence from rigorous impact evaluations to
show whether the various small subprojects led to higher agricultural productivity and
increased farm incomes, and the assessed projects made insufficient provision for assessing
the short-term performance o f individual subprojects (there was no systematic specification
o f baselines and targets).

Sixth, while there are doubts about h o w long support for the competitive fund model will
continue in all four projects, it i s equally important to recognize the support these projects
gave to strengthening the broader public research and extension apparatus. Where there i s a
                                               xii


strong public sector apparatus there i s likely to be a sound enabling environment for
competitive funding over the longer term, which may offset short-term downturns in
government and donor support for competitive funds.

The outcome o f the Nicaragua project i s rated unsatisfactory. The objectives and design o f
the project were only modestly relevant, given Nicaragua's weak institutional capacity.
Financing for the competitive fund component was halved, hampering the launch o f this pilot
initiative. There i s conflicting information about the achievement o f project outputs; and
outcomes, in terms o f crop yields and increased farm incomes, are also in doubt.

The outcome of the Peru project i s rated moderately satisfactory. The objectives and the
design o f the project were substantially relevant, both in terms o f the need to strengthen
Peru's agricultural research and extension institutions and the consistency with good practice
thinking in the Bank. But there was a shortfall in the number o f adaptive research and
extension subprojects, weaknesses in strategic research services, and limited progress toward
the objective o f improving management o f public investment in agricultural technology. The
project's actual achievements were significant in relation to the small size o f the project; and
a recent impact study suggests that I N C A G R O subprojects have had a favorable impact on
technology adoption rates and farm incomes.

The outcome o f the Colombia project i s rated moderately satisfactory. The objectives o f the
project were substantially relevant to Colombia's development priorities. Most o f the
project's output targets were met or exceeded-particularly so for training-and the project
substantially achieved 3 o f i t s 5 objectives. One o f the biggest contributions was a
strengthening o f the public research agency, CORPOICA. But it was not as instrumental as
expected in leading to greater participation by non-government research providers. Also,
efficiency was compromised by the small size and diffuse nature o f the subprojects.

The outcome o f the Brazil project i s rated satisfactory. The project addressed important
issues on the agricultural research agenda (including development o f family farms and poorer
regions) and exceeded i t s targets in terms o f the number o f subprojects generated and the
investments in institutional strengthening. Output targets were exceeded, even though actual
total project costs were slightly less than expected at appraisal. The strengthening o f
EMBRAPA had a clear positive impact on the agency's institutional capacity and
undoubtedly benefited the national research effort.

Comparative analysis o f the four projects yields the following lessons:

There is a clear need for stronger monitoring and evaluation o research projects. The lack
                                                                   f
o f hard evidence about the results o f CGS investments in research and extension i s a
considerable shortcoming o f all but one project. In each o f these countries, agricultural
productivity has risen since the mid 1 9 9 0 with growth increasingly based on intensification
                                               ~~
rather than area expansion. Potentially, the assessed projects contributed to this expansion.
But, with the exception o f Peru, there i s no robust survey evidence linking productivity and
income changes to the project interventions.

I t is important to strengthen the capacity o research organizations, not just tofinance
                                             f
research. CGS can be an important vehicle for research financing and have a strategic role to
                                                ...
                                               Xlll



play in piloting new ways o f working or focusing research on new topics. But they are most
likely to make a sound and lasting contribution when they complement a relatively strong
public-sector framework for research.

To be able to compete, research institutions must have a minimum budget and a critical
mass o staff. All institutions need a portion o f the budget that i s core funded to cover costs
       f
o f maintenance and upgrading o f physical and human resource infrastructure. CGS usually
only fund operating costs, and the subprojects they finance have only 2-3 years' duration.

The CGS model is more likely to strengthen the strongest agenciesproviding research and
extension services than it is to reduce the disparities between the strong and the weak. The
principle o f competition between alternative service providers breaks down where the range
o f providers i s limited (a problem at the municipal level and for small countries) and many o f
the potential providers lack the skills needed to prepare viable sub-project proposals.

The CGS model has not itself led to a large growth in the role o the private for profit)
                                                                    f
sector as a provider o agricultural research and extension; but it has contributed to the
                        f
broader process o private sector development. In these countries, to the extent that
                    f
commercial f i r m s have played a role, they have largely done so outside the framework o f
competitive grant schemes. O n the other hand, under the competitive schemes, through the
medium o f subproject co-payments, producers have provided private funds as a complement
to public sector grants. They have also received training in the preparation o f business plans,
and have become more market-oriented owing to partnerships with producer associations that
have been facilitated by competitive funding agreements.

 1. Introduction

Purpose of the Evaluation

 1.1    This evaluation provides background for IEG's FY 10 Agriculture Study, which
assesses the Bank Group's support to agricultural growth and productivity. IEG evaluated
a cluster o f agricultural research projects to assess the evidence that a particular, widely-
replicated model o f technology development and transfer (developed in Latin America in
the early 1990s) has been effective in spurring the development and dissemination o f
technologies conducive to agricultural productivity growth. The evaluation takes into
account the results o f earlier "self-assessments" o f the four projects conducted by Bank
operational staff.

Background

 1.2   As the Green Revolution demonstrated, the development and dissemination o f
high-yielding crap cultivars-and o f new agricultural technologies in general-has a
major role to play in boosting agricultural productivity and thereby helping to strengthen
long-run food security. The recent spike in food prices has drawn attention once again to
the importance o f technology development and dissemination.

1.3     The economic rate o f return to investments in agricultural research and extension
is high relative to other sector interventions. In Latin America, according to one study,
returns to applied research were 47 percent (compared to a worldwide average o f 49
percent) and 46 percent for extension (4 1 percent worldwide).2

1.4     Since 1990, agricultural productivity has grown rapidly in Latin America (LCR)
relative to other regions. One indicator o f this is the progress o f land-productivity in
cereals (Table 1). However, diversification into other crops and improved links to
markets for high-value products has been equally important. Rising incomes,

urbanization, greater female participation in the workforce, wider media penetration-
these trends are all strong in Latin America and they are driving the demand for higher-
value products, semi-processed and processed products, and convenience foods. There i s
a corresponding focus in the latest development thinking on the need to link farmers to
"value chains', integrating them more closely with wholesalers, processing f i r m s and
retailers (particularly supermarkets).

The Competitive G r a n t M o d e l

1.5     After several decades o f extensive use in industrialized countries (Alston, Pardey
and Smith 1999 review the experiences o f five such countries), in line with emerging
thinking about New Public Sector Management (e.g., World Bank 1997d), many
developing countries have also been introducing Competitive Grant Schemes (CGS) to
bring greater contestability and hopefully increased efficiency into their agricultural
knowledge-creation systems. The competitive research funds being introduced can, in
principle, better mobilize available research capacity, stimulate scientific creativity and
promote efficiencies in the national research system. High-quality review, administrative
efficiency, and transparent processes are obviously essential to program credibility and
performance.

1.6     In CGS research providers are selected on a competitive basis, using calls to elicit
proposals and scientific peer review to allocate funding. CGS complement traditional
"block" funding allocated annually to specified public research organizations for their
core research programs, infrastructure, and human resources. They can be used to
accomplish objectives that may be difficult to achieve through block funding, such as
funding to specific research topics perhaps through adaptive on-farm research projects
requiring collaboration between organizations and farmers, or research within a specific
target region. They can, if appropriately designed:

        Mobilize the best available scientists, including those in universities and the
        private sector, for work on specific high-priority projects.
        Develop a pluralistic research system by providing operating costs to better utilize
        available human and physical infrastructure from a wide range o f institutions.
        Make research more demand-driven by involving clients in setting priorities and
        financing, executing, and evaluating research.
        Increase total research funding by mobilizing funds from farmers, agribusiness,
        and other sources.
        Improve research quality and eventual innovation by selecting projects based on
        rigorous technical review o f scientific merit, sound work-plan, and expected results.

 1.7    Latin America has been a major site for CGS experimentation, an experience that
has been closely followed and strongly supported by the World Bank. In the Bank,
support for agricultural research competitive grant schemes in Latin America can be
traced back to the early 1990s. Analytic work examined the alternatives to the "national
institute model", drawing on the more pluralistic approach taken in countries such as

Spain and Chile.' Operational work began in 1993 with the preparation o f the Colombia
project that i s included in this assessment (PRONATTA), as well as a Venezuela
extension project.

1.8    By the end o f the decade a new, cross-agency consensus had emerged about
"good practice" o n agricultural research. In 1998, an agricultural research specialist at the
Inter-American Development Bank wrote:

         "After 40 years o f useful application o f a "one size f i t s all" model, the standard
         model for public agricultural research in the region-the INIA model-is
         becoming obsolete, due to changes in the process o f innovation, and changes in
         the macroeconomic environment. A s the agricultural sectors o f the region
         continue to grow and become more competitive, private sector funding (from
         farmers and input companies) will continue to increase; as well as the share o f
         public funds allocated to competitive funding mechanisms".2

1.9     The questions that this evaluation sets out to answer are keyed to the core
assumptions o f the competitive fund model for agricultural research as it developed in
Latin America in the 1990s. The model emerged in part as a response to new thinking
about public and private sector roles in agriculture. There was a growing sense among the
Bank's intellectual leaders that if agriculture was to flourish it needed free market~.~
Although few were rash enough to deny that government had a role to play in creating the
conditions for markets to operate, many were persuaded that government was too
intrusive and that markets were distorted as a consequence. The stage was set for an
attempt to circumscribe government intervention in agriculture (most radically in the
withdrawal from subsidized lines o f credit); and to contemplate privatizing certain
services where public sector provision had become d~minant.~

 1.10 Willingness to move in this direction was underpinned, in many countries, by the
urgency o f fiscal retrenchment. This was one o f the factors accounting for the dismantling
o f the federal extension system in Peru, Colombia and Brazil. (In Nicaragua, the coverage
o f the federal program had always been limited, leaving many regions without extension
services.) At the same time, in the World Bank there,was a growing suspicion that i t s
flagship model for agricultural extension (the "Training and Visit system) was too costly to
~ u s t a i nThis particular model was most widely used in Asia and Africa and the Bank had

never promoted it in Latin America; but rejection o f T&V echoed a wider skepticism about
the usefulness o f extension, a concern that national programs were inflexible and poorly
equipped to respond to dynamic supply and demand conditions.

 1.11 A hrther development, which flowed from the structural adjustment agenda, was
the rise in the conviction that Ministries o f Agriculture were not the prime movers in terms
o f sector growth prospects-the distortions constraining agricultural growth had more to do
with overvalued exchange rates, the greater protection applied to other sectors, and other
forms o f implicit taxation o f agriculture, rather than sector-specific policies controlled by
Ministries o f Agriculture.' Much more important than any dialogue with the line ministry
was the dialogue with the Finance Ministry. The staffs o f the Ministry o f Agriculture and
i t s satellite agencies had a vested interest in maintaining the apparatus o f state intervention
in the sector. Increasingly, they were not regarded as the best interlocutors for a Bank set
on redefining public and private sector roles. The idea o f setting up new institutions outside
the traditional public agencies came to seem attractive: the competitive fund model was one
instance o f this move to break free from the supposedly dead hand o f agricultural
bureaucracy. What happened in Peru is probably the purest expression o f this thinking.
After President Fujimori came to power in 1990, policy in Peru was marked by a skeptical
view o f state intervention in the economy, particularly so with respect to the agriculture
sector. There was a market-oriented shift in thinking on agricultural technology transfer,
characterized by what a Bank sector report described as "a strong push towards extensive
privatization o f agricultural research and extension".*

 1.12 But, as this report demonstrates, the technology transfer model that emerged in
the four assessed projects was not about privatization; while it focused on broadening the
range o f service suppliers, commercial f i r m s were not, in any sense the preferred
suppliers. Equally important were the universities (mainly public) and a variety o f
"private nonprofit" agencies, ranging from producer associations (e.g. the gremios in
Colombia) to NGOs. Only in Peru did the overall project development objective invoke
the creation o f a "private sector-led" technology innovation system, and even there this
did not amount to a specific focus on commercial (for profit) service providers. The
design o f the Brazil project (PRODETAB) explicitly acknowledged that the innovation
system would continue to be led by the strong public research agency, EMBRAPA.

1.13 The competitive model presupposed: establishment o f a fund for financing
subprojects; a set o f rules regulating the terms o f the competition, including co-financing;
a nationwide publicity campaign to alert potential service providers; and special grants to
help train would-be service providers to prepare subproject appraisals. To varying
degrees, the models in the four assessed projects also sought to:

         Set up an implementing agency with substantial independence in relation to the
         line ministry-a prerequisite for smooth disbursement;
        Oblige government suppliers o f agricultural research and extension services to
        compete with other potential suppliers, thereby boosting the quality o f the service
        provided and lowering i t s cost;
        A l l o w representatives o f the end-users o f research to participate with government
        in drawing up the research agenda;

       Encourage vertical integration o f small farmers with "value chains", entailing
       diversification out o f staples into high-value crops;
       Aim to raise small-farmer incomes to the point where these producers could
       "graduate" from extension services that were state-led and user-free to fee-for-
       service programs provided by private firms;
       Limit government research agencies to providing goods that the private sector, by
       virtue o f externalities and market failures, i s ill-placed to provide;
       Decentralize to the extent possible, giving regional and local governments and
       non-government agencies a role in planning, implementing and co-financing
       agricultural services.


2. Approach

Evaluation Questions

2.1    This evaluation asks: H o w effectively has the competitive grant model spurred the
development and adoption o f new agricultural technologies?

2.2    The following questions are addressed:

       To what extent has the competitive fundprocess met expectations in terms of: (a)
       responsiveness to the needs o f farmers and other stakeholders; (b) transparency
       and rigor in the selection between competing subprojects; and (c)
       decentralization, entailing greater involvement o f sub-national authorities in
       priority setting and implementation?
       Has introduction o f the competitive model led to a diversification o f service
       providers and a sharper differentiation between the roles o f public and private
       sectors?
       Have subprojects led to higher agricultural productivity and increased farm
       incomes?
       I s the competitive model sustainable-has the supporting institutional framework
       been strengthened and, in the absence o f continued donor support, i s there
       adequate provision for funding recurrent costs?

Project Selection

2.3     IEG purposively selected a group o f Bank-supported projects in Latin America
that are roughly contemporaneous (Table 2). Three o f the four projects have been
followed by other Bank researcWextension operations, which are currently under
implementation. To the extent that it i s relevant to lesson learning, the evaluation
examines the design features and achievements o f the follow-on operations; but the
emphasis i s placed on evaluating the closed projects.

Applied Research. Research whose findings have the potential for immediate application by farmers.
Adaptive Research. Applied research that has been adjusted and confirmed as appropriate for specific local
conditions based on on-farm trials.
Technologv Transfer. The sharing o f research findings and new technologies with extension agents (and,
possibly, farmers also), by means o f meetings, field days, radio, television and publications.

2.5     In varying degrees between the four countries, research and extension activities
extended beyond the competitive funds to cover strengthening o f the agriculture public
sector apparatus. (Only in Peru and Colombia did the competitive fund component
account for more than one-half o f total project costs.) The variation in the content o f the
four projects i s captured in Table 3.

3. Country Context
3.1       In agriculture, Brazil has a commanding lead with an annual growth rate o f total
factor productivity that averaged 1.9 percent between 1960 and 2000; Colombia and Peru
are level pegging at 1.4 percent; and Nicaragua trails at 0.8 percent (Table 4). This
ranking w i l l show up again and again in the course o f this report and i s mirrored in the
relative scale o f the four countries: one that i s vast, two that are o f medium size and one
that i s small. Scale-whether in terms o f land area or the economy-influences the
resources that each country can apply to the overall growth o f agriculture.

Source: /a World Bank, 2005e (Table 5.8); /b World Bank, 2009b.

3.2     Between 1994 and 2005, agricultural value added per worker grew in real terms in
all four countries (Figure 1). Growth was strongest in Brazil followed, in descending
order, by Nicaragua, Peru and Colombia. Over the same period, the farmed land area rose
in Nicaragua remained flat in Brazil and Peru and declined slightly in Colombia. This
suggests that most o f the agricultural growth in this period was at the intensive rather
than the extensive margin, although extensive growth was s t i l l a factor in Nicaragua.
(Between 1990 and 2005, agriculture's share o f all land grew from 34 percent to 44
percent in Nicaragua.) Whether or not intensification in these four countries was partly
driven by the projects assessed in this report (impossible to tell), the pattern o f growth
was at least in line with the overarching productivity goals o f these projects. The rise in
productivity i s confirmed by the data on yields for two major crops common to the four
countries-maize and coffee (Annex 2, Figures 1 and 2). A long-run series (1961-2007)
shows a trend break for maize yields in the early 1990s and for coffee around the turn o f
the millennium, after which points the rate o f land productivity growth accelerated. For
both crops, however, yield growth in Nicaragua lags relative to the other countries,
confirming that the expansion o f value added in this country has been based to a larger
extent on pushing back the frontier o f cultivation.

3.3      Each country faces a different set o f constraints on agricultural productivity growth.
Colombia and Peru are both located in the Andean range but the mountain challenges faced
by Peru are bigger. Much o f i t s land i s too steeply sloping or too high to favor crop
cultivation; agricultural land occupies only 17 percent o f the national territory, compared to
30-40 percent in the other countries. On the other hand, Peru has a higher share o f cropland
under irrigation (28 percent) compared to the other countries, adding to the strategic
significance o f the coastal strip where these works are concentrated (Annex 2).

3.4     Owing to the mountainous terrain, much o f Peru's rural population i s remote from
markets: 30 percent o f those living in the countryside have to journey over four hours to
reach a medium-sized town; in Brazil, Nicaragua and Colombia, the proportions are
respectively 18 percent, 17 percent and 11 percent. Road density i s also l o w in Peru, only
6 kilometers per 100 km2 o f territory; in the other three countries the density is 15 km per
100 km2 or above, with Brazil the best served.

3.5     Communication difficulties also manifest themselves in other ways. In Peru 45
percent o f the population is Amerindian with a mother tongue other than the national
language. By contrast in the other countries the indigenous population represents 5
percent or less o f the total. In Nicaragua the issue i s rural illiteracy: one-third o f persons
aged 15 and above living in the countryside i s unable to read or w r i t e (compared to one-
quarter in Brazil and Peru and 16 percent in Colombia).

3.6     A common theme applies to all four countries. Trade policy has tended toward
greater openness since about 1990 (Figure 2). By broadening the arena o f competition
and the size o f the market, the opening up o f agriculture may help spur productivity
growth (although, equally the line o f causality may f l o w in the opposite direction, more
productive countries finding i t easier to compete). The opening i s most marked for
Nicaragua and Brazil (the countries which, coincidentally or not, had the strongest
growth in per capita agricultural value added).

3.7      A stark indication o f Brazil's preeminence relative to the other countries is the
number o f citations o f agricultural research in international peer-reviewedjournals, using
a database filter that isolates work conducted by institutions native to that country (rather
than research conducted in the country by foreign institutions). This crude measure o f
`indigenous' research capacity also captures the substantial growth in research output that
has occurred between nine-year periods in the 1990s and the 2000s-which may have
facilitated agricultural intensification (Table 5). The same source also shows the high
output o f universities relative to the federal government research agency. The pecking
order i s the same for the federal agencies as it i s for the universities: Brazil (way ahead)

i s followed by Colombia, Peru and Nicaragua, echoing the ranking by agricultural total
factor productivity growth (Table 4 above).

4. Project Performance
4.1       Project performance was inevitably influenced by the country context-including
the size o f the economy, progress to date in raising agricultural productivity and, most
importantly, institutional capacity. Nicaragua i s a much smaller country than the other three
in the IEG cluster (Annex 2, Table 1); agricultural productivity growth has lagged (Figure
 1); the rate o f rural illiteracy i s high; and the capacity o f agricultural research institutions-
reflected, for example, in the level o f research output (Table 5-      s
                                                                       )i    limited. I t i s no surprise
that the Nicaragua project performed less well than those in the other countries, particularly
given the demanding nature o f the competitive fund model and i t s high startup costs.
Prospects in Nicaragua were hampered by the small volume o f funds committed to the
model and the uneven commitment by the Borrower and the Bank that was first manifest
during implementation; and remains in evidence today under the follow-on project.

4.2      At the other extreme, project performance in Brazil was much stronger-because
the implementing agency, EMBRAPA, was much stronger than the corresponding
agencies in the other three countries. Peru and Colombia occupy a middle ground,
performing above Nicaragua but, owing to concerns about the sustainability o f project
results, doing less well than Brazil. The public apparatus for agricultural research i s
stronger in Colombia than Peru-CORPOICA has more staff with better training, and
superior infrastructure compared to INIA, i t s Peruvian equivalent. On the other hand,
Peru arguably faced bigger challenges than Colombia and has made greater progress in
terms o f catching up. Apart from the relative weakness o f INIA, Peru had considerable
ground to make up in pushing toward decentralization (Colombia has, historically, had a
                                               12


weak center while the government in Peru has always been highly centralized, partly
because o f the Inca legacy and because, unlike Colombia, it had the mineral wealth to
support a central bureaucracy.) Also, in terms o f the difficulty o f the terrain in the sierra
and the size o f i t s (poorly integrated) indigenous population, Peru was in a more difficult
position than Colombia.

4.3      In each o f the four projects that are the focus o f this assessment spending on the
competitively-funded subprojects was less than forecast at appraisal. The actual cost o f
this component was 52 percent o f the planned amount in Nicaragua, 72 percent in Peru,
75 percent in Brazil, and 86 percent in Colombia. This was partly the result o f difficulties
in mobilizing government counterpart funding; but also had much to do with the sheer
complexity o f organizing the various bidding rounds, evaluating proposals and providing
technical assistance. The extent o f this complexity-and the time needed to consolidate
the new model-was underestimated when these projects were designed. The countries
that already had ample experience with competitive funds (Colombia, Brazil) were better
placed to make progress with the project. In terms o f the decentralization challenge
facing Peru-the need to build and staff a network o f regional offices and panels-the
Peru project was under dimensioned (actual total costs were a mere US$13.6 million-
for 153 subprojects-compared to US$85.9 million in Colombia-for 636 subprojects).

4.4      The Nicaragua and Peru projects faced an additional hurdle. Both were envisaged
as the first-phase in a sequence o f operations, supported by one o f the Bank's Adaptable
Program Loans. Adopting a twelve to sixteen year horizon made sense in terms o f the time
it would likely take to embed the new model. But the transition from the first to the second
                                                                                l
phase was problematic in both countries. The implementing agencies were ilprepared for
the amount o f preparatory work needed to make the transition (the trigger conditions were
more onerous than they had expected); and in the fluny to prepare for the next phase, the
evaluation and supervision o f subprojects approved toward the end o f the first project
tended to be neglected. Also, in both countries there was a rearguard action against the
competitive model by the more established public research and extension agencies, which
helped to undermine government commitment to a lengthy program. In Nicaragua (but not
Peru), there was also a substantial loss o f Bank commitment to the competitive fund model,
based on a more realistic appreciation o f the country's institutional capacity constraints-
and the government's limited support for the model.

4.5     The performance o f all four projects was potentially constrained by the absence o f
a sound, nationwide network o f institutions capable o f transferring technologies and
providing technical assistance to producers. In Nicaragua and Peru, the government
research agencies (respectively, INTA and INIA) had an extension arm-but INTA's
coverage was geographically limited and INIA was a shadow o f i t s former self, having
been substantially cut back compared to i t s 1970s heyday. In Colombia and Brazil there
was no national public extension service when the projects were launched and the quality
o f technical assistance (provided by state or local governments, NGOs, etc.) varied
greatly from one region to the next. But in Colombia and in southern Brazil the
population was relatively well educated and well connected to markets so that the scope
for picking up technologies by means other than through extension was more developed.
4.6      Nevertheless, it is a concern that in all four countries the evidence concerning
rates o f technology adoption-attributable to the projects assessed here-is very patchy.
This reflects an under investment in monitoring and evaluation. The best evidence comes
from Peru. The independent impact evaluation, reported on below, was led by a Brazilian
team (including EMBRAPA). Ironically, EMBRAPA'Smonitoring o f the impact o f the
Brazil project was substantially weaker, for reasons that will be discussed.

 Box 2. How Positively do Informed Participants Rate the Competitive Fund
 Model?An IEG Poll
 T o help assess the value added by the competitive find model IEG polled a total o f 139 persons across the
 four countries (Annex 1). The p o l l was applied t o persons working on, or familiar with, issues o f
 agricultural technology development and transfer-agricultural researchers in public agencies (federal and
 state entities), plus representatives from the donor community, universities and NGOs and persons
 directly connected with the project that IEG was evaluating.
 The aspects o f the model which received the highest rating center o n (a) the technical rigor and (b)
 transparency o f the process for selecting research and extension subprojects. N e x t come (c) the adequacy
 o f technical assistance for proposal preparation and (d) the technical quality o f competitively-financed
 research-although the standard deviation for these items was somewhat larger, reflecting lower
 consensus. Aspects eliciting a less positive response with relatively high agreement among respondents
 concern (e) responsiveness t o the needs o f small and medium producers and (0 the extent t o which
 farmers are integrated with value chains. The other items-including (g) outreach t o the poorest, (h)
 contribution t o natural resource management and (i)   impact o n yields-are characterized by l o w ratings
 and relatively l o w agreement. The question prompting the largest proportion o f "don't know" responses
 (3 1 percent) concerned the project's impact o n yields o f basic grains. This may reflect a wider lack o f
 hard data o n the difference these projects made at the farm level; which in turn derives from the neglect o f
 monitoring and evaluation.

4.7     There i s a marked difference between the four countries in how positively persons
associated with the competitive fund approach viewed it. IEG polled participants at
meetings convened for the mission (Box 2). The poll was applied to a subset o f persons
knowledgeable about the project and it i s not clear h o w representative their views are o f
the groups to which they belong. The poll was not intended to measure objective
differences in performance between the four countries; but rather to capture the aura
attaching to the project-the perception o f informed participants about how satisfactory
the approach was. The p o l l results suggest a gradient between the countries with
respondents in Brazil the most positive about competitive fund aspects o f the project,
followed in descending order by Colombia, Peru and Nicaragua.

4.8     In Nicaragua and Peru, the staffs o f the national agricultural research institutes
(INIs) have a less positive perception o f the competitive fund aspects o f the project than
other people, whereas in Colombia and Brazil these staffs are relatively more positive
(Figure 3). This bears out the impression received from interviews in the various
countries: in Colombia and Brazil, CORPOICA and EMBRAPA staffs tend to emphasize
how their research work has been enhanced by their capacity to draw on the competitive
funds whereas the staffs o f INTA in Nicaragua and INIA in Peru are more skeptical (and
in some cases hostile toward the competitive approach).

4.9     Perhaps it i s not surprising that IN1staffs in Nicaragua and Peru are lukewarm in
their support for the competitive model: they have derived very little funding from it-
absorbing 5 percent or less o f the subproject funding made available through the respective
projects (Table 6). In Colombia and Brazil, the I N I s (CORPOICA and EMBRAPA)
snapped up, respectively, one-third and one-half o f the project fiinds on offer.

5. Evaluation Findings
5.1    This section assesses the evidence from the four countries and seeks to answer the
evaluation questions posed at the outset (paragraph 2.2 above).

Adequacy of the Competitive Fund Process
5.2     The design o f the assessed projects shared, in varying degrees, the following
process elements o f the competitive fund model: (a) an attempt to be inclusive, demand-
driven, and participatory; (b) a focus o n promoting technical rigor and transparency in the
selection o f research and extension subprojects; and (c) a push to decentralize, involving
sub-national authorities in priority setting and implementation.

5.3      Inclusiveness. For each project one o f the challenges was to include groups-small
farmers, women, indigenous communities-that might, in the absence o f special initiatives,
remain marginalized from the process o f selecting and implementing research and
extension subprojects. In general, projects o f this nature do not lend themselves to targeting
to the poorest-because this group often has no land or other assets to which they may
apply new technology. Impact on the poorest i s mainly indirect, through increased
opportunities for wage employment and lower food prices. Therefore, it i s not clear why
the Bank listed the Colombia and Brazil projects as "targeted interventions" (Table 7).

5.4     However, all four projects did reach out to small farmers and these were the prime
beneficiaries. Targets for covering this group were met or exceeded in Nicaragua,
Colombia and Brazil, but there was a shortfall in Peru. In the Brazil project, the only
performance benchmark pertaining to small farmers was an input not an outcome
indicator-the level o f spending on a small-farmer development program (the target was
exceeded). E x post, the funding o f "family agriculture" research (a non-specific indicator,
not exclusive to small, poor clients) was smaller than the other categories: it accounted for
the largest share o f proposals submitted (33 percent), but only 30 percent o f proposals
approved and 22 percent o f funds committed to subprojects.' For all the projects, attempts
to measure the coverage o f women and indigenous groups were patchy (Table 7).

5.5     In the case o f extension, there are straightforward ways attempts to measure client
responsiveness: visits to farmers can be counted, as can the level o f satisfaction that
farmers report when asked about extension services. The Nicaragua and Peru projects
made explicit provision for extension, each devoting a specific competitive fund to it. In
Nicaragua, the level o f satisfaction expressed exceeded appraisal expectations. The target
was 60 percent o f clients describing themselves as satisfied customers. But clients were
even more satisfied with the service provided by the state (90 percent satisfied) than with
service provided through the competitively-funded subprojects (69 percent). To put this
in perspective, only 33 percent o f the producers surveyed actually had contact with an
extension worker-and other data show that, nationwide, the level o f extension coverage

i s around 15-20 percent.' Clients may be satisfied with the service if they receive it; but
most o f them do not. In Peru also, there was a shortfall in the delivery o f extension
subprojects and lower than expected coverage o f the indigenous population, despite a
special initiative to reach out to these communities (Table 7).

5.6     Responses to the IEG poll show that most o f those interviewed were relatively
lukewarm in rating the projects' responsiveness to small and medium farmers' needs; and to
those o f the poor. In Brazil, responsiveness to small and medium farmers received a more
positive rating than in the other countries (Box 2 above; Annex 1).

5.7     Another measure o f inclusiveness concerns outreach to poorer regions. The projects
in Peru, Colombia and Brazil made explicit attempts to secure participation o f poorer
regions in the various subproject funding rounds. There was a tension between this
objective and the commitment to ensuring that only the most rigorous proposals were
financed-the poorer regions had less capacity for developing proposals and needed special
assistance. (In Peru, for example, the project included a special initiative to help indigenous


1. Annex 4, paragraph 20 (Nicaragua report).
                                             17


communities in the Sierra-the poorest region-to prepare projects.) In general, project
design made adequate provision for ensuring inclusion o f the poorer regions.

5.8    I n conclusion, while the design o the projects was explicitly client responsive,
                                         f
outreach to the poorest groups and regions calls for special measures; and there was a
limited extent to which these could be regarded as targeted interventions.

5.9     Technical rigor and transparency. All four projects placed a high premium on
rigor and transparency. Poll results (Annex 1) show that, o f the twelve items assessed,
informants rated rigor and transparency most highly. The poll also found that the
technical assistance provided for preparing subproject proposals was highly rated.

5.10 The provision o f technical assistance grants to facilitate preparation o f subproject
proposals was critical for enabling less educated people and weaker institutions to take
part in the competitive process. In Brazil, "pre-proposal grants" o f up to US$lO,OOO were
available for those who needed help in designing subprojects. There was no equivalent
facility in the other three countries; although special arrangements were made in Peru to
assist indigenous communities. It i s all the more striking therefore that respondents to the
IEG poll rated the technical assistance for subproject preparation relatively highly
(Annex 1). This suggests that, even in the absence o f explicit grants for subproject
design, the project staff were able to provide adequate orientation to those entering the
subproject bidding rounds.

5.1 1 The various interviews that IEG conducted in each o f the countries convey a
strong impression that, in the view o f the informants, the process o f priority setting was
more transparent than under the previous system o f direct assignment o f funds for
research and extension. The apparatus o f regional and national panels and the process for
reviewing subprojects appears to have favored openness. But in none o f the countries had
an explicit attempt been made to assess the quality o f research under the competitive and
"pre-competitive" models, either in terms o f outputs (for example, number o f
publications in peer-reviewed journals) or field-level outcomes (for example, evidence
that research boosted incomes and productivity. Any such comparison o f the competitive
and pre-competitive models would need to consider their relative cost effectiveness. Even
if the competitive model produces better research it probably comes at a higher cost given
the expense involved in organizing bidding rounds and panel review. In Nicaragua, for
example, economic rates o f return to competitively-funded research and extension
subprojects was 16 percent, compared to 32 percent for investments directly assigned by
the government research and extension agency, reflecting differences in transaction costs.

5.12 To sum up, while informedparticipants are convinced that both rigor and
transparency were enhanced by the competitive model, the impact on research quality
(allowing for cost effectiveness) needs closer investigation.

5.13 Decentralization. The push was decentralize was reflected both in the
administrative apparatus o f the projects and in the attempts to promote linkage to regional
and local government.

5.14 Regional project offices were set up to help extend outreach, with officers trained
to help target groups prepare subproject proposals; and regional panels were created to
assess the proposals. (This was more the case for extension subprojects; research
subprojects tended to rely on national panels and peer review processes.) Thus, in the
case o f Peru, extension subprojects were coordinated initially by offices in each o f three
macro-regions, with offices added in three more departments o f the country in 2003. The
offices were supported by regional agricultural technology fora, which included
participants from farmer organizations and indigenous groups. The fora discussed
regionally-specific technology issues, set priorities and provided guidance for the review
and approval o f locally-generated subproject proposals.

5.15 There i s clearly an issue about the legacy o f any decentralized administrative
apparatus set up by a project. Once project funds are used up, the apparatus may be shut
down and may well leave little mark on local institutional capacity. However, the project
staff in regional offices are often locally recruited and may remain in the neighborhood
after the project has shut down. In such cases, there may s t i l l be a long-term, local impact,
as skills acquired under the project are applied to other initiatives. But the actual extent o f
this skill transfer has not yet been documented. Involving local authorities in the research
and extension initiatives sponsored by the assessed projects was typically problematic. In
Peru, IEG found that despite some attempts to second local government officials to the
regional project offices (e.g. in Tarapoto), local government was not involved in priority
setting for extension and research and had little awareness o f the subprojects that were
financed. In Colombia, the project involved training o f the staff in extension offices
(UMATAs) operated by local municipal government. But owing partly to the absence o f
earmarked transfers for extension from central to municipal government, the decentralized
network o f extension was unevenly funded and often o f poor quality. This reduced the
scope for transferring technologies generated through the project.

5.16 O n the other hand, in Brazil, the project helped to build up the decentralized units
o f EMBRAPA (which will outlive the project) and to boost the capacity o f public research
agencies in some o f the states: o f the four projects assessed, this was the strongest instance
o f decentralization and i s likely to continue to bear h i t . Also, in Colombia and Peru
decentralization has been strengthenedin the follow-on projects. For example, in Peru, the
network o f regional offices for INCAGRO has been consolidated and more tightly
integrated with local public research facilities, helping to strengthen sustainability.

5.17 I n conclusion, the assessedprojects sought, in varying degrees to promote
                                                                      f
decentralization but progress was uneven with the strongest evidence o strengthening
comingfrom Brazil.

Diversification o f Service Providers; Differentiation o f Roles

5.18 Each o f the four projects included diversification o f service providers among its
objectives. An implicit assumption was that government agencies would become more
efficient if they were obliged to compete with other agencies. Alternative service
providers included universities, producer associations and NGOs; but there was a
particular interest in encouraging wider participation by private firms. This went hand in
hand with an attempt to encourage the public sector to limit i t s intervention to public
goods provision-4early differentiating i t s role from that o f the private sector.

5.19 A caveat i s in order-the provision o f agricultural research and extension services
was already diversified before the projects that are the subject o f this evaluation got
underway. In Nicaragua, around project start up, NGOs accounted for one-third o f the
extension service contacts reported by farmers.' The proportional share o f each class o f
service provider varied substantially among the four countries during implementation
(Table 8). NGOs dominate in Nicaragua, producer associations in Peru, and the federal
research agencies in Colombia and Brazil. The universities seem under-represented by
comparison with their contribution to published research (the citation evidence presented
in Table 5 above). It i s also noticeable that, in Colombia, despite their independent
research capacity, the commodity-based producer associations had next to no
participation in the bidding process for competitive funds. Given that their research
funding i s secured through a government-mandated l e v y on crop revenues, possibly they
felt no need to participate. Overall, in Colombia, the extent o f diversification realized
through the competitive funds was lower than that in the research system as a whole.2

5.20 I t i s also striking that, according to Table 8, other than for farmers through
producer associations, private (for profit) f i r m s played no role as providers in Colombia
and Brazil; and only a small role in Nicaragua and Peru. In the case o f Brazil, the private
sector role calls for careful explication: private f i r m s did have a role as subcontractors but

in no cases were they the prime movers in the design and implementation process.'
Partnership did not necessarily entail active private sector participation. In the view o f
some researchers, partnerships were formed to meet a bureaucratic requirement rather
than to enhance the technical soundness o f a research project.2

5.21 Diversification refers not only to the share o f subprojects implemented by each
type o f service provider; it also covers the contribution to the total subproject investment
from sources outside the project (that is, in addition to the funds committed by donors
and the government). By encouraging participant co-payment o f this kind, the project
implementing agencies sought to make their funds go farther, as well as to increase
participants' stake in the success o f the subproject. At first blush, impressive levels o f co-
payment were secured; often in excess o f what was expected at appraisal. In Peru, at
appraisal, the co-payment fraction was set at between 5 percent and 35 percent depending
on the type o f subproject; but, according to the INCAGRO database, the level actually
achieved varied from 48 percent to 56 percent. In Nicaragua, producers contributed 21
percent to subproject investments in extension. In Colombia, contributions by the
agencies implementing subprojects somewhat exceeded the 50 percent share specified at
appraisal. In Brazil, the co-payment share subscribed by implementing partners and
beneficiaries amounted to 42 p e r ~ e n t . ~

5.22 In each o f these cases a note o f caution i s in order. IEG's review o f project
documentation suggests that accounting o f co-payments by the implementing agencies
was very approximate, mainly because little o f it came in the form o f cash. Typically,
contributions were in kind, often involving a commitment o f time by staff salaried
outside the project; or the use o f preexisting laboratory capacity. In Colombia, the cash
proportion o f co-payment from implementing agencies averaged 11 percent, falling to 3
percent in 2008.4 Contrary to expectations at the design phase, these projects have not
sharpened the articulation o f private and public roles in this sub-sector. This i s not
altogether surprising. The distinction between private and public goods is not as clear-cut
in reality as it i s in the textbooks. Strategic research comes closest to fitting the bill as a
public good-because outcomes are uncertain, payoff i s slow to materialize and the
products are mostly non-excludable and non-rival in use (in Peru, the development o f
Sacha Inchi as a plant source o f Omega 3 source i s an example). There are also public
good elements to developing new varieties o f established crops: there will be little
incentive for the private sector to engage if the returns are non-excludable and there i s
scope for free-riding.

5.23 Farmer capacity to pay for research and extension services i s also a consideration.
All the assessed projects included small-scale farmers as a priority client. There i s a
public good case for providing a subsidized service for those too poor to pay; but less o f a
case for subsidizing better-off small-scale farmers. Drawing the line between these two

groups i s problematic and the fiscal payoff to preventing subsidy leakage may not be
large enough to justify the cost o f tighter targeting. Nicaragua i s a case in point. O n a
visit to the primary coffee-producing zone, IEG found that the government agency,
INTA, was providing extension free o f charge to farmers who were relatively able t`o pay
and already had access to a coffee marketing firm that provided a similar type o f service.'
Although the design o f the Bank-supportedproject entails a mixed role for INTA-
charging certain farmers for services but not others-deciding who gets the subsidy i s
tricky; and, in Nicaragua, the Bank was probably too optimistic about the prospects for
"graduating" poor, small-scale farmers into fee-paying clients.

5.24 The assessment confirmed the previous finding (Echeverria, 1998b) that the
competitive fund model tends not to generate much research o f a strategic nature. As long
as there i s a well-funded and well-established public research system capable o f tackling
strategic research it i s o f no great consequence if competitively-funded subprojects
privilege applied and adaptive research. Given the sophistication o f Brazilian research
capacity compared to the other countries, and i t s evident strength in undertaking a broad
program o f strategic research across a wide range o f commodities and themes, it i s not
surprising that only 6 percent o f the competitively-funded subprojects research proposals
                                One
were for strategic studiesS2 o f the project objectives was to focus public sector
research on "quintessential public good^".^ This project achieved that objective through
the support given to the institutional strengthening o f EMBRAPA, rather than through the
competitive fund component. In Nicaragua, where the public sector capacity for strategic
research i s weak, it was perhaps o f more consequence that o f the five competitively-
funded subprojects implemented by the federal research agency, INTA, none was
strategic in nature.4 Here, unlike in Brazil, there was weak capacity for tackling strategic
research outside the terms o f the competitive model.

5.25    I n conclusion, although the projects were generally conducive to the
                 f
diversification o service providers they did not lead to a significant increase in
participation by the commercial private sector. On the other hand, to the extent that the
projects helped to improve skills, increase capacity and elicit eo-payment financing
involving farmers and their organizations, as well as other private nonprofit
organizations, they contributed to a broader process o private sector development.

Impact on Incomes and Productivity Growth

5.26 There i s worldwide evidence to show that agricultural research generates high

                      .~

hand it can be argued that the 2-3 year span o f the subprojects financed i s too limited for

capturing impact (allowing for potential spillovers). But, o n the other hand, the projects
generally made inadequate provision for following up the results o f the subprojects (or, at
least, a representative sample thereof). This i s an intrinsic problem o f the project cycle:
the absence o f funding provision for assessing impact once the loan i s closed.

5.27 There i s a broad spectrum o f concerns about the likely impact o f these projects.
First, it i s striking that none o f the statements o f project development objectives declared
increased agricultural productivity or higher farm incomes as an expected outcome. This
was perhaps a shrewd move given that gestation o f such favorable outcomes might well
take longer than the implementation period o f the project. (The Nicaragua project was
bold enough, however, to forecast a 25 percent increase in yields and 15 percent increase
in real incomes by closing-neither o f which appear to have been achieved.)

5.28 Second, the logical fiamework o f the individual subprojects was generally
characterized by the absence o f any systematic attempt to establish baselines and set
targets. Although the Peru and Colombia projects made explicit attempts to rate
subproject performance the credibility o f the ratings was hampered by weaknesses in the
logical framework.

5.29 Third, the subprojects were short enough in duration (2-3 years) and modest
enough in size (Table 9 ) to beg questions about whether they could make much of an
impact. This issue was raised early on in the competitive fund literature: the concern that,
in aggregate, the multiple subprojects would be too small, too dispersed, too diffuse and
too short-lived to achieve critical mass.'

5.30 Fourth, a bigger concern i s what the subprojects add up to in terms o f long-term
income and productivity effects. With the exception o f the Peru project, the `impact
evaluations' that have been commissioned have been carried out too soon after the
completion o f the research and extension subprojects for their full effect to be assessed.

5.3 1 Fifth, the studies that have been conducted around these four projects have fewer
operational implications than might be expected. The most complete study-the one
recently conducted in Peru-was something o f a "black box" assessment o f impact. The
rate o f return and the income effects were estimated, but it was not clear which o f the
preceding steps in the results chain were critical for attainment o f this outcome. It was not
clear which elements in the process o f designing and implementingthe subprojects would
need to be altered for net benefits to be raised.

5.32 This reference to the results chain presages a sixth objection, one that i s perhaps
the most worrisome o f all. Technology transfer has chain-like elements. Research is
conducted; results are disseminated in various ways (ranging from research station open
days to which farmers are invited to extension agent visits to farms); new technologies
are adopted by an initial group o f farmers; and then there i s spillover to other farmers.
One unresolved question i s the extent to which technology transfer i s contingent upon the
existence o f sound agricultural extension. Two o f the projects-in Nicaragua and Peru-

1. Echeverria (1998b), p. 11.
                                               23


had separate competitive finds for extension. In Colombia, there was no separate
provision for extension; and, in Brazil, extension was entirely overlooked-technology
transfer being limited to off-farm dissemination events. None o f the countries has a
national extension network-in Peru, Colombia and Brazil the former federal systems
have either been wound down or dismantled; and in Nicaragua the federal system
covered only part o f the country. N o r do they have a decentralized network offering an
acceptable level o f service to all part o f the country.

5.33 To what extent has this missing link in the technology transfer chain blunted the
impact o f agricultural research developed through the competitive funds? The available
studies shed no light on this question. In regions such as southern Brazil where farmers
have the education and the means to hunt for technologies on the Internet the absence o f
extension may not be critical; in a country such as Nicaragua where one-third o f the rural
population i s illiterate i t s absence is likely to be more constraining.

5.34 The strongest evidence o f impact comes from the Peru project. A recently
completed independent evaluation (led by a Brazilian team that included E M B R A P A
researchers) found that the economic rate o f return from INCAGRO (200 1-2006) varied
between 25 percent and 37 percent.' This positive return stood up to sensitivity analysis:
it would take a 25 percent increase in costs and a 25 percent drop in benefits to drive the
rate o f return down to the threshold o f unacceptability (12 percent). The study was based
on a random sample o f 49 subprojects (almost one-quarter o f the universe), stratified by
region, by subproject type (research, extension or training), by period, and by the
performance rating applied to subprojects by the INCAGRO team. The evaluation found
that 53 percent o f aggregate net benefits were captured by the Selva region, 27 percent by
the Costa and 20 percent by the Sierra (the poorest region). O f the 739 farmers
interviewed, 59 percent reported that they adopted new technologies during the period
that INCAGRO was implemented; by the producers' own reckoning, adoption was one-
quarter attributable to the project, three-quarters attributable to other factors.

5.35 The Peru study had two flaws. First, there was no control group, comprising
farmers not exposed to INCAGRO. Second, the pre-project baseline was constructed
using farmer recall. Both o f these shortfalls raise the possibility that the impact o f
INCAGRO was overestimated. Relying on farmers to estimate to what extent INCAGRO
was responsible for their adoption o f new technologies was a poor substitute for a
comparison between treatment and control groups.

5.36 The same two flaws applied to the rate o f return evidence for the other three
countries; but they were compounded by other drawbacks. In the case o f Brazil, the
available evidence was not specific to the Bank-financed project (PRODETAB): the
completion report presented data on non-randomly selected E M B R A P A subprojects that
were not PRODETAB financed; and, also, none o f the subprojects featuring in the annual
impact reports prepared by E M B R A P A was supported by PRODETAB. While it i s
perfectly plausible that the PRODETAB subprojects had similarly high rates o f return,
the evidence i s not conclusive. Moreover, the available studies on rates o f return have

                                                 24


nothing to say about subprojects financed by entities other than EMBRAPA. (It would be
interesting, for example, to compare the returns to E M B R A P A research with that
sponsored by i t s strongest competitors-the universities at Campinas and Vicosa.)

5.37 For Nicaragua, the evidence for sound rates o f return to subproject investments was
not compelling.' The Bank's completion report estimated the ex-post rate o f return at 25
percent but this was based on extrapolating from a series o f farm models prepared at
appraisal, rather than on survey data. The evidence failed to square with the information
contained in a 2005 "interim impact evaluation", involving interviews with 1,162
producers, which found that neither yields nor incomes grew significantly between the
1997-2000 baseline (constructed from farmer recall) and the project implementation period.

5.38 In the case o f Colombia, a 2004 "impact evaluation" estimated the average rate o f
return at 88 percent, based on a random sample o f subprojects that covered 17 percent o f
the universe.2But the information on the subprojects was obtained'not from farm-level
surveys but from `expert estimates', based on the parameters o f `typical' subprojects.
This was not an independent assessment: the experts comprised persons with "direct
experience o f PRONATTA, including subproject implementing agencies, beneficiaries,
and selection panel member^".^

5.39 Summing up, these projects made insufficient provision for assessing the short-
                   f
term performance o individual subprojects (there was no systematic specification of
baselines and targets); and insufficient consideration has been given to a robust
assessment o the aggregate income and productivity impact o the various subprojects.

Sustainability o f the Institutional Framework

5.40 The four assessed projects combine, in varying degrees, support for competitive
funds with support for the broader institutional apparatus o f public research and, in some
cases, extension. The sustainability o f these two elements-the fund model versus the
broader apparatus-needs to be separately addressed. Sustainability o f the fund model i s
intrinsically less certain than that o f the apparatus because it i s more susceptible to the
changing whims o f government and donors. The public sector apparatus i s more stable-
many staff members have tenure and there i s a substantial sunk investment in
infrastructure which it may not be easy for governments to sell or write off.

5.41 The four projects fall neatly into two pairs. In the Brazil and Nicaragua projects
more than half o f total costs were devoted to strengthening the public sector agencies o f
research (plus, in Nicaragua, extension). In Peru and Colombia, by contrast, the bulk o f
project resources were absorbed by the competitive fund component.

5.42 Brazil and Nicaragua are polar opposites in terms o f domestic funding capacity
and the strength o f public sector research institutions. In Brazil, the project had a strong
foundation to build on-the federal research agency, EMBRAPA-and it filled a
temporary funding gap in a period o f government-wide fiscal restraint. The strengthening
of EMBRAPA, both headquarters and decentralized units, plus the state research
agencies and the building o f stronger ties with research facilities in the U S A and
European Union-these were major project achievements the results o f which are likely
to endure. O n the other hand, while the competitive fund component performed well, in
the longer term, it may not leave a substantial mark on the research framework. In the
follow-on project supported by the Inter-American Development Bank (not the World
Bank) there was originally a competitive fund component but it was dropped. The project
focuses on further strengthening o f EMBRAPA. This may suggest that the government
and E M B R A P A are not strongly committed to continuing the competitive fund model.
But, on balance, IEG considered that sustainability prospects for project achievements
were good, reflecting the relative weight o f the institutional strengthening component.

5.43 In the case o f Nicaragua, although strengthening o f the federal agency INTA was,
as in Brazil, a major component, project achievements were less significant: INTA's
research capacity does not appear to have been substantially strengthened by the project,
although there was significant training o f extension agents. Also, there are doubts about
the sustainability o f the competitive fund component (which, anyway, received only 10
percent o f project funds), mainly based on lack o f guaranteed continuity in government
and donor support. Specifically, the research arm o f the competitive fund initiative was
not directly supported in the follow on project. O n balance, therefore, the sustainability o f
the project's development achievements seems doubtful.

5.44 In Nicaragua, for reasons that have not been well articulated, it was decided
before the second project was launched to commit no fresh money to the two competitive
funds (FAT for extension, FAITAN for research) that it had championed during the first
project. (The Bank's withdrawal from FAT is less critical-IFAD has made a
commitment to fund it through 20 12-but the abandonment o f FAITAN-whose
subprojects now receive no direct donor support--calls into question the long-term
viability o f the competitive model in Nicaragua.)

5.45 In Brazil, the competitive fund was run by EMBRAPA and, in terms o f funds
absorbed, E M B R A P A was the prime beneficiary o f PRODETAB. Although elements o f
the competitive model were incorporated in the programs o f government research
agencies in the states o f Sao Paulo, Parana and Pernambuco, and although the
competitive fund principle has an existence and a vitality independent o f EMBRAPA, the
effect o f PRODETAB and the follow-on (Inter-American Development Bank-supported)
Agrofututro project has been more to consolidate E M B R A P A than to expose i t to greater
competition from other agencies. PRODETAB helped E M B R A P A to weather the
downturn in federal spending o f 1998-2003, allowing for upgraded staff training and
closer collaboration with research institutions in Europe and the United States. Federal
funding o f E M B R A P A has risen sharply since 2006,' making the agency's competitive

                                             26


position more or less unassailable. Agrofuturo funding i s exclusively for E M B R A P A and
IADB staff told IEG that there was no compelling reason for them to promote
competition by other agencies. Commitment to diversifying research providers-a
primary objective o f PRODETAB-has been sidelined, for the moment at least. In Peru
and Colombia, any judgment about sustainability hinges on prospects for the competitive
funds which absorbed respectively 53 percent and 70 percent o f project resources.
Prospects for sustainability would seem to be higher in Colombia because the
government has made a major funding commitment under the follow-on project, there i s
a closer relationship between the competitive fund unit and the national research agency
and there i s a stronger tradition o f decentralization, creating a more supportive
environment for the competitive funds model. The public apparatus o f research i s
stronger in Colombia than Peru ( C O W O I C A i s better staffed and better equipped than
INIA) and this probably helps to make the competitive model more fruitful by pulling up
the average quality o f the research proposed.

5.46 Based on IEG's assessments in the four countries, it seems that the competitive
fund model i s more likely to survive where it i s "owned" by the Ministry o f Agriculture,
where government commitment to this approach i s not held hostage to renewed pledges
o f donor financing, and where overhead costs compare favorably with those incurred
through the alternative model o f directly assigning public agricultural research and
extension funds.

5.47 In Nicaragua and Peru, the projects deliberately aimed to set up the competitive
finds outside the orbit o f the Ministry o f Agriculture, partly because the Ministry was
perceived by the Bank to be inefficient and weak; and also because this was perceived as a
"cleaner" approach that would both facilitate disbursement o f project funds and signal a
radical departure from the state-led model o f development. (The approach taken by the
Bank in Nicaragua was directly modeled on the project design used in Peru.) The net result
was to alienate staff in the Ministry o f Agriculture and to trigger a rearguard action that
threatened to destroy the competitive find institutions that were created. As one insider in
Peru told IEG, there will always be a Ministry o f Agriculture-however underfunded and
demoralized it may be; survival o f the project-driven entity that i s INCAGRO carries no
such guarantee. The government has recently bid to end the isolation o f the competitive
find management unit, integrating INCAGRO with the federal research agency, INIA.

5.48     In Colombia and Brazil, the competitive funds established respectively by
PRONATTA and PRODETAB were more integrated to begin with. In Colombia, the
project coordination unit was set up within the Ministry o f Agriculture, although all o f
the unit staff were brought in from the outside and hired on short contracts. During
PRONATTA, the unit was perceived by outsiders to have little interaction with the
Ministry-a situation possibly aggravated by the rapid turnover in project managers; but
under the follow-on project there i s closer liaison, although for reasons more related to
personalities than to any change in structure or procedures.

5.49 The competitive model has high start up costs. When project funds for this
component are small (the case for Nicaragua and Peru) the administrative overhead per
subproject becomes very high (Table 9), which may undermine commitment to sustaining
the model. In Nicaragua, extension services provided by the state outside the competitive
model (at no charge to the farmer) cost US$87 per producer per year; a similar service
provided under the auspices o f the model cost US$126 per producer per year, reflecting the
extra expense involved in organizing the competitive bidding process and supplying
technical assistance to weaker would-be service providers. Respondents to IEG's poll
reported that the extra cost o f research and extension services provided through the
competitive model did not result in better service compared to the alternative system o f
direct government provision (Annex 1).

5.50 The IEG poll results (Figure 3 above) picked up the differences between countries
in the level o f satisfaction with the project approach; which may have some bearing on the
survival prospects o f the competitive model. But it i s impossible to determine whether the
higher level o f satisfaction expressed by meeting participants in Brazil and Colombia
reflects enthusiasm for the competitive model principle in itself-rather, it may reflect
gratitude that the project actually delivered substantial resources to the institutions that
these people worked for.

5.5 1 There i s an important final consideration. Because the competitively funded
subprojects were only supported for 2-3 years it i s possible that the various alliances
between producers and providers that were generated under the subproject will not survive
once external funding dries up. O n the other hand the process o f engaging with the
subprojects undoubtedly helped to build up the s k i l l s o f all concerned-in proposal writing,
preparing business plans and application o f new technologies-and this human capacity
development will outlive the subproject. This i s one respect in which sustainability
prospects seem sounder.

5.52 I n short, while all o thefour projects assessed raise concerns about the long-
                           f
term sustainability o the competitivefunds, it is equally important to consider the
                     f
support these projects gave to strengthening the public research and extension

apparatus and building up o skills, aspects that may be more sustainable. Moreover,
where there is a strong public sector apparatus there is likely to be a sound enabling
environment for competitivefunds over the longer term, which may offset short-term
downturns in government and donor supportfor competitivefunds.


6. Conclusions and Lessons
6.1    An importantfinding o this four-project assessment is the lack o hard
                            f                                          f
evidence about the results o competitivefund investments in research and extension.
                                f
In each o f these countries, agricultural productivity has risen since the mid 1990s, with
growth increasingly based on intensification rather than area expansion. Potentially, the
assessed projects contributed to this expansion. But, with the exception o f Peru, there i s
no robust survey evidence linking productivity and income changes to the project
interventions. Even in the case o f Peru there are doubts about which o f the steps in the
results chain were most critical for achieving the increase in farm incomes. For example,
extension services potentially have a role to play in the technology transfer chain but it i s
unclear just how a critical a role. In each o f these four countries extension has withered
on the vine; but from the evidence generated by these projects it i s impossible to
conclude if this attrition i s truly significant-or whether, for example, tighter linkage o f
farmers to producer associations i s an effective substitute.

6.2     With respect to the viability o f the competitive fund model, more study i s needed to
compare the efficiency o f the model with the alternative-a single (public) supplier with
fiinds directly assigned by government. There is a perception-stronger in Brazil and
Colombia than in Peru and Nicaragua-that the competitive process has been managed in a
way that i s both fair and transparent and has tended to raise the quality o f the research
proposals that are approved for funding. But there i s no indication o f how costs per unit o f
technology adopted vary between the competitive and the direct assignment approach.

6.3     Thefourprojects included in this assessment, and thefollow-on projects that have
succeeded them, have generated substantial learning, both by the Bank and by the
countries concerned. InNicaragua, there i s now greater realism about what can be achieved
in a context o f weak institutions and high donor dependence. In Peru, the importance o f
integrating the competitive fund approach with the broader public sector apparatus o f
research and extension has been acknowledged; and the government's commitment to
maintainingthe regional network o f INCAGRO bodes well for increased decentralization. In
Colombia, the progress under the follow-on project in linking subprojects to commodity
chains and increasing engagement with producer associations i s resulting ina more strategic
allocation o f competitive fund resources that will help to enhance the country's agricultural
competitiveness under the terms o f the new free trade agreement with the USA. In Brazil, the
returns to increasing EMBRAPA'S      connectedness with diverse research institutions, both
within the country and beyond, have become f i l l y apparent.

6.4     The findings from this assessment suggest lessons o f broad relevance that are
likely to apply beyond the four countries studied. A principal lesson concerns the
importance o strengthening the capacity o research organizations, not just financing
            f                            f
                                             29


research. Competitive funds can be an important vehicle for research financing and have
a strategic role to play in piloting new ways o f working, or focusing research on new
topics; but they are most likely to make a sound and lasting contribution when they
complement a relatively strong public-sector framework for research (in this respect,
prospects were brighter to begin with in Brazil and Colombia than they were in
Nicaragua and Peru). Public funding i s essential for agricultural innovation systems and
private funding complements rather than substitutes for higher levels o f public funding

6.5    Second, to be able to compete, research institutions must have a minimum
budget and a critical mass o staff-all
                            f           institutions need a portion o the budget that is
                                                                     f
                           f                                 f
corefunded to cover costs o maintenance and upgrading o physical and human
resource infrastructure. Competitive grants usually only fund operating costs; and the
subprojects they finance have only 2-3 years' duration.' The sustainability o f the public
sector research apparatus in general and the competitive funding model in particular
depends on a continuing commitment o f government funds. The new model is unlikely to
flourish in a climate o f fiscal austerity because there i s only limited scope for private
funds to substitute for public money.

6.6      Third, the competitive fund model i s more likely to strengthenthe strongest
agencies providing research and extension services than it is to reduce the disparities
between the strong and the weak. Thus, in Brazil, the model strengthenedan agency that
was pre-eminentto begin with. At the other extreme, in Nicaragua, the model was
underfundedfrom the outset, i t s transformative capacity was limited by the weakness o f all
the actors in the competitive arena, and the government provided little support to it. The
principle o f competition between alternative service providers breaks down where the range
o f providers i s limited (a problem at the municipal level and for small countries) and many
o f the potential providers lack the skills needed to prepare viable sub-project proposals.

6.7     Fourth, the competitive model has not itselfled to a large growth in the role o f
                                             f
the private GforprofiQ sector as a provider o agricultural research and extension; but it
has contributed to the broaderprocess o private sector development. Compared to high-
                                         f
income countries, in Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua and Peru, commercial f i r m s have played
a smaller role as providers relative to public and private nonprofit agencies. To the extent
that commercial f i r m s have played a role, they have largely done so outside the framework
o f competitive grant schemes; this i s the case, for example, for the partnership between
EMBRAPA and the private multinational Monsanto for producing herbicide-tolerant
soybeans2O n the other hand, under the competitive schemes, through the medium o f
subproject co-payments, producers have provided private funds as a complement to public
sector grants; they have received training in the preparation o f business plans; and they
have become more market-oriented owing to partnerships with producer associations that
have been facilitated by competitive funding agreements. In this sense, the competitive
fund model has contributed to the broader goal o f private sector development without
entailing a major role for commercial f i r m s as service providers.

Annex 4: Republic o f Nicaragua
Agricultural Technology and Rural Education Project

Summar y
This report assesses the performance o f the Agricultural Technology and Rural Technical
Education Project (PTA 1). The project was supported by an IDA credit (No. 3371-NC) o f
US$23.6 million, which was approved on June 6,2000. The loan disbursed fully and closed
on June 30,2005, nine months behind schedule.

The project was designed as the first phase o f a 16-year Agricultural Technology Program
that had the following purpose: to increase agricultural productivity and family income o f
110,000 small- and medium-scale farm households through the generatiodenhancement o f
an efficient, demand-driven agricultural technology, knowledge and innovation system.
Specifically, by the end o f this first phase, it was expected that: (a) the main public
agricultural technology institutions would be providing effective, coordinated sector policy
guidance and client-responsive services; (b) the private sector, non-governmental
organizations, and the educational institutions would be participating significantly in
providing agricultural services to client farmers; (c) the public sector would be proactively
undertaking strategic and basic research and providing advisory services that generate
positive externalities; (d) a national agricultural technical education training strategy would
be defined and a pilot begun; and (e) a timely, high-quality agricultural and market
information would be available to technicians and farmers.

The project comprised: (a) Development o Institutional Capacity (planned cost, US$9.5
                                             f
million; actual cost, US$20.7 million), which involved strengthening public institutions o f
strategic importance to the sector, and involving public and private institutions in agricultural
technology and agricultural technical education and training; (b) Establishment o a     f
Competitive Fundfor Agricultural Services (planned cost, US$8.3 million; actual cost,
US$4.3 million), which piloted a scheme to provide grants for demand-driven agricultural
service subprojects, supplied by private as well as public entities; (c) Strengthening the
Nicaraguan Institute for Agricultural Technology (INTA) (planned cost, US$16.7 million;
actual cost, US$13.9 million), which included support to this government entity in order that
it might better provide agricultural research and extension services; (d) Establishment and
Piloting o an Agricultural Education and Training System (planned cost, US$2.6 million;
           f
actual cost, US$1.8 million); and (e) Establishment and Piloting o an Agricultural
                                                                       f
Information System (planned cost, U S $ l .1 million; actual cost, U S $ l .1 million). During
implementation funds were reallocated between components, resulting in a doubling o f the
cost o f the first component; this partly reflected the addition, at the government's request, o f
a supply-driven program (Librapor Libra) that provided seed to farmers-a component that
had not been envisaged when the project was designed.

IEG rates Outcome as unsatisfactory. The objectives and design o f the project were only
modestly relevant, based o n Nicaragua's weak institutional capacity. Progress toward project
development objectives was marred by the decision, during implementation to alter the
                                                39

content o f the first component, adding Librapor Libra and using some o f the funds to pay
the salaries o f Ministry o f Agriculture staff-neither o f which were in tune with the original
project design. Financing for the competitive fund component was halved, hampering the
launch o f this pilot initiative. Neither the agricultural training nor the agricultural information
components left an enduring mark on the institutional framework o f the sector. There i s
conflicting information about the achievement o f project outputs; and the outcomes, in terms
o f crop yields and increased farm incomes, are also in doubt. The project was modestly
efficient in i t s use o f resources. The reported economic rate o f return i s not supported by
evidence from elsewhere that shows limited increase in farm yields and incomes. Also,
contrary to the spirit o f the project design, the public research and extension service (INTA)
did not focus o n delivering public goods, such as strategic research-which also has negative
implications for efficiency.

The Risk to Development Outcome i s rated significant, mainly because the original plan to
finance a 16-year program for strengthening research and extension fell apart; and, in the
follow-on project, the competitive fund for research subprojects i s no longer supported by the
Bank or other donors. Prospects for a more sustainable research and extension effort led by
INTA are also in doubt, unless donors continue to finance recurrent costs.

IEG rates Bank Performance as unsatisfactory. Quality at entry was hampered by over
ambitious project objectives and the difficulty, in the Nicaraguan context, o f supporting, in
parallel, a government research and extension service and a competitive fund scheme run by
a private foundation. During supervision the Bank did not provide the sufficient support to
the foundation and did not amend the credit agreement when the government requested that
funds be diverted to Librapor Libra.

IEG rates Borrower Performance as unsatisfactory, reflecting a loss o f government
commitment during implementation (particularly for the competitive fund) and weak
oversight by the implementing agency.

The Lessons learned from this project are discussed in the overview report which draws on
IEG's findings about the performance o f competitive grant schemes for agricultural research
and extension in four Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Nicaragua).
Taking the four countries as a whole, with the exception o f Peru, there i s a lack o f hard
evidence about the ultimate impact o f the investments made-the extent to which farmers
adopted new technologies developed through research and extension subprojects, and the
related change in productivity and incomes.

The assessment also concludes that the principle o f competition between alternative service
providers breaks down where the range o f providers is limited (a problem at the municipal
level and for small countries) and many o f the potential providers lack the skills needed to
prepare viable sub-project proposals. The model i s more likely to strengthenthe strongest
players in the field than it i s to reduce the disparities between the strong and the weak.
Summing up, the competitive fund approach i s a useful adjunct to the broader public sector
apparatus for agricultural research and technology transfer; it i s not a substitute.

Background
 1.     Since the early 1990s the Bank has supported a broad program o f adjustment and
liberalization in Nicaragua that was intended to revive economic growth. A major part o f
this effort was directed at the agricultural sector, with a particular emphasis on increasing
the contribution o f research and extension to agricultural productivity. The Bank played a
key role in the establishment o f the National Institute o f Agricultural Technology
(INTA), which was founded in 1993. The creation o f INTA was a precondition for the
FY94 Agricultural Technology and Land Management Project (ATLMP), which ran
through June 2000. A privatized extension pilot formed a part o f ATLMP. The FYOO
Agricultural Technology and Rural Technical Education Project (PTA l),        which i s the
focus o f this PPAR, aimed to build on these foundations. It combined further
strengthening o f INTA with attempts to consolidate producer co-financing o f extension
(piloted under ATLMP) and to promote a demand-driven model o f research and
extension.

2.     In addition to reviewing P T A 1, this evaluation also considers progress under the
follow-on project (PTA 2).

Box 1. IEG Approach
During the October 2008 mission to Nicaragua, IEG interviewedthe principal agencies involved in the project
(Ministry of Agriculture, INTA, and FUNICA). Separate focus-group meetings were held with donors, NGOs
and universities. Two field trips were staged, the frst involving visits to the Departments o f Leon and
Chinandega, the primary locus for competitively-fundedextension (FAT), and the second involving visits to
the coffee-producing Department of Matagalpa, where INTA i s active (Box 2 below). IEG's initial intention
was to review completion reports (and any follow-up evaluations) o f a sample o f research and extension
subprojects financed both through the competitive model (FUNICA) and through the direct assignment model
(INTA). But there has been no adequate documentation o f a representative sample of subprojects and there
have been no follow up evaluations. Therefore, IEG revised its approach. First, it examined the consistency
between the multiple background reports that were generated in the fmal year of the project and the published
ICR. In addition, IEG polled groups familiar with the project (Ministry of Agriculture, INTA and FUNICA
staff, and service providers, such as NGOs and universities) to determine how positively they rated the various
aspects o f the competitive fund model. The poll items were the same for each o f the four Latin American
countries included in this IEG assessment and the results'are presented in the overview report, which
compares findings across the four countries and derives lessons.


Objectives and Components
3.      The project was designed as the first phase o f a 16-year Agricultural Technology
Program that had the following purpose: to increase agricultural productivity and family
income o f 110,000 small- and medium-scale farm households through the
generatiodenhancement o f an efficient, demand-driven agricultural technology,
knowledge and innovation system. The project's development objective was to establish
this system. By the end o f the project, it was expected that: (a) the main public
agricultural technology institutions would be providing effective, coordinated sector
policy guidance and client-responsive services; (b) the private sector, non-governmental
organizations, and the educational institutions would be participating significantly in
providing agricultural services to client farmers; (c) the public sector would be
                                                 44


proactively undertaking strategic and basic research and providing advisory services that
generate positive externalities; (d) a national agricultural technical education training
strategy would be defined and a pilot begun; and (e) a timely, high-quality agricultural
and market information would be available to technicians and farmers.

            FRAMEWORK
      INSTITUTIONAL
PROJECT

4.      The Ministry o f Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry (MAGFOR) sets the strategic
direction for research and extension. The Nicaraguan Institute for Agricultural
Technology (INTA), a dependent institution o f MAGFOR, provides research and
extension services, based on funds directly assigned from the government budget (heavily
underpinned by donor funding). I N T A administers both a freely provided extension
service and a service requiring farmer co-financing, each targeted to different income
groups. Competitive funds for research and extension are administered by FUNICA.
Established in 2000, this foundation was a direct product o f PTA 1-its creation was a
condition for project effectiveness. FUNICA manages separate competitions for research
(FAITAN) and extension (FAT). While F A I T A N has always been national in reach, FAT
was initially limited to three Departments(Leon, Chinandega and Managua); i t expanded
to the Departments o f Esteli, Nueva Segovia and Madriz in 2004, with the help o f
additional funding from DANIDA. INTA chairs the 27 member governing council o f
FUNICA and competes for the funds that it administers. Other institutions supported by
the project are the National Institute for Technical Training (INATEC), which i s
responsible for educating extension agents and farmers, based on a network o f regional
centers (CETAS); and the Agricultural Information System (SIA), supported by
Information Centers for Local Development (CIDEL). The project implementation unit
was housed in MAGFOR.

RELEVANCE OBJECTIVES
       OF

6.       The productivity focus i s relevant to country needs. The agricultural census data
show that between 1963 and 200 1 the share o f land in natural pasture and under fallow
increased while forestland coiitracted (Figure l),  reflecting the predominance o f a pattern
o f agricultural growth based o n expansion at the extensive margin rather than through
increased yields.' However, there was a substantial increase in yields from the early
1990s onwards, with growth in Nicaragua exceeding that in most other Central American
countries, leading to considerable exports, especially o f dry beans and coffee.
Nevertheless, in absolute terms, yields remain relatively l o w suggesting that further
support to agricultural research and extension was eminently relevant.

7.      O n the other hand, some observers have argued that the real constraint to
increasing productivity in Nicaragua i s not farmer access to appropriate technology
packages- packages were there to be exploited well before this project-but the l o w
levels o f literacy in the countryside (the lowest in Latin America) and the poor quality o f
roadse2 Attending to these fundamental constraints was conceivably the first priority.
However, the Bank did finance two basic education projects in the 1990s (including
components to improve school infrastructure in rural areas) and it also supported a road
rehabilitation project. Funding a research and extension project was arguably
complementary to these initiatives.

8.      O n the other hand, given the weak institutional framework in Nicaragua the
objective o f implanting a competitive fund model (based o n the Bank's experience in
Peru, in particular) seems misplaced. Having been instrumental in the creation o f INTA
in the 1990s it was more than a little awkward that the Bank should suddenly appear to
change direction, supporting the scaling back o f staff in INTA and the development o f an
alternative model. Also, the Bank read too much into the limited evidence that small

farmers were ready to co-finance extension.' The development trajectory envisaged was
as follows. Technical staff made redundant by the public institutions would swell the pool
o f potential research and extension providers. These potential providers would compete
for the resources in a fund composed o f both public and private money. Over time, as
farmers prospered, they would graduate from the free extension program provided by
INTA to the co-financed extension programs that emerged from the various competitive
rounds supervised by FUNICA. Public-sector involvement in technology transfer would
be limited to the provision o f pure public goods, such as most o f the products o f strategic
research. I t would have been a challenge for most countries in Latin America to realize
these objectives; with Nicaragua's limited resources such objectives were too ambitious.

9.       IEG rates the relevance o f objectives as modest.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

10.      The project was designed as the first phase o f a 16-year Adaptable Program Loan
(APL). According to the ICR, the choice o f an APL was justified by the need for long-
term commitment and sustained intervention to bring about lasting and effective change.
The design incorporated lessons learned from past projects, notably A T L M P which gave
INTA the opportunity to pilot a private technical assistance scheme. The project's design
was heavily influenced by prevailing thinking in the Bank's Agricultural Knowledge and
Information System thematic group, which emphasized the need for a comprehensive
approach to managing agricultural knowledge. As the I C R put it, "unlike traditional
projects that mainly rely on improving productivity through the provision o f technical
assistance alone, the project design included other supportive activities such as rural
education, improving access to information, and strengthening and diversifying the
institutional frameworPy2.

 11.    IEG finds that the attempt to secure a 16-year commitment from government was
appropriate (although ambitious). The I C R acknowledges that it was optimistic to set a
target o f increasing farm productivity and incomes, respectively, by 25 percent and 15
percent-by the end o f the first phases3  Also, there was a further challenge. This was a
race in which two horses would be backed against each other. Since the Bank had
effectively created INTA in the 1990s, government had strong expectations that the Bank
would continue to support it and the Bank evidently went along. But at the same time the
project sought to move towards a competitive model that was contrary to the INTA
culture. The dilemma i s reflected in the relative size o f the components: the expected
investment in strengthening M A G F O R and INTA was three times as large as that for the
competitive fund, raising questions about the extent o f commitment to the competitive
principle. At least one Bank task manager questioned the wisdom o f setting up a
competitively funded approach to research and extension in parallel with INTA,
envisaging that limited human resources and budget would be spread too thinly and there
would be a duplication o f efforts.

12.      IEG rates design relevance as modest.

Efficacy
13.     Efficacy assesses to what extent the project's stated objectives were realized. This
report systematically analyzes whether the expected inputs, outputs and outcomes
actually materialized (the results chain). This provides a basis for the subsequent
discussion o f progress toward objectives. To the extent possible progress toward
objectives i s assessed against evidence bearing on intermediate and final outcomes
(defined in Table 2). Where such evidence i s lacking or insufficient, IEG considers data
on outputs, considering whether there are plausible grounds for arguing that delivery o f
those outputs has led (or i s likely to lead) to the expected outcomes.

14.     The chain o f expected inputs, outputs and outcomes (Table 2) i s derived from the
PAD. According to the ICR, during implementation the project's objectives and
components were not changed and the project was not formally restructured. Therefore,
the Table 2 results chain i s a valid template for the ex-post evaluation. Each o f the next
sections begins with a presentation o f I C R material bearing on the results chain, followed
by a discussion o f the relevant IEG findings.

INPUTS
 15.     Although there was no formal restructuring, the size o f the project components
changed during implementation and the content o f some o f the components was
redefined. Total project cost increased from US$38 million to US$42 million. The
institutional strengthening component more than doubled in size while the competitive
funds component was roughly halved. By project end the competitive funds component
accounted for only 10 percent o f project cost, suggesting that there was limited scope for
this component to catalyze the reform o f the overall research and extension system.'
Some o f the funds previously earmarked for competitive funds and INTA were
transferred to the institutional strengthening component to finance a US$5. l m seed
distribution initiative (Libra por Libra) that was out o f tune with the demand-driven spirit
o f the original project design.2 Taking out the Libra por Libra funding, the institutional
strengthening component received an additional US$6.14 million over the appraisal
estimate. Most o f this funding went to paying salaries o f M A G F O R staff rather than
direct financing o f institutional ~trengthening,~raising questions about sustainability.

OUTPUTS
16.     Institutional strengthening. All the outputs listed in Table 2 were delivered. In
addition, the (supplementary) seed-distribution program was fully implemented. IEG


1. The Borrower observes that owing to this cutback the competitive model was not properly tested
(Appendix B).
2. This point was made to IEG by persons associatedwith the project in Nicaragua; Bank staff have pointed
out that Libra por Libra was mainly financed by separate finds from Dutch bilateral aid rather than through
transferred finds previously allocated to FUNICA.

found that the seed initiative was not sustainable and, because there was no attempt to
enforce payment for inputs, the broader aim o f encouraging farmers to pay for
services may have been undermined.
17.       Competitivefunds. Six fbnding rounds took place rather than the five that had
been expected. The number o f contracts awarded was 75 (up from the expected 36). IEG
found that there was no consensus about the quality o f the research and extension
services that were competitively contracted. One report notes that FUNICA itself
acknowledged the deficiency, stating that even some o f the proposals approved for
funding were deficient leading to subsequent problems with implementation. Some
observers said that quality remained poor, partly because Nicaraguan universities had
weak research capacity and there was limited participation by (better-qualified) foreign
institutions. One well-positioned observer h s noted that the proposals h d e d in later
                                             a
rounds were significantly better than those financed early on.2 O f the 70 subprojects that
FUNICA approved for financing 4 were submitted by INTA-yet despite the declared
project objective o f focusing INTA on public goods provision, none o f the 4 subprojects
involved strategic research. The FUNICA contests attracted a wide range o f service
providers. With respect to the research proposals that were approved (by FAITAN), 50
percent were submitted by NGOs, 2 1 percent by producer associations, 13 percent by
universities, 10 percent by government agencies and 6 percent by private firms.
18.     INTA strengthening. With respect to extension, the annual target for training
agents was exceeded (up from 400 to 436 persons per year). The area committed to
artisanal and commercial seed production was 330,000 manzanas, 50 percent greater
than e ~ p e c t e dIt i s not clear from the I C R if the annual targets for the number o f
                    .~
contracts to service providers (30) and the training o f technicians (500) were met.
IEG found that INTA paid relatively little attention to research during the period o f
P T A 1 implementation. Taking 2001-2004 as a whole, only 10 percent o f i t s budget
was devoted to r e ~ e a r c h . ~
19.     Agricultural education. The training centers were equipped and the training
plan was administered to 460 extension workers but the I C R says that a comprehensive
strategy was not adopted and i s silent about whether curricula were developed.
20.      Agricultural information system. At one level targets were exceeded: 33
institutions were linked up (the aim was 20) and the system was implemented in 16
(rather than 2) municipalities, including creation o f 10 information centers. But the
I C R says that the quantity and quality o f the information generated was limited and
there was no commitment by institutions to continue implementingthe system. The
information system was designed independently resulting in l o w buy-in by
government.' The web portal created during implementation i s no longer operating.

     OUTCOMES
INTERMEDIATE

2 1.    Development o technologies. The number o f technologies "consolidated" by
                       f
INTA was 18 1 (the target was 180). Most o f the money I N T A spent on research was
devoted to maize, beans, rice, sorghum and tomato.' N o corresponding target was set
for the competitive funds but, according to the ICR, 75 percent o f the contracts
awarded provided solutions to the problems o f small- and medium-scale farmers
(exceeding the 70 percent goal). Competitively-funded research (FAITAN) resulted
in the generation o f 15 technologies. It i s not clear from the ICR what proportion o f
the technologies were developed by agencies other than I N T A (such as universities,
NGOs and private firms). IEG found that, according to one o f the background reports
for the ICR, only 30 percent o f the combined number o f research and extension
contracts was geared to small- and medium-scale farmers.2
22.     Transfer o technologies. The ICR variously reports that the number o f
                    f
small- and medium-scale farmers receiving extension services was 6 1,797 (p. 6) and
68,071 (Annex 1)-both figures exceeding the target o f serving 60,000 farmers. The
ICR acknowledges that owing to budgetary cutbacks and a reallocation o f project
resources, I N T A coverage fell from a peak o f 53,730 farmers in 2001 to 34,055
farmers in 2004.3 Adoption rates were higher than expected for the technologies
transferred by I N T A (90 percent rather than 80 percent); but lower than expected (70
percent) for technologies transferred through the competitive funds. IEG found that
extension outreach was possibly lower than reported in the ICR. The 200 1
agricultural census reports that, in the country as a whole, only 23,677 farms (12
                                                      With
percent o f the total) received technical as~istance.~ respect to the seed
distribution initiative, Libra por Libra, a background report for the I C R shows that
68,000 farm households were served-about one-third o f the national total.5 But these
figures fail to square with another source. The 2005 national household survey found
that only 5 percent o f rural households received agricultural project assistance
(defined to include Libra por Libra).6
23.       Yet another data source adds to the confusion. An interim impact evaluation o f
the project's extension activities compared results from a baseline survey conducted in
2001 with a follow-up survey in 2004. The evaluation covered 1,162 producers in each
year, finding that the proportion o f interviewees receiving extension rose from 28
percent in 2001 to 33 percent in 2004. In both years NGOs were the main service
providers, accounting for about one-third o f all the cases reported by interviewees
(Table 3). INTA's share f e l l while that o f private f i r m s and producer associations
grew-consistent with the project's aim o f diversifying the range o f service providers.
It i s not clear how many o f the non-INTA providers were financed through competitive

finds. Data from the 2001 agricultural census are consistent with survey findings. (The
census reports that two-thirds o f the households not receiving technical assistance gave
as the reason the lack o f any service in the locality.)

INTA's co-financed extension service reportedly recovered 40 percent o f i t s costs
from producers in 2003, down from 60 percent in 1996-97.' The 1996 figure i s
consistent with the 63 percent level o f co-financing estimated by the World Bank in
1995.2 Yet in the case o f extension financed through competitive funds (FAT), the
producers contributed an average o f 21 percent o f the cost o f each s~bproject.~

25.      Knowledge base. At loan closing the sustainability o f the training centers
(CETAS) and the information centers (CIDEL) was already in doubt. IEG found that
these institutions failed to achieve their objectives. The original aim was to set up 14
CETAS but only three were established and the Ministry o f Agriculture dropped the
initiative in 2005. A 2005 report on the CETAS found that in municipalities where
the training centers had been established, extension agents had little contact with
them. From the perspective o f farmers, the training courses provided general
information but l i t t l e practical advice about how to tackle the main problems being
faced by producers, such as marketing bottlenecks. In the municipalities o f El Sauce
and Muy Muy, 72 graduates o f the training centers were interviewed. These graduates
had been trained to work as extension agents; but only 9 o f the 72 had found
employment. With respect to the CIDEL the same report found that, while they

FINALOUTCOMES

26.     Yield imrease The ICR notes that the yield data for Nicaragua in the World
Bank's development data platform show substantial growth during the project period:
cereal yields rose by 22 percent between 1999 and 2003, a faster rate o f growth than
in any other countries. However, it i s not possible to ascertain how much o f this
nationwide growth was attributable to the project.
27.     According to the ICR, crops that account for a large share o f the value added
produced by small and medium-scale farmers showed yield increases that exceeded
appraisal targets: compared to the overall goal o f a 25 percent increase, based on data
from project sites, maize yields increased by 37 percent and bean yields increased by
63 percent. IEG found that, taking the country as a whole, maize and bean yields each
increased by 18 percent between 1995-97 and 2005-07 (a period which brackets the
project implementation period and i s based on the-more reliable-comparison o f
three-year averages). Bearing in mind that the extension service reaches less than 20
percent o f the nation's producers the shortfall in relation to the ICR figures i s hardly
surprising. However, in Leon and Chinandega-departments that did receive heavy
project coverage-maize and bean yields also fail to agree with the ICR figures,
increasing respectively by 30 percent and 21 percent between 1995-97 and 2005-07.

28.     Contrary to the ICR, the interim impact evaluation found that the only crop to
show a statistically significant yield increase was beans; there was also a significant
increase in summer milk yields (Table 4). Another source (Table 5) found that in
200 1 and 2002 I N T A extension recipients did not, on average, obtain higher yields

29.     Even if the project had had a significant impact on crop yields in the zones
that were covered there is an important caveat. M u c h o f the impact--exactly how
much is impossible to quantify--would be attributable to the supply-driven seed
distribution initiative which was not part o f the original project design and added
nothing to the sustainable institutional reforms that the project sought to promote.
This seed initiative ran for a limited period, giving only a temporary boost to
productivity.2
30.      In monetary terms, diversification into more profitable crops i s as much a part
o f yield increase as the change in physical output per hectare. Comparing the periods
before and during project implementation there was no observable increase in the
introduction o f new crops (Table 6). The report concludes that producers' averseness
to market risk dissuaded them from diversifying. O f the four zones covered by the
impact evaluation, the level o f diversification was lowest for the zone covered by
competitively-funded extension (FAT), probably reflecting the higher-than-average
poverty and dryness o f this zonea3  Livestock farming was slightly more dynamic than
crop farming, with 10 percent o f interviewees reporting adoption o f new techniques.

3 1.     Income increase. The I C R reports that the income o f farm households
representative o f project beneficiaries increased by between 25 and 84 percent,
compared to an expected improvement o f 15 percent. IEG found that the interim
impact evaluation report presented a less positive picture o f income growth: a 9
percent increase in total output value for farmers receiving extension-not a
statistically significant increase (Table 7). Strikingly, there was a large increase in
incomes from livestock, statistically significant both for farmers receiving and not
receiving extension. Another author has confirmed that, as o f 2004, there was no
significant difference in the level o f production between farmers receiving and not
receiving technical assistance.

32.     Client satisfaction. Compared to the targeted satisfaction rate o f 60 percent,
90 percent o f clients expressed satisfaction with the services provided by INTA and
69 percent said they were satisfied with the services provided by agencies that won
competitive fund contracts. Satisfaction was also high (90 percent) for the seed
distribution initiative that was added to the original project design. IEG found that,
based on the interim impact evaluation report, satisfaction was indeed high among
producers that received extension services and adopted new techniques; but only 33
percent o f the producers surveyed received extension-and, nationwide, the level o f
extension coverage varied from 15-20 percent. Clients may be satisfied with the
service if they can get it; but most o f them don't.

ACHIEVEMENT PROJECT OBJECTIVES
           OF

33.    IEG evaluates the project against the overall objectives o f the program (for
which the project was intended to be the first phase) and the specific objectives
defined for this phase. Overall, the project sought to increase agricultural productivity
and family income o f 110,000 small and medium-scale farm households. Since this
was envisaged as the end product o f a four-phase, 16 year program i t i s difficult to
decide h o w high the bar should be set in evaluating the productivityhncome changes

realized by the end o f phase 1. The project's specific objectives make no reference to
productivity and income gains (although the logical framework did include income
and productivity targets). The interim impact evaluation quoted above showed that,
comparing the baseline (mean performance in 1997-2000) with mean performance
during the project implementation period (200 1-2004), there was no statistically
significant increase in yields or income. But a judgment based on these findings
would be precipitate-the project did not close until June 2005. Maybe things picked
up in the final year o f implementation. A discussion o f this matter will be deferred to
the section below on Risk to Development Effectiveness.

34.      IEG rates the achievement o f the specific objectives o f the project as follows:

      (a) "The main public agricultural technology institutions would be providing
           effective, coordinated sector policy guidance and client-responsive services"
           (Rating: Modest). Overall coordination by M A G F O R was limited. M A G F O R
           was not fully committed to FUNICA. Shortfalls in counterpart funding
           undercut any strengthening o f the institutional framework.
          "The private sector, non-governmental organizations, and the educational
           institutions would be participating significantly in providing agricultural
           services to client farmers" (Rating: Modest). Table 3 shows that service
          provision did indeed involve a range o f suppliers, but it i s not clear how many
           o f these suppliers were financed through the competitive fund; also, many
           were operating before the project. Moreover, various sources show that only a
           few producers actually received services.
      (c) "The- public sector would be proactively undertaking strategic and basic
          research and providing advisory services that generate positive externalities"
           (Rating: Modest). There is no indication that INTA gave priority to strategic
          research and its extension,service provided a mix o f public and private goods.
      (d) "A national agricultural technical education training strategy would be defined
           and a pilot begun" (Rating: Negligible). N o strategy was defined.
      (e) "A timely, high quality agricultural and market information would be available
          to technicians and farmers" (Rating: Negligible). The information system had
          negligible impact.

35.     Weighing up these five ratings, the project's progress toward i t s objectives
(efficacy) i s rated as modest.'

Efficiency
36.     At appraisal, the economic rate o f return was estimated at 30 percent. The ex-
post analysis in the I C R gives a rate o f 25 percent, attributing the difference in the
two estimates to the lower than expected coverage o f INTA's extension services and
the higher than anticipated start-up cost for FUNICA. These negative factors were
partly offset by the successful implementation o f the Libra por Libra seed distribution

1. These achievements do not include the support given by the project to the establishment o f the
sector wide approach (PRORURAL) because this was not among the original project objectives-and
was different from the 16-year programmatic loan originally envisaged.

initiative which (temporarily) increased the use o f improved maize, bean, sorghum,
rice, and sesame seeds.'

37.     IEG found that, based on a modeling o f rates o f return to F U N I C A and INTA
investments that was prepared for the follow-on project, the former was less efficient
than the latter. The economic rate o f return to P T A 1 investments in FAT and
FAITAN was 16 percent, compared to 32 percent for INTA (extension services only).
This discrepancy reflects the higher administrative cost o f the competitive model
compared to the INTA model o f directly assigned fundsS2       Possibly this discrepancy
would narrow over time as lessons are learned about how to streamline the
administration o f the contests. Indeed, the time for processin research grants
                                                                               8
(FAITAN) f e l l from 16 months in 2001 to 5 months in 2004. However, the attempt
to level the playing field by providing project preparation assistance to some o f the
weaker competitors would probably continue to make the competitive model more
costly. The discrepancy i s reflected in the unit costs o f service delivery. FAT
extension cost US$126 per producer compared to US$87 per producer for ATPm
(INTA's free extension service).

38.    But the rate o f return data are not convincing. They do not square with the
evidence from the interim impact evaluation, which show that neither yields nor
incomes grew significantly between the 1997-2000 baseline and the project
implementation period. The impact evaluation data are perhaps more persuasive,
based as they are on interviews with 1,162 producers-although baseline data were
constructed from farmer recall, which may not be reliable. On balance, however, this
survey data source i s more `real world' than the modeling which was based on
extrapolating from a series o f idealized farm model^.^

39.      There i s one other reason for casting doubt on the project's efficiency. High
rates o f return may disguise an inappropriate allocation o f resources if public money i s
used to finance the production o f private goods. One o f the project's objectives was for
public agencies to concentrate on delivering public goods such as strategic research and
services with significant externalities. But as the coffee case illustrates (Box 2), INTA
has remained active in areas where the private sector had demonstrated a capacity to
secure payment for the extension services it offered to producers. INTA's limited
resources are spread too thinly, covering private as well as public goods.

1. ICR (2005), p. 16.
2. Bank staff have pointed out that evidence from supervision missions for the follow-on project
suggests that although the F A T extension model i s more expensive than the I N T A model, it may also
be more effective. The Borrower notes that the FAT model i s still incipient and that higher costs are to
be expected at the outset (Appendix B).
3. ICR (2005), p. 12.
4. A further study on the impact o f F A T was conducted under the follow-on project (Nitlapan, 2009).
IEG reviewed this study reaching the conclusion-subsequently borne out in correspondence with
FUNICA-that the results are not comparable with the earlier study because they refer to different
regions, a different sample o f producers and only cover the period after the f i r s t project (2006-2008). IEG
finds that the 2009 study does not offer a robust assessment o f the impact o f FAT because there was no
baseline survey and there are doubts about the method used to match beneficiary and control groups.

40.       Based on these considerations, efficiency i s rated modest.

Box 2. Questionable Targeting o f Extension Services in Nicaragua's Coffee-
Producing Heartland
Background Coffee i s Nicaragua's number one export, accounting for 17 percent of total export value
in 2004. It accounts for roughly one-fifth o f agricultural GDP and employs about 30 percent of the
agricultural labor force. Nicaraguan coffee yields are below the Latin American average, averaging 576
kgha in 2005-07-about the same as in the 1970s. Yields are positively correlated with farm size. Small
farms-those under 8 hectares (10 m )h vz- a e     yields o f 300 kgha comparedto 2,160 kgha for farms
over 40 hectares. Small farms account for 90 percent o f all coffee farms, cover 55 percent o f the total area
in coffee and produce 24 percent o f output. The stagnation o f yields has been attributed to problems
applying particularly to small-scale producers: illiteracy, lack o f secure property title, and limited access
to credit. A 2006 survey found that in recent cycles coffee plantations had been less carefilly managed
and the share o f the cultivated area under traditional (unimproved) technology had increased, partly
owing to the increased difficulty in obtaining credit. In that year, 95 percent o f the coffee producers
surveyed (managing 57 percent of the planted area) used traditional farming practices (1).
Field Visit The Department o f Matagalpa i s a major coffee producer. Eleven producer cooperatives
supply the marketing enterprise CECOCAFEN, which provides credit and technical assistance to
farmers. CECOCAFEN deducts 40 percent o f the cost o f the technical assistance from the revenue paid
to the cooperative. IEG found that for the past twelve months or so I N T A has been supplying a mix o f
co-financed and free extension services in the same cooperatives where CECOCAFEN agents are
active, aiming to increase extension outreach to farmers not already covered. The cooperative decides
which o f i t s members qualify for the fi-ee service and which are well off enough to co-finance. It i s s t i l l
                        n
early days for I N T A i this area but the farmers who were interviewed could not identify an `INTA
premium' that would lead them to pay for the co-financed service provided by that agency. This begs
two questions. First, given INTA's limited resources does it make sense to provide extension services
in an area that i s already reasonably well covered by a private extension service? Second, i s there not a
risk that running a fi-ee and a co-financed service side by side will simply encourage fi-ee riding by
producers who have the means to pay for extension? It appears that I N T A presence in this region i s
motivated by the strategic importance o f coffee as the nation's primary export. But it runs counter to
the logic o f getting public agencies to focus on serving poorer producers while promoting privately-
provide extension services for producers able to afford these (2)
(1) Montserrat (2008), p. 29. (The survey was conducted by MAGFOR and the central bank).
(2) The Bank Region's response pointed out that under the terms o f the follow-on project referred to here M T A
will engage in both public extension (free) and private extension (paid by the user), but will increasingly withdraw
from the public scheme: what IEG observed in Matagalpa i s not inconsistent with these terms. The Region notes
however that, in the current government, I N T A management provides more attention to public action than to
supporting private initiative.


Project Development Outcome
4 1.    Adding up the component criteria assessed above IEG rates outcome
unsatisfactory (Table 8). The downgrade from the I C R rating i s based primarily on
the compromised nature o f support for the competitive funds and the lack o f
agreement between various reference sources that were available when the I C R was
written yet whose findings were not fully reflected in that document. These findings
suggest that the project had less o f an effect on institutional strengthening than was
expected and the impact on productivity and the returns to investment were lower
than expected.

    Risk to Development Outcome
    42.     The primary risk derives from the collapse o f the original plan to finance a 16-
    year year program for strengthening research and extension. The follow-on project
    (PTA 2) i s not Phase I1 o f the original four-phase A P L but a stand-alone project that
    falls under the umbrella o f a multi-donor sector-wide operation (PRORURAL). The
    Bank's engagement with the competitive fund model i s more limited under P T A 2
    than it was under PTA 1: it provides no resources for the research (FAITAN) or the
    extension (FAT) competitive funds.

    43.     Although the government signed o f f on the original design o f P T A 1-which
    included competitive funds-strong animosity developed between FUNICA, the body
    responsible for managing the funds, and the Ministry o f Agriculture. To make matters
    worse, competitive fund procedures were burdensome and F U N I C A management was
    overstretched. The Bank's decision not to commit more resources to FAITAN in P T A
    2 meant that some o f the subprojects begun under PTA 1 were not completed.

    44.       Prospects for a more sustainable research and extension effort led by INTA
    are also in doubt, unless donors continue to finance recurrent costs. One o f the
    purposes o f P T A 2 i s to support payment o f M A G F O R and INTA salaries on a
    declining basis, with the government expected to assume responsibility for 100
    percent o f the MAGFOR and INTA payroll by December 2009. As o f September
    2008 (shortly before the IEG mission) the government was covering just 25 percent
    o f this cost. But according to the Ministry o f Agriculture, by year's end, the
    government contribution was 50 percent, consistent with the 2008 target2

    45.     The recommendation o f the PTA 2 mid-term review mission3 was that the
,   Bank should remain committed to PRORURAL: while maintaining the project mode
    o f operation the Bank will seek closer integration with PRORURAL and, to the extent
    possible, increase the technical support it provides. IFAD i s committed to FAT
    through 20 12; but there are s t i l l concerns about the sustainability o f support to the

public sector apparatus for research and extension, strongly borne out by discussions
with government and donors during the mission. Based on these considerations IEG
rates the risk to development outcome as significant.

Monitoring & Evaluation
DESIGN

46.     According to a Development Letter addressed to the Bank by the Ministry o f
Agriculture, monitoring and evaluation was the responsibility o f the Ministry's
General Directorate o f Agricultural Technology. M&E was intended to "generate,
systematize and interpret information produced by the Project's relevant stakeholders
using the Agricultural Information System".' The aim was to fund this under the
Institutional Strengthening component, with M&E operations handled through the
Project Implementation Unit. Verification o f the output and outcome targets specified
in Table 2 above hinged on the smooth operation o f the envisaged M&E system.

IMPLEMENTATION AND USE

47.      The Project Implementation Unit, which had been placed in charge o f M&E,
was replaced during implementation by a Coordinating Committee composed o f
representatives from the Ministry o f Agriculture and other stakeholders.
Consequently, the project-specific monitoring system that had been envisaged was
not established and M&E was handled piecemeal. The project did support the
separate monitoring systems o f INTA and F U N I C A (each agency reported on the
performance indicators that were relevant to it). Also, there was a significant
investment in a baseline survey and a follow-up survey, conducted by the
Universidad Centroamericano (Nitlapan) in 2001 and 2004. These surveys formed the
basis o f an interim report o n project impact prepared in 2005. Although parts o f this
report are referred to in the ICR, the available evidence was not examined as
thoroughly as it might have been-this report has sought to make more systematic
use o f it. Under the follow-on project, implementation o f the planned monitoring and
evaluation system remains incomplete and, despite Bank insistence, data on
performance indicators are not yet being systematically collected by INTA.2

48.     IEG rates monitoring and evaluation as modest.

49.     O n the one hand, the attempt to secure long-term government commitment
through use o f an Adaptable Program Loan made sense. On the other hand, the
objectives were too ambitious. Having built up INTA it was not feasible for the Bank
to suddenly change tack and advocate a competitive fund model (FUNICA) that had

attempt to simultaneously build up separate systems o f agricultural education and

SUPERVISION      QUALITY    (RATING:
                                   UNSATISFACTORY)

50.     Having set up FUNICA the Bank did not provide it with the support it needed,
with the result that the foundation had problems in implementing the competitive
fund model and lacked a clear strategic vision. The Bank also stood by while the
government diverted project funds to the subsidized input supply program (Libra por
Libra), which was not in line with project objectives. The ICR concedes that the Bank
should have amended the Credit Agreement once the government began to advocate
for Libra por Libra.' The ICR also notes that the Bank did not exert enough pressure
for the establishment o f a project M&E system in the Ministry o f Agriculture.

5 1.     On a more positive note, the Bank project team was innovative in proposing
new approaches when project implementation lagged. It introduced a Rapid Result
Initiative that helped step up progress and improve cooperation among participating
institutions. This pilot approach was written up as a case study and subsequently
applied to other Bank projects in the Africa region.2

52.     However, towards the end o f the first-phase project the Bank lost the
confidence o f the other members o f a multi-donor consortium compromising the
prospects for effective follow up. A critical factor was the change in the Bank country
management team that took place during project implementation, leading to a major
scale back in support to agriculture. Arguably, the management team could have
negotiated this transition better with government and with the other donors. The
project team was l e f t in an exposed position and the net effect was a loss o f
~redibility.~

reasons for the outcome shortfall were the overambitious project design and-as acknowledged in the
Borrower's comment in Appendix B-the government's limited support for the development
objectives o f the project.

Appendix B. Borrower Comments
From JULIO C. CASTILLO VARGAS, Director General de Politicas, Ministerio Agropecuario y Forestal

De acuerdo a la nota de la seiiora Monika Huppi, de fecha 8.06.09, enviado al compaiiero Ministro
Bucardo, tengo a bien compartir con usted, algunos comentarios sobre el "DRAFT PROJECT
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORT" (PTA I CREDIT NO. 3371), desde la perspectiva del
MAGFOR y de FUNICA, respectivamente.

Comentarios Generales:

   1. El cambio del Banco de un enfoque programatico, a un proyecto que solo financia costos
      recurrentes a una entidad publica (INTA) es el principal elemento que marca cualquier
      evaluacion que se pretenda realizar en estas experiencias. Esto, y no necesariamente unas
      metas muy ambiciosas, que pudieron ser ajustados oportunamente, fueron la principal razon
      que puede explicar cualquier fracas0 en la ejecucion. Se ignora el hecho de que este era un
      programa "ajustable", precisamente para aprender de las experiencias e irlo adaptando a las
      practicas y situaciones que se iban'encontrando. La falta de continuidad de esta vision, es la
      principal explication.
   2. El PTA en su diseno, fue de alguna manera un precedente para pasar a un programa macro-
      sectorial como es PRORURAL y este cambio de paradigma, no ha sido menor en la actual
      politica publica. Pero, en lugar de continuar en esta linea, se abandona sin mediar mayores
      explicaciones (incluyendo la inclusi6n del programa Libra por Libra), deja de lado 10s
      acuerdos, quedando al FIDA, uno de sus dos principales socios (el otro es COSUDE), en
      una situacion compleja. Muchos de 10s temas incluidos y que estaban supuestos a ser
      brindados en el marco del PTA, dejan de operar sin haber completado su desarrollo y el FAT
      de repente, se ve totalmente aislado de su marco de nacimiento, el cual debe replantearse
      su esquema.
   3. El FlDA se habia comprometido a impulsar uno de 10s componentes: el FAT, quedando en
      esta situacion, como un proyecto aislado que debe buscar como complementar 10s apoyos
      que se suponia daria el PTA en su version programatica. Es asi, que el FlDA debe
      replantear la estrategia y redefinir 10s alcances del FAT para enfocarlo como un proyecto que
      CREA capacidades, para preparar condiciones para el desarrollo de 10s mercados de
      servicios y contribuir a desarrollar instrumentos que permita el desarrollo de un nuevo sector
      empresarial mas inclusivo.
   4. Estamos de acuerdo en lo general con las responsabilidades no asumidas por el Banco, y
      por la falta de compromiso de 10s sucesivos gobiernos, que inclusive intentaron el cierre de
      FUNICA. El Banco, ni en el inicio del PTA I y menos en el PTA II, tuvo un papel beligerante
      en el fortalecimiento de capacidades a FUNICA, al contrario, obvi6 su papel para que
      asumiera el rol para el cual habia sido creada. El FlDA tambien tuvo que asumir esta
      responsabilidad de acompaiiar, financiar y proteger el desarrollo de FUNICA, acuerdos que
      le correspondian al Banco desde que el PTA fue creado y, que despuks abandon6
   5. Se indica (para justificar la evaluacidn de Riesgo en el objetivo de desarrollo como alto) que
      el fondo competitivo para proyectos de investigacibn no tuvieron mas financiamiento. Esto no
      es cierto, dado que tanto el FlDA como DANIDA, continuaron financiandolos.
Comentarios particulares sobre 10s Fondos Competitivos v el FAT (FUNICA):

        1-    El cambio de instrumentos en 10s fondos competitivos ha permitido evolucionar de un
        modelo que solo brinda servicios de asistencia tecnica a la production, a uno mas amplio,
        donde median las relaciones entre oferente y demandante, y con una vision integral de la
        cadena y de negocio, definido desde la demanda. Esto ha permitido promover una nueva
        "clase" empresarial, con pequeiios productores anteriormente marginados, que hoy estan
        integrados en cadenas o en mercados. Este cambio no es menor y no parece haber sido
        muy analizado en la evaluacibn.
                                                  68


        2-       De hecho, 10s resultados alcanzados en el FAT y el perfeccionamiento de sus
        instrumentos y metodologias, se convierten en la orientacion para ampliar el Area del FAT
        hacia Las Segovias (norte del pais) con financiamiento de DANIDA y que otras iniciativas
        utilicen la misma metodologia, introduciendo todo un nuevo concept0 en la prestacion de
        servicios. Igualmente, la experiencia del FAT ha orientado el diseiio de PRODESEC y de
        PROCAVAL, y de otros proyectos financiados por el FlDA en la region, que estan
        alcanzando resultados importantes en el us0 de instrumentos competitivos, para un
        segment0 de productores mas pobres, que tambien buscan la excelencia en la prestacion de
        servicios.

        3-     Si bien el "modelo" de fondos competitivos en America Latina no ha sido exitoso o
        viable, debido a las capacidades existentes, en oferentes como en demandantes, no solo en
        innovacion tecnologica y sector agropecuario, sin0 en general; pero, en el cas0 del FAT, el
        modelo contrasta por 10s logros en el desarrollo de capacidades en la region. En el cas0
        especifico de Nicaragua y del PTA I, es ligero valorar el modelo cuando el mismo no fue
        posible probarlo, dado 10s cambios introducidos en el segundo aiio de ejecucion a 10s
        objetivos del programa y con ello, la reorientacion del presupuesto de 10s Fondos
        Competitivos, para el tema de Investigation.

        4-     Los aprendizajes obtenidos en el PTA I permitieron a FUNICA adaptar el modelo de
        Fondos Competitivos a la realidad del pais, dando un paso atras para desarrollar procesos
        de fortalecimiento de capacidades y asegurarlos y luego entrar a desarrollar un modelo de
        alianzas en el marco de la investigacion con resultados sostenibles y apropiables en el
        sistema de extension, que han sido financiados por otras agencias como DANIDA.

        5-      Se indica que el IEG Rates Bank Performance como insatisfactorio, tomando como
         referencia el hecho de que se apoyaron en paralelo dos iniciativas de prestacion de
        servicios. Se ignora que la introduccion de la asistencia privada en el marco del Programa,
        jamas fue visto como un modelo en competencia con el modelo publico que se venia
        desarrollando, sin0 mas bien como modelos amplios de prestacion de servicios, a traves de
        10s cuales, se podian complementar competencias y determinar roles claros en el marco de
        la entrega de servicios publicos y servicios privados, en determinados rubros y en
        poblaciones identificadas para la provision de bienes, por parte de ambos sectores.
        6-     En el cas0 del tipo y costos de servicios, 10s servicios publicos se orientan mas a la
        produccibn primaria, mientras que 10s servicios privados se enfocan a atender todos 10s
        procesos de la cadena en su conjunto y, en ese sentido, 10s eslabones especializados
        requieren de servicios especializados, generalmente vinculados a garantizar la calidad y
        provision de producto, colocacibn en mercados e insercion en cadenas de valor. Los costos
        para asegurar estos procesos son mas altos que 10s costos del eslabon primario.

        7- Igualmente, en el cas0 de /os costos de 10s modelos, no se debe obviar la valoracion de
        que en Nicaragua, el modelo de prestacion de servicios privados es bastante incipiente y
        requiere de aprendizajes, que tambien elevan relativamente 10s costos en algunos casos.

A la espera que 10s presentes comentarios le Sean de utilidad, le saludo,

Atentamente.

Annex 5: Peru
Agricultural Research and Extension

Summary
This report assesses the performance o f the Peru Agricultural Research and Extension
Project (INCAGRO). The project was supported by an IBRD loan (No. 45 19-PE) o f
US$9.6 million, which was approved on November 23, 1999. The loan closed on January
3 1, 2005, nineteen months behind schedule.

The project was envisaged as the first o f a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan, intended,
first, to establish and then to consolidate a private sector-led and decentralized agricultural
technology innovation system. The system would permit farmers and farmer organizations
to collaborate with research institutions in carrying out adaptive research work and to
access technical advisory services for a range o f needs from production to management and
marketing. This would lead to increased farmer adoption o f environmentally sound
technology. The specific objectives o f the project were: (a) to improve management o f
public investment in agricultural technology; (b) to involve producers in planning and
financing adaptive research and extension services; and (c) to develop plans for increasing
capacity for strategic research and extension support services.

The project comprised: (a) Program and Policy Coordination (planned cost, US$3.3
million; actual cost, US$4.7 million), which financed a project implementation unit to
manage the development o f the technology system, coordinate public sector support for
agricultural research and extension, and facilitate institutional reforms; (b) an
Agricultural Technology Fund (planned cost, US$7.2 million; actual cost, US$5.2
million), which provided grant support to competitively selected subprojects focusing on
adaptive research and extension, involving diverse service providers; and (c) Institutional
Strengthening (planned cost, US$3.2 million; actual cost, US$3.6 million), which
financed selected programs o f applied and strategic research, extension training,
information systems and competitively-funded strategic services subprojects.

IEG rates Outcome as moderately satisfactory. The objectives and the design o f the
project were substantially relevant, both in terms o f the need to strengthen Peru's
agricultural research and extension institutions, and the consistency with good practice
thinking in the Bank. Progress towards the project's stated objectives was less than
expected, based on the shortfall in the number o f adaptive research and extension
subprojects, weaknesses in strategic research services and the lack o f productive dialogue
and cooperation between the project, the public research and extension agency (INIA)
and the Ministry o f Agriculture-this last factor thwarting the objective o f improving
management o f public investment in agricultural technology. However, the project's
actual achievements were significant in relation to the small size o f the project; and a
recent impact study suggests that INCAGRO subprojects have had a favorable impact on
technology adoption rates and farm incomes. Thus, the project made an efficient use o f
i t s limited resources.
                                              70


The Risk to Development Outcome i s rated moderate. Although there are some
concerns about the dissemination o f subproject results, the impact study suggests that in
aggregate the funded subprojects produced a significant economic rate o f return that i s
robust to sensitivity analysis. Moreover, since the IEG mission was concluded, the
government has strengthened its commitment to the competitive fund model and the
terms o f the integration between INIA and INCAGRO have become clearer.

IEG rates Bank Performance as moderately satisfactory. Based on the design's
alignment with good practice thinking at the time and the pragmatic adjustment to a
difficult operating environment, quality at entry was generally sound. However, during
project supervision the Bank had insufficient dialogue with INIA and the Ministry o f
Agriculture, contributing to a certain isolation o f INCAGRO.

Overall, Borrower Performance i s rated moderately satisfactory. O n the one hand, there
was an erosion o f government commitment over the l i f e o f the project (which since
appears to have been reversed) and a failure to grasp the nettle o f institutional reform. But
this was more than offset by the great dedication and solid performance o f management
and staff in the implementing agency; they did the best that could be expected, given the
unpromising operating environment and the resource limitations.

The Lessons learned from this project are discussed in the main report which draws on
IEG's findings about the performance o f competitive grant schemes for agricultural
research and extension in four Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, Peru and
Nicaragua). Taking the four countries as a whole, with the exception o f Peru, there i s a
lack o f hard evidence about the ultimate impact o f the investments made-the extent to
which farmers adopted new technologies developed through research and extension
subprojects, and the related change in productivity and incomes.

The assessment also concludes that the principle o f competition between alternative
service providers breaks down where the range o f providers i s limited (a problem at the
municipal level and for small countries) and many o f the potential providers lack the
skills needed to prepare viable sub-project proposals. The model i s more likely to
strengthen the strongest players in the field than it i s to reduce the disparities between the
strong and the weak. Summing up, the competitive fund approach i s a useful adjunct to
the broader public sector apparatus for agricultural research and technology transfer; it i s
not a substitute.

Background
1.      Following the accession o f the Fujimori government in 1990, the opening up o f
the Peruvian economy to free market forces changed the environment for agriculture
drastically, from a regime o f indirect taxation, as a result o f high industrial protection and
exchange rate misalignment, to one that favored agriculture. As a result, during 1991-
2000 agricultural GDP grew at 6.6 percent per annum, considerably faster than overall
GDP'. But rural poverty declined less than proportionately, partly because agricultural
growth was largely confined to commercial farm enterprises o n the coast (Costa); peasant
farming in the interior-comprising the Andes (Sierra) and the Amazon hinterland
(Se1va)-languished by comparison, owing to the difficult terrain, lack o f good roads and
remoteness o f markets.

2.       In Peru, 36 percent o f the population lives more than 4 hours away from a city o f
100,000 people or more, compared to 18 percent in Colombia (another Andean country),
17 percent in Nicaragua and only 13 percent in Brazil.2 Poverty rates in the Sierra and
Selva are nearly double those o f the Costa.3 Among households in the bottom 60 percent
o f the income distribution the disparity between the dynamic coastal strip and the other
                                                                         This
two regions shows up clearly in agricultural productivity (Figure l).4 "value o f
production per unit area" measure also illustrates the great diversity o f farming systems
in the Costa and Selva.

3.      Public spending on agricultural research and extension was equivalent to 0.5
percent o f agricultural GDP in 2003. To put this in perspective, in Latin American
countries, spending on agricultural research averaged 0.9 percent o f sector GDP in 1995'.
In Brazil and Colombia in 1996 (the latest date for which comparable, cross-country data
are available), spending on a ricultural research was, respectively, 1.7 percent and 0.5
percent o f agricultural GDP:      B
4.      This assessment focuses on the first-phase project (INCAGRO) o f an innovative
program o f agricultural research and extension that was launched in 2000. To a lesser
extent it considers progress under the follow-on project (INCAGRO 2) which was
approved in 2005 and i s s t i l l underway. IEG's approach to the evaluation i s summarized in
Box 1.

Box 1. IEG Approach
During the November 2008 mission to Peru, IEG interviewed the principal agencies involved in the project
(INCAGRO, INIA, and Ministry o f Agriculture). Field trips were staged to the three natural regions o f
Peru-Junin (Sierra), Tarapoto (Selva), and Piura and other coastal regions (Costa)--the        143 subprojects
completed between 2001 and 2005 being evenly distributed between these regions. IEG interviewed
farmers and service providers as well as staff of the regional implementing agencies in each location. A
preliminary list o f sites to visit was proposed by IEG and INCAGRO arranged visits to a subset o f the
projects on that list, selection based on time and logistical considerations. In addition to these site visits,
IEG drew a stratified random sample o f 54 completed subprojects (approved between 2001 and 2006) and
requested INCAGRO to provide the completion reports. INCAGRO supplied 18 o f the 54 reports requested
and analysis o f these i s included in this assessment. IEG also drew heavily on the economic analysis in
studies prepared by the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos (Barrantes et al, 2004) and by the Grupo de Analisis
para e l Desarrollo (Escobal, 2003 and 2005); as well as the 2009 independent impact evaluation. In
addition, IEG polled groups familiar with the project (INCAGRO staff, INIA staff, and service providers,
such as NGOs and universities) to determine how positively they rated the various aspects o f the
competitive fund model. The poll items were the same for each of the four Latin American countries
                                                                 n
included in this IEG assessment and the results are presented i the overview report, which compares
findings across the four countries and derives lessons.


Objectives and Components
5.     The project was envisaged as the first o f a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan
(APL). According to the Project Appraisal Document:

         "The Project Development Objective i s to establish a private sector-led and
         decentralized agricultural technology innovation system. The system would permit
         farmers and farmer organizations to collaborate with research institutions in
         carrying out adaptive research work and to access technical advisory services for a
         range o f needs from production to management and marketing. This would lead to
         increased farmer adoption o f environmentally sound technology. The Government
         would provide co-financing, and policy guidance for the system. Research
         institutions would develop strategic plans to increase their capacity to meet the

         long-term technology needs o f the sector. Information and training institutions
         would develop plans for rural information services and extension training programs
         to complement decentralized, demand-drivenextension services".

6.     The specific objectives o f the project were (a) improve management o f public
investment in agricultural technology; (b) involve producers in planning and financing
adaptive research and extension services; and (c) develop plans for increasing capacity
for strategic research and extension support services".2 Priorities for strategic research
included: genetic resources conservation and utilization, biotechnology, post-harvest
handling and processing, water resources management, forest management, land and soil
management, and integrated pest management.

PROJECT     FRAMEWORK
      INSTITUTIONAL

8.       The project (INCAGRO) established two competitive funds for agricultural
research and extension. These would operate in parallel to the long-established and
underfunded public research and extension agency (INIA, founded 1978). The project
included a subcomponent to develop a strategy for INIA but it did not finance the
agency's overhead or research and extension budget. However, along with other service
providers, INIA was permitted to bid for the competitive funds. The Agricultural
Technology Fund (FTA) was funded from component 2 and was earmarked for adaptive
research and extension. The Strategic Program Development Fund (FDSE), funded from
component 3, covered applied and strategic research, extension agent training, and
information services. For both funds, grants were made in response to proposals
submitted by applicants under competitive procedures. The applicants included NGOs,
government research institutes, universities, agribusiness firms, consulting firms, and
individuals. All projects required co-financing from grant recipients. Although formally
the Ministry o f Agriculture was the project implementing agency, an independent Project
Implementation Unit was established, with a Board o f Directors appointed by the
Ministry. The Project Implementation Unit administered both competitive funds. In the
case o f FTA, subprojects were submitted and selected at the regional level. To support
these contests, three regional offices were established and each region had an
Agricultural Technology Forum, comprised o f participants from farmer organizations,

indigenous groups, agribusiness, financial institutions, NGOs, and research and extension
service providers. FDSE subprojects involved nationwide rather than regional contests.

Relevance
9.      Relevance assesses the appropriateness o f project development objectives in
relation to country priorities and Bank strategy; and the suitability o f project design for
achieving project objectives. In line with IEG methodology, in this report relevance i s
assessed in terms o f information and assumptions available at the time o f loan closing
rather than when the project was prepared (on the assumption that, during
implementation, project objectives and design should be adjusted if they cease to be
relevant). But to help understand the project concept as originally framed, this section
begins with a short review o f the context in the late 1990s, the period before preparation
(which began formally with the issue o f the project concept document in January 1999).

THECONTEXT FOR PROJECT PREPARATION

 10.    After the Fujimori government came to power in 1990, policy in Peru was marked
by a skeptical view o f state intervention in the economy, a position that was broadly
endorsed by the Bank. This was particularly so with respect to the agriculture sector. For
most o f the 1990s the Bank had no agriculture lending commitments. This changed with
the 1997 Country Assistance Strategy, which included an FY2000 agricultural research
and extension project in the lending program. Increasing agricultural productivity was
included among the CAS development objectives; the strategy was "to strengthen
research systems, both public and private.. .and to increase farmer participation in
managing extension"; and the progress benchmark for the Bank program was to "reach
consensus on private and public sector roles and appropriate policy/institutional
framework for agricultural technology development and transfer"'.

11.      The annunciated shift in favor o f private sector initiative was entirely plausible.
Government agencies had a poor record in dealing with agriculture. The agriculture staff
was persuaded that, based on past performance, the Ministry o f Agriculture was a weak
interlocutor with low credibility in the eyes o f the lead agency, the Ministry o f Economy
and Finance. The previous research and extension project (approved in 1982; prematurely
terminated in 1988) had foundered partly because the implementing agency, INIPA [a
dependency o f the Ministry o f Agriculture from which today's INIA i s descended] was
plagued by "repeated changes in leadership and management style.. .and irrational
personnel and remuneration policies which affected morale and efficiency at every level
o f the institution". This project had sought to build up I N I P A through an integrated
program o f research and extension. Although the aim was to be demand-driven, the
completion report found that "researchers tended to pursue avenues o f enquiry largely
divorced from regional and farm realities" and "extensionists were unable to grasp the
methodology for independently selecting good contact farmers, resulting in limited
program coverage and effecti~eness".~     Against this background it i s understandable that

the staff who preparedthe FY2000 project tended to regard the Ministry o f Agriculture as
more part o f the problem than part o f the solution.

12.      In Peru, the market-oriented shift in thinking on agricultural technology transfer
was clearly apparent by 1992. A sector report issued that year observed that "the
government has turned i t s attention toward alternative methods o f providing research and
extension services to the agricultural sector. A strong push towards extensive
privatization o f agricultural research and extension has emerged. One proposal envisages
that INIAA [successor to INIPA; predecessor o f today's INIA] could be transformed into
a much smaller and strictly administrative and managerial entity. Under this proposal,
INIAA's role as a research center would be eliminated. The existing public experiment
stations would be transferred to the regional governments, sold to the highest bidder, or
transformed into non-profit foundations receiving some budgetary subsidies from the
Government. Research would be contracted out to private sector f i r m s or foundations.
INIAA would be charged with deciding what research should be publicly supported in
this way and would manage and monitor the process"',

Box 2. Public and Private Sector Roles in Research and Extension: F r o m A Peru
Sector Report
"Since most R&E activities are designed to increase yields which ought to increase a farmer`s profitability, a
good question to ask i s why the government should be involved at all in the subsidization o f R&E. Why
shouldn't farmers be expected to carry out the optimal level o f research and extension if left to the free
market? There are several reasons why this may not happen. First, some kinds o f basic research and certain
kinds o f extension cannot be successfullymarketedby the innovators because, once they have been
discovered, others cannot be prevented from being able to adopt or copy them at little or no cost. Second,
whereas farmers as a whole may gain fiom the increase in yields, an individual farmer with limitedproduction
potential may not find it worthwhile to carry out research activities. T h i s calls for organizing farmers in
associations which should fund the research that i s o f use to them. While this may be possible in many
instances, in some cases it may not be feasible for a large number of small farmers to organize themselves for
this purpose. Third, the increase in yields may not result in increased farm profits; if the consumer demand for
the product i s not totally elastic, the increased output would lower prices, transferring the gains fiom higher
yields to consumers. These factors above call for apublic subsidy for most basic research and for applied
R&E on crops such as potatoes, which face a fairly inelastic demand curve and whose farmers tend to be
small and dispersed, but call for private funding for applied R&E activities for traded crops such as rice and
wheat where the demand curve i s extremely elastic and where farmers can organize themselves relatively
easily. Although it i s possible to come up with a number o f other factors (information costs, credit market
imperfections etc) which would lead to a sub-optimal allocation o f R&E if left to the free market alone, it i s
necessary to mention one other important area o f particular concern in the Peruvian situation. T h i s deals with
research aimed at reducing environmentaldegradation. Given the problems in Peru with soil erosion, salinity,
toxic chemical runoffs into streams, R&E activities addressing these problems will need to be subsidized".

13.     The same source contained a detailed explication o f the rationale for assigning
public and private responsibilities for research and extension. This i s worth reproducing in
full (Box 2) because reasoning along these lines formed the analytic underpinning o f the
FY2000 project that i s the focus o f this assessment. In August 1995, the new thinking-as
it was now being applied to projects throughout Latin America-was showcased at a joint

World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank workshop in Buenos Aires. The
workshop proceedings concluded that "in efforts to promote greater institutional diversity
and efficiency in the National Agricultural Research Systems, i t s several components will
have to acquire a greater share o f their funding through competitive bidding schemes.
National competitive funds for the development and transfer o f agricultural technology are
increasing rapidly in the region and, to date, they have proven to be effective and efficient
mechanisms for funding research by contributing to improved research quality and by
providing greater accountability to the funding source".1

14.     Outside the region, thinking in the Bank's agricultural strategy anchor (the Rural
Development Department) was moving along similar lines.2 Interestingly, the
recommendations from the contemporaneous Operations Evaluation Department study,
based on i t s assessment o f Bank support to research and extension worldwide, analyzed
the problems with public service provision without explicitly invoking the need for a
radical realignment o f public and private sector roles; and made no specific reference to
competitive fundsn3 this respect, the objectives o f the FY2000 Peru project (and o f
                      In
similar projects elsewhere in Latin America) were ahead o f the Bank mainstream and in
line with the more radical thinking o f the time.
15.     An important clarification needs making. While the project's objective was to
help establish a "private-sector led technology innovation system", it would be too
narrow an interpretation to represent this as primarily about increasing the role of private
(for profit) f i r m s as suppliers o f research and extension services. The aim was equally to
help farmer organizations and farmers to build up the skills (e.g., preparation o f business
plans) needed for a more profitable, market-oriented agriculture, thus furthering private
sector development in a broader sense.
THEPOSITION AT PROJECT COMPLETION

 16.      Were the objectives and design o f the FY2000 project in line with country and
Bank strategy in 2005 when the project closed? This i s the criterion on which IEG's
relevance rating i s based. With respect to Peru's development priorities, there was a
sound case for supporting research and extension. For the nation as a whole the data show
that programs o f research and extension have a positive impact on agricultural
productivity. "Plots cultivated by farmers with access to technical assistance are 15
percent more productive than other p l ~ t s ' ' .In particular, there was an urgent need to
                                                   ~
raise productivity in the Sierra and the Costa regions and the project design included
sufficient elements-decentralized offices, cross-regional resource balancing-to ensure
that these regions would not be neglected. The relevance o f project development
objectives to Bank-wide agricultural strategy i s equally clear: the best expression o f this
i s the inclusion o f specific modules on public/private sector roles and competitive funds

in the research and extension chapters o f the `good practice manual' issued by the anchor
in 2005.' IEG rates the relevance o f project objectives as substantial.

17.      Project design was also relevant; i t s features adhered closely to those in the good
practice manual. There are three other positive points to consider. First, there i s the issue
o f the three-phase adaptable program loan envisaged at the outset. The I C R argues
plausibly that "the choice o f an A P L as lending instrument was appropriate as the
ambitious development target o f establishing a new agricultural innovation system clearly
required longer than the period normally encompassed by a single investment proj ect".2
 18.    Second, careful consideration was given to the need to balance strengtheningo f
the government research and extension institute, INIA, and the development o f the
competitive fund model. During project preparation it was first proposed to have a
component dedicated to building up INIA. However, the Bank's analysis-backed up the
Ministries o f Agriculture and Finance-concluded that INIA was not in a position to
absorb resources efficiently. Consequently, the project was reduced in funding level and
support to INIA was limited to strengthening some o f i t s programs (through FDSE).
Also, the idea o f developing a strategic plan was introduced, partly in order to make the
case for strengthening INIA in the second-phase p r ~ j e c t . ~
 19.     Third, the design was flexible enough to allow for midcourse adjustments.
Initially the quality o f subproject proposals was poor leading to the introduction o f a two-
phase selection process in 2002. In the first instance, proponents submitted outline
proposals that were assessed for technical merit. Successful outlines passed to a second
round, which entailed preparation o f detailed subproject proposals with technical
assistance for those who needed it. In 2003, additional major changes were introduced to
the selection process with competitions on a national thematic basis - one for extension
and the other for adaptive research - rather than at a regional level. At the same time,
more attention was given to identifying local priorities and requirements, with training
and information workshops at local rather than regional level^.^
20.      Weighing up these four factors, IEG rates design relevance as substantial.

Efficacy
21,     Efficacy assesses to what extent the project's stated objectives were realized. This
report systematically analyzes whether the expected inputs, outputs and outcomes
actually materialized (the results chain). This provides a basis for the subsequent
discussion o f progress toward objectives. To the extent possible progress toward
objectives is assessed against evidence bearing on intermediate and final outcomes
(defined in Table 2). Where such evidence i s lacking or insufficient, IEG considers data
on outputs, considering

3. Ultimately, this did not take place. Bank staff pointed out that the decision not to include a component
for strengthening INIA in the second phase was based on technical grounds.

    whether there are plausible grounds for arguing that delivery o f those outputs has led (or i s
    likely to lead) to the expected outcomes.

    22.     The chain o f expected inputs, outputs and outcomes (Table 2) i s derived from the
    PAD. According to the ICR, during implementation the project's objectives and components
    were not changed and the project was not formally restructured. Therefore, the Table 1
    results chain i s a valid template for the ex-post evaluation. Each o f the next sections begins
    with a presentation o f I C R material bearing on the results chain, followed by a discussion o f
    the relevant IEG findings.

    INPUTS

    23.    During this first phase o f the INCAGRO program, the World Bank financed 80
    percent and the government 20 percent.' Although the project components were not revised
    there was some reallocation o f funds. Resources were shifted from FTA to FSDE, because
    the number o f FTA subproject proposals was lower than expected at appraisal. Also, during
    implementation the terms o f the FTA were modified to allow for establishment o f a special
    fund for indigenous communities (Huchuy Ayni) and the development o f a plan to reach more
    women farmers. Counterpart funding was not always timely but by project end the
    government's contribution exceeded by U S $ l . l m the amount expected at appraisal.

    OUTPUTS

    24.     Policy andprogram coordination. Although it was an effective administrator o f the
    competitive funds the implementation unit did not coordinate effectively with INIA and the
    Ministry o f Agriculture and this contributed to the government's failure to approve a
    strategic plan for development o f INIAS3 I C R notes that "the project did not

    but were overburdened. The staff in each office was responsible for liaison with regional

    INCAGRO offices in Tarapoto, Huancayo and Piura, the office staff were too few to allow
    for close supervision o f each subproject.

26.     Agricultural Technology Fund. Thirty-one adaptive research subprojects were
financed (see Table 4 below); the appraisal target was 5 1 (Table 2). There was also a
shortfall in the delivery o f extension subprojects: 6 1, compared to the 123 expected.' The
I C R does not say how many innovations were diffused to farmers. Initially, proposals from
the Sierra were weaker than those received from the Costa and the Selva, calling for
additional training and the addition o f a pilot initiative for indigenous communities in the
region. After 2002 the rigor o f the competitive process was stepped up with an insistence
that subproject proposals be linked to business plans. IEG found that among the more
successful extension projects there were several based on export-oriented producer
associations that had obtained `fair trade' certification (Box 3). However, subproject
completion reports were o f uneven quality and often did not contain the information needed
to assess outreach to farmers or economic benefits.

Box 3. A Successful Extension Subproject: Promoting Organic Cocoa
The subproject sought to boost the competitiveness o f small farmers in the Selva Alfa by providing the
technical assistance needed for them to switch from conventional to organic cocoa production. The aim was
to work with 25 1 producers, each with an average o f 3 hectares in cocoa, obtaining their certification as
organic producers and boosting mean yields from 288 kgha to 540 kg/ha. The parties to the subproject
were INCAGRO (which provided 43 percent o f the financing), three producer cooperatives (37 percent),
and an apex organization, Caf6 Peru (20 percent). The subproject was highly successful. B y the time it was
completed 846 producers from the three cooperatives had received organic certification, entering into `fair
trade' deals with overseas buyers and thus substantially increasing their revenues compared to the
preceding period when they sold to local intermediaries. Ninety-four percent o f the beneficiaries reported
they were satisfied with the technical assistance provided. Based on the increasedreturns to cocoa
production, the farmers interviewed by IEG said that each o f the cooperatives i s now willing to pay for
continuing extension services. The cooperatives supply working capital credit to their members; but the
need for additional financing to cover the cost o f replanting has not yet been fully met.

27.     Institutional strengthening. FSDE subprojects were smaller than expected
(US$94,538 per project compared to the US$250,000 envisaged). Sixty-one subprojects were
financed (see Table 4 below); almost three times the expected number. But overall the I C R
reports that limited progress was made toward the goal o f developing strategic research and
extension services owing to the weakness o f the existing institutions and the failure to
promote better communication between them. IEG found no evidence to dispute this
statement in the I C R and also formed the impression that FDSE subprojects were too small
and too diffuse to achieve the critical mass that strategic services entail. Some o f these
projects are o f doubtful sustainability (Box 4).

Box 4. A Strategic Research Subproject: Developing a Plant Source o f Omega Fatty
Acids
Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) i s an oilseed native to the Amazon basin that has attracted attention in
recent years because i t i s a significant plant source for Omega fatty acids whose health benefits have been
widely proclaimed. Owing to the depredation o f fish sources o f fatty acids there i s a growing demand to
 id
fn alternative, sustainable supplies from the plant world. Given the large potential demand, claims have
even been made that the crop could be attractive to Peruvian farmers as a substitute to coca production. The
plant has a productive life o f four years during which time it produces h i t continuously, providing a
steady income to the farmer. The number o f Peruvian growers o f the crop i s unknown but it estimated that,
nationwide, about 3,000 hectares are under cultivation. There are major constraints to expanding
production. The l i t t l e seed that i s available on the market i s o f variable quality and the plant i s susceptible
to fungi and nematodes. There i s no parallel development at the international level: e.g., none o f the
CGIAR research centers i s working on the crop. Thus, sacha inchi could be presentedas an ideal candidate
for strategic research funding: returns are uncertain and likely to be long-term but the potential rewards are
high given rich country interest in herbal panaceas. A n I N I A research station (El Porvenir, Tarapoto)
submitted proposals to the FDSE competitive fund and so far two subprojects have been financed. Between
2004 and 2007, subproject spending totaled US$138,000,42 percent from INCAGROFDSE, 46 percent
from I N I A and 12 percent from other public research agencies. The aim i s to build up a germplasm bank
from which to develop pest-resistantvarieties that can ultimately be certified and sold. So far results have
been mixed. The stock o f genetic material has grown substantially following collection o f wild varieties
from several sites in Peru, researchers have been trained and several experimental plantings have been
staged; but none o f the plants has survived, succumbing to nematodes and failing to withstand damp
conditions. N o viable varieties have yet been produced. INIA has insufficient resources to continue the
work once the FDSE financing comes to an end.

     OUTCOMES
INTERMEDIATE

28.     Co-financing. INCAGRO financed 48 percent o f the cost o f the 153 subprojects
approved in 2001-2005.' This i s substantially less than indicated in the ICR (which reports
that the INCAGRO share began at 75 percent, falling to 65 percent in 2003 owing to budget
constraints).2 Thus, co-financing by partners (service providers and farmers) appears to have
been much higher than reported. Much o f this co-financing-how much i s not clear-was
not in cash but in kind. IEG found that partner co-financing was not well accounted for (see
"Efficiency" section below). I t also found that the level o f participation by private
agribusiness f i r m s was less than expected. The PAD set as a target 15 percent FTA
subproject financing by the private ~ e c t o r .O f the 92 FTA subprojects financed in 2001-
                                                 ~
2005, only 10 involved private f i r m s as service providers (equal to 10 percent o f the total
investment in FTA subprojects). For these private-sector-led subprojects, the co-financing
share averaged 39 percent, compared to 53 percent for all the FTA subprojects. This hardly
amounted to the `private-sector led' extension model envisaged at apprai~al.~

29.      Farmer coverage. The P A D target was for 20,000 farmers to participate in research
and extension subprojects and adopt new technologies. The I C R reports that direct
beneficiaries numbered ` 10,334 approximately' but that about 35,000 farmers benefited in
total (including indirect beneficiaries-although it i s not clear h o w these were counted).
According to a recent estimate, between 2001 and 2008, taking into account both the original
and the follow-on operation, INCAGRO subprojects benefited 3 8,347 producers.

FINALOUTCOMES

30.      Increase in incomes andproductivity. The PAD projected that real incomes o f direct
beneficiaries o f FTA subproject would increase by 30 percent. The I C R contains no estimate
o f the increase in income. The appraisal target o f an average productivity increase o f 30
percent for FTA subprojects involving adaptive research trials was not re-visited in the ICR.
IEG was not able to verify these outcomes directly but the available studies cast some doubt
on the level o f income and productivity impact (see "Efficiency" section below).

3 1.   Improved natural resource management. The P A D states that 30,000 hectares would
be brought under improved management but the I C R makes no reference to this figure. I t
does note, however, that 10 percent o f all subprojects were directly related to natural resource
management. IEG observed in the course o f field trips that various subprojects had
successfully enabled farmers to substitute organic for conventional, chemical-using
approaches to farming and some modest reduction in overall environmental degradation was
probably achieved.

ACHIEVEMENT       OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES

32.      IEG rates the achievement o f the specific objectives o f the project as follows:

      (a) "Improve management o f public investment in agricultural technology" (Rating:
          Modest). The lack o f dialogue between INCAGRO, INIA and the Ministry o f
          Agriculture reduced the scope for improved management and the government
          wavered in i t s commitment to this objective. The first-phase o f the proposed three-
          phase program was too limited in resources (US$14 million) to achieve the level o f
          reform projected in the PAD.
      (b) "Involve producers in planning and financing adaptive research and extension
          services" (Rating: Modest). Although the decentralized process for selecting between
          these types o f subproject proposals was sound the number o f subprojects financed
          was r.oughly half the expected number.
      (c) "Develop plans for increasing capacity for strategic research and extension support
          services" (Rating: Modest). The number o f this category o f subprojects was about
          three times what was expected but they were too small to make a difference and the
          participating institutions remained weak and poorly coordinated.

33.      Weighing up these three ratings, the project's progress toward i t s objectives (efficacy)
i s rated as modest.

Efficiency
34.     At appraisal, based on an assessment o f FTA research and extension projects, an
economic rate o f return o f 39 percent was estimated. A similar approach was adopted at
completion. Annex 3 o f the I C R states that 75 adaptive research and extension subprojects
were funded through FTA (although the figures in Annex 1 add up to 79). Annex 3 further
elaborates that 29 o f the 75 subprojects were selected for evaluation, noting that "the
selection was mainly based on data availability and i s therefore not a formally randomized
selection" (p. 18). The aggregate economic rate o f return for the 29 subprojects i s 34 percent.
But because selection was not randomized the results for the 29 project subset cannot be
taken as a guide to the performance o f all 75 subprojects.

35.     A separate cost-benefit analysis was carried out by Barrantes and others (2004),
covering a wider range o f subprojects. This was subject to the same constraints. The selection
o f subprojects was not randomized; it was limited to those for which adequate data were
available. In this case, the cohort was 101 subprojects implemented between 2001 and 2004.
Since only 6 subprojects from the cohort had been completed the analysis was mostly ex ante
(like that o f the ICR). O f the 101 subprojects only 41 had enough economic data to allow
costs and benefits to be estimated. The estimated rate o f return for these 41 projects i s higher
than that in the ICR-the mean exceeds 70 ,percent for each o f the four categories o f service
funded; mean returns are highest for the categories o f strategic research and information and
training-but variance i s also higher in these categories (Table 3).

36.     Although the sample size i s 25 percent or more for each o f the four service categories,
given the non-randomness o f i t s selection not much faith can be placed in these estimates as a
guide to the overall rate o f return to the project. (The Barrantes study scales up the findings
                                                         87


    to the universe o f INCAGRO subprojects, estimating an overall rate o f return o f 76 percent,
    and a net present value o f US$35 million-but this assumes that the subprojects for which
    there i s incomplete information are comparable to those with better information when, in
    fact, the shortage o f data may well reflect a lower economic viability o f the subproject).

    3 7.   Did co-financing enhance efficiency? The co-financing requirement facing partner
    agencies and producer groups should, in principle, have helped to ensure beneficiary
    commitment to a satisfactory outcome and closer scrutiny o f economic viability when the
    proposals were prepared. At appraisal, the level o f co-financing by service category was set
    at between 5 percent and 35 percent; but the ex-post level o f co-financing recorded by
    INCAGRO was substantially higher-between 48 percent and 56 percent (Table 4).

    38.     O n the other hand, the actual level o f co-financing was probably overestimated
    because partners were able to make their contribution in kind as well as cash. In-kind
    contributions took the form o f land, labor (e.g., research workers whose salaries were paid
    outside INCAGRO could devote part o f their time to INCAGRO subprojects), materials, and
    the loan o f existing equipment and facilities (e.g., laboratories). Monetizing these diverse
    contributions must have been difficult and there was ample margin for inconsistent
    accounting-not to mention pledging o f resources that were not ultimately delivered.
    (Perhaps for this reason the P A D for the follow-on project insisted more strongly that
    contributions be made in cash.' Also, the operating manual for the follow-on project has a
    special section on "non-monetary inputs", emphasizing that it i s the responsibility o f the
    regional offices o f INCAGRO to check that these are actually provided.)2

    39.     There is also some evidence that pours doubt on the returns to agricultural technical
    assistance in areas covered by the project (although not INCAGRO subprojects specifically).
    A study by Escobal(2003; 2005) assessed the returns to technical assistance comparing

1,02 1 producers who had received technical assistance with 1,111 producers who had not
received such assistance, spread across ecologically representative zones o f the country
(selected randomly). Although the study included 340 INCAGRO beneficiaries these
represented only a minority o f the producers with technical assistance and the study was too
close to the start up o f INCAGRO to estimate the specific impact o f INCAGRO. But the
findings are s t i l l important because the operating environment was the same as that for
INCAGRO. It emerged that for four out o f six activities there was no significant difference
between the `with' and `without' groups in terms o f net income per hectare (Table 5). The
evidence i s all the more robust because steps were taken to filter out the effect o f exogenous
influences on income-the `withs' were propensity score matched against the `withouts' by
education, assets, risk perception and access to credit.

40.     The Escobal study also assessed capacity for producers to co-finance extension and
adaptive research, on the assumption that the INCAGRO subsidy was transitory and that the
producers themselves would ultimately be obliged to shoulder the burden n o w borne by
INCAGRO. It emerged that in the coffee and potato growing areas included in the study net
incomes from these crops were high enough to cover technical assistance costs; but such was
not the case in the rice growing areas. This i s partly driven by crop marketing arrangements.
In the case o f coffee and potato, producers tended to have forward contracts for their crop,
securing better prices and quality premiums than (rice) producers dependent on the spot
market. But rice producers covered by the study were also less well educated, had fewer
assets and had less access to credit than coffee and potato producers.

41.      Furthermore, the study found that INCAGRO beneficiaries were more educated, owned
more land, were less risk averse, had easier access to credit and enjoyed higher living standards
than respondents in the sample that had not been funded by INCAGRO. Non-users o f
extension services were significantly less informed about the range o f services available and
more skeptical about the value o f these services. This suggests that there are significant barriers
to extending the reach o f INCAGRO to include less well-off producers. Note, however, that the
first phase o f the INCAGRO program (the focus o f this assessment) did not present i t s e l f as a
targeted intervention when it was appraised; although, during implementation, some
adjustments were made to ensure greater coverage o f indigenous communities in the Sierra.

42.     A recently completed independent evaluation (led by a Brazilian team that included
E M B R A P A researchers) found that the economic rate o f return from INCAGRO (2001-
2006) varied between 25 percent and 37 percent.' The positive return stands up to sensitivity
analysis: it would take a 25 percent increase in costs and a 25 percent drop in benefits to
drive the rate o f return down to the threshold o f unacceptability (12 percent). The study was
based on a random sample o f 49 subprojects (almost one-quarter o f the universe), stratified
by region, by subproject type (research, extension or training), by period, and by the
performance rating applied to subprojects by the INCAGRO team. The evaluation found that
53 percent o f aggregate net benefits were captured by the Selva region, 27 percent by the
Costa and 20 percent by the Sierra (the poorest region). O f the 739 farmers interviewed, 59
percent reported that they adopted new technologies during the period that INCAGRO was
implemented; by the producers' own reckoning, adoption was one-quarter attributable to the
project, three-quarters attributable to other factors.

43.     This study has two flaws. First, there was no control group, comprising farmers not
exposed to INCAGRO. Second, the pre-project baseline was constructed using farmer recall.
Both o f these shortfalls raise the possibility that the impact o f INCAGRO was overestimated.
Relying on farmers to estimate to what extent INCAGRO was responsible for their adoption
o f new technologies was a poor substitute for a comparison between treatment and control
groups.

44.      Nevertheless, despite these flaws there i s ample evidence in this latest study that the
project had a solid impact on technology adoption and farm incomes. Also, given the small
size o f the project and the challenging environment it is striking what was accomplished-
the network o f regional project administration and technical assistance was impressive (if
overstretched). IEG rates efficiency as substantial.

Project Development Outcome
45.     Based on the sub-ratings o f substantial relevance, modest efficacy and substantial
efficiency, IEG's overall rating o f project development outcome i s moderately satisfactory
(Table 6).

46.    INCAGRO has developed i t s own method for rating subproject outcomes. Table 7
summarizes the results for subprojects approved between 2001 and 2005, showing that, on a
three-point scale, 56 percent occupied the middle rating ("moderately satisfactory').

Subprojects in the Costa and Sierra regions achieved more `satisfactory' ratings than those in
the Selva. By service type, strategic research, training and information subprojects rated
more highly than adaptive research and extension projects. The success o f adaptive research
and extension subprojects hinged more on the institutional capacity o f producer associations,
which was probably weaker than that o f the institutes involved in leading the strategic
research initiatives. (INCAGRO management acknowledges the problems associated with
weak producer associations, the difficulty o f obtaining finance for fixed capital costs and
complementary investments, and the inadequate flow o f information about business
opportunities in agriculture. `1

Risk to Development Outcome
47.    In assessing risks, a distinction can be drawn between, on the one hand, measures that
INCAGRO has taken to disseminate and consolidate the competitive find model and
subproject results; and, on the other hand, the extent to which the operating environment i s
conducive to sustainability.

48.     INCAGRO says that the competitive funding model i t developed has already left i t s
mark on other institutions. The INCAGRO funding process influenced the design o f the
government's Fund for Innovation, Science and Technology (FINCYT); the information
system was copied by the Private Sector Investment Program (PSI), which is supported by
Dutch bilateral aid, as well as by the IFAD-sponsored Management o f Natural Resources in
the Southern Highlands Project (MARENASS); and advice on the design o f the operating
manual was provided to the IADB-supported Rural Market Access Program (PROSAAMER)
(Benites & Wiener, 2008).

49.     In 2007 INCAGRO introduced a prize for the best subprojects, inviting applications
from all subprojects approved since the start o f Phase I (Figure 2).' O f the 555 subprojects
approved up to 2007, only 38 participated in the contest (and 9 o f these were not co-financed
by INCAGRO). Seventy-one percent o f the contestants had had their subprojects approved
since 2004; and in about one-half o f these cases the subproject was s t i l l under
implementation. This could mean that subprojects from the earlier phase o f INCAGRO were
less prize-worthy (although the barley subproject that took the 2007 prize for innovative
research was approved in 2000); or that, if they had been prize-worthy once, this was no
longer the case in 2007. Or it may simply mean that the contest was underpublicized so that
many o f the prize-worthy did not hear o f it. In any event, these results suggest that the prize
offers only limited support to consolidating the contribution made by the subprojects.

50.     In 2006, the Ministry o f Agriculture launched an on-line agricultural information
system which involves 10 Peruvian institutions, including INCAGR0.2 Filtering b y project
and by keyword search on farm activity, the search engine picks up none o f the INCAGRO
subprojects approved before 2006 (not even the prize-winning barley project referred to in
the previous paragraph); and coverage from 2006 onwards i s patchy-many o f the
INCAGRO subprojects approved after that date are not in the database. This suggests that the
dissemination o f subproject results needs strengthening; and that the scope for using this
information system for learning from INCAGRO experience i s yet limited. The preparation
o f books, booklets and brochures on the INCAGRO achievements are a more direct and
traditional means o f dissemination but since most o f these are only o f recent production, it i s
too early for IEG to judge their effectiveness in getting the INCAGRO experience "out".

5 1.    There i s another risk to the survival o f the INCAGRO model. The attempt to establish
a culture o f paying for extension services has been undercut by the operation, simultaneously
and in the same region, o f other projects offering free services.' One such service was
provided in the Sierra by the (Bank-supported) National Program o f Watershed Management
(PRONAMACHCS). In the Amazon, IEG found that `alternative development' programs
funded by the U S government's bid to suppress coca cultivation also offered free extension
services.

52.     A further risk derives from the limited engagement o f INCAGRO with regional
governments. Although the competitive funding mechanism for FTA subprojects i s fully
decentralized and INCAGRO has a network o f regional offices the approved subprojects are
not, for the most part, known to regional governments. In this respect, INCAGRO's
experience differs from that o f another competitive fund visited by IEG-Fondo Empleo-
where regional governments are actively involved in setting priorities for subprojects.

53.     On a more positive note, the concerns about INCAGRO's future and the terms o f i t s
integration with INIA2-which were very marked when IEG conducted i t s mission in
November 2008-seem since to have lessened. The Ministry o f Agriculture i s now using the
INCAGRO initiative to allocate roughly US$lO million to farmers under the Free Trade
Agreement with the United States. Also, INCAGRO's network o f seven regional offices
(threatened with closure at the time o f the mission) will be kept going-although they will
now be housed within INIA facilities to reduce costs. INIA and INCAGRO are now jointly
developing a proposal for the third phase o f the adaptable program loans3

54.     Another consideration i s the positive results from the comprehensive impact
evaluation (not available when IEG conducted i t s mission). These indicate that the
subprojects financed by INCAGRO produced a significant economic rate o f return which
stands up to sensitivity analysis (see "Efficiency" section), suggesting that the project had a
solid impact on technology adoption and farm incomes. Based on these considerations IEG
rates the risk to development outcome as moderate.

Monitoring & Evaluation
55.     The I C R notes that "while the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit has successfully set up
a web-page, there i s s t i l l much more information on the competitive processes than on the
actual operations and results o f the subpr~jects".~  Transmission o f data between field and
headquarters was not as smooth as i t should have been. IEG concurs with these findings. The

mission found that the quality o f subproject completion reporting was uneven. INCAGRO
could supply only 18 o f the 54 randomly-selected completion reports that IEG requested.

56.    O n the other hand, the recently completed independent impact evaluation was
comprehensive and-despite some methodological caveats referred to above-presented
convincing results. The scale o f the evaluation suggests a stepping up o f Borrower
commitment since the implementation phase o f the first project. O n the strength o f this, IEG
rates monitoring and evaluation as substantial.

                    (RATING: SATISFACTORY)

57.      The analytic work underpinning the project could have been stronger. Striking by its
absence i s any backing from a review o f public expenditures on agriculture and an
assessment o f what reforms were fiscally sustainable. (Fiscal impact estimates were added at
appraisal o f the follow-on project however.)' The Bank's 2002 country assistance evaluation
expressed some skepticism about the need for a research and extension project, suggesting
that the (unpublished) agriculture sector work conducted by the Bank in FY 1998 had set the
wrong priorities. "Protection levels increased in the late 1990s and the coverage o f distortions
broadened. Strengthening agricultural research and extension.. .is less relevant than the other
needed reforms. Pushing ahead with a demand-driven but publicly-financed strategy for
agricultural research and extension before liberalizing the sector-in particular lowering
tariffs and surtaxes and removing subsidies from water users in the irrigated coastal areas-
could lead to a use o f government resources for agricultural research in areas o f comparative
disadvantage where interest groups are

58.     However, the same evaluation finds justification for the partial attempt at institutional
reform adopted by the Bank around this time, which was reflected in the design o f
INCAGRO. The evaluation concludes that the government was no longer committed to the
holistic modernization o f the state and the fiscal effort that this entailed. "Given these
constraints, the decision to attempt an incremental approach to public sector modernization
by building in institutional reform components into individual loans was rea~onable,'~.

59.      O n balance, IEG finds that the project was a limited but nevertheless valid response to
lagging agricultural productivity. The thinking underpinning the project was in line with best
practice at the time. The project's design i s defensible on the pragmatic grounds that, in the
policy environment o f the late 1990s, it was not possible to attempt the needed, comprehensive
restructuring o f the public sector apparatus for agricultural technology development and
transfer. The loan amount was correspondingly modest. Also, given the government's lack o f
support for decentralization (acknowledged by the country assistance evaluation) it i s not

realistic to suggest that the project should have given a role to regional and local governments
in helping to define, finance and implement the research and extension agenda.

SUPERVISION             MODERATELY
                 (RATING:      SATISFACTORY)

60.     The I C R acknowledges that during supervision the Bank had little dialogue with
INIA or the Ministry o f Agriculture.' By limiting the dialogue to INCAGRO, the Bank
reduced the contribution to reforming the overall system. During the last 16 months o f
project implementation, the Bank and the implementation unit devoted most o f their efforts
to preparing for Phase 1 , leading to a neglect o f Phase Iactivities. Closer attention could

62.        During project gestation the overall climate was not conducive to institutional
restructuring. Government had lost the resolve to push forward the radical public sector
reform that had been launched in 1990. Power was concentrated increasingly in the
Presidency and the Ministry o f Economy and Finances and there was little engagement with
the line ministries; the Ministry o f Agriculture was particularly isolated. The 2002 country
assistance evaluation rated the outcome o f the Bank's 1995-2000 program as unsatisfactory,
largely because it was fiscally unrealistic. "A missing ingredient throughout the 1990s in
Peru was an interaction between macro-economic planning and sector needs. Macro-
economic planning was carried out taking existing resource availability as a given and no
calculation was made o f what increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio was needed to meet sector
goals".* The report went on to criticize the government's record on institutional development
and i t s lack o f sustained investment in physical and human capitaL3 Project teams "were
dismantled after donor funds ceased, leaving the technical capacity o f ministries much as it
had been before their establishment and endangering the sustainability o f project
achievements. In fact, an increase in the fiscal effort was necessary to sustain the largely
foreign-financed effort^".^

63.    The first-phase o f the INCAGRO project coincided with a tight fiscal environment.
Public spending on agriculture and livestock fell from a mean o f 3.8 percent o f total
government spending in 1997-1999 to 2.4 percent in 2005-2007 (Figure 3).'

64.    During project implementation the broader government context was no more
favorable. "Public administration suffered from poor accountability, inadequate policy
coordination, and the absence o f a coherent public sector pay and employment system.
Organizational confusion, duplication o f programs, and excessive centralization" hindered
government performance.*

65.     The government was initially supportive o f the project. It signed a Letter o f Sector
Policy in October, 1999 which supported the development objective o f the project, namely
the establishment o f a decentralized agricultural technology innovation system led by the
private sector. But following project approval by the Bank in November 1999 government
took almost one year to sign the loan agreement so that the loan only became effective in
January 200 1. During implementation, unlike in the preparation phase, the various
administrations were less supportive o f the scope o f reform entailed by the project,
particularly as it bore on INIA. At one point, without consulting INCAGRO, the government
summarily broadened the mandate o f INIA to include extension services. The
implementation unit commented on the implications o f this restructuring but received no
response from g ~ v e r n m e n t . ~

IMPLEMENTING
     AGENCY

66.     The I C R notes that the management team in Lima was strong but "a weakness has
been the shortage o f professional staff in the Decentralized Units, whose role has become
increasingly important as more projects require supervision at the same time as new
proposals have to be reviewed and relationships built up with local authorities".' IEG
concurs with this finding. Although the staff it encountered in Lima and in the Units were
highly dedicated they also appeared to be overstretched. The implementing agency shares
some responsibility with the Bank for the weak dialogue with INIA and the Ministry o f
Agriculture although it must also be conceded that INCAGRO faced an uphill battle in this
respect given the limited support shown by government during the implementation period,
and given the continuing fiscal uncertainties. Overall, IEG considers that the management
and staff in the implementing agency did the best that could be expected, given the
unpromising operating environment and the resource limitations.

67.      The overall rating o f Borrower Performance i s moderately satisfactory.

Fecha:          Mav 19.2009

Estimada Sra:

D e acuerdo a lo solicitado en su comunicaci6n de junio 8, l e remitimos informaci6n
complementaria que seguramente servira para enriquecer vuestro informe final en un tema crucial
abordado por e l PPAR. Esto se agrega a 10s documentos que hemos remitido anteriormente.

El Draft PPAR destaca la "ausencia de un didlogo productivo y cooperacidn entre el proyecto,
INIA y M I N A G como un factor importante que frustrd el objetivo de mejorar la gestidn de la
inversidn phblica en tecnologia agricola" (ix). A1 respecto es importante tener en cuenta l o
siguiente:

1. En marzo 2008, e l gobierno promulg6 la ley de Organizaci6n y Funciones del Ministerio de
Agricultura (DL 997). En esta, e l MINAG defini6 como una de sus funciones especificas (art. 6 )
"Conducir el Sistema Nacional de Innovacibn Agraria " y "Desarrollar y promover la
investigacidn, capacitacidn, extensidn y transferencia de tecnologia para el desarrollo y
modernizacidn del sector". En este mismo dispositivo (tercera disposition complementaria final),
se modifica la denominaci6n del Instituto Nacional de Investigaci6n Agraria por la de Instituto
Nacional de Innovaci6n Agraria, con la responsabilidad de diseiiar y ejecutar la estrategia
nacional de innovaci6n agraria.

2. Luego, en junio 2008, se aprob6 e l DL 1060 por la cual se regula e l sistema nacional de
innovaci6n agraria. Este dispositivo da la responsabilidad de ente rector del sistema a1 INIA, y
entre otras funciones se dispone e l desarrollo de fondos concursables para `bromover la
investigacidn ...
                "




3. Estos dos dispositivos no pueden entenderse a1 margen de la experiencia positiva del proyecto
y la relaci6n que se estableci6 entre INIA, MINAG e INCAGRO desde e l 2001. A1 respecto s610
mencionar tres hechos:

3.1 Existe una Clara relaci6n conceptual y de enfoque de politica de ambos dispositivos con e l
enfoque de INCAGRO y con e l proyecto "Estrategia Nacional de Innovaci6n Tecnologica
Agraria y Agroindustrial del Peru" que INIA desarroll6 en e l aiio 2002 con el financiamiento y
apoyo conceptual de INCAGRO (Ver libro "verde" del INIA, 2002) como resultado de dicho
documento, e l INIA logr6 duplicar su presupuesto institucional en e l 2003, nivel que ha
mantenido hasta l a fecha; constituyhdose en un hito importante en la historia reciente de dicha
instituci6n.
                                                100



3.2 En e l 2004, durante e l proceso de formulaci6n del estudio de factibilidad de la fase 1 , se
                                                                                                1
intensific6 e l dialogo, principalmente con las diversas instancias del MINAG, donde se discuti6 la
manera de intensificar la relaci6n interinstitucional tripartita, decidihdose por el establecimiento
de una instancia de coordinaci6n permanente para e l diseiio de la politica de C&T+i agraria. Esto
se concret6 a pocos meses de iniciada la fase 1 , enero 2006 cuando se constituy6 e l Cornit6 de
                                                   1
Coordinacidn de Politicas en Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacidn Agraria (RM 0256-2006-AG),
con representantes de las tres partes MINAG, INIA e INCAGRO; en ese entorno se elabord e l
estudio de prospectiva "El futuro de la innovaci6n tecnol6gica en e l Peni"(Proyecto Quo Vadis).
Este comite tuvo una vida intensa toda la primera mitad del 2006. El cambio gubernamental de
julio 2006 postergo e l proceso hasta marzo del 2007, se debe recordar que en ese period0 hub0
dos cambios ministeriales en e l MINAG;

3.3 El nuevo ministro, a principios del 2007, convoc6 a1 INIA e INCAGRO a colaborar con e l
MINAG en e l proceso de reforma del Ministerio; est0 concluy6 con la ley de marzo del 2008 que
se menciona arriba. Fueron muchas sesiones de trabajo entre MINAG, MIA e INCAGRO en la
que se comparti6 l a experiencia y e l enfoque del proyecto y se discutio la orientaci6n de la
reforma ministerial y e l lugar que debia tener la politica de C&T+i en la modernizaci6n agraria.
En ese sentido, nos parece esencial destacar que la experiencia del proyecto y las relaciones
tripartitas mencionadas fueron un insumo importante para orientar e l enfoque de ambos
dispositivos y para reafirmar la importancia de continuar con 10s fondos concursables como
mecanismo importante para promover la I&D+i agraria en e l pais.

4. El IEG concordara con nosotros que las condiciones institucionales estan asociadas a un gran
numero de factores externos que e l propio proyecto y 10s stakeholders no controlan directamente,
y que la maduraci6n de las condiciones institucionales tienen un ritmo y caminos no lineales y
asume formas que no siempre son facilmente perceptibles. S i e l informe I C R del 2005 no aquilato
positivamente e l impact0 que INCAGRO Ituvo en e l INIA hasta e l 2003, una mirada posterior,
como la que realiza e l PPAR, no deberia soslayar e l hilo conductor entre lo acontecido en e l 2002
y l o madurado en e l 2008, maxime e l hecho que se pueden observar un conjunto de hitos, como e l
estudio del proyecto Quo Vadis y la RM 0256-2006 que permiten percibir que e l dialogo
tripartito no se paralizd y abon6 en la reforma ministerial del 2008 y el DL 1060.

5. Finalmente, queremos valorar la visi6n del PPAR porque nos permite observar que no siempre
10s procesos siguen las dinamicas que se habian planificado y que las expectativas muchas veces
son bastante optimistas respecto a la complejidad de la realidad social e institucional. A1 respecto,
nos parece importante resaltar que i) l modelo de acompaiiamiento del banco con supervisiones
                                        e
periodicas, MTE, PPAR etc y ii)e l diseiio del proyecto en tres fases (Adaptable Program Loan),
son mecanismos que han permitido dar una importante cuota de flexibilidad para adecuar 10s
esfuerzos del proyecto a la velocidad y caracteristicas de 10s cambios de nuestro entorno. En ese
sentido, la Fase I11 que se est6 diseiiando aprovechara 10s actuales avances en e l dialogo
interinstitucional, y podra perfilar mejor las nuevas metas del proyecto.

Annex 6: Colombia
Agricultural Technology Development Project

Summary
This report assesses the performance o f the Colombia Agriculture Technology
Development Project (PRONATTA). The project was supported by an IBRD loan (No.
3871-CO) o f US$51.O million, which was approved on April 20, 1995. The loan closed
o n December 3 1, 2003, two years behind schedule.

The project's specific development objectives were five-fold: (a) to promote the
development and testing o f technical packages especially appropriate for small farmers;
(b) to promote private sector participation in agricultural research; (c) to improve the
quality and efficiency o f agricultural research by introducing a demand-driven,
competitive selection system that would co-finance projects with universities and private
and public sector entities; (d) to support decentralization o f agricultural research and
extension activities by strengthening regional centers, training agricultural extension
agents, and disseminating information; and (e) to revitalize underused assets in
Colombia's research services system.

The project comprised: (a) Technology Development and Adaptation (planned cost,
US$53.6 million; actual cost, US$46.3 million), which provided grants for competitively-
selected, demand-driven subprojects in applied and adaptive research and technology
transfer; and (b) Institutional Development (planned cost, US$30.4 million; actual cost,
US$39.6 million), which included establishment o f a coordination unit in the Ministry of
Agriculture, setting up o f a national and regional panels to evaluate subproject proposals,
training and the launch o f an agricultural technology information system. By an
amendment to the loan agreement in August 1999 US$15 million was reallocated to help
fund disaster r e l i e f following an earthquake that year.

IEG rates Outcome as moderately satisfactory. The objectives o f the project were
substantially relevant, both in terms o f Colombia's development priorities and good
practice thinking in the Bank about approaches to agricultural research. Most o f the
project's output targets were met or exceeded-particularly so for training-and the project
substantially achieved 3 o f i t s 5 objectives, although it was not as instrumental as expected
in leading to greater participation by non-government research providers. One o f the
biggest contributions was a strengthening o f the public research agency, CORPOICA.
Efficiency was compromised, however, by the small size and diffuse nature o f the
subprojects, the difficulty o f accounting for the sizeable in-kind component o f beneficiary
co-payments and the failure to ensure that subprojects were based on business plans.

The Risk to Development Outcome i s rated moderate. Government has remained s
committed to the competitive fund principle and substantial learning took place under
PRONATTA that has been applied to the follow-on project. There i s now a stronger focus
on linking subprojects to commodity ("value") chains and increasing the engagement with,
and co-financing by, producer associations, helping to ensure that the selection o f
                                             102


subprojects i s more strategic and geared to increasing agricultural competitiveness (gaining
momentum from the new free trade agreement with the United States).

IEG rates Bank Performance as satisfactory. The project was well designed and the
arrangements for cross-government coordination proved effective. The Bank's project
team had a close and productive dialogue with the Ministry o f Agriculture throughout the
implementation.

Overall, Borrower Performance i s rated satisfactory, reflecting the sustained
commitment shown by government during preparation and implementation and the
efficient performance o f the project coordinating unit in managing the process for
selecting subprojects and supervising disbursements. In addition to tracking the financial
performance o f subprojects more attention could have been given to monitoring
subproject outcomes at the farm level, but IEG acknowledges the constraints o n field
visits that resulted from high levels o f insecurity in the Colombian countryside during the
period o f implementation.

The Lessons learned from this project are discussed in the main report which draws on
IEG's findings about the performance o f competitive grant schemes for agricultural
research and extension in four Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, Peru and
Nicaragua). Taking the four countries as a whole, with the exception o f Peru, there i s a
lack o f hard evidence about the ultimate impact o f the investments made-the extent to
which farmers adopted new technologies developed through research and extension
subprojects, and the related change in productivity and incomes.

The assessment also concludes that the principle o f competition between alternative service
providers breaks down where the range o f providers i s limited (a problem at the municipal
level and for small countries) and many o f the potential providers lack the skills needed to
prepare viable sub-project proposals. The model i s more likely to strengthenthe strongest
players in the field than it i s to reduce the disparities between the strong and the weak.
Summing up, the competitive fund approach i s a useful adjunct to the broader public sector
apparatus for agricultural research and technology transfer; it i s not a substitute.

Background
1.         In Colombia, as in most Latin American countries, agricultural research was
originally centered on a state-run national institute (initially, ICA; subsequently
CORPOICA). Initially, the Bank sought to strengthen this institution. An earlier Bank-
supported operation-the Agricultural Research and Extension Project that closed in June
1992-was designed to improve and expand ICA's research activities to help Colombia
raise i t s agricultural output at competitive costs. The completion report noted that the
project met i t s targets (such as building and equipping facilities at research stations and
training research personnel), thereby expanding Colombia's capacity to develop useful
agricultural technology to improve and increase production. But following a lead taken
by the Colombian government, the Bank shifted, in the 1 9 9 0 ~ ~ supporting the
                                                                    from
national institute model to a competitive fund model.

2.          In 1989 the government set up the National System for Agricultural Technology
Transfer (Decree No. 1946), replacing I C A with a research and extension framework that
was intended to be more responsive to farmer needs. The staff o f I C A was cut from 6,700
to 1,600. In 1993 the agency was split in two: I C A maintained responsibility for plant and
animal health, quarantine, input regulation, and public research coordination and
supervision; research and technology transfer were moved to the new institution,
CORPOICA, a joint venture between the government and various producer associations,
universities, and regional institutions. CORPOICA, with a staff o f 3,500, took over ICA's
13 main research stations and 66 regional research centers and their staff. Responsibility
for extension was devolved upon municipal governments, creating a multitude o f small
u n i t s (UMATAs), most o f which, in the absence o f continuous, earmarked transfers from
central government were doomed to wither on the vine.

3.      But these government initiatives do not capture the full story. What sets Colombia
apart from the other countries covered by this evaluation i s the importance o f
commodity-specific producer associations, the oldest o f which (coffee) dates back to the
1928. Between them, thirteen producer associations accounted for about one-third o f
Colombia's public (nonprofit) agricultural research staff and spending in 2006.' Many o f
these producer associations have their own research institutes (CENIs), funded partly
from a government-regulated cess on commodity revenues.

4.       Both PRONATTA and the follow-on Agricultural Transition Project (PTA) have
a small farm focus. They also (but PTA more than PRONATTA) sought to promote
research linked to commodity chains based around the producer associations. Reconciling
these two objectives i s not straightforward. Only a minority o f small-scale farmers are
affiliated with producer associations. The data on the number o f small farmers and the
number o f affiliations are highly approximate. About 40 percent o f the roughly 1.1
million small-scale farmers in Colombia (defined as producers operating less than five
hectares), are connected to producer associations. The vast majority o f these affiliations

    (about 80 percent) are accounted for by small coffee growers.' Reaching out to the large
    number of such producers not in coffee i s a challenge.

    5.      Despite an uptick in government spending on agricultural research in 2008, taking
    a longer perspective, investment levels have been comparatively modest. In 2006
    Colombia invested $0.50 in agricultural research for every $100 o f agricultural output,
    which was lower than the corresponding ratio in 1996 (0.61) but slightly higher than the
    1981 ratio (0.43).2 The 2000 ratio for Colombia was also lower than the reported 2000
    average for Latin America and the Caribbean (1.19), the developing world (0.56), and the
    global average (0.98).3
    6.      Public spending on agricultural research and extension was equivalent to 0.5
    percent o f agricultural GDP in 2003. To put this in perspective, in Latin American
    countries, spending on agricultural research averaged 0.9 percent o f sector GDP in 1995.
    In Brazil and Colombia in 1996 (the latest date for which comparable, cross-country data
    are available), spending on agricultural research was respectively 1.7 percent and 0.5
    percent o f agricultural GDP.
    7.      This assessment focuses on the first-phase project (PRONATTA) o f an innovative
    program o f agricultural research and extension that was launched in 2000. To a lesser
    extent it considers progress under the follow-on project (PTA) which was approved in
    2005 and i s s t i l l underway. IEG's approach to the evaluation i s summarized in Box 1.

I   Box 1. IEG Approach
    During the November 2008 mission to Colombia, IEG interviewed the principal agencies involved in the
    project (PRONATTNPTA, CORPOICA and the Ministry o f Agriculture). Field trips were staged to three
    areas of Colombia-Cordoba (on the Caribbean coast), Cundinamarca (in the central sierra) and Meta
    (eastern savanna). IEG interviewed farmers and staff o f the regional implementing agencies i eachn
    location. A preliminary l i s t o f sites to visit was proposed by IEG and PRONATTA arranged visits to a
    subset o f the projects on that list, selection based on time and logistical considerations. In addition to these
    site visits, IEG drew a random sample o f the 93 subprojects completed between 1999 and 2004.
    PRONATTA supplied documentation on each of these subprojects fkom its archive. IEG also drew on an
    institutional impact assessment (Echeverri Perico, 2002) and an economic impact assessment (Sain, 2004).
    In addition, IEG polled groups familiar with the project (PRONATTA staff, CORPOICA staff, and service
    providers, such as NGOs and universities) to determine how positively they rated the various aspects o f the
    competitive f k d model. The poll items were the same for each o f the four Latin American countries
    included in this IEG assessment and the results are presented in the overview report, which compares
    findings across the four countries and derives lessons.


    OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS

    8.     "As part o f Government's National Agricultural Technology Transfer Program,
    the Project aims to achieve the following objectives:

     (a) Introducing a new approach, in support o f the National System for Agricultural
         Technology Development and Transfer, including with measures to build institutional
         capacity, which would promote the development and testing o f technical packages
         especially appropriate for small farmers, and to develop new technology;
     (b) Promoting private sector participation in agricultural research;
     (c) Improving the quality and efficiency o f agricultural research by introducing a
         demand-driven, competitive selection system that would co-finance projects with
         universities and private and public sector entities;
     (d) Support decentralization o f agricultural research and extension activities by
         strengthening regional centers, training agricultural extensionists, and
         disseminating information;
     (e) Revitalizing underused assets, both physical and human, that presently exist
         within Colombia's research services system".'

9.      The project supported three types o f research. Strategic research encompassed
subprojects directed toward medium-termnational priorities, and was expected to lead to
applied and later possibly adaptive, research. Applied research supported subprojects o f
potential immediate use to farmers (in such areas as sustainable production systems,
integrated pest management, post-harvest technologies, fisheries, and environmental
management). Adaptive research took the results o f applied research and adjusted them,
as necessary, to local conditions, through field trials typically involving extension
personnel (notably, UMATA staff) and farmers. Support to the three types o f research
was expected to amount to US$54 million, or two-thirds o f project costs (Table 2).
10.     The project objectives and components included elements o f extension but
without comprehensive support to the institutional apparatus o f extension services (which
was assumed to be provided for outside the project through the network o f local
government extension agencies, or UMATA). Thus, the project financed training o f
UMATA staff and other extension professionals, while also funding information
diffusion through meetings, field days, radio and television spots, and publications. The
training subcomponent was expected to absorb 17 percent o f project costs (Table 2).

            FRAMEWORK
      INSTITUTIONAL
PROJECT

12.      Oversight o f PRONATTA was vested in an Executive Council, led by the Vice-
Minister o f Agriculture responsible for policy coordination and including the heads o f the
national science foundation (COLCIENCIAS), the Integrated Rural Development program
(DRI) and the Agricultural Unit in the Department o f National Planning (DNP). A project
management unit, housed in the Ministry o f Agriculture, served as the administrative arm
o f the Executive Council, reporting to the Vice-Minister. A National Panel o f technical
experts, including representatives from the universities and private sector, was appointed
by the Council to review, select, validate, and adjust all research and training subproject
proposals implemented under the Project. The National Panel presented the portfolio o f
selected subprojects to the Council for approval, based on submissions from five Regional
Panels which served as the first subproject selection filter.
13,      The Regional Panels were intended to ensure that subprojects responded to local
priorities and, in particular, the needs o f small-scale farmers. Each regional panel
contained up to five professionals, appointed by the Executive Council on
recommendations from the Agricultural Secretariats in the administrative regions. The
work o f the Regional Panels was supported in turn by five field-level coordination units
responsible for promoting and administering the first rounds o f the competitive process.
Strategic research subprojects were vetted solely by the National Panel; all other research
and extension training subprojects passed through the Regional Panels.
14.      Under the follow-on project (PTA), the project management unit remained housed in
the Ministry o f Agriculture. The staff changed and continued to be recruited from outside
the Ministry. The unit remained the same size and s t i l l reported to the Vice-Minister. The
PRONATTA apparatus o f panels and regional coordinating units was replaced by a new
structure built around 20 primary production chains. Each o f the chains had its own
Regional Council and Technical Secretariat. The selection o f subprojects was guided by
research agendas prepared for all 20 o f the targeted production chains. The research agendas
were intendedto be long-term and strategic in nature and to counter the tendency in the
previous project to disperse resources across a wide range o f subprojects that were not
always well linked to markets or based on sound business plans. The small farm focus o f
PRONATTA was retained but the extension training element was dropped. Instead, there
was a new initiative to strengthen plant and animal health regulatory bodies (including ICA),
partly to facilitate access to U S markets under the prospective free trade agreement.

Relevance
15.     Relevance assesses the appropriateness o f project development objectives in
relation to country priorities and Bank country and sector strategies; and the suitability o f
project design for achieving project objectives.

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

16.     In the early 1990s the government pushed to open up the Colombian economy
and the initial impact on the agriculture sector was devastating: output contracted sharply
following the removal o f tariffs and the scaling back o f protection. It was therefore
imperative to take measures to boost agricultural productivity. PRONATTA respondedto
that need by seeking to make agricultural research more efficient and more relevant. The
appraisal report noted that past agricultural research projects in Colombia had been
overly academic, failing to meet the research needs o f small farmers. PRONATTA
sought to address that issue. The continuing relevance o f proj ect development objectives
to Bank-wide agricultural strategy i s equally clear: the best expression o f this i s the
inclusion o f specific modules on publidprivate sector roles and competitive funds in the
research and extension chapters o f the `good practice manual' issued by the anchor in
2005.' IEG rates the relevance o f project objectives as substantial.
RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

17.     The institutional framework for the project (concisely and lucidly set out in the
appraisal report) was fully in line with the Bank's conception o f good practice in
agricultural research, and remained so throughout project implementation. The system o f
national and regional panels encouraged a rigorous and transparent selection o f
subprojects. Although project coordination was not run by career professionals in the
Ministry o f Agriculture, the oversight arrangements entailed by the Executive Council
allowed for project results to be owned and incorporated by the Ministry (and the
Department o f National Planning). The administrative autonomy o f the project
coordinating unit probably ensured that subproject approvals and disbursements were
handled more speedily than if the Ministry had been directly responsible.
 18.    There was one problem with the design arrangements. PRONATTA excluded
municipal extension units (UMATAs) as implementing agencies o f subprojects (treating
them purely as beneficiaries o f training provided by the project).2 This possibly reduced
the prospects for a smooth transfer o f technology. O n the other hand, leaving out the
UMATA's may have been a pragmatic decision, based on the early evidence o f their
underfunding and patchy coverage.
19.   Despite this caveat, on balance the relevance o f project design i s rated
substantial.

Efficacy
20.     Efficacy assesses to what extent the project's stated objectives were realized. This
report systematically analyzes whether the expected inputs, outputs and outcomes
actually materialized (the results chain). This provides a basis for the subsequent
discussion o f progress toward objectives. To the extent possible progress toward
objectives i s assessed against evidence bearing on intermediate and final outcomes

(defined in Table 2). Where such evidence i s lacking or insufficient, IEG considers
data on outputs, considering whether there are plausible grounds for arguing that
delivery o f those outputs has led (or i s likely to lead) to the expected outcomes.
2 1.    The chain o f expected inputs, outputs and outcomes (Table 2) i s derived from
the PAD. According to the ICR, during implementation the project's objectives and
components were not changed and the project was not formally restructured.
Therefore, the Table 2 results chain i s a valid template for the ex-post evaluation.
Each o f the next sections begins with a presentation o f ICR material bearing on the
results chain, followed by a discussion o f the relevant IEG findings.

INPUTS

22.     Owing to the disaster r e l i e f reallocations, actual spending on the original
project components was 83 percent o f what was expected. The ICR shows that the
main cutback was applied to regional strengthening (down by US$9.6 million, or 12
percent o f expected total project cost).' Development o f the information system was
also squeezed. The cuts applied to the Bank's share o f project funding, not to the
government contribution.
OUTPUTS

23,    The Executive Council was set up as planned, along with the national panel.
The target for regional panels was exceeded-with 5 being established, not 3 as
originally envisaged. Six funding rounds were realized, resulting in the financing o f
636 subprojects (Table 3). The I C R made no reference to the municipal agricultural
development plans that were envisaged in the appraisal report (see Table 2 above);
and IEG found no evidence o f these. But the I C R reported that the U M A T A s were
strengthenede2 also reported that the number o f persons trained (1,256) exceeded
                 It
the appraisal target (940)-many o f these were UMATA agent^.^

INTERMEDIATE
     OUTCOMES

24.     One o f the expected outcomes was a diversification o f research providers. There
has, indeed, been diversification in Colombia but: first, the level o f diversity was
already high before PRONATTA (the role o f producer association research institutes
has long been notable); second, diversification has mainly involved reallocation
between the various nonprofit agencies (including government) with limited
involvement o f private-for-profit firms; and third, the level o f diversification induced
by PRONATTA was actually less than for the public agricultural research system as a
whole-with producer associations and universities being relatively underrepresented.

25.     Figure 1 shows how, over the long term, the share o f government in nonprofit
research has declined, with a sharp fall in the number o f CORPOICA researchers.'
Table 4 compares PRONATTA with the overall system o f public research capturing
the more limited role that producer associations and universities played in
PRONATTA. Notable was the high proportion o f projects approved for temporary
unions between nongovernment natural resource organizations and farmer groups.
However, according to researchers interviewed by IEG, these unions sometimes only
existed on paper: the farmers who originally signed up were poorly informed about
what was going on and not interested to participate actively in the subproject because
they saw little immediate benefit to themselves.2

mainly NGOs (29 percent); NGOs (12 percent); and unidentified others (6 percent)

26.     One o f the concerns i s that there were gaps in research coverage inherent in
this pattern o f participation. In the view o f one influential commentator, CORPOICA
should fill the gaps left by the commodity-specific research institutes (CENIs)
associated to the various producer associations; but CORPOICA i s failing to do SO.^
Given the limited engagement o f producer associations with the competitive process
during PRONATTA' s implementation there was little scope for identifying these
gaps. (Under the follow-on project, PTA, engagement picked up substantially.) Not
all commodities have their own CENIs (fruit and horticulture crops are underserved).
Some producer associations (e.g. FEDEGAN, which represents beef producers) have
the means to fund research but have chosen not to do so. Many small-scale,
subsistence-oriented, producers are not represented by producer associations. The
competitive model i s not, by itself, able to resolve these various expressions o f patchy
coverage.

27.         The producer associations are nonprofit private entities. Data on research by
private-for-profit companies i s hard to come by but this source o f research funding i s
probably limited in Colombia; and was largely absent from PRONATTA. Private
f i r m s prefer to import technology rather than develop it in Colombia. "Many
multinational agro biotech companies use Colombia as a base o f operations for the

Andean and Central American region but have a comparatively small local R&D
component that focuses largely on the testing and screening o f improved germplasm
developed elsewhere". Multinationals account for less than 5 percent o f Colombia's
full-time agricultural research staff.

28.    Finally, was the link between research and extension strengthened? All the
evidence from interviews and field visits staged by IEG suggests that this was not the
case. Once subprojects were complete, the path to adoption o f useful findings by
farmers was unclear to the IEG mission. Indeed, the government now acknowledges
the need to strengthen technology tran~fer.~

FINALOUTCOMES

29.       According to the ICR, PRONATTA met its appraisal target o f benefiting
350,000 farmers (200,000 o f these being served "indirectly", based on estimates o f
spillovers to neighboring producers); 98 percent o f subprojects had satisfactory
outcomes; and the average annual household income o f producers increased by US$
1,533 as a result o f adopting technologies developed under the project. The weakest
region in terms o f subproject development and performance was Costa Caribe. The
rate o f return o f i t s subprojects was lower than other regions and subprojects were
also less likely to be p r ~ f i t a b l eIEG was not able to substantiate these estimates
                                           .~
owing to methodological concerns about the 2004 report on which they are based (see
"Efficiency" section below) and the absence o f a more rigorous impact evaluation in
the period since the loan c10sed.~

ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES

30.      IEG rates the achievement o f the specific objectives o f the project as follows:

      (a) "Introducing a new approach, in support o f the National System for
          Agricultural Technology Development and Transfer, including with measures
          to build institutional capacity, which would promote the development and
          testing o f technical packages especially appropriate for small farmers, and to
          develop new technology" (Rating: Substantial). PRONATTA supported the
          National System (particularly CORPOICA) and, based on the random sample
          o f subprojects reviewed by IEG, most o f the initiative sponsored were
          appropriate for small-scale farmers.
      (b) "Promoting private sector participation in agricultural research" (Rating:
          Modest). Private nonprofit agencies (producer associations and NGOs)
          participated to a lesser extent in the competitive funds model than their
          participation in the overall research system. (Also, producer association

          funding o f CORPOICA i s negligible.) Private for profit institutions barely
          participated at all in the subproject competitions-and their support o f the
          total package o f agricultural research funding is, by all accounts, insignificant.
      (c) "Improving the quality and efficiency o f agricultural research by introducing a
          demand-driven, competitive selection system that would co-finance projects
          with universities and private and public sector entities" (Rating: Substantial).
          The competitive grants scheme was well designed, placing a premium on rigor
          and transparency in the selection o f subprojects. IEG's poll o f knowledgeable
          informants (which included a large number o f researchers) found that a
          majority considered research quality under the demand-driven model to be
          sound. There was substantial co-funding o f research subprojects by NGOs and
          beneficiaries (Table 4). Co-payments (by implementing agencies) somewhat
          exceeded the 50 percent level specified at appraisal.
      (d) "Support decentralization o f agricultural research and extension activities by
          strengthening regional centers, training agricultural extensionists, and
          disseminating information" (Rating: Modest). The regional capacity building
          and information system components were cut back (and project-specific
          regional institutions were dismantled at project end). The project trained
          several local extension professionals.
      (e) "Revitalizing underusedassets, both physical and human, that presently exist
          within Colombia's research services system" (Rating: Substantial).
          PRONATTA provided a boost to CORPOICA (which won more subproject
          contests than any other entity), helping to ensure that i t s staff and
          infrastructure were more fully used than they might otherwise have been.

3 1.    Weighing up these ratings, the project's progress toward its objectives
(efficacy) i s rated as substantial.

32.    H o w highly did PRONATTA itself rate the subprojects? The project
management unit developed a validated self-assessment system where each
subproject was rated on five dimensions by the implementing agency at project
completion; based on information in the completion report the coordinating unit could
endorse the proposed score or propose an alternative (Table 5).

completion report.

33.       Table 5 shows that:

          There were gaps in the self-assessment: 44 percent o f the sampled subprojects
          were not rated.
                                            118


         CORPOICA subprojects were more likely to have been self-assessed: they
         accounted for 37 percent o f all subprojects in the sample; and 29 percent o f
         those not rated.
         CORPOICA subprojects were more likely to be highly rated: they accounted
         for 37 percent o f all subprojects in the sample; and 43 percent o f those that
         were highly rated.

Efficiency
34.     No rate o f return was estimated at appraisal. T h i s was a demand-drivenproject,
making it impossible to determine ex ante what subprojects would be financed. A 2004
`impact evaluation' estimated the economic returns to PRONATTA based on a random
 17 percent sample o f subprojects (N=l06), stratified by region and by type o f
subproject.' The sample covered two phases o f project implementation, comprising 50
subprojects completed on or before January 3 1,2001 and 56 projects completed after
that date. The mean economic rate o f return was 88 percent. This estimate (which was
endorsed by the ICR) compares favorably with an earlier estimate o f returns for the
overall research and extension system in Colombia-50 percent for research and 21
percent for extension.2 The rate o f return was higher for applied research than (in
descending order) for adaptive research and training (Table 6).

35.    There are some problems with the 2004 study. The information on the
subprojects was obtained not from farm-level surveys o f subprojects but from `expert
estimates', based on the parameters o f `typical' subprojects. This was not an
independent evaluation: the experts comprised persons with "direct experience o f
PRONATTA, including subproject implementing agencies, beneficiaries, and

selection panel members".' Such persons may have had a vested interest in putting a
positive gloss on subproject outcomes. A further weakness i s that the project
coordinating unit took no steps to conduct a performance audit o f a random sample o f
subprojects, i t s work primarily being limited to administering disbursements.*

36.      There are various efficiency concerns. First, there is the question o f whether
the projects were too small and too diffuse to have critical mass. According to the
appraisal report, subprojects should not run for more than three years and their cost
should not exceed US$50,000 per year.3 Assuming a ceiling cost o f US$l5O,OOO per
subproject, the actual mean cost per subproject was well below this threshold:
US$58,914, based on the universe; US$95,771 based on IEG's random sample o f
subprojects (Table 7). Second, the accounting o f subproject costs was problematic
because a large part o f the co-payment was rendered in kind not in cash. The cash
proportion o f co-payments by implementing agencies averaged 11 percent and had
fallen as l o w as 3 percent by 2008.4 Third, selection o f subprojects took little account
o f business plans and capacity for self-financing, and PRONATTA made no
provision for operation and maintenance costs-making it more likely that
subprojects would disappear once project funds dried up. The inability o f IEG to find
field evidence o f randomly sampled (non-CORPOICA) subprojects (see Section 6)
suggests that many have indeed disappeared.

37.      Based on these considerations, IEG rates efficiency as modest.

Project Development Outcome

development outcome as moderately satisfactory (Table 8).

Risk to Development Outcome
39.     PRONATTA made the case for the competitive fund model. According to the
ICR, PRONATTA has had a lasting effect on other institutions. COLCIENCIAS has
developed several competitive science and technology funds, five o f which are
relevant to agricultural research.' But there was no provision for subproject
sustainability (Box 2). While PRONATTA has developed a viable competitive funds
model, there i s little or no incorporation o f project results in the sector policymaking
process and there i s no provision for subprojects to become self-financing, meaning
that they will surely disappear once PRONATTA funds are used upq2            There was
limited scope for consolidating lessons learned; or strengthening existing institutions.
Only 36 percent o f subprojects received feedback or learned lessons from other
 subproject^.^ The (weak) decentralized extension u n i t s (UMATAs) had little
interaction with PRONATTA.4

40.     The failure to make explicit attempts to promote transfer o f the technologies
developed by PRONATTA has been identified as one o f the project's chief
weaknesses; along with the limited ownership o f PRONATTA by the broader sector
policymaking p r o c e ~ s .In interviews with IEG, staff from various CORPOICA
                             ~
research stations acknowledged that there were no data on the level o f adoption o f
technologies promoted by PRONATTA subprojects; and no budgetary provision for
subproject follow up. One researcher noted that, for bureaucratic reasons, subproject
completion reports were sometimes submitted before the results were in. Someone
else observed that with respect to an adaptive research subproject designed to
promote more effective techniques for reducing tick infestation o f livestock, the

producers abandoned the new techniques as soon as the subproject ended because
"there was no back up in the form o f a continuing service o f technical assistance".'

Box 2. The Competitive Funding Model for Agricultural Research in Colombia:
A Critical View from COLCIENCIAS
The Colombian Institute for Science and Technology Development (COLCIENCIAS) has its own
agricultural science program and its own experience with implementing a competitive fund model. The
leadership of COLCIENCIAS i s therefore well-placed to offer an informed perspective on the Ministry
of Agriculture's experience with competitive funds, beginning with PRONATTA and continuing with
PTA. (COLCIENCIAS was represented on the committees charged with oversight of both
PRONATTA and PTA.)
COLCIENCIAS staff interviaved by IEG expressed the view that the competitive fund model i s
superior to the previous arrangements where research funds were directly assigned by government.
This previous model lacked transparency and rigor and sometimes promoted research that was not
relevant to producers and consumers. The competitive finding model has improved over time. As it
has moved away from funding o f diffuse subprojects to those linked to production chains, there i s
more uptake o f findings by producer associations.
But the model has a number of limitations. First, in the case o f PRONATTAPTA specifically, the
available funds cover the investment costs of subprojects, but neglect operation and maintenance costs and
do not include value added tax, factors that reduce the pool o f service providers able or willing to compete,
even serving as a disincentive to CORPOICA participation. [The Ministry o f Agriculture responded that,
under PTA, 10 percent o f the financing providedby the Ministry to subprojects can be used for operation
and maintenance; it also noted that public universities, at least, do not pay value added tax].
Second, the competitive model neglects basic research and tends to overlook cross-cutting themes relevant
to a wide range o f subprojects. Adaptive research subprojects might, for example, derive fertilization
techniques from old U S textbooks while neglecting fundamental issues o f soil chemistry specific to
Colombia; the soil constraints are common to many subprojects but learning i s often not shared between
them. In general, producer associations are not interested in helpingto fund basic research with a long-term
payoff, limiting their attention to immediate problems (e.g. white fly infestation).
Third, a random sample of the subprojects that receive financing needs to be audited, providing a
check against inappropriateuse o f funds. The cost of these audits i s typically not built into the funding
model. Fourth, the norms applied to competitive funds in Colombia stipulate that there be a mandatory
evaluation of impact; but this i s not always carried out. [PRONATTAPTA has not been subject to
rigorous impact evaluation; CORPOICA staff told IEG that there are "never any funds for impact
evaluation"]. COLCIENCIAS establishes norms in this respect but does not have regulatory powers.

41.     IEG drew up a random sample o f subprojects to visit. None o f the subprojects
involving implementing agencies other than CORPOICA could be traced. Based on the
contact addresses and phone numbers given when the subproject was approved an
attempt was made to locate persons associated with the subproject. These persons either
could not be found; or they reported that the subproject was no longer operating. Also,
the internet database set up to facilitate the search for agricultural research innovations
(Agricultural Technology Information System or SITA) has been shut down. These
findings suggest that although the project was successful in terms o f the process for
producing research, and in terms o f the number o f subprojects delivered, i t s long-term

impact was probably less than intended. Results were somewhat diffuse. Nevertheless,
significant learning was accomplished in the course o f PRONATTA implementation.
This led to improvements to the design o f the follow-on project, PTA. The impact o f
P T A i s likely to be less diffuse than PRONATTA because the project targets selected
production (or "value") chains. The Ministry o f Agriculture i s emphasizing the chains
most likely to be affected by the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, aiming
to enhance Colombia's competitiveness. This focused approach i s less risky than the
previous, scattershot method. Under P T A an attempt has been made to be more
strategic in selecting subprojects, taking into account the recommendations from a
series o f commodity-specific issues papers ("Agendas") that are keyed to the value
chains. Although there has been some delay in the preparation o f the Agendas, IEG
found the general approach to be sound.

42.      There are other factors which increase the prospects for sustainability o f the
competitive fund model. First, the broader trend toward decentralization that has been
evident for several years in Colombia is consistent with the general terms o f the
model. Second, the public research apparatus o f CORPOICA has the installed
capacity to be a strong contender in future funding rounds and by participating it will
tend to pull up the level o f competition. Building on experience under PRONATTA,
CORPOICA has developed an internal competitive system for research funding,
which amounts to a pre-qualification o f bids submitted in the subproject funding
rounds. Third, the follow-on project has introduced an improved model for co-
financing by the producer associations. These associations are well placed to
contribute to technology transfer (helping to make up for the deficiencies in the
UMATA extension system). Broader engagement with the producer associations will
help to strengthen private sector development, increasing the competitiveness o f
Colombian agriculture. Fourth, the follow-on project has been implemented in close
coordination with the Ministry o f Agriculture (facilitated by locating the project
management unit in the Ministry). Last but not least, government funding for
agriculture has increased significantly in the past couple o f years, partly driven by
the government's commitment to enhance rural security-through the Agro-Ingreso
Seguro program. The Ministry o f Agriculture has allocated at least double the amount
o f resources that the Bank has assigned through the follow-up project, a significant
measure o f its commitment to the competitive fund model. In short despite concerns
about the sustainability o f results generated by individual subprojects financed under
PRONATTA, IEG finds that in the light o f progress since that loan closed the
appropriate rating for Risk to Development Outcome i s moderate.

Monitoring & Evaluation
43.      IEG sought to evaluate how far the self-assessment process had matured by
the end o f the project. From i t s initial sample o f 94 subprojects, IEG randomly
selected 11 o f the 24 subprojects evaluated by PRONATTA in 2003-2004. Table 9
summarizes salient information from the completion reports o f these 11 subprojects.
The number o f adopters averaged 28 percent o f the population served (with two out
o f the eleven subprojects recording neither persons served nor adopters). There i s no
correlation between the overall rating assigned to the subproject by the PRONATTA
self-assessment or the level o f adoption. The logic o f the rating system i s hard to
                                                  123


fathom because some projects with no or l o w adoption are rated relatively high. (This
may cast doubt on the soundness o f the overall reckoning that 94 percent o f
completed subprojects had performed satisfactorily.)' Eight out o f the 11 subprojects
that fell in the sample were implemented by CORPOICA, higher than that agency's
overall share o f subproject implementation (35 percent).

44.    There i s l i t t l e evidence that the present staff coordinating PTA has built on
evaluation lessons learned from PRONATTA. (Staff responsible for M&E
arrangements under the follow-on project told IEG that they had not examined the
PRONATTA model.) Although a coordinating unit for the two projects has existed in
the Ministry o f Agriculture since 1995 it i s not apparent that there has been any
cumulative development o f evaluation capacity. While the management information
system allows for effective tracking o f subproject disbursements, no systematic
approach has been designed for capturing impacts.

45.     There was no rigorous independent impact evaluation o f PRONATTA and,
despite repeated Bank requests, little progress toward conducting such an evaluation
for PTA.2 Following a P T A supervision mission in September 2008 the Bank
reported, "None o f the members o f P T A [Le., the coordinating unit] has had
experience in conducting impact evaluations, or has received relevant academic
training, or has had close contact with persons or institutions that have realized
impact evaluations., .PTA needs to identify ways to acquire this e~pertise".~   The

neglect o f impact evaluation i s also evident at CORPOICA. In a videoconference
with CORPOICA research stations, IEG asked h o w many stations had conducted
impact evaluations: five out o f eight responded that they had no experience o f
rigorously evaluating the effect o f the technologies they developed. Lack o f budget
and an outlook characterized by `short-termism'-these are the reasons given for
neglecting impact evaluation.

46.     IEG rates monitoring and evaluation as modest.

                    (RATING:        SATISFACTORY)

47.     The design o f PRONATTA was fully consistent with government and Bank
strategy for Colombia and was also in accord with thinking on good practice for
agricultural research projects. Problems associated with the weakness o f the
municipal extension agencies (UMATA) were not the responsibility o f those who
designed the project. The Executive Council was a sound way to ensure
representation o f key government constituencies in project oversight.

SUPERVISION     (RATING:       SATISFACTORY)

48.     Field visits by the Bank in Colombia were seriously constrained by the
security situation. Between approval o f the project in April 1995 and February 1997
there was only one supervision mission (involving just the task team leader).' This
was a critical period because three o f the six subproject contests were completed by
the end o f 1996. But after that supervision shifted to the regular two missions per year
cycle, and was well staffed with 3-5 persons taking part in each mission. The Bank's
project team had a close and productive dialogue with the Ministry o f Agriculture
throughout the implementation and together with it played an important role in
advocating for the project following the 1999 earthquake when there were demands in
some government quarters to use a larger share o f project funds for disaster relief.

49.     The overall rating o f Bank Performance i s satisfactory.

GOVERNMENT
        (RATING:               SATISFACTORY)

50.    The government gave i t s full support to the preparation and implementation
process, and counterpart funding was generally in line with appraisal expectations,
although the Ministry o f Finance was sometimes late in releasing the budget. The
Ministry o f Agriculture and the National Department o f Planning remained closely
engaged with the project throughout the period o f preparation and implementation
and have continued to show a high level o f commitment.

IMPLEMENTING
     AGENCY(RATING:SATISFACTORY)

5 1.     The project coordinating unit was well staffed and, for the most part, managed
the process for selecting subprojects and supervising disbursements expeditiously.
The ICR notes that the coordinating unit was implicated in the delay in implementing
the 2000 cohort, resulting in a summary winding up o f 94 subprojects in order to meet
the three-year deadline specified by the project design.' More attention could have
been given to tracking subproject outcomes (rather than the narrow focus on financial
performance) but, once again, IEG acknowledges that the security situation in
Colombia reduced the scope for field visits. Following the 1999 earthquake the
PRONATTA were effective in advocating for the project, which reduced the volume
o f project resources diverted to disaster relief.

Annex 7: Brazil
Agricultural Technology Development Project

Summary
This report assesses the performance o f the Brazil Agricultural Technology Development
Project (PRODETAB). The project was supported by an IBRD loan (No. 4169-BR) o f
US$60.0 million, which was approved on M a y 22, 1997. The loan disbursed fully and,
after two extensions, closed o n December 3 1,2005, three years behind schedule.

The project's development objective was to increase the efficiency and sustainability o f
resource use in the Brazilian National Agricultural Research System (SNPA) by: (a)
stimulating the transition in the SNPA from i t s current heavy reliance on public sector
research carried out by the national organization Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa
Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA) to a more integrated and diversified system o f Agricultural
Research Technology Development and Transfer led by EMBRAPA; (b) increasing the
role o f clients in the definition o f research and technology transfer priorities and
implementation; (c) refocusing public sector research on quintessential public goods; and
(d) helping E M B R A P A to reorient i t s current structure to address issues o f
decentralization and diversification o f the SNPA.

The project comprised: (a) a Competitive Grants component (planned cost, US$72.0
million; actual cost US$54.1 million) financed agricultural research subprojects, based on
the rigorous evaluation o f proposals from a variety o f providers, including universities
and agencies in the individual Brazilian states as well as EMBRAPA; (b) an Institutional
Strengthening component (planned cost, US$44.7 million; actual cost US$63.6 million)
financed the upgrade o f infrastructure at EMBRAPA's various centers and the state
research centers, as well as funding training o f E M B R A P A staff and the development o f
l i n k s between E M B R A P A and the international agricultural research system and research
institutions in the USA and European Union; and (c) an Administration, Monitoring and
Evaluation component (planned cost, US$3.3 million; actual cost, US$1.O million).

IEG rates Outcome as satisfactory. The objectives and the design o f the project were
substantially relevant, addressing important issues on the agricultural research agenda
(including development o f family farms and poorer regions) and building on
EMBRAPA's solid foundations and research tradition. The project exceeded i t s targets in
terms o f the number o f subprojects generated and the investments in institutional
strengthening-even if there was limited progress on diversification o f research
providers. The project made an efficient use o f resources: output targets were exceeded
and actual total project costs were slightly less than expected at appraisal (even though
the project closed three years behind schedule). The money used to strengthen
EMBRAPA had a clear positive impact on the agency's institutional capacity and
undoubtedly benefited the national research effort. Even though the absence o f follow-up
on PRODETAB subprojects makes it impossible to assess the rate o f adoption o f
technologies and the ultimate impact on incomes and employment, based on an analysis
                                              130


o f risks and assumptions in the results chain, there are plausible grounds to assume that
the outputs delivered by the project had a positive farm-level impact.

The Risk to Development Outcome i s rated moderate. Based on the proportional weight
o f the project components, PRODETAB's primary focus was on strengthening the public
sector research system. The project helped strengthen EMBRAPA's staff and
infrastructure, as well as building up the state research agencies and other research
providers. These achievements have been sustained since the loan closed, making for an
overall strengthening o f Brazil's capacity to continue as a major player in the
international agricultural research field.

IEG rates Bank Performance as satisfactory. Quality at entry and supervision were
generally sound and the Bank provided first-rate technical support throughout the design
and implementation phases. More attention could have been paid, however, to developing
an outcome-oriented system o f monitoring for the competitively-funded subprojects that
lent themselves to this approach, as envisaged at appraisal. Borrower Performance i s also
rated satisfactory. The government showed a sustained commitment during preparation and
implementation; and EMBRAPA's administration o f the project was sound.

The Lessons learned from this project are discussed in the main report which draws on
IEG' s findings about the performance o f competitive grant schemes for agricultural
research and extension in four Latin American countries (Brazil, Colombia, Peru and
Nicaragua). Taking the four countries as a whole, with the exception o f Peru, there i s a
lack o f hard evidence about the ultimate impact o f the investments made-the extent to
which farmers adopted new technologies developed through research and extension
subprojects, and the related change in productivity and incomes.

The assessment also concludes that the principle o f competition between alternative
service providers breaks down where the range o f providers i s limited (a problem at the
municipal level and for small countries) and many o f the potential providers lack the
skills needed to prepare viable sub-project proposals. The model is more likely to
strengthen the strongest players in the field than it i s to reduce the disparities between the
strong and the weak. Summing up, the competitive fund approach i s a useful adjunct to
the broader public sector apparatus for agricultural research and technology transfer; it i s
not a substitute.

Background
1.     Brazil accounts for about one-half o f total agricultural research expenditures in
Latin America, dwarfing the three other countries in this IEG evaluation. In 1996, when
PRODETAB, the Brazil project that i s the focus o f this assessment, was formulated, total
spending on agricultural research was 8.5 times higher in Brazil than in Colombia, the
next best-equipped country o f the four under consideration. Brazil had almost five times
as many agricultural researchers as Colombia, and research spending was equivalent to
1.7 percent o f agricultural GDP in Brazil compared to 0.5 percent in Colombia.2

2.      Agricultural research in Brazil i s dominated by the Brazilian Agricultural
Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), created in 1973, This public corporation i s a semi-
autonomous agency that falls under the jurisdiction o f the Ministry o f Agriculture and (in
2000) derived 94 percent o f i t s funding from government source^.^ In 1996, EMBRAPA
accounted for 59 percent o f total spending on agricultural research and employed 44
percent o f all full-time equivalent agricultural research staff (Table 1). The next largest
player was the agricultural research system o f the individual states. B y comparison, the
participation o f private (for profit) entities was negligible.

EMBRAPA, which was part o f a broader process o f fiscal retrenchment.' The monetary
values in Figure 1 include the proceeds o f loans such as PRODETAB. These loans were
not large enough to offset the government cutbacks; but they nevertheless softened the
blow-helping EMBRAPA to keep up i t s staff training program, for example. (Annual
disbursals from the World Bank component o f PRODETAB averaged US$12 million
over the five years o f the project, just 2 percent o f EMBRAPA'S annual budget and
around 1 percent o f Brazil's total agricultural research spending.)

Box 1. IEG Approach
During the December 2008 mission to Brazil, IEG interviewed the principal agencies involved i the   n
project (EMBRAPA and the state research institutes). IEG traveled to Brasilia, Fortaleza, Recife and
Florianopolis, visiting research stations and field sites in each of these regions. A preliminary list o f sites to
visit was proposed by IEG and EMBRAPA arranged visits to a subset o f the projects on that list, selection
based on time and logistical considerations. In addition to these site visits, IEG drew a random sample o f
the projects sponsored by PRODETAB, focusing on Family Agriculture* and Natural Resources, the two
main areas o f research. EMBRAPA supplied documentation on each of these projects from its archive,
together with a number o f related studies. In addition, IEG polled groups familiar with the project (staff at
EMBRAPA and the state research institutes and other service providers) to determine how positively they
rated the various aspects o f the competitive fhnd model. The poll items were the same for each o f the four
                                      n
Latin American countries included i this IEG assessment and the results are presented in the overview
report, which compares findings across the four countries and derives lessons.
*"Family Agriculture" refers to small-scale farms, loosely defined-whether poor or less poor. "The number of family
farms in Brazil i s estimated at 4.3 million, 53 percent o f which are located in the Northeast [a poor region], 21 percent
in the South [a less-poor region]" (World Bank, 1997, p. 23)

Objectives and Components
4.      The Project Appraisal Document contains the following statement o f development
objectives:

          "The project seeks to increase efficiency and sustainability o f resource use in the
          Brazilian National Agricultural Research System (SNPA) by: (a) stimulating the
          transition in the SNPA from i t s current heavy reliance o n public sector research
          carried out by the national organization Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa
          Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA) to a more integrated and diversified system o f
          Agricultural Research Technology Development and Transfer (ARTDT) led by
          EMBRAPA; (b) increasing the role o f clients in the definition o f research and
          technology transfer priorities and implementation; (c) refocusing public sector
          research on quintessential public goods; and (d) helping E M B R A P A to reorient
          i t s current structure to address issues o f decentralization and diversification o f the
          SNPA".'

6.      Selection o f subprojects under the competitive grants system was keyed to five
priority areas, consistent with "the objectives o f poverty alleviation and environmental
sustainability as well as increased productivity and efficiency through access to advanced
technologies and increased role for the private sector": (a) family farms; (b) advanced
technologies; (c) natural resource management; (d) agribusiness; and (e) strategic studies.2

7.     Grants o f up to U S $ l 0,000 were available to help bidders prepare proposals-but
award o f a preparation grant did not guarantee that a proposal would be approved. Grants
for approved projects were either classed as small (US$25,00O-US$40,000) or large

(US$40,000-US$500,000), the latter reserved for projects with longer gestation lags and a
multi-disciplinary focus. Each project was expected to involve from two to five
subprojects and at least two institutions, each o f which was to execute at least one
subproject. The shares o f project costs financed by participants were: 10 percent (public
agencies other than EMBRAPA), 15 percent (EMBRAPA) and between 20 and 50
percent (private firms, based on their size and financial viability).

      INSTITUTIONAL
PROJECT     FRAMEWORK

8.       Project implementation arrangements were-at the outset at least-designed to
provide a counterweight to EMBRAPA. The National Advisory Council (NAC) was
taken out o f E M B R A P A and given broader responsibilities for the National Agricultural
Research System (SNPA), led by the Ministry o f Agriculture. A sub-council o f this body,
chaired by the President o f EMBRAPA, was created to provide oversight o f
PRODETAB. The transformed N A C was intended to represent both the potential
beneficiaries and funders o f agricultural research and technology transfer (small and large
farmers, agribusiness, environmental, consumer and international trade interests) and the
potential suppliers o f research including outstanding scientists, representatives o f
universities and state research and extension systems. An Executive Council (EC),
chaired by EMBRAPA, and assisted by a PRODETAB secretariat was responsible for
approving the financing o f subprojects submitted to it by sub-committees for each of the
five priority research areas. The E C had 9 members, 5 from EMBRAPA. The E C and i t s
supporting apparatus was the Bank's primary interlocutor for the project-meaning that,
for all intents and purposes, E M B R A P A was the prime mover behind project
implementation, although N A C retained formal veto power. (As it turned out, N A C never
had any weight-it was too difficult to convene the members in a timely fashion; there
was no real counterweight to EMBRAPA).*

.Relevance

relation to country priorities and Bank country and sector strategies; and the suitability o f
project design for achieving project objectives.

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

The Brazilian government has assigned a high priority to agricultural research, treating it
as a key element o f sector de~elopment.~  Thus, in general terms, PRODETAB was
relevant to the development priorities established by Brazil. The specific objectives o f
PRODETAB were also consistent with EMBRAPA's strategy for 1995- 1998, which
included a call for "closer collaboration with other institutions in the national agricultural
research system", "promotion o f private sector resource mobilization so that E M B R A P A

can focus on more strategic, long-term and interdisciplinary research" and stronger
downstream linkages with farmer's organizations, and state research and extension
services".' The overarching goal o f PRODETAB was to increase the efficiency o f the
national agricultural research system; empowering weaker players in the research arena
and encouraging competition between them was a plausible way to achieve this. In
particular, the appraisal document singled out the need to give a bigger role to the private
sector (the extent o f whose involvement in research was not well mapped), to bolster the
weak state research systems, and to draw more fully on the universities (which contained
as many agricultural researchers as the combined federal and state government systems).

10.     A report produced by the Bank after the mid-term o f PRODETAB implementation
gives a clear sense o f the trajectory that the project's framers had in mind for agricultural
research in Brazil. First, spending on agricultural research would rise as a proportion o f
agricultural GDP, mirroring the trend in developed countries. Second, the share o f public
spending in total spending on agricultural research would fall, while private spending
would rise. Third, public research spending would be increasingly limited to quintessential
public goods (that is, long-term research generating benefits that are not easily appropriated
by the private sector, such as reduced soil erosion). Fourth, universities would capture an
increasing share o f public research spending, the share o f government agencies shrinking
correspondingly. Fifth, local and state research and technology transfer systems would
assume a bigger role, focusing on applied and adaptive research, while central government
agencies would play a smaller role, geared to addressing strategic research needs2

11.      Each o f the five trends envisaged bears on the institutional framework for
technology development, rather than the higher goal o f raising agricultural productivity.
This was perhaps a pragmatic accommodation, a reluctance to promise too much in terms
o f end results when the basis was a series o f small, short-term projects. The statement o f
objectives in the Loan Agreement does, however, single out the need to ensure that
agricultural research addressed issues o f "competitiveness, environmental sustainability
and poverty alle~iation".~

 12.    But there was a hint o f equivocation in the way that the project objectives were
framed. E M B R A P A was scheduled to play a more circumscribed role in a diversified
system; and yet retain leadership o f the system. The first objective cited in the project
appraisal document refers to: "(i)    stimulating the transition in the National Agricultural
Research System (SNPA) from i t s current heavy reliance on public sector research
carried out by.. .EMBRAPA to a more integrated and diversified system.. .led by
EMBRAPA". At one level this could mean that that the state (through EMBRAPA)
would continue to provide the financing but would leave much o f the responsibility for
conducting research to other agencies. At another level the message could be read as
"diversification i s fine provided i t does not compromise EMBRAPA's preeminent role in
the system". It i s striking that the statement o f objectives in Project Appraisal Document

makes EMBRAPA's leadership role explicit; but the project objective statement in the
Loan Agreement makes no reference to EMBRAPA.

13.     IEG gives priority to what is common to, and explicit within, the project objective
statements in both the appraisal document and the Loan Agreement: the striving to create a
more diversified and better integrated research system. This, rather than the strengthening
o f EMBRAPA, was the project's primary purpose. Indeed, the appraisal documents notes
that while previous agricultural research projects in Brazil had concentrated their support
on EMBRAPA, and while "partnerships and competition with other public and private
agricultural R&D institutions were limited", PRODETAB was intended to be qualitatively
different.' Improved diversification and integration o f the research system remains today a
                                                                                and
priority for government and for the country partnership strategy o f the BankY2 for this
reason the relevance o f project objectives is rated substantial.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

 14.    In terms o f institutional strengthening, the project had a solid foundation on which
to build, simplifying design challenges. First, with the assistance o f the World Bank and
the Inter-American Development Bank dating back to the 1970s, E M B R A P A had not
only built but also managed to maintain excellent research facilities and a well-trained
research staff (43 percent with PhDs). Second, Brazilian agricultural scientists had
experience in preparing high-quality research proposals and competing. Third,
E M B R A P A could take account o f lessons learned from previous Brazilian competitive
research schemes in areas o f science and technology outside a g r i ~ u l t u r e . ~

 15.    Above all, PRODETAB made sense for EMBRAPA. The introduction o f a
competitive grant scheme gave E M B R A P A greater funding flexibility and the
opportunity to build new partnerships. The new Brazilian Constitution o f 1998 limited
the allocation o f federal resources to states, and these cuts disrupted the partnerships that
EMBRAPA had previously created with state research centers through the medium of its
leadership on the National Agricultural Research Systema4      PRODETAB offered a way
round this impasse.

16.   The biggest design challenge was h o w to draw on EMBRAPA's strengths without
crowding out the other players in the national research system. The design o f the project

2. According to the 2008-201 1 Country Partnership Strategy, "The partnership o f E M B R A P A and the
private sector has been successful in developing high-yielding, regionally adapted, and conservation-
focused technologies for Brazil's tropical agriculture. EMBRAPA, the private sector, state extension
agencies and NGOs need to step up these public-private partnerships to mainstream these and future b y
developing innovative organizational and fmancial mechanisms.. . The Bank would also continue i t s
historically strong relationship with EMBRAPA, with the goal o f promoting public-private partnerships for
the formation o f productive market chains and for development o f technologies for adaptation o f
agriculture to climate change", World Bank (2008), Annex, pp 29-3 1.

ultimately consolidated EMBRAPA's preeminence. Although the designers o f the project
took the National Advisory Committee out o f EMBRAPA, N A C proved to be a dead
letter. O n the other hand, E M B R A P A was better placed than any other agency to manage
the project. The Bank argued that: "The placement o f PRODETAB within EMBRAPA,
which has a well-established infrastructure, while it was originally controversial among
non-EMBRAPA scientists, has enabled the development o f a credible competitive grants
program that has processes and standards in place equivalent to those o f other major
competitive grants programs such as the US".1

17.     A major issue was how to redress the institutional disparities between Brazil's
regions (the variation in their capacity to conduct agricultural research), thus enabling
full, countrywide participation in competitive funding schemes. The south and south-west
regions o f Brazil were more competitive than the north and north-east. This held true
both for research programs within EMBRAPA and outside it. When PRODETAB was
prepared, nearly two-thirds o f E M B R A P A researchers were concentrated in the south and
south-west. Regional differences among the state research systems and universities were
even sharper. In some states, research and extension systems were absent altogether, and
in others the size o f the research establishment was a small fraction o f those in the larger
states. At the preparation phase, even in relatively well-funded states (e.g., Sa0 Paulo and
Minas Gerais), state funding had been unstable and declining and state governments had
not made capital investments in research for several yearsq2

18.      In principle at least, PRODETAB was intended to help tackle these disparities.
N A C and E C would use the information provided by the monitoring system to identify
areas in which the number and quality o f subproject proposals were insufficient relative
to the target allocations so that more resources could be allocated to weaker institutions
and more challenged r e g i o n ~ . ~

19.      The main constraint on project success lay in the absence o f sound and stable
institutions for transmitting new technologies to farmers. The federal service o f agricultural
                                                          ~~
extension had been largely dismantled in the 1 9 9 0 leaving the initiative to agencies in the
individual states. The extent and quality o f coverage varied significantly between regions.
This was less o f a constraint for better o f f farmers, many o f whom were sufficiently
educated to be able to search for the information they need (increasingly, over the Internet).
But small-scale farmers were l e f t out. A representative survey o f rural families in 1996-
 1997 found that only 2 percent o f farmers with less than 10 ha received technical
assistance, compared to 8 percent for medium-scale farmers (10-50 ha), and 3 1 percent for
large-scale farmers (over 50 ha).4 The authors o f a Bank study that analyzed these data
concluded: "One factor that seems to benefit farmers more or less equally across land sizes
i s technical assistance, which has a relatively large impact on revenues; having access to it

                                             140


increases farm revenues by between 7 percent and 11 percent. Policies that increased
access to technical assistance would benefit poor and non-poor farmers alike".'

20.     The design o f PRODETAB did not address this gap in technology transfer, a gap
that was particularly likely to limit the project's impact on small farmers. O n the other
hand, it would be unreasonable to argue that the project should have taken on the
reintroduction o f a national extension system: because there was no political will for this;
because it i s by no means clear that extension along the traditional lines i s the best answer
nowadays to technology transfer; and because it would have made the project unwieldy.

2 1.    On balance, there are three important reservations about design. First, without
reinventing the extension system, IEG finds that project design could have made space
for more reflection on the issue o f technology transfer: i t could have funded some
analytic work on alternatives to traditional extension. Second, in view o f the lengthy
period needed for research development and transfer, and the difficulty o f attributing
ultimate changes in productivity and incomes to projects o f this nature, it was all the
more important to define very carefully what would constitute acceptable measures o f
subproject success: the project appraisal document i s silent about the sorts o f output and
outcome indicators that needed to be included in the logical framework o f the
subprojects. For these reasons, IEG rates design relevance as modest.

Efficacy
22.     Efficacy assesses to what extent the project's stated objectives were realized. This
report systematically analyzes whether the expected inputs, outputs and outcomes
actually materialized (the results chain). This provides a basis for the subsequent
discussion o f progress toward objectives. To the extent possible progress toward
objectives i s assessed against evidence bearing on intermediate and final outcomes
(defined in Table 2). Where such evidence i s lacking or insufficient, IEG considers data
on outputs, considering whether there are plausible grounds for arguing that delivery o f
those outputs has led (or i s likely to lead) to the expected outcomes.

23.     The chain o f expected inputs, outputs and outcomes (Table 3) is derived from the
PAD. According to the ICR, the project's objectives and components were not changed
during implementation and the project was not formally restructured. Therefore, the
Table 4 results chain i s a valid template for the ex-post evaluation. Each o f the next
sections begins with a presentation o f I C R material bearing on the results chain, followed
by a discussion o f the relevant IEG findings.

INPUTS

24.     Funding for competitive grants subprojects was 25 percent less than expected.
The I C R gives various reasons for this. In the first four o f the seven funding contests
(staged between 1997 and 1999), less than one-fifth o f the submitted proposals resulted in
financing, reflecting EMBRAPA's concern to set a very high standard; many submissions

                                                     142


were rejected for lack o f proper documentation.' Second, project funds went further than
expected because, although the number o f subprojects was almost double appraisal
estimates, their mean cost was lower than expected; and the depreciation o f the real
increased the buying power o f the dollars borrowed. Third, uncertainties with respect to
government funding led EMBRAPA to restrict the publicity given to bidding events and
to limit the number o f partnerships.* The investment in training and other forms o f
knowledge acquisition was 3 1 percent higher than expected while spending on goods and
equipment (e.g., laboratory facilities) was 23 percent lower than anticipated at appraisal.

OUTPUTS

25.     Over the course o f 7 bidding rounds (from January 1997 to February 2001), 139
projects (comprising 464 subprojects) were approved (Table 4). The mean cost was
US$115,000 per subproject (compared to the appraisal expectation o f 250 subprojects
costing US$288,000 each). No ex ante distribution between the priority research areas was
specified at appraisal. The ex post distribution suggests that family agriculture was
relatively squeezed, this research area accounting for one-third o f the proposals submitted
but capturing just over one-fifth o f the financing. Research areas more likely to contain
public good elements (natural resources, advanced technology and strategic studies)
accounted for two-thirds o f committed resources, which is consistent with specific
objective (c) o f the project.

26.      EMBRAPA assumed a larger role in coordinating projects and implementing
subprojects than any other institution; but universities and state research centers were also
significant players (Table 5). The 139 projects generated by PRODETAB employed 2,010
scientific staff, 46 percent from EMBRAPA, 3 1 percent from universities and 11 percent
from state research centersS3     EMBRAPA preferred partnerships with universities and

27.    The number and range o f agencies that participated in PRODETAB i s larger than
Table 5 suggests because, for each subproject, there were a number o f informal partners
involved, in addition to the entity formally identified as responsible for implementation-
including 130 private firms, which contributed with staff, equipment and, to a small extent,
cash.'

29.     With respect to the training component o f PRODETAB, targets were amply
exceeded in the case o f EMBRAPA-354 staff trained against the appraisal estimate of
64-but    for the state research centers the target was l i t t l e more than half met (65 persons
trained, compared to the 110 expected). The allocation per capita seems generous, given
that few received doctoral training abroad: the average cost per person trained was
US$48,5 12 (less admittedly than the US$80,000 or so projected at appraisal).

30.     Other output targets were exceeded. The number o f E M B R A P A decentralized

E M B R A P A non-budget revenues from the sale o f products, processes and services (17
percent compared to the target o f 15 percent). The competitively funded research that was
supported generated 604 publications (the forecast was 400). Finally, EMBRAPA's links
with advanced research institutions, including `virtual laboratories' (LABEX) in the
United States and Europe were consolidated, and the investment in satellite
communications put researchers and administrators in closer touch with each other
throughout Brazil. Overall, there was a significant strengthening o f institutional capacity,
the biggest winner being EMBRAPA.

3 1.    At appraisal the highest risk facing the project was identified as the inability o f
extension services to transfer the research results generated owing to budget cuts.' A
further concern was that the poorer regions-the North and Northeast-would be
marginalized from the competitive funding process. Indeed, at midterm, cognizant o f the
continuing gravity o f these risks, the Bank recommended that "EMBRAPA should ensure
that weaker institutions and less successful areas o f the country receive a fair share o f
technical assistance funds to strengthen their competitive position".* By project end this
had not happened. The distribution o f competitive funding resources had accentuated
rather than offset existing regional imbalances: the North and Northeast captured only
one-quarter o f the funds committed, compared to the 41 percent garnered by the
Southeast, which i s Brazil's research powerhouse (Table 6).3 Also, only 4 technical
assistance and extension agencies participated and N G O participation was lower than
expected (Table 5). O f the 2,010 technical staff involved in PRODETAB projects only 8
were described as extension ~pecialists.~  Finally, the l o w share o f funding captured by
research on family agriculture (Table 5) suggests that PRODETAB's contribution to
poverty alleviation may ultimately have been more limited than intended.

INTERMEDIATE
     OUTCOMES

32.     The I C R acknowledged that the project appraisal document "may have conveyed
the impression that the transfer o f project-generated technology was part o f project design
and that poverty reduction would be measurable in i t s lifetime", thereby raising
unrealistic expectations. Although the project did sponsor dissemination activities
(including "600 training courses in the countryside")2 this was no guarantee that
information was picked up by farmers, technologies were adopted and, as a result,
poverty was reduced. With hindsight, the I C R concluded, five years was too short an
implementation period for PRODETAB. "Much greater time i s needed.. .to evaluate
impact on the ground, including poverty effects. Expectations expressed by the mid-term
review were overly optimistic in this regard".3 W h e n IEG conducted i t s mission in 2008
there was s t i l l no clear picture o f PRODETAB-specific impact; and evidence presented
below in paragraphs 3.15-3.16 and 4.1 bears this out.

33.      Less than one-half o f the PRODETAB projects involved participation o f producers
or final beneficiaries (48 percent ~ v e r a l l ) Projects approved in later bidding rounds were
                                                   .~
less participatory (Figure 2), reflecting changes in the proportional weight o f the different
research areas. Towards the end there were more strategic research and advanced
technology projects, these lending themselves less to participation: these research projects
accounted for 3 1 percent o f approved projects but 43 percent o f the projects that did not
work with end-users. O n the other hand, family agriculture accounted for 30 percent o f
approved projects but only 24 percent o f projects not involving participation.

34.      I t could be argued that all family agriculture projects (and many o f the natural
resource management projects) should have been participatory in nature, in order to
maximize prospects for technology transfer. O n the other hand, IEG examined the final
reports for each o f the 4 1 family agriculture projects that were approved, finding that the
lack o f technology transfer was explicitly identified as a problem in only 4 cases. But
there i s no ready way to be sure if this means that there really was no problem; or
whether it signifies that technology transfer was not on the researcher's radar screen.

FINALOUTCOMES

35.     For each o f the 139 projects approved under PRODETAB there i s an aggregate
data sheet describing the main project characteristics and findings. The sheet includes a
section that compares expected with actual results. A quick scan o f the data sheets shows
that there are few quantitative data reported, and what few are reported are limited to the
results obtained column, making it impossible to assess what the targets were and
whether they were achieved.

36.      In 2003 a consultant commissioned by EMBRAPA analyzed the 25 projects that
had been completed by M a y 30 o f that year. The consultant sent a questionnaire to each
o f the project teams asking for information on results achieved. Eighteen o f the 25 teams
responded and 14 o f these reported that the project had led to an increase in productivity.*
But the aggregate data sheets for these 14 projects show that for the most part targets
were not set (Table 7).3

37.     The same consultant observed that there was often a confusion o f activities with
outcomes and a tendency to report that expected outcomes were 100 percent achieved
when the appropriate comment was that the expected activities were fully completed.
His report notes that PRODETAB management sponsored various training events to try
to improve the logical framework o f projects. But IEG compared the aggregate data
sheets for projects approved early on with those approved toward the end o f the
implementation period and found no evidence o f a tightening up in the specification o f
expected and actual outcomes.

ACHIEVEMENT PROJECT OBJECTIVES
           OF

38.       IEG rates the achievement o f the specific objectives o f the project as follows:

      (a) "Stimulate the transition in the National Agricultural Research System (SNPA)
           from i t s current heavy reliance on public sector research carried out by EMBRAPA
          to a more integrated and diversified system led by EMBRAPA" (Rating:
          Substantial). At the level o f subprojects and resources committed (Table 5)
          EMBRAPA remained the single largest player but the universities and state
          research agencies had a significant role (42 percent o f resources between them),
          which i s consistent with diversification. Private f i r m s (nonprofit and for profit)
          played a marginal role; but the project objectives did not target these agencies.
          Moreover, the extensive subcontracting arrangements allowed for a level o f
          diversification that went beyond that reflected in the l i s t o f formal coordinators and
          implementers for the various research initiatives (paragraph 26).
      (b) "Increase the role o f clients in the definition o f research and technology transfer
          priorities and implementation" (Rating: Substantial). By definition, the competitive
          fund model was more demand-driven than the system o f directly assigning research
          money and, based on responses to an IEG poll o f informed participants, the process
          appears to have been fair and transparent. A distinction needs to me made between
          responsiveness to client needs and participation: although 52 percent o f
          PRODETAB projects involved no participation o f producers or final beneficiaries
          in actual implementation (paragraph 32) this does not mean that the selection o f
          these initiatives was not client-driven; moreover, `clients' is not limited to farmers.
          The strategic research and advanced technology projects (which absorbed one-third
          o f resources) were less likely to lend themselves to participatory implementation;
          but the process for identifying these initiatives was participatory because it involved
          a range o f stakeholders, including consumer groups and industry.
      (c) "Refocus public sector research on quintessential public goods" (Rating:
          Substantial). IEG i s not able to state categorically which o f the 139 projects
          financed by PRODETAB were "quintessentially" o f a public goods nature
          because, in practice, there are few pure public goods and the line between public
          and private is debatable. But research areas more likely to contain public good
          elements (natural resources, advanced technology and strategic studies) accounted
          for two-thirds o f committed resources (Table 4).

    (d) "Help EMBRAPA reorient i t s current structure to address issues o f
        decentralization and diversification o f the SNPA" (Rating; Modest). PRODETAB
        investments strengthenedthe infrastructure and staffing o f EMBRAPA's
        decentralized units and (to a lesser extent) the individual state research agencies;
        although universities and state research agencies had an important role to play in
        PRODETAB-which speaks o f diversification-it i s not clear that the project led
        E M B R A P A to embrace the principle o f diversification as a goal; not surprisingly
        perhaps, i t s primary concern was to build up its own strength.

39.      Weighing up these ratings, the project's progress toward i t s objectives (efficacy)
i s rated as substantial. The overarching objective-"increase     efficiency and
sustainability o f resource use in the national agricultural research system"-was also
substantially achieved, as sections 4 and 6 demonstrate.

Efficiency
40.     The appraisal report includes estimates o f economic rates o f return o f between 27
percent and 146 percent for representative projects in the PRODETAB areas o f family
agriculture, natural resource management and advanced technologies. "For
methodological, data and other reasons, the I C R does not attempt to replicate that
analysis". Instead, the I C R quoted the results o f a 2006 EMBRAPA study which
analyzed the impact o f a sample o f 12 technologies.2 There are three problems with this
approach. First and foremost, none o f the twelve technologies was developed under
PRODETAB auspices; the study was conducted to fulfill one o f the preconditions for
approval o f a project that came after PRODETAB (Agrofuturo, financed by the Inter-
American Development Bank). Second, all 12 technologies were generated by
EMBRAPA. Even if PRODETAB examples were included, this would not be a sufficient
means to evaluate a project that was intended, ex ante, to sponsor diversification o f
research provision; and which, ex post included a significant participation by universities
and state research institutes. Third, it i s not clear o n what basis the sample was drawn; it
does not appear to be random because each o f the 12 projects was generated by a
different decentralized unit o f EMBRAPA, suggesting that the selection was intended to
showcase the diversity o f EMBRAPA's work rather to make a statistically rigorous
evaluation o f the efficiency o f EMBRAPA's use o f resources.

4 1.       Each year since 1997 EMBRAPA has published a `Social Balance' report on the
impact o f technologies developed under its auspices. But the reports contain no explicit
mapping o f the technologies to the projects that generated them making it impossible to
use this source as a basis for evaluating PRODETAB. E M B R A P A informed IEG that the
Social Balance i s derived from `impact assessment' reports prepared by each o f the 37
decentralized units o f EMBRAPA. This impact assessment comprises a subset (`at least
3 ') o f the technologies developed by each unit, limited to technologies where sufficient
time has elapsed for adoption to be feasible. (It i s not clear if the subset i s randomly or

purposively selected; or if all projects beyond a given threshold o f elapsed time are
eligible for selection.) None o f the impact assessment reports provided to IEG by
E M B R A P A correspond to PRODETAB projects. E M B R A P A explained that this i s
because the PRODETAB technologies are "very recent" (although the first projects were
approved in 1997), so that none have so far been picked up by the assessment process.

42.       In order to understand the type o f results generated by PRODETAB, IEG studied
the completion reports o f 12 projects randomly selected from the two areas o f research with
the largest number o f projects, family agriculture and natural resources (Table 8)' The 12
completion reports give considerable detail on inputs (how grant money was spent) and
carefully catalogued `intellectual' outputs (refereed articles, book chapters, conference
presentations, pamphlets, theses, etc). The substantive results o f the research are mainly
couched in physical terms (particularly yield response and product characteristics). The
large number o f blank cells in Table 8 tells the story. In only one o f the 12 cases examined
i s there any estimation o f economic or financial return. There i s usually no ex ante
specification o f benefits, making it hard to assess how successful projects were. Also, there

                                                                                 n
 1. Not to be confused with the 12 subprojects referred to in the ICR (mentioned i an earlier paragraph o f
this IEG report).
                                                   150


i s only one case where the number o f direct beneficiaries i s given (that is, farmers or end-
users o f the technology who collaborated in i t s development).

43.      Arguably, the content o f these reports reveals what researchers have the biggest
incentive to display: evidence o f intellectual productivity (rather than end results). It
could be countered that the three-year span o f a PRODETAB project was too short to
expect significant farm-level impact. Indeed, the net benefits from some o f these projects
may be captured in a future Social Balance report. But the Social Balance leaves out non-
E M B R A P A projects and it i s not clear how representative the chosen projects are o f the
E M B R A P A universe. Moreover the Social Balance framework doesn't lend i t s e l f to an
estimate o f the efficiency o f competitive funds relative to other models o f research
financing. As the I C R conceded, "Estimation o f whether the competitive grant scheme i s
the least-cost, most efficient and sustainable option for agricultural research-as called
for in the project appraisal document-awaits formal study".'

44.       These are important shortcomings but they are not decisive for the overall rating
o f efficiency. A more important consideration i s that, overall, the project exceeded i t s
output targets and it did so within the cost envelope established at appraisal. Moreover,
54 percent o f actual project costs were devoted to institutional strengthening and the
relevant indicators are infrastructure built, people trained and research published, rather
than farm-level results. The money used to strengthen E M B R A P A had a clear positive
impact on the agency's capacity as a research leader. There is a further consideration. The
principle o f "constellated subprojects"-whereby each `project' within PRODETAB had
3-5 associated subprojects-probably increased the scope for transferring learning
between subprojects, thereby enhancing efficiency. (With respect to the four countries
covered by this IEG assessment, "constellation" was peculiar to Brazil.) IEG rates
efficiency as substantial.

Project Development Outcome
45.   Adding up the component criteria assessed above IEG rates project development
outcome as satisfactory (Table 9).

Risk to Development Outcome
46.     There are three levels o f risk to PRODETAB outcomes. First, will the positive
outcomes o f the 139 projects financed by PRODETAB be sustained? Second, will the
competitive funding model endure? Third, will the institutional strengthening o f
E M B R A P A prove resilient?

47.     The first o f these questions i s the hardest to answer. O n the one hand, PRODETAB
or no PRODETAB, EMBRAPA has made a spectacular contribution to productivity
growth-not least in developing the technology needed to open the infertile soils o f the
cerrado to export agriculture. Some o f the technologies developed under PRODETAB
may eventually have a big payoff-ven          if there i s no s i g n o f this so far. The primary
concern i s the lack o f solid evidence for evaluating just how positive the PRODETAB
project outcomes were; and the gap in the results chain linking PRODETAB-supported
researchers to the end user. (The risk was foreseen at appraisal and re-emphasized at
midterm when the Bank suggested that one-year grants-additional to the original two to
three years o f project funding-might help to improve the prospects for technology
transfer.)*

48.       The completion reports for individual PRODETAB projects carefully count the
intellectual outputs and the dissemination events (open days at research stations, etc.) but
there i s next to no quantification o f the number o f beneficiaries or the level o f benefits. In a
2003 report it was observed that "various projects that have reached the end o f their
PRODETAB financing are continuing to be executed with support from other sources,
involving both diffusion o f results and new research and development activitie~".~ the   But
percentage o f projects showing this sort o f sustainability was not given in the report; and
data o f this nature had not been collected by loan closing.

49.      Second, what i s the future for the competitive funding model? To begin with, the
model predated PRODETAB and has vitality independently o f it. PRODETAB did make a
difference-it had a specific influence on the state research programs (Sa0 Paulo, Parana,
and Pernambuco) that incorporated elements o f the model. O n the other hand, Agrofuturo,
the follow-on research project financed by the Inter-American Development Bank, has
dropped any sponsorship o f the competitive model. IADB says that the loan that was
approved for this project was only one-half o f the anticipated amount, so that funds were
only sufficient to finance EMBRAPA. This suggests that commitment to the diversification
o f research provision-a key objective o f PRODETAB-is not strong.

50.    Third, partly because o f the consolidation made possible first by PRODETAB and
then by Agrofuturo, the outlook for EMBRAPA seems promising. EMBRAPA was the
prime beneficiary o f PRODETAB. The project helped EMBRAPA to weather the
downturn in federal spending o f 1998-2003, making it possible to upgrade the training o f

research staff and broadening collaboration with research institutions in Europe and the
United States. EMBRAPA is now much stronger, federal funding having picked up since
2006.

5 1.     Brazil's need for external funds should not be exaggerated: less than 5 percent o f
                                                                      *
national agricultural investments have come from external loans. With or without further
loans, E M B W A ' s position seems unassailable. The PRODETAB-sponsored National
Advisory Committee that was supposed to reduce EMBRAPA's role in setting research
priorities carried no weight; and there is no other agency that comes close to matching
EMBRAPA for resources.

52.     Based on the proportional weight o f the project components, PRODETAB's
primary focus was on strengthening the public sector research system. The project helped
strengthen EMBRAPA's staff and infrastructure, as well as building up the state research
agencies and other research providers. These achievements have been sustained since the
loan closed, making for an overall strengthening o f Brazil's capacity to continue as a major
player in the international agricultural research field. Therefore, IEG rates risk to
development outcome as moderate.

Monitoring and Evaluation
DESIGN

 53.     When the project was designed, the aim was "to bring the existing M&E system
 [Le., EMBRAPA's system] up to the standards o f the U.S. National Science Foundation
 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development".2 Yet the appraisal
 document contains no detailed provision for M&E. It notes that "EMBRAPA already has a
well-developed information management system. However, a similar system will have to
be developed for the project-financed activities in the National Agricultural Research
                         .~
 System as a ~ h o l e " Although there is an annex on "key quantitative indicators" these are
 all output-based (number o f contracts signed, number o f publications, number o f staff
trained, etc). There i s no provision made for measuring the level o f adoption o f
PRODETAB-generated technologies by farmers; or the impact on incomes and
employment. In Annex 2 o f the appraisal document the completion o f an M&E design
satisfactory to the Bank i s listed as a condition o f project effectiveness; but at the front o f
the document, the section on "Effectiveness Conditions" makes no reference to this.4

54.     According to the .ICR, the monitoring and evaluation system sponsored by
PRODETAB was intended "to test the hypothesis that the competitive grant system was the
least-cost and most-efficient option for carrying out certain forms o f research and

technology transfer".' But there was no provision made to compare the costs o f
competitively funded with directly assigned research.

IMPLEMENTATION

5 5.    Actual spending on the "administration, monitoring and evaluation" component
was only US$1.O million, one-third o f the level anticipated at appraisal. This shortfall
reflects the failure to develop a comprehensive system, capable o f monitoring the
national agricultural research system as a whole (rather than just EMBRAPA) and
capturing outcomes as well as outputs (extending beyond EMBRAPA's existing, well-
established management information system).

56.      At a conference during project implementation the Bank stated that the standard
                                                                              S
o f PRODETAB monitorin actually exceeded that which prevailed in the U agricultural
                                   5
competitive grants system. But, in a separate presentation at the same event,
E M B R A P A acknowledged the lack o f good monitoring and evaluation usually applied to
competitive schemes and "tried to address this issue by organizing visits to individual
projects, with the participation o f members o f the Executive Council with other scientists
who act as project reviewers, using standardized forms for project assessment".3 This
was a sensible proposal but based on the final output-the completion reports of
individual projects, a sample o f which were reviewed by IEG-monitoring quality fell
short o f what it was reasonable to expect. Reporting focused on counting inputs and
outputs rather than outcomes, there was no comparison o f expected and actual results and
no attempt to quantify the number o f beneficiaries. This casts doubt on the claim in the
I C R that the project was "an example o f Best Practice in competitive grant system
management and monitoring in relation to similar systems in other countriesyy4.

57.      There was no substantial field-level research on adoption rates. An E M B R A P A
study on the impact o f a sample o f 12 (non-PRODETAB) technologies noted that "the
teams responsible faced difficulties based on the limited financial resources available for
field work. It some cases it was not possible to systematically verify the benefits from the
technologies based on a representative sample o f farms; instead, this was substituted by
conversations with extension workers and other local people". The same source finds a
lack o f uniformity in the methodological approach adopted by the different decentralized
units o f E M B R A P A that contributed to the study.5

USE

58.   The M&E data generated by PRODETAB were useful for day-to-day project
management and disbursement tracking. But they did not have a broader application. The

PRODETAB) have not allowed for project-level attribution o f research outcomes; and
they do not cover agencies other than EMBRAPA.

 IEG rates monitoring and evaluation as modest.

Bank Performance
QUALITY     AT       (RATING: MODERATELY
                 ENTRY               SATISFACTORY)

59.     The project was prepared rapidly, internalizing key lessons from earlier research
projects.' E M B R A P A has acknowledged the considerable value that the Bank added to
the project preparation process, by bringing to bear experience from designing
competitive grant schemes in other countriesS2

60.    In various respects, quality at entry was solid. The design o f the competitive
funding process allowed for rigorous and transparent evaluation o f research proposals,
and also provided grants for the preparation o f proposals. The clustering o f subprojects
around a unifying theme helped to ensure critical mass as well as facilitating exchange
between large numbers o f participants. The review process helped unsuccessful
applicants design better proposals for submission in the next bidding round.

6 1.    O n the other hands there were some shortfalls which, taken together, explain why
quality at entry i s rated moderately satisfactory. First, the I C R acknowledged that the
Bank underestimated h o w long it would take to embed the new procedures but stated that
a longer period for implementation was probably not negotiable when the project was
~repared.~  Second, the I C R also conceded that "the project was not designed to actually
transfer the new technology developed to poor, small-farm clients in the Northeast and
similar region^".^ Third, project objectives were framed in a way that created uncertainty
about the priority given to EMBRAPA: witness the discrepancy between the statements
in the Project Appraisal Document and the Loan Agreement (paragraph 1.5 and footnote).
Fourth, the lack o f provision for an M&E system that would span the national agricultural
research system and would capture outcomes as well as outputs was a weakness.

SUPERVISION (RATING: SATISFACTORY)

62.     Supervision intensity was adequate with 16 missions over 8 years. The I C R notes
that supervision "focused heavily on accelerating disbursements and resolving
bureaucratic and other constraints on project e x e c u t i ~ n " .The mid-term review was
                                                                   ~

supervision was acknowledged by PRODETAB counterparts interviewedby IEG. On the
other hand, the Bank appears not to have pressed as much as it might have done with
respect to the adequacy o f arrangements for monitoring the individual projects and
encouraging E M B R A P A to evaluate the long-term impacts attributable to the project.

63,      The overall rating o f Bank Performance i s satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
GOVERNMENT
         (RATINGSATISFACTORY)

64.      The government was actively involved in project preparation and showed a high
level o f commitment. The project called for major changes in EMBRAPA's way o f doing
business, pushing for greater decentralization, making the decentralized units more
autonomous and more accountable. The government backed these changes.

65.     PRODETAB was implemented at a time o f fiscal retrenchment. In order to reduce
the fiscal deficit the federal government withheld as contingencies a sizeable portion o f
the annual budget allocations o f public agencies, as well as delaying the release o f
available budget resource. This was an across-the-board cut back and the negative impact
on the pace o f PRODETAB implementation did not signal a specific lack o f government
commitment to the project-indeed, at the time, PRODETAB fared better than other
Bank-supported projects. Funding shortages were most severe from 2001 through 2003.'
By midterm Bank disbursements for PRODETAB were only one-third o f the total loan
(they should have been one-half) owing to cutbacks in counterpart funding and the
devaluation o f the Real (which required E M B R A P A to spend 80 percent more local
currency to tap Bank counterpart funds than when the project was designed).2

     AGENCY(RATING:SATISFACTORY)
IMPLEMENTING

66.     Locating project management in E M B R A P A made sense given i t s well-
established infrastructure. The I C R notes that the long-standing relationship between
E M B R A P A and the Bank helped to speed up the preparation o f PRODETAB. The
Executive Council performed transparently and fairly in reviewing project proposals.
Fiduciary oversight by E M B R A P A was adequate. All proposals o f US$40,000 or more
were reviewed ex post by the Bank on a random basis and no irregularities were found.3
O n the other hand, E M B R A P A shares some responsibility with the Bank for gaps in the
monitoring the outcomes o f the competitively-funded projects that formed part o f
PRODETAB, which complicates the task o f attributing results.

67.     The overall rating o f Borrower Performance i s satisfactory
