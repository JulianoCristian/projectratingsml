Brazilian National Agricultural Research\n            System (SNFA) by: (1) stimulating transition in the SNPA\n            from its current heavy reliance on public sector research\n            carried out by the national organization, Empresa Brasileira\n            de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA), to a more integrated and\n            diversified system of Agricultural Research Technology\n            Department and Transfer (ARTDT) led by EMBRAPA; (2)\n            increasing the role of clients in the definition of research\n            and technology transfer priorities and implementation; (3)\n            refocusing public sector research on quintessential public\n            goods; and (4) helping EMBRAPA to reorient its current\n            structure to address issues of decentralization and\n            diversification in the SNPA. The project components to\n            achieve these objective are: (1) financing a Competitive\n            Grants System for agricultural research, development, and\n            technology transfer; (2) strengthening research management\n            through technical assistance, training, satellite\n            communications, and international collaborations at the\n            Federal level; (3) strengthening research and technology\n            transfer activities at the state level; (4) and monitoring\n            and evaluating the project overall."}, "docdt": "1997-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
