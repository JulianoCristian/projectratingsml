The lessons learned are\n            conveyed as follows. The public, competitive selection of\n            research projects was the principal strength of the Project\n            from which all else flowed. The competitive format, the\n            thematic structure of strategically and socially relevant\n            research areas, and the multi-institutional and\n            multi-disciplinary mechanisms for initiating and\n            consolidating a fundamental shift in how agricultural\n            research was performed, fostered a more dynamic, organized\n            focus on the real needs of society, the economy and the\n            environments. The design motif promoted institutional\n            integration, higher quality research, and expanded research\n            horizons. Moreover, the thematic configuration of the\n            bidding events resulted in research projects with convergent\n            themes and activities, creating valuable opportunities to\n            exchange experiences and define joint strategies, formulate\n            new lines of research in partnership, and conduct evaluation\n            and wider dissemination of results, opportunities that\n            should be fully exploited. In addition, competitive systems\n            of research funding require a regulatory, and institutional\n            framework which promotes efficiency of financial management\n            to administer the multiple, diverse partnerships, and large\n            numbers of projects/subprojects."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
