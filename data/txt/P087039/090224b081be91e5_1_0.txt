                         commitment and ownership; (ii) adoption of SLM practices by some 2,100 farmers which are contributing to the reduction of annual soil loss by 41% in the project sites; (iii) promotion
                         of a better understanding of erosion and productive soil loss under different SLM technologies compared to traditional agricultural practices through the development of documents to
