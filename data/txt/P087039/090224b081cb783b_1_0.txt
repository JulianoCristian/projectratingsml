                         The Project Development Objective is to strengthen institutional and community capacity for anticipating and managing land degradation in Bhutan. The Project Global
                         Objective is to contribute to more effective protection of trans-boundary watersheds in a manner that preserves the integrity of ecosystems in Bhutan.

                         The project has met the PDO indicators. In addition to 138 chiogs (villages) in 9 geogs (blocks of villages) comprising the project sites, sustainable land management (SLM) initiatives
                         were introduced in some 30 other chiogs in 23 geogs. The number of farmer households that adopted SLM practices in the project sites increased by 70% compared to the target of
                         30%. In terms of the Global Environment Objective (GEO), measurements taken from soil erosion plots from participating geogs show a reduction of soil loss by 42% annually from

                         the application of SLM techniques.

                         In addition, SLM principles and practices are being mainstreamed in the 11th Five Year Plans (July 2013 to June 2018) at the national, dzonghag (district) and geog levels and were
                         integrated into the 2010 National Land Policy and the approved 2007 Land Act. The project contributed hugely to the development of high quality baseline data on resource mapping,
                         land cover and land use. The geographic information system (GIS) based mapping of biophysical and socio-economic factors identified the causes and incidences of land
                         degradation while identifying hotspots to allow the prioritization of SLM investments in action plans prepared by the participating geogs. The capacity for coordination in implementing
                         SLM practices has been strengthened within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MOAF) as well as in other sectors and across different levels of government (central, dzhonghag
                         and geog). To sustain the project's achievements and PDO, MOAF approved the establishment of a land management unit to continue with the scaling up of the SLM approach and
                         with mainstreaming it into national, district and local policies and programs. With the mainstreaming into planning and policymaking, the latter further confirms that SLM is relevant for
                         Bhutan's development priorities. The project's approach is being integrated into other rural development projects under implementation with financing from IFAD, EU, and IDA.
