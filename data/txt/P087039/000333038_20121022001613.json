All four components\n            are progressing satisfactorily. The project, based on its\n            current progress and achievements, is likely to achieve the\n            project development objectives within the six-month\n            extension. This extension of the grant closing date by six\n            months entails a level two project restructuring. The Royal\n            Government of Bhutan has requested the extension of the\n            project and, at several occasions, has indicated that the\n            approach to land management introduced through the project\n            is relevant and suitable for replication within the country.\n            The Ministry of Finance has endorsed this extension of the\n            project. This is the first request for extension of the\n            project's closing date."}, "docdt": "2012-10-08T00:00:00Z"}
