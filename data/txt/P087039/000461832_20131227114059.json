Most\n            of the project development objectives (PDO) indicators and\n            the global environment objectives (GEO) indicators have been\n            achieved either completely, or to a large extent. This paper\n            pertains to the provision of a grant for the aforementioned\n            project. Significant lessons learned during the\n            implementation of the project are: 1) the project design in\n            terms of multi-sectoral approach and phase-wise\n            implementation models worked well and did not show any signs\n            of serious weaknesses; 2) the participatory Sustainable Land\n            Management (SLM) action planning methodology proved to be an\n            excellent approach for community-based planning of SLM,\n            enhancing community commitment and ownership, facilitating\n            inclusion of local knowledge in decision-making and\n            participation of all households including women; 3) the\n            participatory approach created a conducive environment for\n            allowing communities to work together and build social\n            capital, thus contributing to mainstreaming gender, ensuring\n            equity and improvement of livelihoods of the poor; 4) the\n            SLM implementation was hampered by the remoteness of rural\n            communities, and associated difficulties; and 5) the lack of\n            labor availability due to rural-urban migration at the\n            household level is a key constraint in adoption and\n            successful implementation of project interventions."}, "docdt": "2013-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
