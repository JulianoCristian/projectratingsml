I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.        Country and sector background. Bhutan’s usable land resource is limited, owing to its
difficult and high mountain terrain, vast areas of snow and barren rocks, and large forests –
which cover some 70% of the country. Arable land makes up less than 8% of the territory with
most of it located in the central valleys and southern foothills. In those relatively flat areas,
agriculture must coexist with other development activities of a population growing at 2.5% per
year. Therefore, the total cultivated agricultural land accounts only for 2.93% of total land area . 1
The rural landscape of Bhutan is highly susceptible to landslides, soil run-off, and seasonal
floods, owing to the country’s characteristically steep terrain, fragile geological conditions, and
heavy rains. The areas of intensive land use suffer from soil erosion, landslides, forest
degradation, and depletion of soil fertility. Factors such as overgrazing, deforestation, poor
farming, poor soil and irrigation water management, and infrastructure development (e.g. roads)
aggravate the land degradation problem. The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) recognize
the social and economic impacts of the problem, including the potential losses to life and
property (mainly from landslides), reduced productivity, lower returns from public and private
investments in infrastructure and farmlands and risks to environmental stability.

2.     Project background. In 2003, Bhutan ratified the United Nations Convention to Combat
Desertification (UNCCD) and was eligible to receive Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
support under Operational Program 15 on Sustainable Land Management (SLM). 2 Bhutan has
been party to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change since 1995.

3.      The Sustainable Land Management Project (SLMP) was financed by a GEF grant of
US$7.66 million. The grant was GEF’s first investment in the reduction of land degradation in
Bhutan. It was GEF’s response to RGoB’s commitment to the United Nations Convention on
Combating Desertification ratified in 2003. The project received parallel financing of US$5.77
million from the Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA). RGoB supported the
project through the renewable natural resources (RNR) programs of the Ministry of Agriculture 3
-- of US$2.46 million – that were implemented with the participation of local communities.
Therefore, the total investment in the project amounted to US$15.89 million.

4.    Rationale for Bank assistance. The Bank actively worked with GEF and other donors in
a number of countries to support SLM initiatives. The Bank’s comparative advantage as GEF
implementing agency stemmed from its long-standing partnership with Bhutan, its experience in
community-driven and participatory approaches and ability to leverage donor funding (such as

  SLM was defined at the UN Earth Summit in 1992 as “the use of land resources, including soils, water, animals and plants, for
the production of goods to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential of
these resources and the maintenance of their environmental functions”. It has been further defined as “the adoption of land use
systems that, through appropriate management practices, enables land users to maximize the economic and social benefits from
the land while maintaining or enhancing the ecological support functions of the land resources” by TerrAfrica, 2005

emphasis on the need to support environmental efforts to achieve the strategic objectives. 4
Specifically, this project was expected to foster approaches, tools, and interventions to manage
land sustainably as well as to reverse damage to land due to weak policies, overgrazing, forest
degradation and unsustainable agricultural practices.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.    The PDO was to strengthen institutional and community capacity for anticipating and
managing land degradation in Bhutan.

6.       The key PDO indicators were:
         •    Increase in number of farmers practicing sustainable land management techniques
         •    Number of geogs implementing land degradation prevention development plans 5

1.3 Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators [as approved]:

7.     The GEO of the project was to contribute to more effective protection of trans-boundary
watersheds in a manner that preserves the integrity of ecosystems in Bhutan.

8.       The key GEO indicator was:
         •    10 percent reduction of sediment flow in selected micro-watersheds in pilot geogs

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.       The PDO was not revised.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification:

10.     The GEO was not revised. However, the measurement for its associated indicator –
reduction in sedimentation in selected micro-watersheds – was revised in March 2007 for the
following reasons. First, measuring the reduction in sediment flow in selected micro-watersheds
in the pilot geogs would have required time series data for establishing a baseline for subsequent
monitoring of mountain stream discharge and that was too difficult to undertake. Second,
sediment flux is not easily quantifiable because of its dependence on peak flow occurrences.
Finally, even if the changes in sedimentation flow were quantifiable, the reduction in sediment
influx in micro-watersheds could not be attributed exclusively to SLM practices. Hence, it was
agreed that a more appropriate measurement would be to use erosion plots to quantify and

practices.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

11.     The entire country and targeted rural communities were the project’s principal
beneficiaries. The project aimed to benefit Bhutan through strengthened human capacity at all
levels to systematically coordinate activities to manage land degradation. The project also
envisaged the introduction of: (i) tools and systems to identify and address incidences of land
degradation; and (ii) legislation and policies related to watershed management, agriculture,
livestock and forestry and planning and development that would benefit the country.

12.     The project was implemented in 138 chiogs 6 (villages) in nine geogs that are part of three
dzongkhgs (districts). The envisaged benefits were improved agriculture and livestock yields,
better income, conservation of agriculture, pasture and forest land, and capacity to sustainably
manage the land in the long term. The targeted communities included 4,500 households and
approximately 31,000 people living in land degradation hot spots in Bhutan, as well as
individuals and institutions benefited from project’s technical and institutional development
activities.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

13.     Component 1: Pilot projects to demonstrate effective application of land degradation
prevention approaches (US$1.37 million). The pilots were intended to be implemented in three
geogs 7 which were selected to represent the range of land degradation pressures across the
country. Component 1 had three sub-components: (i) development of a GIS (geographic
information system)-based biophysical and socio-economic mapping exercise to identify the
causes and incidence of land degradation; (ii) use of the information generated from the mapping
exercise to identify “hot spots” and assess the presence or absence of incentives that guide
farming practices and inform community decisions; and (iii) support for community decision
making and prioritization of potential SLM investments at the chiog level.

14.    Component 2: Mainstreaming of practices for protection against land degradation
(US$4.41 million). This component aimed to support the scaling up of the pilots to six additional
geogs (two in each of the pilot dzongkhags 8) based on the lessons learned from Component 1.
The support to additional geogs would be phased and would start in geogs where there was
substantial potential for successful SLM interventions and where existing capacity was adequate.

15.    Component 3: Policy support and guidance for mainstreaming land degradation
prevention practices (US$1.05 million). This component sought to consolidate the lessons from
Component 1 and 2 to inform national legislation and policies pertaining to watershed

management, upland agriculture and livestock, forestry, urban planning and infrastructure
development. It would provide technical assistance to develop guidelines for mainstreaming
SLM principles into RGoB’s five-year plans as well as annual and five-year plans of geogs and
dzongkhags by compiling and disseminating the lessons learned from pilot sites, policy guidance
notes, capacity building and awareness workshops.

16.     Component 4: National level support for coordination of implementation of land
degradation prevention practices (US$0.81 million). This component intended to support
RGoB’s efforts to strengthen and build capacity within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests
(MoAF) to systematically and effectively coordinate a program of activities for anticipating and
managing land degradation in the country. It would provide over-arching support across
different sectors (i.e. agriculture and natural resources, roads, infrastructure, etc.) and different
levels of government (i.e. geogs, dzongkhags and central levels) for SLM activities.

1.8 Revised Components

17.    The components were not revised.

1.9 Other significant changes

18.     Project schedule. A Level II project restructuring was carried out in October 2012 to
extend the closing date of the project from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 without any
change to the project cost. The extension aimed to assist RGoB toward consolidating the PDO
and project outcomes. It was expected that RGoB would mainstream some activities introduced
in the latter part of the implementation period, reinforce and sustain the project benefits through
integrating into the eleventh five-year plan and scale up SLM as an important tool for the
management of Bhutan’s land and land resources.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     Soundness of background analysis. Despite Bhutan’s good governance and long-
standing commitment to environmental sustainability, the practices and institutions existing at
the time of preparation were unable to adequately address ecological pressures from rapid
urbanization and development. Because SLM was a new priority area, the GEF project
preparation grant supported much-needed analysis of sector issues linked to environmental
sustainability, global practices for addressing the drivers of land degradation and the possible
impact of government strategies on project implementation and sustainability.

20.     Two alternatives were considered in arriving at the selected design: (i) strengthening the
sectoral approach existing at the time of preparation; and (ii) introducing payments for
environmental services (PES). Those options were rejected because SLM requires the collective
effort of a number of sectors and the data for the establishment of PES and the complex task of
valuation of environmental services were not available. Also, downstream users were not
willing to consider compensating upstream inhabitants for ecosystem services that were



                                                 4
considered to be free. The selected design was based on community decision making that would
effectively incorporate ecological, economic and social dimensions into sustainable land use
decisions and investments at all levels.

21.    The project design was informed by the lessons from ongoing and completed projects in
the environment sector that were supported mainly by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP). It also took into account the lessons from Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) project evaluations on the importance of considering size, remoteness and capacity in
designing projects including the IEG’s Country Assistance Evaluation for Bhutan. 9 Therefore,
the design incorporated the need to pilot SLM approaches, reliance on existing institutions and
systems to comply with fiduciary requirements and strengthening capacity when required.

22.     Five principles guided project design: a bottom-up approach, phased implementation,
decentralization, use of knowledge and information on farmer incentives and an integrated multi-
sectoral approach. Project preparation placed huge emphasis on participatory planning from the
bottom up (chiog, to geogs, to Dzongkhags that focused on community priorities. Such bottom-
up approach was innovative for Bhutan and its communities. The phased approach allowed for
adjustments throughout implementation based on the learning that emerged from the pilot
efforts. The project design supported the existing decentralization by strengthening the role of
communities and local authorities in natural resource management. The project integrated the
planning and investment of three key sectors – agriculture, livestock and forestry – that are
closely linked to the livelihoods of the rural communities and the wellbeing of the natural
resource base. In addition, the preparation incorporated an extensive focus on social issues to
ascertain the social acceptability of proposed activities and potential negative impacts on
vulnerable groups, while ensuring that solutions responded to the environmental problems
arising from land degradation.

23.     The institutional framework of shared overall implementation responsibility by MoAF
and the local administrations was appropriate because the effective coordination of agencies. The
need for three sectors to work closely for effective natural resource management was deemed to
require a multi-sectoral technical advisory committee (MTAC). The MTAC was convened to
provide oversight and technical support and to ensure timely delivery of inputs and actions and
effective mainstreaming of field results into national and sectoral policies and programs.

24.     Adequacy of participatory processes. The preparation entailed a participatory and
inclusive process of direct and systematic engagement with beneficiary communities in the
planning, selection, implementation, and monitoring of activities. Stakeholder participation was
secured through: (i) national consultations and workshops; (ii) meetings of the MTAC and joint
national steering committee (NSC) 10; (iii) field surveys and study visits; (iv) geog and chiog

level workshops, meetings and consultations especially in the three pilot project locations; and
(v) dzongkhag level consultations. 11

25.     Adequacy of government commitment.              RGoB’s commitment to address land
degradation was demonstrated by: (i) the July 2004 recommendation of the National Assembly
to review the 1979 Land Act; (ii) a high level technical meeting held in October 2004 and
chaired by the Minister, MoAF that focused on the urgency of the problem; (iii) a land
management campaign in eastern Bhutan launched in July 2005 by the Minister, MoAF; and (iv)
incorporation of policy initiatives against land degradation policy to implement the goals of the
Ninth Five Year Plan (2002-2007) one of which was environmental conservation. The latter
included the plan to develop a new grazing policy as well as SLM related information
management systems at the central and dzongkhag level with DANIDA support. In addition,
MoAF undertook a major shift from sector-based planning to area-based planning to address
land degradation in the subsequent five-year plan. Hence, the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2008-2013)
incorporated an increase in the national budgetary resources for SLM. RGoB formed a qualified
team of government staff to work closely with the Bank during project design and preparation.
Finally, RGoB committed US$1.51 million for project implementation as its contribution.

26.     Risk assessment. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified several potential
risks and mitigation measures. The overall risk of the project was rated moderate. The rating
proved to be appropriate for the type and scale of the proposed interventions as well as the level
of capacity, commitment and governance within which the project was to be implemented.
During implementation, the overall risk was revised to low because most of the risks identified at
appraisal were managed adequately with appropriate mitigation measures.

27.      Quality at entry rated by QAG. Moderately satisfactory/likely. (See 5.1(a))

2.2 Implementation

28.    Implementation progress was satisfactory throughout the project period. The grant funds
were fully disbursed. All outcome/ and output targets were met by the revised closing date.

29.     The project’s uncomplicated design complemented the emerging context for SLM at the
time of preparation. It took into account Bhutan’s limited financial and human resources and the
remoteness of the project sites. 12 The stakeholders adhered to the project’s five principles
formulated at the design phase (described in sub-section 2.1). As such, the participatory multi-
sectoral approach that allowed for adjustments throughout implementation was fruitful. The
approach resulted in the: (i) involvement and ownership of communities in natural resource


11
   The major stakeholders relevant to the project were policy makers, national and district level government agencies, national
and district level technical and research institutions, civil society organizations and academic institutions. Local stakeholders
comprised local government agencies, farmers, herders, forest dependents, local municipalities and their populations, and other
local citizens.

planning and decision making; (ii) integrated planning of resources that impact three sectors, i.e.,
agriculture, livestock and forestry; (iii) testing and grounding of traditional approaches to SLM
and new technologies; as well as (iv) identifying cost effective SLM technologies for investment.
Specifically, implementation led to improved knowledge of 17,237 farmers across Bhutan and to
the provision of benefits to 21,613 males and females in the project sites from SLM investments
covering about 70% of the targeted population.

30.     The structure of the project management team (PMT) was aligned with that of MoAF,
allowing for relatively coordinated and consistent implementation across the project sites. A
hands-on management approach along with high staff commitment facilitated monitoring,
troubleshooting and continuous enhancement of interventions. Weak capacity at inception was
resolved in due course by enlarging the PMT to comprise not only key personnel from MoAF but
also other ministries and by tapping experts who strengthened the PMT’s knowledge. 13 The PMT,
with the support of other relevant departments, carried out a training needs assessment that
formed the basis for the capacity building program supported under the project. Because of the
project’s pilot approach, it allowed the PMT to try and test techniques during implementation
before the wide scale adoption or replication of methodologies.

31.      New activities that had not been envisaged during preparation were added during
implementation to enhance the project’s outcomes. They included: (i) updating of land use and
land cover maps for Bhutan that led to improved planning and monitoring of SLM and other
area-based development activities and created the potential for natural resource risk
management; (ii) development of the Druk Dynamic Information Framework (DrukDIF) as a
decision-support tool that could test future scenarios of land use changes and climate change;
(iii) additional financial, technical, training and marketing support to the pilot and scaling-up
geogs and short-term incentives to improve farm and non-farm incomes and livelihood
diversification; 14 and (iv) provision of non-formal and vocational training to literate, semi-
literate and vulnerable community members. The extension of the closing date permitted the
consolidation of these new activities and full disbursement of the GEF grant.

32.      Operational challenges. While no significant issues impeded the implementation of each
component, the early stages of implementation faced operational challenges because the project
is a pilot effort. Implementation began slowly because of: (i) inadequate engineering expertise at
the geog/dzongkhag level to support the water resources/irrigation canal rehabilitation; (ii) lack
of citrus seedlings for the promotion of orchards; and (iii) RGoB’s audit constraints that
restricted the purchase of supplies from non-formal suppliers when the National Seed Centre and
other licensed private suppliers faced shortages. Subsequent enhancements to coordination and


13
   Consultants were engaged in the initial stages of project implementation to fill knowledge gaps in particular areas. The new
knowledge was transferred successfully to technical staff in relevant institutions within RGoB. MoAF agreed to assign a
dedicated project manager who was relieved from regular duties during the implementation period. However, the rest of the team
including the project director and technical staff carried out their project responsibilities along with their regular functions. No
special incentives were provided to the team. Because project implementation was incorporated into career development
strategies, the staff owned it fully and demonstrated the commitment.
14
   Although the communities understood the importance of SLM, significant underlying factors such as poverty and scarce farm
labor (due to urban migration of able bodied community members) needed to be addressed. In the early stages of implementation,
it was recognized that community participation would be a challenge and therefore the incentives were developed in part to
overcome the difficulties of eliciting community interest in the adoption of SLM practices which are highly labor intensive.


                                                                 7
involvement of sectoral expertise facilitated infrastructure rehabilitation. After some delay, the
seedlings became available for orchard planting and restrictions of purchasing supplies were
resolved.

33.     The high turnover of key PMT members in the initial stages – due to departure for the
pursuit of higher education and to routine transfers – affected implementation. This was a result
of a small number of public servants in the RGoB. Most importantly, the project manager
changed four times and the frequency of the changes resulted in the varying degree of
compliance with fiduciary requirements. In the last four years, the PMT composition was stable
with the absence of any significant changes.

34.     The transfer of funds to the geogs was delayed which led to a lag in the disbursements of
the GEF grant and other funding sources because the geogs did not have banks or bank accounts,
thus constraining implementation in the first two years. This issue was resolved through a
revision of the initial fund flow release mechanism to one that was adapted to prevailing
conditions. The change was determined to be acceptable in terms of financial management.
Fiduciary training was provided to ensure that the PMT managed implementation in compliance
with the Bank’s requirements.

35.     Mid-term review. The Bank conducted a mid-term review (MTR) in September 2008
that also involved the participation of the Danish Environment and Urban Sector Program
Support (EUSPS) and UNDP's GEF Sustainable Land Management Medium Sized Project. The
joint review was aimed at assessing the progress and constraints in implementing SLM and
environmental management programs and identifying opportunities for further harmonization
and alignment among the three donor-supported programs.

36.     The MTR led to a set of coordinated recommendations to consolidate the successes of
each project component and most of them were implemented in subsequent years. These
included: (a) enhancing farm and non-farm income generation activities during the chiog work
planning exercises; (b) providing financial and technical support to pilot geogs beyond the initial
three-year implementation period in order to build further commitment and implementation
capacity for SLM; (c) documenting and disseminating methodologies for participatory planning
and mapping that had been tested and refined in the field, as well as other relevant learning
experiences and best practices in SLM and lessons emanating from the project; (d) supporting
the development and testing of methodologies and tools for linking SLM planning at the geog
level to area-based planning at dzongkhag level; (e) continuing to accommodate thematic
proposals to replicate successful SLM techniques and contribute to improved understanding of
natural resource management issues at the national and dzongkhag levels; and (f) improving the
collaboration with EUSPS in implementing Component 2.

37.    During the MTR, MTAC members visited pilot geog sites to review progress and impact
and continued to join the PMT on monitoring visits, thereby enhancing their advisory role.
RGoB provided additional staff to the PMT in the third year of implementation. Improvements
were made to the procurement planning processes at the dzongkhag level and to the internal
controls for timely fund flows and financial monitoring.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.     M&E design. A results framework and a detailed and participatory monitoring and
evaluation mechanism were part of the PAD. The indicators of the results framework were
adequate to report on the objectives of the project. At the outset, baseline information was not
available for many indicators as the existing tools for establishing the baseline were impractical
and would not have provided reliable data. The development and application of new analytical
tools for establishing biophysical and socio-economic baselines to inform chiog and geog SLM
planning were carried out as the implementation commenced. In late 2012, two core sector
indicators required by the Bank were introduced with a view to better reporting of the project
outcomes.      Overall, the M&E mechanism provided (a) opportunities for continuous
feedback regarding the extent to which the project was achieving its goals, (b) identification of
potential problems at an early stage and possible solutions, (c) monitoring the efficiency with
which the different components of the project were implemented as well as introduction of
improvements that facilitated mid-way corrections, (d) incorporated stakeholders’ views and (e)
influenced planning and decision-making.

40.     M&E implementation.         The regular RGoB monitoring system through MoAF was
routed to the RNR sectors from the geog to the dzongkhag levels and was ultimately reflected in
MoAF’s program. The latter was linked to and reflected in RGOB’s Tenth Five Year Plan.
Achievements were monitored through the web-based planning and monitoring system
(PLAMS) managed by the Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC). The data and
information from MoAF’s monitoring subsequently fed into the PMU’s tracking system for
reporting to the Bank on the progress vis-a-vis the results framework.

41.     As described in paragraph 11, the measure for GEO indicator on sedimentation at micro-
watershed level was replaced by reduction of soil erosion in the project sites. The implementing
agency introduced erosion plots to quantify the reductions in run-off and soil erosion as the
positive effects of SLM activities. The erosion plots served to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the project’s SLM interventions. It also provided a good communication and training tool for
convincing farmers about the potential contribution of SLM activities to land productivity and
prevention of soil loss. The introduction of additional proxy indicators during implementation
allowed for better determination of the project achievements. Process monitoring was carried
out to identify implementation challenges and good practices for replication and to strengthen
implementation continuously. The MTR’s joint evaluation with other funding agencies helped in
disseminating best practices and lessons learned more widely and influencing policy decisions.

42.      M&E utilization. The monitoring responsibilities were carried out at all administrative
levels. Data collection at all levels was adequate and was built into the bottom-up planning
process. The farmers received training in data collection in addition to SLM techniques.
Consolidated M&E reports were prepared and submitted bi-annually. The MTR found that SLM
activities were too spread such that they did not provide readily tangible evidence of the SLM
benefits as a result of the project. Hence, further investments were made in two villages per
geog identified randomly for demonstration purposes while still continuing the SLM support



                                                9
planned in all target villages. The data collected by MoAF and PLAMS were evaluated and used
for decision-making beyond the project activities, including the preparation of the Eleventh Five
Year Plan, the 2010 land cover update as well as national planning and decision making by the
Ministry of Finance, GNHC, MoAF and other government and non-government organizations.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

43.     Safeguard compliance. As a category B project, the safeguard policies on environmental
assessment (OP/BP 4.01), forests (OP/BP 4.36), and pest management (OP 4.09) were triggered
in addition to locally applicable policies, laws and regulations. An Environmental Management
Framework was developed as part of project preparation to guide the management of potential
environmental impacts. The Social Assessment adopted a process framework for the
participation of local communities in implementing SLM activities to ensure transparency and
equity related to potential livelihood impacts.

44.     Environmental and social safeguard compliance is rated satisfactory. The environmental
and social screening processes identified were subsequently mainstreamed into the SLM
planning process which integrated environmental and social concerns into activity planning at
the chiog level. The practice of integrated planning ensured the likelihood of continued attention
to prioritizing and selecting SLM interventions beyond the project period. The impacts –
particularly the resource-linked differences in the benefits of the interventions – were regularly
monitored during implementation by the geog SLM planning teams and field coordinators. The
SLM plans and bylaws for community forestry, water use, etc. were validated and endorsed at
the chiog and geog levels, thereby ensuring local ownership throughout implementation. The
interventions that restricted access to natural resources were identified and the chiogs carried out
consultations to resolve the issues. Any intervention with negative environment or social impact
which could not be mitigated was dropped from the chiog’s SLM plan. There were no cases of
environmental or social issues that were not successfully managed.

45.    Fiduciary compliance. This aspect is rated satisfactory. Fiduciary covenants were
complied with during implementation. Internal controls were in place and further improvements
were made after the MTR. The financial management system and records were adequate. There
was no reported mis-procurement of activities.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

46.   Transition arrangements.         The transition arrangements for sustaining the project’s
outcomes seem adequate.
(i)   Institutional. In December 2012, MoAF approved the establishment of an SLM unit within
      the National Soil Services Center (NSSC) to build on the SLM initiatives and mainstream
      SLM at the national, district and local levels. The SLM unit will continue to employ field-
      level and central NSSC staff members who were involved with SLMP. At the field level,
      trained geog SLM planners, extension workers, and geog heads will ensure that SLM
      activities are integrated into the development planning at the geog level. The beneficiary
      survey results indicate the high likelihood of continued integration of SLM in agriculture,
      livestock and forestry sectors because of the relevant training provided to farmers. During


                                                10
       implementation, linkages were developed with the research and development centers
       (RDCs) that helped expand technical support to non-project areas. Those linkages will be
       strengthened in implementing the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. Indeed, Volume 1 of the
       Eleventh Five Year Plan document incorporates the adoption of SLM approaches in geog
       level planning.
(ii)   Financial. The project was designed and implemented as a pilot effort and confirmed by
       the selection of the project sites – 3 pilot geogs and 6 scaling up geogs. Due to its limited
       resources, RGoB may be able to provide some financing for the broad-based
       implementation of SLM approaches throughout the country but it may require external
       funding for SLM on a wider geographical scale. MoAF and NSSC requested an in-depth
       assessment of the economic benefits of SLM and the Bank secured trust fund support to
       engage the services of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to conduct a
       comprehensive economic assessment of SLM in Bhutan. It is envisaged that the report
       would reach out not only to national policymakers but also to possible financiers. For
       pragmatic purposes, the IFPRI draft was aimed at informing the ICR and the final report
       will be shared with RGOB and stakeholders. 15
(iii) Technical. NSSC is equipped with adequate laboratory facilities and technical staff with
      SLM expertise to provide technical support to geogs and farmers. NSSC strengthened its
      linkages with the RDCs whose staff will work as focal resources at the regional level. The
      local leaders and extension officers trained in SLM techniques will ensure the continued
      planning and adoption of SLM at the local level. Based on the ground interventions and
      training conducted during the project period, a number of manuals were developed for the
      purposes of documenting, as well as for future training needs. SLM was incorporated into
      standard training of extension agents.
(iv) Policies. In addition to MoAF policies that promote SLM in key sectors, the completion of
     the National Action Program aligned to the UNCCD 10-year strategy would be a vehicle
     for mainstreaming SLM into national and sectoral plans and policies.

47.    As described throughout this document, the project design and implementation were
aligned with the intent to pilot SLM practices. The GEF grant was not intended to support a
nation-wide introduction and application of SLM approaches. On the other hand, the grant led to
two impressive outcomes: (i) the demonstration of good SLM practices with ownership by
communities; and (ii) the replicability of the participatory approach and the tested techniques.
Moreover, the staffing of the SLM unit at NSSC represents a de facto financial commitment by
RGOB to apply SLM beyond the project’s three pilot geogs and the six scaling-up geogs. As
described above, the SLM unit will collaborate and link up with the RDCs and the local officials
and communities. MoAF and GNHC conveyed to the ICR team their aspiration for grant
funding to take SLM one step further – the possibility of designing and implementing a project
that addresses river basin level/watershed level issues stemming from land degradation with
linkages to disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change. Finally, an impact

  IFPRI launched the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative in 2011 to examine globally the economic benefits of
land and land based ecosystems. ELD emphasizes the value of SLM and provides an integrated global approach for the analysis
of the economics of land degradation. To date, IFPRI's research covered eight countries of the Mashreq and Maghreb sub-
regions as well as Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Kenya, Peru, Niger, Senegal, Uganda and Uzbekistan.

evaluation of the project in two or three years that would fully reflect the physical impact of
SLM may be considered.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

48.    The objectives of the project are highly relevant, timely and appropriate to the current
needs of Bhutan’s renewable natural resource sector and country’s vision. 16 Improved land
management can reduce long-term fiscal expenditures on sectors such as agriculture, livestock,
hydropower, water, etc. and increase the resilience of the land and critical watersheds and
communities dependent on the land to natural disasters and impacts of climate change.

49.     SLM is in line with RGoB policies and legislation on agriculture, livestock, water
resources, irrigation, forestry, biodiversity and land. The project contributed to RGoB’s mandate
of maintaining 60% forest cover through afforestation activities in degraded land. The project
remains relevant because of the multi-sectoral approach identified in the National Land Policy
2010 toward reducing the demand for land, improving its productivity and promoting sustainable
agriculture. It encouraged sustainable management and development of land areas identified as
critical for national food security, good ecosystem services, hydropower generation, forest
management, etc. The country’s National Forest Policy (1974 and 2011) aimed at the protection
of land, its forest, soil, water resources and biodiversity against degradation calls for continued
adoption of proper SLM practices and systems. The national development goals and targets
presented in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2013-2018) provide the opportunity to continue
mainstreaming SLM as part of poverty reduction, agriculture diversification and responsiveness
to emerging issues, such as climate change. 17

50.     The core design of the project and implementation arrangements remains highly relevant
and appropriate in terms of the country context. The principles that guided project design are
significant for sustaining SLM interventions and they continue to contribute to the global
environmental objective of arresting and reversing land degradation. The project activities
promoted an effective and efficient SLM planning process within the broader development
planning efforts at all administrative levels. The project investments are highly relevant to the
achievement of RGoB priorities, such as self-reliance in food, reduction in income poverty and
increased hydropower generation through better watershed management. RGoB’s commitment
to SLM and the project activities generated a significant change in the recognition and
acceptance nationally and locally about the importance of SLM. All of the stakeholders
interviewed by the ICR team and 98% of the respondents to the beneficiary survey confirmed the
high relevance of the project design and implementation.



16
   Bhutan 2020 – A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness, is a Vision statement taking stock of the past development
performance and presenting the challenges under broad thematic topics like nation, people, economy, environment and
institutions. The document also describes guiding principles for change and development including environmentally sustainable
development.
17
   The top three economic activities contributing to GDP are (i) construction with 16.3%, (ii) agriculture with 15.7% and (iii)
electricity and water with 13.9%.


                                                             12
51.     While the project was designed during the implementation of the 2006-2009 CAS, its
objective is consistent with the Bank’s current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) where
environmental sustainability is a cross-cutting theme. 18 The CPS highlights the importance of
environmental stewardship, application of environmental safeguards, disaster risk management
and adaptation to climate change and all of these priorities are linked to SLM. The Bank’s
implementation support responded to the changing needs toward achieving the development and
global environmental objectives through the incremental inclusion of capacity building activities,
such as the development of a decision-making tool 19 aimed at addressing the need for better
watershed management and adaptation to climate vulnerabilities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

52.       The project is rated satisfactory vis-à-vis the achievement of the PDO and GEO.

53.     The overall project achievements are significant with results exceeding the targets in
some cases. Specifically, SLM benefits reached 70% of the farming households compared to the
target of 30%. At closure, the targets related to reducing land degradation toward the effective
protection of watershed, maintaining the integrity of ecosystems and increasing the capacity to
respond to land degradation issues were met with high efficacy. The achievements are described
below for the key PDO and GEO outcome targets.

54.     Capacity building in addressing land degradation. The project was successful in
strengthening institutional and community capacity for anticipating and managing land
degradation as well as in transforming the attitudes of land users on the significance of SLM.
The country’s knowledge base increased with the training and technical assistance provided to
NSSC staff. In turn, the latter shared their expertise on the management and monitoring of land
degradation with the geog officials and field coordinators and ultimately with 17,237 farmers
cross Bhutan who practiced their newly acquired skills in appropriate and cost-effective SLM
techniques.

55.     Local government planning improved as geog planners gained more confidence in the use
of participatory tools as well as multi-sectoral and area based planning. Staff of the National
Biodiversity Center and Department of Hydro-Meteorological Service benefited from training in
rapid biodiversity assessment of watersheds and land use cover mapping. The project enhanced
the National Land Commission Secretariat’s capacity to raise awareness on land use and to
implement the rules and regulations of the 2007 Land Act more effectively. The expanded
partnership and linkages between NSSC and RDCs enabled the replication and scaling up of
SLM best practices in many parts of the country 20 and institutionalizing SLM in research and

   DrukDIF is a “multi-layered” environmental information system that would help analyze the resource base and develop
productive scenarios and appropriate interventions based on variations in climatic conditions and ecosystems. The system was
developed to serve as a decision-making tool on the allocation and use of land and land resources, location and operation of
future hydro-power facilities and key infrastructure, development of strategies for improving agricultural productivity and
poverty alleviation as well as management of land erosion and land degradation. In addition, it is aimed at organizing, storing and
making accessible natural resources management data.
20
   As a result of capacity building, about 40 geogs beyond the targeted geogs expressed the interest to adopt SLM practices in
their respective chiogs out of which 23 geogs were implementing SLM practices at the closure of the project.


                                                               13
development. The improved capacity of government institutions influenced the reforms that
took place after the introduction of two key policies, a regulation and two action plans 21 as well
as the adoption of 140 local level natural resource management regulatory agreements.

56.     Adoption and implementation of land degradation prevention plans (target: in at least
9 geogs). Prevention plans were adopted and are under implementation in 9 geogs. With the
outreach efforts and improved their knowledge and skills in participatory rural planning and
decision-making made possible by the project, 23 additional geogs adopted SLM planning and
implementation. Dzongkhag and geog officials gained the capacity to undertake natural resource
surveying and mapping and multi-sectoral SLM planning. Over 50% of the farmers in the
targeted geogs learned to identify and prioritize SLM needs and develop action plans to reduce
land degradation. According to the beneficiary survey results, stakeholders benefited from the
methodology for SLM action planning because of its relevance to overall development planning.

57.    Multi-sectoral and participatory planning introduced by the project was adopted in other
donor-funded programs (e.g., DANIDA) and in the preparation of the Tenth and Eleventh Five
Year Plans. The current RNR Five Year Plan includes a national SLM program for a majority of
geogs in the country.

58.      Increase in the number of farmers practicing SLM techniques (target: 30% increase).
The project sites were located in areas of high incidence of land degradation which are inhabited
by most of the country’s poorest and most vulnerable communities. For the most part, the
communities were reluctant to change their traditional livelihood practices especially if the
benefits from the changes would materialize fully only in the long term. To ensure the
participation of the communities, short-term incentives – in the form of income-generating
activities – were combined with the adoption of SLM techniques. They included vegetable
production in kitchen gardens, production of farm yard manure, dairy shed farming and bamboo
planting. These activities also resulted in a positive impact on natural resources management
because they reduced the dependence by the communities on non-wood forest products (e.g.
fodder) and helped stabilize the land and control soil erosion. These achievements were
confirmed by over 97% of respondents to the beneficiary survey who claimed that they benefited
from higher incomes and improvements to the productivity of their land resources.

59.    In comparison to the baseline of 255 farmers in three pilot geogs and 500 farmers in six
scaling up geogs, project implementation led to the adoption of SLM practices by over 1,800
famers in the pilot geogs and some 1,300 farmers in the scaling up geogs, which contributed to
an exceeded target of 70% increase. The actual figures represent a four-fold increase over the
baseline data.

60.     Achievement of the GEO. As explained in paragraph 11, the GEO monitoring indicator
was revised. Because of the difficulties in the measurement and attribution of sediment flows in
selected watersheds, the Bank and RGoB agreed to measure the run-off and soil erosion change
due to SLM activities. About 50% of the targeted land area identified with severe land

Biodiversity Action Plan.

degradation issues was managed effectively by project closure, preserving the integrity of a
number of key ecosystems. The project reduced annual soil loss by 29MT/ha/year or 44% in the
project sites due to management of run-off and soil erosion (target: 10%). The evidence point to
the reduction of land degradation in targeted areas, increased agriculture and livestock
productivity, reduced damage to households and down slope land and lowered downstream
sediment load. 22 The draft report prepared by IFPRI (with Bank support) confirms the
significant impacts to sediment loading at the basin level due to SLM techniques in Bhutan.
Specifically, country-wide data indicate that SLM reduced sediment load in forest land by 50%,
agriculture land by 23% and orchards by 50%. 23

61.      In addition to the PDO and GEO results, the following results were achieved.
(i)      Adoption of SLM techniques – such as establishment of community forests, private
         forests, water source protection, check dams, bamboo and tree plantations, afforestation,
         orchards, terracing, hedgerows, stone bunding, and agroforestry – on 7,122 hectares (ha)
         in pilot geogs and 5,128 ha in scaling up geogs
(ii)     Improvement of degraded forests and grazing land by 31% (target: 10%)
(iii)    Conversion of tseri land (shifting cultivation land) into sustainable land cover by 69%
         (target: 39%)

3.3 Efficiency

62.      While the project was extended by another six months, the impacts described above were
attained with significant efficiency. The project disbursed the entire grant (see Annex 1) and
used 76.9% of the available funds with a variation of +1.3% from the original allocation for
piloting and scaling up of SLM practices toward the reduction of land degradation and
institutional and community capacity building (Components 1and 2), which represents the main
contributors to the PDO and GEO outcomes. An ex-post cost benefit analysis was carried out
and it confirmed the positive economic impact and economic feasibility of the project (see
Annex 3). The economic calculation yields positive results under two scenarios, i.e., at 5% and
10% discount rates. However, the calculations exclude many other benefits, especially those
related to capacity building and mainstreaming of SLM into government policies which generate
benefits beyond the communities living in the project sites.

63.     Other benefits beyond the project boundaries were achieved, such as the positive impact
of SLM on hydropower generation or the sequestration and storage of carbon. SLM also
provides important amenity values that are significant for enhancing the nature-based tourism
potential of Bhutan. The economic analysis considers these benefits by using the values for
ecosystem services reported by Kubiszewski et al. (2013). 24 Because the figures are per capita
values and apply only to the population in the project sites, actual benefits are likely to be higher.

   Sediment load estimation was conducted by modifying the gross soil erosion estimates taking into account the sediment
transport and deposition processes from run-off and soil erosion plots and sediment characteristics.

64.     Implementation of the activities confirmed the benefits of SLM and point to the possible
gains from further scaling up of the project. The analysis applied a conservative approach when
approximating economic values and limited the quantification of a few direct benefits to the
target population. The results are robust because they underestimate the true economic impact of
the project. Due to data constraints, the other economic benefits arising from capacity building
and mainstreaming can be considered only in qualitative terms and their positive impact would
be felt by land users beyond the project areas in future years.

3.4         Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

65.       The overall outcome is rated satisfactory on account of the: (i) high relevance of the
project objectives, design and implementation; (ii) achievement of the PDO and GEO with high
efficacy; and (iii) significant efficiency. The project outcomes are consistent with Bhutan’s
long-term vision and short to medium term development strategy as well as the Bank’s CPS.
The relevance of the project outcomes and benefits to communities were confirmed by the high
positive responses of the stakeholders interviewed during the ICR mission and the beneficiaries
(i.e., from the survey results). Many design elements were subsequently adopted in development
planning at the national and decentralized levels and funding agencies. The project’s
development and global environmental objectives were achieved despite some operational and
technical challenges in the early stages of project implementation. Implementation of the project
activities was financially sound, allowing for additional outputs to enhance the overall outcome.
The project’s positive economic impact is a testament to the benefits of SLM.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)         Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

66.     The project generated additional income in targeted as well as non-targeted communities
while safeguarding land and land based resources from further degradation. Most of the
investments were concentrated in areas of high poverty largely because of their remoteness. For
details see Annex 2. In Radhi geog, the bamboo plantations introduced to prevent soil erosion
and improve land stability became a source of income for the communities, second only to rice
production. Because of bamboo’s high regenerating capacity, the sale of bamboo poles provided
over Nu 400,000 in less than three years. Such results drew the interest of farmers and geog
administrators beyond the target geogs in adopting SLM. Indeed, NSSC continues to receive
proposals to support SLM interventions in non-project geogs.

67.     Women participated actively in training and field demonstration exercises with 40% of
the participants being female. The project created a conducive environment for female
participation in SLM action planning. For example, the project arranged community meetings
close to their residences to avoid any long travel avoiding possible disruption to livelihoods.
The project beneficiaries included 5,900 females and 9,800 males who participated willingly and
recognized the relevance of SLM to their livelihoods. 25



25
     There were no targets for the gender distribution of benefits (including levels and types).


                                                                   16
68.     The project was instrumental in reviving the traditional practice of establishing informal
labor sharing groups to address the lack of adequate labor in many households. 26 This practice
built social cohesion in villages and helped develop community trust and confidence. The
demonstration sites created under the project were used to show case good practices to farmers in
non-project areas and brought remote rural communities together to learn from and share their
experience. The project contributed to inter-community transfer of knowledge, increased
dissemination and adoption of SLM practices and reduced isolation, resulting in benefits to an
additional 12,737 farmers outside the project sites.

(b)      Institutional change/strengthening

69.      The project attained considerable results vis-à-vis institutional change and strengthening
because they were the core elements of the project design as described under section 3.2 (also
refer to Annex 2 for details). The sustainable engagement of communities with local level
institutions and extension services for agriculture, livestock and forestry was key to the project
and satisfactorily achieved through the multi-sectoral planning approach and the resource
management regulatory agreements adopted at the local level. The multi-sectoral planning
approach strengthened the linkages between RDCs and geogs, RDCs and NSSC and geogs and
NSSC. It also led to better coordination among the three key sectoral departments of MoFA as
well as other institutions (Hydro-Meteorological Service, National Biodiversity Center and
National Land Commission).

(c)      Other unintended outcome and impacts (positive and negative)

70.    The development of DrukDIF and its offshoot, the geographic information system (GIS)
were instrumental in opening the dialogue within RGoB on improving the country’s capacity to
manage their natural endowment and to respond effectively to disaster risks. Due to the project’s
robust capacity building elements, RGoB was able to utilize the GIS expertise and mapping
during the recent flood in Bhutan. The Department of Hydro-Meteorological Service secured
additional finance to enhance the capabilities of DrukDIF in response to engage more effectively
to address river-basin level challenges.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

71.     As part of the preparation of the borrower’s evaluation report, NSSC conducted a
beneficiary survey targeted to the project beneficiaries and stakeholders. The study was
administered and analyzed by an independent consultant. Over 90% of respondents felt that: (i)
the project enhanced the livelihoods of farmers; (ii) SLM interventions lead to positive impact on
land resources; and (iii) the training provided was relevant and useful in enhancing knowledge
and skills, changing attitudes towards SLM and its adoption. A majority of respondents



26
   Historically, people particularly living in rural areas worked in small groups (known as informal labor groups) for activities
such as agriculture, livestock management, building small-scale infrastructure, etc. Through time this practice ceased in many
parts of Bhutan. With the migration of people to urban centers, there is significant level of labor drain in rural areas. With the
reduction of able bodied people to work on land, the communities recognized the importance of reviving the informal labor
groups to work efficiently.


                                                               17
expressed their confidence that SLM activities will be sustained after project closure. (See
Annexes 5 and 6 for details.)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

72.    Rating: Moderate

73.     The risk of reversing or losing the institutional and community capacity for anticipating
and managing land degradation is considered low. The project design and implementation
succeeded to instill ownership among communities and local administrative officers which is
critical for sustaining the development outcome. Currently, there is adequate institutional
capacity and community ownership to sustain the SLM investments. Although the project
demonstrated SLM best practices in all project geogs, it takes time for farmers to realize the
benefits of SLM interventions before they actually adopt and maintain the technologies on their
own. Limited additional support may be needed to keep up the momentum and to facilitate the
consolidation of ongoing SLM activities in critical sites. Such support would lead to increased
attention to the demonstration sites and the reduction of land degradation in the long run. The
beneficiary survey results confirm the substantial changes in farming practices in the project
areas and the significant willingness and ability of the farmers to continue those practices.

74.     The risk of negating the effective protection of transboundary watersheds is assessed to
be moderate. While the physical investments were carried out in a limited area, they made a
significant contribution to watershed protection by improving land management in land
degradation hotspots in Bhutan. By strengthening human and technical capacity, the project
built a foundation for understanding the need for watershed protection as well as for knowledge
and capital investment in appropriate technology. RGoB’s development strategy espouses the
significance of watershed protection especially because of its impact on one of the country’s key
economic sectors – hydropower generation. The shared interest of the international community
on watersheds raises the possibility of external finance.

75.   RGoB has taken a number of initiatives to ensure the sustainability of the project
outcomes, including the following:
(i)    The establishment of the SLM unit demonstrates the country’s ownership of and
       commitment to the project approach and the considerable likelihood of sustaining the
       development objectives and achievements. While there is a risk to adequate staffing of
       the unit for budgetary reasons, it is mitigated by the availability of NSSC staff trained in
       SLM who can provide their expertise to the unit and continue to integrate SLM in their
       regular work. In addition, NSSC maintains its linkages with the RDCs that have closer
       access to the dzongkhags, geogs and chiogs.
(ii)   The SLM approaches under the project were mainstreamed into other donor-financed
       projects, such as the: (i) Market Access Growth Intensification Project (US$12.5 million)
       funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development and RGoB; (ii)
       Accelerated Bhutan Socio- Economic Development (US$700,000 annually) funded by
       RGoB and the European Union (EU); (iii) Remote Rural Communities Development
       Project supported by the International Development Association (IDA) (US$9 million).



                                               18
(iii)    MoAF requested all 205 geogs to make adequate allocations for SLM activities in their
         annual and five year plans. In the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, RGoB gives priority to the
         agricultural sector toward increased food production from Bhutan’s available arable land.
         The plan emphasizes land development and management to mitigate the adverse effects
         of torrential rain, flash floods, and soil erosion, on their small area of arable land.
(iv)     RGoB is currently aligning its National Action Program (NAP) to combat desertification
         with UNCCD’s 10-year strategy. Bhutan may be able to gain access to additional
         financial assistance for SLM from GEF or UNCCD in the future. The NAP alignment
         process is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2013.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

76.      Rating: Satisfactory

77.     A quality assessment of lending portfolio (QALP) on the project was carried out in
October 2008 by reviewers from the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). The team recognized the
main strengths of project design – its participatory mechanism, building block system and
learning by doing. However, the QAG team thought that little attention was given to watersheds
as the centerpiece for planning and implementing interventions towards the achievement of the
GEO. Hence, they rated quality at entry as moderately satisfactory.

78.     The ICR team rated the Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and
appraisal of the project as satisfactory. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank team fully
considered the adequacy of project design and all its major aspects – technical, financial,
economic and institutional – as well as procurement, financial management and safeguards. A
number of design alternatives were considered. Because of the limited experience in
implementing similar projects in Bhutan, 27 the pilot and scaling up approaches gave space for
learning and adaptive management decisions. The lack of experience with the project
approaches justified the lengthy preparation. The participation of the communities and local
officials ensured that the design would be acceptable to the project beneficiaries. Hence, it was
necessary to spend a lot of time interacting and consulting with the communities in the project
sites. Resources were insufficient to collect data for all elements and variants necessary to
calculate sedimentation at the watershed level. In view of the challenges related to country size,
remoteness and capacity, the attention paid to achieving the GEO by measuring the reduction of
runoff and soil loss was adequate and realistic. The team did not lose sight of the need for better
watershed management as the country’s capacity in terms of technology and knowledge
increased.


27
   There were no community-driven development projects financed by the Bank in Bhutan from which lessons could be drawn to
address the implementation challenges. The only Bank-financed project that was in place at the time of project preparation was
the Bhutan Decentralized Rural Development Project (approved in 2005) which focused on rural access and irrigation. While the
latter informed the project design, many approaches applied under the project were not relevant or applicable to SLMP.


                                                             19
79.     Project preparation was carried out with a sufficient number of specialists who provided
the technical skill mix necessary to address sector issues and develop the project design. The
Bank provided adequate resources – staff time and funding – to ensure the quality of preparation
and appraisal. The team recognized the importance of consistency with the CAS and
government priorities in the sector. The Bank maintained a consistently good working
relationship with the Borrower and its institutions during preparation and appraisal.

(b) Quality of Supervision

80.    Rating: Satisfactory

81.      The QAG team rated Bank supervision as satisfactory vis-à-vis development
effectiveness, supervision inputs and processes as well as candor and realism of the
Implementation Status Reports (ISR). The reviewers found that implementation was generally
proceeding well at the time of their assessment. Some initial problems with procurement,
monitoring and reporting were resolved and the ongoing issue with flow of funds to project
localities was addressed. The supervision team was adequate because of the strong participation
of procurement and financial management specialists as well as environment and social
specialists from the Delhi and Washington offices. Some team members were involved in other
activities in Bhutan, allowing for economies of scale and solid knowledge of the country
conditions. QAG felt that the task team gave priority to developing the institutional capacity and
mechanisms required for SLM at both the community and national levels. The QAG report
stated that the project’s systems for budgeting, fund flows, internal control, accounting, reporting,
and audit were generally adequate for mitigating any risk of fraud and corruption.

82.     The ICR team rated project implementation of the project as satisfactory. The
supervision skill mix was appropriate for a project of this nature since it included technical,
environmental, social development, procurement, and financial management specialists. The
supervision team provided adequate direction to the client toward the achievement of the PDO.
Sufficient budget and staff resources were made available for supervision. The task team alerted
RGoB and NSSC about issues that emerged during implementation and facilitated prompt
corrective action. The ISR ratings on achievement of the PDO and GEO and implementation
progress were realistic.

83.     The Bank’s procurement and financial management staff worked regularly with NSSC
staff to explain the applicable fiduciary policies and procedures. The recommendations of the
MTR of September 2008 were implemented and led to improved project performance. Although
the task team monitored safeguard compliance, the team did not include a Social Development
Specialist in the latter part of the project for budget reasons.

84.     The Bank’s counterparts acknowledged the quality of the overall implementation support
provided by the task team and the extent of Bank support toward meeting the project objectives.
On the other hand, the client felt that the Bank could have provided better support on the
fiduciary aspects in the early stages of implementation. Also, the quality of the Bank’s




                                                20
engagement could have been more effective if the task team had participated in field monitoring
to guide local level implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

85.    Rating: Satisfactory

86.    In view of the satisfactory rating for quality at entry and of supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated as Satisfactory in accordance with the Independent Evaluation Group’s
(IEG) harmonized rating criteria.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

87.    Rating: Satisfactory

88.     As mentioned in Section 2.1, RGoB demonstrated its commitment to the objectives of the
project starting with preparation. That commitment was maintained throughout implementation
as demonstrated by the quality of the government’s performance. RGoB responded effectively
and promptly to resolve issues as and when they arose. RGoB officials worked closely and
regularly with the Bank's project team. Their performance was satisfactory because of the
dedication and strong technical capacity of the project management team (PMT). In addition, a
field coordinator was assigned in each of the three dzongkhags. There were no problems with
the allocation of financial resources to the project although there were some difficulties with the
timely flow of funds to the pilot geogs in the early stages of implementation (described and
justified earlier) that were subsequently resolved.

89.    MoAF played an active role in project implementation by providing policy guidance to
the PMT. The relevant Ministries, departments and NSSC coordinated and consulted with each
other systematically. Appropriate levels of review and approval were in place and the review
processes were timely. Financial accountability and follow-up were observed, expenditures were
duly authorized before they were incurred and documentation was maintained properly for
periodic review.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

90.    Rating: Satisfactory

91.     NSSC consistently demonstrated its commitment to implementation and resolution of
issues. Fiduciary performance was mixed. Financial management was initially rated as
moderately unsatisfactory because of the delay in the fund flows. On the other hand, the project
was designed to be flexible and allow for learning and improvements. The cause of the delay
was resolved and, during the project’s last four years, financial management was rated as
satisfactory. The submissions of the quarterly Interim Unaudited Financial Reports were timely.
The flow of funds between the Designated Advance Account and the PMT was satisfactory.
There were no reports of any delays in fund releases or shortfalls. On the other hand,


                                                21
procurement compliance was inconsistent due to poor management of procurement records.
However, the procurement post reviews did not find any significant deviations from agreed
procedures or lack of necessary documentation.

92.      The PMT at NSSC was effective in performing project management, safeguards
compliance, M&E and reporting. NSSC regularly monitored the results framework and updated
and shared the results monitoring matrix with the Bank. The PMT conducted regular monitoring
visits to the project geogs and achievements were well documented through posters, brochures,
workshop reports, manuals, etc. NSSC submitted all required quarterly and annual reports in a
timely manner. The reports provided valuable feedback on the project’s progress and served as
useful inputs to Bank supervision missions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

93.    Rating: Satisfactory

94.    With satisfactory ratings for Government performance and NSSC performance, overall
borrower performance is rated satisfactory in accordance with IEG’s harmonized rating criteria.
At the time of project closure, the Borrower had complied with all agreed grant requirements
toward the PDO and GEO achievement.

6. Lessons Learned

95.     A simple and flexible project design is important for a country with limited resources
and prior experience that was still developing its approach to address a national priority. Such a
design recognizes the need for allowing sufficient time for capacity building to become fruitful
and for the implementing agencies to take on increasingly complex activities at the right time. It
is adaptive to the changing needs of beneficiaries and decision-makers. Learning by doing or
piloting during the early stages of the project in a new area of intervention is critical to building
the knowledge and expertise of the project team, local officials and the communities prior to
scaling up the project in a larger geographical area.

96.      The multi-sectoral approach adopted by the project proved to be an effective means of
managing natural resources. The wellbeing of the environment and natural resources is
fundamental to the long-term sustainability of many sectors. Hence, bringing practitioners from
various sectors together, creating and enhancing synergies, promoting collective processes and
encouraging adaptation to joint decision-making are basis to the project’s success. The
appointment of a multi-sectoral technical advisory team centrally ensures that the technical
knowledge for implementing project activities is consolidated and made available to field level
staff to build strong ownership of the project among stakeholders. Collaboration among relevant
ministries and agencies, as well as with other donor agencies on sectoral, as well as cross-
sectoral issues can help address them expeditiously. The synergy created by this collaboration
and cooperation enables the government to carry out related policy changes more effectively.

97.    Providing short-term livelihood incentives to communities facilitated the effective
adoption of natural resource management practices. For a project where the activities are



                                                 22
labor-intensive and most of the impacts are long-term, providing short-term livelihood incentives
raises the willingness of communities to adopt new techniques and ease the burden on the most
vulnerable groups. When the benefits are realized, the need to continue with the short-term
incentives diminishes substantially. Training and awareness raising and developing clear
linkages to livelihood outcomes enable community understanding of the significance of the
project interventions. Close and continued interaction with the communities for a considerable
amount of time helps to change their attitudes and behaviors towards the adoption of new
technologies with long-term benefits.

98.    The use of existing institutional structures for project implementation instead of
creating a separate project management unit is effective when implementing institutional
capacity building projects. The approach encourages institutional enhancements after the project
closure and instills project ownership within the country. Disruptions to project implementation
would need to be minimized by limiting the turnover of key project staff. To ensure continuity,
key staff should be appointed for the entire project period. When this is not possible, the
availability of proper documentation and handover arrangements (including overlap between
incoming and outgoing staff) must accompany staff changes for the continuation of systems,
procedures and documentation.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

99.    Comments were requested from Secretary of MoFA, Director General of Department of
Agriculture, Director General of Department of Public Accounts and Secretary of GNHC.

100. There were no specific comments for the draft ICR from the Secretary of MoFA, Director
General of Department of Agriculture and GNHC. Few minor comments were shared by the
Program Officer for the World Bank Projects in Bhutan on behalf of the Department of Public
Accounts correcting a reference to an on-going project and providing two suggestions for NSSC
(refer to Annex 7 for details). Further, MoAF considered that this project was one of the most
successful projects implemented by MoAF so far. It was indicated that MoAF and Department
of Agriculture are fully committed to scaling up or replicating the good lessons and experiences
gained through the project to other parts of the country and possibility of getting this done is
being explored quite vigorously. Appreciation were also provided to the World Bank for its
support in getting the project successfully implemented and ICR team for evaluating the project
positively encouraging RGoB to take forward SLM.

(b) Cofinanciers

The DANIDA representative in Bhutan was approached for comments on SLMP and the
response was that no specific comments for the report.

28
   The total baseline cost given in the cost table in Annex 5 of the PAD is incorrect where the total should be US$ 6.348 million,
but shown as US$ 6.328 million. There is also a US$ 0.024 million difference between the total of the component costs
(US$ 7.64 million) shown as appraisal estimates above including physical and price contingencies (Annex 4 of the PAD), which
is different to actual total financing (USD 7.664 million). Therefore, the percentage of appraisal above has not accounted for the
US$ 0.024 million, which cannot be reconciled at this point.
29
   Actual/latest estimate appears high as compared to the appraisal estimate. This is because of the varying exchange rates. Here
we have used 2005 exchange rate (Nu. 44.91 = 1 US$), whereas it has varied so much over the years and the last exchange rate
before the project came to end, i.e. as of June 29, 2013 was Nu. 59.30 = 1 US$. As a result there was extra Ngultrum (Nu) to
spend.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component I: Pilot projects to demonstrate effective application of land degradation
prevention approaches.

Key Outputs

1. Development of GIS-based analytical tools, tracking SLM, identifying land degradation
   hot-spots and prioritizing SLM investments. The following outputs improved the natural
   resources and sustainable land management planning and prioritizing investments both at
   local and national levels.

   •   The GIS Section within the NSSC strengthened with well-trained personnel and latest
       technology in terms of equipment and tools.
   •   A SLM Action Planning Manual prepared in 2009.
   •   50 renewable natural resource maps prepared, employing GIS analytical tools, which
       include the resource assessments and socio-economic profiles with full participation of
       chiogs.
   •   National land cover maps updated in 2010.

2. Improvement of income of local farmers and agricultural productivity gains. There were
   interventions that were successful in generating cash and improving the livelihood of the
   communities. Smart agriculture practices such as terracing, stone bunding, agro-forestry,
   farmer-groups, improved farm yard manure, orchard development and water source
   protection significantly benefitted farmers in the project areas. Other equally important
   interventions such as irrigation channel renovation, monetary incentives, bamboo plantations,
   community forests, fodder base improvement and poultry farms also resulted in gains.
   Livelihood outputs and related achievements due to project were as following:

   •   Growing a variety of vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, beans, etc. in a kitchen garden
       (tshesa) reduced dependence on non-wood forest products, and diversified the household
       diet.
   •   Cultivation of potatoes as cash crop was significant for livelihoods of the communities.
       Farm yard manure (FYM) / dairy sheds and improvement of agriculture land provided
       direct socio-economic impact.
   •   FYM/dairy sheds, stone bunding and citrus orchards were aimed at long-term impact that
       will lead to structural and physical improvement of land. In addition, they will not depend
       on continued short-term inputs other than maintenance.
   •   FYM sheds (1,555 numbers) resulted in better cash income from the sale of milk, butter
       and cheese, through improved animal production due to better fodder availability and
       improved sheds. In addition, 16 breeding bulls were supplied to the farmers. Besides the
       cash, the workload of farmers was reduced with the improved fodder availability that
       replaced the cumbersome fodder collection from the forest.
   •   Cultivation of ginger (cash crop) was an important source of cash income for the
       communities of Phuentsholing, Logchina and Bongo geogs, under the Chhukha district.


                                               26
         In combination with structural and vegetative SLM interventions such as hedgerows,
         stone bunding and bench terracing on very steep slope sections, ginger cultivation proved
         more sustainable.
   •     Improved varieties of staple crops such as maize, paddy and wheat greatly contributed to
         better yields. Especially in remote communities like Goshing, seed quality was
         mentioned as a major issue for land users and supply of better seeds clearly benefited the
         households involved.
   •     The project provided 48 post-harvest machineries and 914 sets of agricultural tools to
         reduce post-harvest loss of produce and to increase the efficiency of farming without
         compromising the sustainability of the land.
   •     The project supported the improvement of 83km of irrigation channels. Larger areas of
         paddy were irrigated with higher yield as planting was carried out on time.
   •     Bamboo plantations developed to an important income source in geogs where bamboo
         was a key intervention, such as in Radhi. Bamboo is now listed second highest income
         source after paddy (the traditional key income source) bringing down bhurra weaving to
         third place.
   •     165 poultry and piggery enterprises were set up by the project. Small-scale poultry
         enterprises aimed at the production of eggs was a relatively new activity for income
         generation. A number of groups were formed to collectively manage a poultry enterprise
         as well as marketing of products.
   •     A beekeeping group was formed in Logchina geog in the Chhukha district to promote
         improved beekeeping practices with modern wooden beehive boxes, which facilitated
         practical and hygienic management. A total of 1,404 improved beehive boxes were
         provided by the project. An agreement was made with a private firm, Bio Bhutan to buy
         the honey.

Key Outputs

1. Scaling up of SLM practices in new geogs. Activities such as natural resource surveying and
   mapping and training of dzongkhag and geog officials were undertaken as part of the initial
   ground preparation. Natural resource maps were prepared for all 88 chiogs. Scale up
   practices were implemented in the 6 additional geogs by further incorporating SLM activities
   in the annual plans. Another 23 geogs outside the project areas also undertook SLM practices
   with the project support. A total of 6,435 acres of vulnerable land improved and 5,082 acres
   of ex-tseri land converted to sustainable use (please refer to table 2.4 and 2.5 for details).

2. Resolving inter- and intra-dzongkhag conflicts over resource use. The project actively
   supported in addressing forest use issues in collaboration with the National Land
   Commission and the rangeland management issues in partnership with Social Forestry
   Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests. The rangeland management study
   contributed to documentation of conflicts 30 with special reference to the Sheytemi conflict in
   Radhi geog. Further, trainings and seminars were organized on conflict management and
   effective practices and appreciation on preventing land degradation measures to the geog and
   dzongkhag staff. Resource use conflict management at the local level was put in place for all
   project sites. The policy changes and local level regulatory agreements helped to reduce the
   number of conflicts. In addition, the project created a forum for the community members to
   discuss issues with the assistance of local authorities and extension staff. By final year of the
   project, except for minor issues there were no significant conflicts among the resource users.

3. Awareness and capacity building of staff and farmers in sustainable land management.
   The project was successful in building both institutional and human resource capacity at
   different levels of the government. The project sponsored 9 Masters Degrees and 7 Post
   Graduate Diplomas. As shown in Table 2.6, 64 short-term trainings were undertaken and 223
   study tours were conducted for a total of 1,012 beneficiaries. Farmer training both in-country
   and out of Bhutan, benefitted 17,237. As part of institutional strengthening and coordination
   among stakeholders, annual review workshops were conducted every year attended by the
   World Bank Mission team, SLMP MTAC members, PMT members, representatives from the
   research and development centers, Dzongkhag planning officers and RNR sector heads of
   three pilot dzongkhags, extension agents from scale up and pilot geogs and field
   coordinators.

  The conflicts were mainly due to resource use such as how much to extract, who can extract, etc. by different individuals and
communities due to lack of policy guidance and regulations.

Component III. Policy support and guidance for mainstreaming of land degradation
prevention practices.

Key Outputs

1. Including SLM planning guidelines in the Tenth Five-Year Plan and Eleventh Five-Year
   Plan: PMT and MTAC brought lessons learnt and feedback from geog level to central level
   through discussions during the preparation of Tenth Five-Year Plan and then subsequently
   incorporated them in the geog plans. RNR Five-Year Plan included a national program for
   SLM for most geogs. The “one geog three products” plans adopted as a core activity in the
   Tenth Five-Year Plan also included SLM activities. The SLM content in the Tenth Five-Year
   Plan was stronger than the Ninth Five-Year Plan with SLM targeted programs and activities.
   The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2013-2018) integrated SLM approaches in different sectors


                                                    31
    and administrative levels. SLM activities were included in the NAP which required the
    project activities to align with UNCCD 10-year strategy. Likewise, the Remote Rural
    Communities Development Project within the Policy and Planning Division of MoAF also
    included components on SLM activities, further contributing to land degradation prevention.
    The land management campaigns continued as part of the regular agriculture development
    interventions across the country and were conducted annually thus helping in mainstreaming
    of SLM beyond the project sites.

2. Including SLM planning processes and components in the nine target geogs: Nine geogs,
   three from each of Zhemgang, Chhukha, and Trashigang dzongkhag incorporated SLM
   action planning processes into their annual development planning processes. The project
   introduced comprehensive planning approaches with a range of tools originating from
   Participatory Rural Appraisal and Participatory Learning and Action such as problem census,
   history lines and participatory mapping. This approach with its illustrative character and
   consultative nature empowered grassroots level communities. Even those considered illiterate
   actively engaged in this approach.

3. Sectoral level policies incorporating SLM principles: SLMP principles were significantly
   incorporated into policy and legal reforms through the revised Land Act of Bhutan 2007,
   National Land Policy 2010 and National Forest Policy of Bhutan 2011. The Land Act of
   Bhutan 2007 contains several revised clauses relevant to sustainable land management. A
   review of government policies and plans in Bhutan relating to sustainable land management
   were carried out and published. SLM principles were integrated into the national
   development and environmental framework via the National Capacity Self-Assessment, the
   National Adaptation Program of Action and the National Biodiversity Action Plan.

4. Local level resource management system adopting SLM outcomes: Formulating at least 10
   local level resource management regulatory agreements for geogs and local communities for
   SLM outcomes was the first target under this initiative. At project closure, a total of 140 local
   level resource management regulatory agreements were put in place. This included the
   establishment and certification of community forests, as well as community concurrence and
   agreements with water user associations and by-laws for the water source protection.

Component IV. National level support for coordination of implementation of land
degradation prevention practices

Key Outputs

1. Sector agency annual plans incorporating SLM: Various activities were undertaken such as
   the Livelihood Analysis Survey for the scaling-up geogs and the development of the Land
   Bill of Bhutan 2007. The project supported geog planning and implementation of the Land
   Cover Mapping Project, which started in 2008 and completed in 2010. Maps of geogs,
   dzongkhag and national atlases were printed. These were widely distributed, used by all
   agencies for planning and used for informed decision making. The project also supported the
   development of the Land Policy document ensuring proper management and administration
   of limited arable land and the pristine environment of the country.

2. Developing a system for data modeling and management for natural resource management
   and decision making. The project with the technical assistance of data management and
   modeling experts from the University of Washington supported the development of DrukDIF
   to organize, store and make accessible natural resources management data from the project
   sites. It is a valuable tool to facilitate informed decision-making on natural resource use and
   trade-offs and could facilitate policy and planning for natural resource management. In
   addition, the DrukDIF was linked to a spatially disaggregated (distributed) hydrological
   model to permit the data to be used for land cover and land use change projections as well as
   to assess the likely impacts of climate change on agriculture and natural resource dynamics.

3. NSC and MTAC to support planning and mainstreaming multi-sectoral SLM approaches:
   The project gained an excellent reputation among various stakeholders for its unique feature
   of using a multi-sectoral approach that caters to integrated farming needs of communities.
   SLM interventions holistically cover all three RNR sectors of agriculture, livestock and
   forestry. NSC and MTAC guided and advised the PMT and field officers on project delivery
   and technical issues through meetings, workshops, seminars and field visits.

4. Making the project structure functional: The six-year project exhibited exemplary functional
   and administrative benchmarks and achievements with the multi-sectoral advisory committee
   and the National steering committee as management heads. Fund transfer at the initial years
   of the project was directly from the center to the project field coordinators and later disbursed
   through the Gup’s 31 office. Additional funds were sent based on completion reports

   incorporating expenditure and project activity reports. Disbursements followed regular
   government norms by adhering to existing geog and dzongkhag administration rules,
   regulations and guidelines. Effective monitoring and evaluation procedures were in place
   with geog SLM planning teams (GSPTs) submitting progress reports and keeping all
   administration levels informed. The SLM activities beginning with GIS-based maps
   identifying “hotspots” that need urgent land degradation preventive practices were well
   adopted and appreciated by farmers in the project geogs. SLM manuals and digitization were
   completed. These facilitated the planning and implementation process. The unique SLM
   feature incorporating a multi-sectoral approach helped mainstream land concerns in the main
   planning process. Further, the phase-wise approach starting with pilot, scaled up and other
   SLM activities benefitted all stakeholders with planning capabilities, opportunities to share
   lessons learnt and equitable distribution of benefits. All nine geogs received formidable
   support, proving the proper functioning of the project.

5. Fully functional and well-defined financial, monitoring and information management system
   in place: A simple, but informative M&E system was used to monitor project performance
   and capture achievements. The GSPTs communicated information through the quarterly
   project activity progress reports aligned with the GNHC PLAMS. In addition, the GSPTs
   also carried out participatory monitoring and evaluation and its learning and experiences
   were used in improving the plan.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Scope of Economic Analysis and Data Sources

The scope of the economic analysis was defined by the project boundaries, i.e. the
beneficiaries and land area directly reached by the project, even though it was acknowledged
that economic benefits were generated well beyond this boundary. With this conservative
approach the economic analysis represents only a lower bound estimate for the total economic
benefits generated by the project. Therefore, it increases the robustness of the quantitative
analysis as several benefits are excluded, but could potentially be added. Where data was not
readily available for the project site, comparable data from other sites or studies was used and is
indicated accordingly.

While the economic analysis carried out at PAD stage only included economic benefits
resulting from slowing the rate of deforestation, this economic analysis included two separate
benefit estimations: income improvements by local farmers and ecosystem service
enhancements. Further, the quantitative assessment only considers benefits where numerical
data can be obtained for the project sites. Economic benefits derived through, for example,
capacity building and mainstreaming of SLM in overall policies was included as the
quantification of such benefits would be rather difficult.

The quantitative analysis of SLM benefits was built on a variety of data sources. Economic
parameters of rural farm households were obtained from the Bhutan Living Standard Survey
2012 and parameters of the project beneficiaries were provided from borrowers’ independent
evaluation. It was noted that the project reached more beneficiaries than originally anticipated,
which in itself is already noted as a great success.

The annual economic benefits of ecosystem service enhancements were approximated on a per
capital basis. Using the total annual economic value provided by Kubiszewski et al. (2013)32
estimated an annual economic value per capita of ecosystem services of USD 10,400. Increment
assumption compared to the without project scenario of 1%, 2%, and 5% was applied assuming
that the adoption of SLM would lead to incremental increases of 1%, 2%, and 5%. This was
only a partial estimate that leaves out many other sources of benefits to the people, including
social and cultural values. It also excluded the provision of goods as these were calculated
separately as increases in crop yields.

Estimating yield increases due to the adoption of SLM practices is a key parameter for
simulating the economic impacts of the project. However, as such data was not available for
the project site and data from other studies had to be used. A global review of SLM literature
conducted by Branca et al. (2013) 33 indicated that the adoption of sustainable land management

generally leads to increased yields, although the magnitude and variability of results varies by
specific practice. Yield effects can vary and in some cases negative for improved fallows,
terraces, minimum tillage, and live fences. Cover crops, organic fertilizer, mulching, and water
harvesting were found to have consistently positive yield effects. Rainfall distribution is a key
determinant of the yield effects of sustainable land management adoption, and the yield results
are generally found to be higher in areas of low and variable rainfall. Isolating the yield effects of
individual practices is complicated by the adoption of combinations or “packages” of sustainable
land management practices. UNCCD (2009) 34 estimated that 16% reduction of global yields can
be attributed to soil degradation and water scarcity. Nkonya et al. (2011) 35 estimated yield
losses due to salinity of soils to be around 22% for India and Peru. For Peru, the same source
suggests a decrease of maize yields of about 2% due to soil erosion on sloped lands.
Consequently with accounting for the complex structure of multiple benefits of SLM affecting
yields, the simulation of costs and benefits will consider yield increases of 5% and 10% for crops
only.

Other parameters assumed for the cost-benefit analysis were the discount rate and simulation
period for the analysis. To account for the sensitivity of simulation results to the choice of the
discount rate, rates of 5%, 10%, and 20% were chosen. In line with the economic analysis
carried out at PAD stage, a 20-year time horizon was used for the simulation. Table 3.1 provides
a quick summary of all parameters used for the analysis.

Project costs were approximated using the investment costs of the project totaling USD7.66
million. According to the disbursement progress anticipated by the project team, total costs were
distributed as follows: USD 0.25 million (year 1), USD 1.08 million (year 2), USD 1.24 million
(year 3), USD 1.14 million (year 4), USD 1.50 million (year 5), USD 1.43 million (year 6) and
USD 1.01 (year 7).

Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was applied for this benefit assessment. CBA provides a set of
procedures for comparing benefits and costs and is traditionally associated with government
intervention and with the evaluation of government action and government projects. The
underlying rationale for CBA is rational choice, i.e. a rational agent will weigh up the costs and
benefits of any proposed activity and will only undertake the activity if the benefits exceed the
costs. CBA must include all the costs and all the benefits to whomsoever accruing. Thus, the
definition instructs that whether the costs or benefits are marketed or not, makes no difference. In
other words, even if some of the costs or benefits are not exchanged in markets at all, hence do
not have a price, they may still be of value. This provides the basis for the inclusion of
environmental and wider social impacts in cost-benefit analyses of energy projects and policies.
In many cases, the costs and benefits of a project or policy will arise at different points in time.
This provides the basis for a technique known as ‘discounting’ which allows future costs and
benefits to be compared with those in the present. Economic indicators that were used for this
analysis are Net-Present Value (NPV) and Benefit-Cost Ratio (B/C-Ratio).

The consideration of the With and Without project situation is important in CBA. For example,
a slowing but continuation of soil erosion is a benefit that can be quantified by the amount of
incremental yield that is not lost compared to the without project situation. Likewise, if
household incomes can remain stable under a project situation compared to a possible negative
trend due to declining agricultural productivity, climate change and other possible impact factors,
this also represents an incremental benefit achieved by the project. The incremental change
between with and without situation was estimated as a percentage difference of the baseline.

Results

Income data provided by the BLSS 2012 was used to approximate increases in income
triggered by yield increases that were due to the adoption of SLM practices. The data is
depicted in Table 3.2. Income from cereal, fruit and vegetables makes up about 17% of the
average rural household income in Bhutan amounting to about USD 350 annually.

The simulation results confirmed the positive economic impact of the project for most of the
parameter combinations. The economic calculation yielded a negative result only for the high
discount rate scenario (20%) and low incremental benefits of ecosystem service provision under
the project situation (2% incremental increase). However, this still excluded many benefits,
especially those related to capacity building and mainstreaming of SLM into government policies
which would achieve benefits beyond the target population of the project. Tables 3.3, 3.4 and
3.5 summarize the simulation results.

Discussion

This ex-post economic analysis of the Sustainable Land Management project confirmed the
economic feasibility of the project. It was discussed that many benefits reached beyond the
project boundaries, such as positive impacts on hydropower generation or the sequestration and
storage of carbon. SLM also provided important amenity values that are important for enhancing
the nature-based tourism potential of Bhutan. The economic analysis takes account of these
values by using the values for ecosystem services reported by Kubiszewski et al. (2013).
However, as these were per capita values and only the population reached by the project was
considered, these values may be still underestimated.


                                                 38
It demonstrated that investments in SLM were beneficial and that a scaling-up of this SLM
project should be considered beyond the project phase. By choosing a conservative approach
when approximating economic values, limiting the quantitative valuation to only a few direct
benefits and limiting it strictly to the target population reached by the project, the results were
robust as they likely still underestimate the true economic impact of the project. However, given
data constraints, additional economic impacts can only be discussed in qualitative form, mainly
those arising from capacity building and mainstreaming as they are expected to positively
influence the adoption of SLM practices far beyond the project boundaries in the coming years.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

A beneficiary survey was conducted by the independent consultant hired by the borrower or the
preparation of the borrower evaluation report. The survey was undertaken on a sample basis to
obtain feedback from beneficiaries. Structured questionnaires designed for three different distinct
groups in the field were employed to assess benefits and perceptions. Relevant key findings of
the survey are presented below:

Samples of chiogs and households were randomly drawn from two pilot geogs of Nangkor and
Radhi, three scaled-up geogs of Bongo, Lumang and Goshing, and two Land Management
Campaign sites, namely Thridangbi and Kilikhar in Mongar employing simple random sampling.
From each of the five geogs, 35% of the total chiogs were randomly selected and likewise 35%
of households from each of the selected chiogs were randomly chosen for the beneficiary survey.
Table 5.1 and 5.2 provides the overview of the beneficiaries and stakeholders surveyed and
gender based distribution of farmer respondents respectively.

Component I: Pilot projects to demonstrate effective application of land degradation
prevention approaches

The SLMP directly and positively impact on the livelihood of the communities by way of
growing a variety of vegetables through improved soil fertility. Given the steep gradient of fields,
SLM contributed to conserving soil fertility avoiding loss of topsoil through various
interventions. Interventions on smart agriculture practices such as terracing, stone bunding, agro-
forestry, farmer-groups, improved farmyard manure, orchard development and water source
protection immensely benefitted farmers in the project areas. Other equally important
interventions such as irrigation channel renovation, monetary incentives to attract farm labor,
bamboo plantations, community forests, fodder base improvement, poultry farms also benefitted
from adopting sustainable land management activities.

Potato and ginger were two key cash crops that were listed in almost all villages as significant
for livelihoods of the communities, which were supported as part of short-term benefits. In
combination with structural and vegetative sustainable land management interventions such as
hedgerows, stone bunding and bench terracing, ginger cultivation were considered as a more
sustainable and viable income generating farm activity. Specifically ginger continued to be an
important source of cash income for the communities of Logchina and Bongo geogs. Market
demand for potatoes and ginger are on the rise but lack of good roads and high transaction cost
continue to pose challenges to profitable ventures.

Improved cattle sheds as one of the SLM activities resulted in better cash income from the sale
of milk, butter and cheese. The animal production was also improved due to better fodder
availability and improved cattle sheds. Besides the cash income, it reduced workload of farmers
because of readily available fodder, replacing cumbersome fodder collection from the distant
forest. This also reduced grazing pressures to vulnerable land. The stone bunds resulted in


                                                 44
increased yields through preventing topsoil erosion, improved workability and larger area for
annual cropland development. The citrus orchards initially supported by the project were found
to be closing the fruiting stage.

Table 5.3 shows that 96.55% of respondents in Bongo, 97.5% percent in Goshing, 91.67% in
Nangkor, and 100% in Radhi and Lumang were of the opinion that SLMP enhanced the
livelihood of farmers. This was attributed to SLM key interventions such as vegetable production,
payment for contractual services, improved dairy sheds, farmyard manure and poultry. However
8% of people in Nangkhor seem less happy as soya beans supplied performed poorly and were
largely infested with insects.

The survey also indicated that vegetable production generated the highest cash income for
farmers followed by poultry, piggery and dairy (refer to Table 2.1 in Annex 2.

Component II: Mainstreaming of practices for protection against land degradation.

SLMP was designed as a community-based project to build awareness and capacity of rural
communities to recognize and address land-based problems using a sequential and integrated
series of participatory approaches. The general feedback on these approaches as applied for SLM
at community and municipality level were positive based on the responses from all key
stakeholders met during the consultation period.

As shown in Table 5.5 all of the respondents in all geogs indicated that the trainings carried out
by SLMP were relevant and useful. Farmers responded that training programs on SLM activities
were highly beneficial to them, in terms of enhancing their knowledge and skills and also in
changing their attitudes towards SLM and its adoption.

From the two questions asked from GSPTs, Agricultural Extension Officers, Livestock
Extension Officers, Forest Rangers and GSPs (as depicted under Table 5.6), it was inferred that
the beneficiaries who were exposed to multiple trainings were more confident in extending SLM
knowledge to the farmers.

Component III: Policy support and guidance for mainstreaming of land degradation
prevention practices

The land management campaigns continued as part of the regular agriculture development
interventions. They were carried out annually, thus helping in mainstreaming SLM with the core
plans and programs, as well as dissemination of knowledge to farming communities, RNR staff
and local authorities.

According to Table 5.8, respondents comprising gups, geog administration officers, and
mangmis said SLM activities can be sustained even after the project is over, because they are
increasingly incorporated into the Five-Year Plans.

It was noted that only a few farmers with large landholdings and abundant resources were in a
position to appreciate long-term benefits that will emerge after a number of years post-project
period. On the other hand, smallholders and marginal farmers were keen to pursue on SLM
practices that bring immediate benefits or gains that were otherwise impeded by socioeconomic
hardships. Therefore, two-tier approach was successful as it facilitated long-term interventions
such as orchard plantations, agro-forestry, afforestation and bench terracing while providing
direct short-term benefits such as distribution of improved seeds and farming tools and
equipment.

The survey results as shown in Table 5.9, reported that over 90% of farmers in all nine geogs
stated that SLM activities will be sustainable and will continue even after the project ends. This
was a positive indication towards sustainability. Three out of the five geogs sampled indicated
their willingness to continue SLM activities (Table 5.10).

Executive Summary of Borrower’s Evaluation Report – October 22, 2013

The Kingdom of Bhutan is a small landlocked country in the Eastern Himalayas with an area of
38,394 km2 and a population of 720,679. Located within the Himalayan range, the ecosystems of
Bhutan are fragile and unstable and include about 72.5 percent of snow, barren rocks and forests.
Because of its topography and altitude, Bhutan has inherently limited resources of productive
land. Being a predominantly agrarian society, 79 percent of Bhutan’s population live in rural
areas and subsist on an integrated livelihood system of crop agriculture, livestock rearing, and
use of a wide variety of forest products. Out of the 8 percent arable land available in Bhutan,
only 2.9 percent is actually cultivated. Moreover, the predominantly steep slopes put these
resources at particular risk from some form of degradation or the other. Land degradation is
therefore an even more serious threat in Bhutan than in most places.

The Sustainable Land Management Project started its implementation in 2006 to support the
Royal Government of Bhutan’s efforts to prevent and reverse land degradation and mainstream
sustainable land management into its national development and planning framework. The project
was financed by the Global Environment Facility grant of US$7.66 million through the World
Bank. This was supplemented with a parallel financing from the Danish International
Development Assistance and the Royal Government of Bhutan providing US$ 5.77 million and
US$ 2.46 million respectively. The project’s development objective was to strengthen
institutional and community capacity for anticipating and managing land degradation in Bhutan,


                                               56
while its global environmental objective was to contribute to more effective protection of trans-
boundary watersheds in a manner that preserves the integrity of ecosystems in Bhutan. The
Global Environmental Facility grant has supported four main components to achieve the project
objectives including, 1) pilot projects to demonstrate effective application of land degradation
prevention approaches, 2) mainstreaming of practices for protection against land degradation, 3)
policy support and guidance for mainstreaming land degradation prevention practices, and 4)
national level support for coordination of land degradation prevention practices. The project
implementation completion study covers development outcomes and performance indicators
ranging from sustainability, effectiveness and efficiency of the institutional development and
implementation in order to achieve project objectives. Project evaluation also included
effectiveness of community participation in decision-making, impact of activities carried out
under each component, and compliance towards fiduciary and safeguard requirements.

The project was implemented under the supervision of the National Soil Service Center
structured within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests. Over the last seven years (2006-June
2013) the project has benefitted 3 dzongkhags, 9 gewogs, 138 chiwogs and 4,552 households
corresponding to a total population of 31,274. The multi-sectoral approach and phase-wise
implementation modalities of the project received wide appreciation not only from policy makers
in the center but also from wide quarters in the dzongkhags and gewogs that participated in the
project. The phase-wise approach starting with pilot, scale up and other land management
campaign activities benefitted all stakeholders from the planning to lessons learnt and equitable
distribution of benefits.

The key objective of the Project Implementation Completion Report is to evaluate the overall
Sustainable Land Management Project design and implementation status and process thereof.
The aim of the evaluation is to assess the extent to which the project components and activities
achieved those objectives and determining the exactitude and feasibility of project objectives.
The study also identified institutional, social, environmental, financial and other impacts of the
project at the local level as well at the higher levels resulting from the implementation of the
project.

Component One: Pilot projects to demonstrate effective application of land degradation
prevention approaches

Component One refers to effective applications of land degradation preventive activities under
the three pilot gewogs of Nangkor, Phuentsholing, and Radhi. Main project activities under this
component included supporting a GIS-based biophysical and socioeconomic resource mapping
to identify causes and intensity of land degradation in the area. Pilot gewogs were prioritized on
the basis of the severity of the land degradation, namely extent of deforestation and overgrazing,
improper irrigation water management and type of agricultural practices. The component was
also designed to support community decision making of potential sustainable land management
investments at the chiwog level through capacity building initiatives. These included training of
gewog staff, physical investments at the community level, conducting national and regional
workshops, monitoring and evaluation. Total GEF funding for the component was appropriated
at US$1.37 million.




                                               57
Under Component One, GIS-based analytical tools such as satellite imagery and topographical
maps were prepared for 47 chiwogs of 3 pilot gewogs and for the 6 scaled-up gewogs. In addition,
land management manuals and 138 renewable natural resource maps were prepared of which 48
were digitized and national land cover maps updated. The GIS based technology successfully
identified land degradation “hotspots” and prioritized sustainable investments starting with the
pilot gewogs. Component One also had direct and positive impact on the livelihood of rural
communities by way of growing a variety of vegetables through improved soil fertility and
avoiding loss of topsoil through various sustainable land management interventions. For example,
smart agriculture practices such as terracing, stone bunding, agro-forestry, improved farmyard
manure, orchard development and water source protection immensely benefitted farmers in the
project areas. Other equally important interventions such as irrigation channel renovation,
bamboo plantations, community forests, fodder improvement, poultry farming resulted in huge
gains. Potato and ginger of all cash crops listed in almost all villages as significant for livelihood
income of the communities. Likewise, in other agro-ecological zones, improved cattle sheds
resulted in better cash income from the sale of dairy products through improved animal
production from improved fodder availability. Cash rewards are yet to be realized by some
farmers venturing into citrus orchards considering the long gestation period.

A total of 8,445 acres (3,447 hectares) of vulnerable land was improved through various
sustainable land management interventions such as establishment of community forest and
private forest, water source protection, check dams, bamboo and tree plantation, afforestation,
and legume cropping during the project period. Similarly, a total of 9,173 acres (3,744 hectares)
of ex-tseri land was converted to more sustainable land use through establishment of orchards,
terracing, hedgerows, stone bunding, fodder tree plantation and agroforestry during the project
period.

Component Two: Mainstreaming of practices for protection against land degradation

Component Two involved mainstreaming practices for protection against land degradation
through the introduction of new organizational arrangements for multi-sectoral planning,
capacity and skills development, budgetary realignment, and analytical tools for promoting
sustainable land management approach. The component also supported scaling up activities in
the six additional gewogs. Some of the result indicators under the component include gewogs
independently implementing land degradation and prevention sustainable land management
plans in addition to resolving inter-intra dzongkhag and gewog conflicts. Total Global
Environment Facility funding for Component Two appropriated a budget of US$4.41 million.
Under Component Two scaling up sustainable land management practices in the six additional
gewogs started towards the fourth year of the project with natural resource surveying and
mapping, training of dzongkhag and gewog officials as part of the initial ground preparation.
Adoption of sustainable land management activities by farmers showed encouraging signs;
perhaps contractual payments could be one contributing factor in addition to few beneficiaries
realizing long-term blessings from project activities at their fields. As part of the inter and intra-
dzongkhag conflicts over resource use the project actively supported new policy development on
grazing and forest use issues in collaboration and the studies on rangeland management.
Trainings and seminars on conflict management and practices preventing land degradation were
provided extensively to the gewog and dzongkhag staff. From the beneficiary survey, target on



                                                 58
creating awareness and capacity building of staff and farmers in sustainable land management
was met adequately with 88 percent of pilot dzongkhag Renewal Natural Resource staff and 90
percent of the Dzongkhag Tshogdu members trained in multi-sectoral sustainable land
management.

Component Three: Policy support and guidance for mainstreaming land degradation prevention
practices

Component Three provided policy support and guidance for mainstreaming land degradation
prevention practices in national level policies and plans. The project influenced the Tenth Five
Year Plan by incorporating stronger sustainable land management content as compared to the
Ninth Five Year Plan in terms of targeted programs and activities. The Eleventh Five Year Plan
preparation both at the national and local levels provided substantial opportunities for
strengthening sustainable land management approaches in different sector and administrative
levels. For example, nine gewogs, three each from each of Zhemgang, Chhukha, and Trashigang
dzongkhag incorporated sustainable land management action planning processes into their annual
development planning processes. Sustainable land management activities have a continuous
engagement in nature and since the planning cycle are repeated annually, it gave sufficient time
for farmers to get proper understanding of the objectives, methods and technologies promoted
and introduced under the sustainable land management interventions. In addition, sustainable
land management principles significantly been incorporated into policy and legal reforms
through the revised Land Act of Bhutan 2007, National Forest Policy of Bhutan 2011, and inputs
into the national grazing study. Sustainable land management principles were also integrated into
national development and environmental framework via National Capacity Self-Assessment,
National Adaptation Program of Action and National Biodiversity Action Plan. In addition,
numerous local level resource management guidelines were formulated for gewogs and local
communities including by-laws for community forestry, water user association groups.

Component Four: National level support for coordination of implementation of land degradation
prevention practices

Finally, Component Four supported strengthening the capacity of institutions to effectively
coordinate the implementation of activities for preventing and managing land degradation. An
important aspect of this component was to rationalize the organizational structure of the Ministry
of Agriculture and Forests to enable it to systematically and effectively coordinate between
different sectors and different levels of government to achieve sustainable land management
outcomes. The project was successful in terms of building both institutional and human resource
capacity at different levels of the government by conducting both long-term and short-term
studies.

As part of institutional strengthening and coordination among stakeholders, annual review
workshops were conducted every year with members of the multi-sectoral advisory committee
functioning as a consultative and advisory body. The Sustainable Land Management Project was
successful in mainstreaming sustainable land management activities into broader government
policies and plans, acts and guidelines. For example, the National Action Plan to Combat Land
Desertification offers an institutional set-up that ensures an adequate multi-sectoral



                                               59
representation and interest in sustainable land management as a key underlying theme. Various
activities were undertaken such as the Livelihood Analysis Survey for the scaling-up gewogs and
development of Land Bill of Bhutan. Among others, Component Four also supported gewog
planning and implementation of Land Cover Mapping. Other interventions included support
towards poultry farming, dairy management, community forestry, stonewall terracing, planting
hedgerows, orchard plantations, seed distribution.

Institutional Setup and Project Management

The National Soil Service Center provided main management support and facilitated the
sustainable land management project upon constituting an inter-ministerial Multi-Sectoral


                                                  63
Advisory Committee. A Project Management Team constituting a project director, project
manager and unit heads performed the day-to-day administrative and coordination functions of
the project. At the dzongkhag level, with Dzongda as the Chief Executive Officer, the project
received support and collaboration from Dzongkha Sector Heads namely, Dzongkha Agriculture
Officer, Dzongkha Livestock Officer, Dzongkha Forest Officer, and the Land Record Officer.
Major part of the implementation activities was carried out at the gewog level following standard
local government administrative norms and practices. The Gup as the Chairman, activities were
implemented with assistance from Gewog Sustainable Land Management Planning Teams, Field
Coordinators and village elders.

Capacity building initiatives were undertaken with a total of 17,237 farmers trained and a total of
317 through training of government staff and local leaders. Development of digitized maps, GIS-
trained professionals, farmers and local government officials adopting sustainable land
management policies and field activities were some of the exhibits related to capacity building
and institutional strengthening. Documentation on sustainable land management practices was
undertaken extensively exhibiting lessons learnt, timely field reports and annual publications.
Other achievements under capacity building included construction of improved dairy sheds
(1,150 no.), renovation of irrigation channels (83 Km), supply of improved bee hives (1,404
boxes), supply of breeding bulls (16 no.), developing piggery and poultry combined a total of
165 numbers. Post-harvest machines (48 no.) and agriculture tools (914 sets) were also
distributed.

The financial management system activities were proven efficient after revising the initial fund
flow release mechanisms. Such change in the financial management system was supported by the
trainings and guideline preparation for improved service delivery. The project also followed the
government’s public expenditure management system or PEMS thus facilitating efficient
operations. With the project management team facilitating fund release, the concerned project
officer at the Department of Public Accounts directly transfers the fund to the gewog Letter of
Credit account. Together, procurement requirements were carried out in accordance with the
World Bank’s guidelines on procurement under the IBRD loans and IDA credits and guidelines
for selection and employment of consultants by World Bank Borrowers.

The project exhibited exemplary functional and administrative benchmarks and achievements
with the multi-sectoral advisory committee and the project steering committee as management
heads. Fund transfer at the initial years of the project was directly from the center to the project
field coordinators and later disbursed through the Gup’s office.

Fully functional and well-defined financial, monitoring and information management system
were in place as captured well with the Gewog SLM Planning Teams relaying information on the
quarterly project activity progress reports aligned with the planning and monitoring system
(PLAMS). In addition, the GSPTs carried out in participatory monitoring and evaluation and its
learning and experiences were used in improving the plan. Monitoring of project activities were
closely rendered through monthly reports, plan targets and project objectives, annual review
meetings, Project Management Team and Multi-Sectoral Technical Advisory Committee
supervision.




                                                64
The project adhered to strict environmental compliance standards by following two distinct
screening steps forming a continuous interactive process during planning, implementation,
evaluation and impact assessment. First tier screening was done at a chiwog level with the
second tier screening repeated at the gewog level. Within nine project gewogs, a number of
activities were screened out or implemented with certain modifications to limit negative social
and environmental impacts or proposed fencing support groups. This included, for instance the
group private forest plantation area of Dribla in Thrimshing gewog under Trashigang Dzongkhag.

Participatory monitoring and evaluation was carried out not only at the decentralized level with
the beneficiary communities in all nine SLMP gewogs, but also at project management level with
a range of district and national level stakeholders in the annual review workshops. Specific
monitoring of project activities was carried out based on the project targets and benchmarks
based on set of indicators identified during project designing stage. Similarly, introduction of
social and public accountability mechanisms with the participatory approach in planning,
budgeting and expenditure not only built local capacity but also furthered good governance with
community members collectively exerting social control on performance and equitable
distribution of sustainable land management project activities.

Sustainability

Sustainable Land Management (SLM) is high labor intensive approach that also requires
substantive level of capital financing. The sustainability of the project activities will largely
depend on the availability of resources in terms of budget allocation in future development plans
of gewogs. With farm labor decreasing each year and the discontinuing of funding after the
project period will provide a challenge for farmers to continue taking up sustainable land
management activities. The ability of households to adopt future SLM interventions, as well as
maintain the SLM activities already in place will largely depend on farmers’ capacity to mobilize
the continuous requirement of human and financial resources. One of the main intrinsic
objectives of the project being improving livelihoods and quality of life of farmers, the
establishment of strong informal labor groups and increased social capital contributed immensely
to support community growth and future sustainability. However, only few farmers with large
landholdings and adequate resources are in a position to appreciate long-term benefits deriving
out of the land management activities. It is concluded that the two-tier approach was successful
which facilitated long-term interventions such as orchard plantations, agro-forestry afforestation,
bench terracing alongside direct short-term inputs such as distribution of improved seeds,
farming tools and equipment and payments for contract services. Past reports mentioned that
such a dual approach has proven worthy with a clever sequence of short-term and long-term
interventions to entice farmers to continue.

Sustainability also depends highly on how the farmer groups based organizations are capable of
enhancing the opportunities of the sustainable land management activities as a community and
develop linkages with institutions outside the gewog and even dzongkhag to capture more
opportunities to shape their members socioeconomic development. The longer-term
sustainability of such linkages however, requires adequate support from public resources both
human and capital and strong partnerships with local governments. Further, the sustainability of
these groups also depends on their existing capacities of functioning and organization.



                                                65
Observations deem that no clear exit arrangements and no clear guidelines were formulated to
ensure sustainability of these informal institutions. On the central management front, the
sustainable land management activities are likely to function smoothly with the establishment of
the new SLM unit within the National Soil Service Center, as well as the continued mandate of
and services delivered by the Center.

A sustainability model that was established as part of the evaluation concluded that SLM
activities that have been put in place are sustainable resulting increased income and positively
affecting the productivity of their land resources. Sustainability showed significant dependence
on income (< 2e-16 ***) and productivity (< 2e-16 ***). In addition, sustainability at the farm or
gewog levels will hold true since in the past project intervention years, support in the areas of
group formation has been visible with by-laws, guidelines, joint bank accounts, trainings, etc.
awarded with an aim to make groups self-sustaining.

Lessons learnt

The project design in terms of multi-sectoral approach and phase-wise implementation models
worked well and did not show any signs of serious weaknesses. Such approaches were
instrumental for unleashing the communities’ potential for socioeconomic transformation, as
well as building capacity. The phase-wise implementation of SLM activities provided adequate
time for all stakeholders to learn from the earlier interventions. The broad-based nature of SLM
activities was successful in equitable distribution of benefits in all the nine gewogs right from the
planning stage to implementation by involving the local people.

SLM manuals and GIS-based digitized maps were proven very useful to identify “hotspots” of
degraded areas and facilitated participatory natural resource mapping. The Participatory SLM
Action Planning methodology were proven to be an excellent approach for community-based
planning of SLM, enhancing community commitment and ownership, facilitating inclusion of
local knowledge in decision-making and participation of all households including women.

The participatory approach created conducive environment allowing communities to work
together and build social capital resulting in informal labor groups and adopting a community
approach vis-à-vis household or individual approach. Such participatory approach contributed to
mainstreaming gender, ensuring equity and improvement of livelihoods of the poor. The two-tier
approach comprising of interventions of short-term combined with long-term outcomes pursued
by the project has worked well with beneficiaries being able to accrue immediate benefits in the
process, as well as long-term benefits. This is extremely relevant when the target group is the
most vulnerable and poor. In such instances, more time is needed to understand and accept new
practices.

Planning and fund management at the local level and preparation and submission of reports to
the center not only helped build capacity of farmers on promoting participatory management and
grass root empowerment but also reduced unnecessary bureaucracy, eliminated administrative
bottlenecks and reinforced accountability for project outcomes, placing decision making closer to
the beneficiaries.




                                                 66
It was learnt that SLM activities taught farmers on optimizing usage of the limited agricultural
land through various integrated activities. A great deal of awareness and advocacy on mitigating
land degradation undertaken by the SLMP has built capacity of the farmers appreciating the
long-term benefits of protecting farm land especially in preventing loss of fertile top soil.

The participatory sustainable land management action planning methodology proved its capacity
and suitability as a tailor-made planning approach. However, blanket approaches for planning
purposes was not suited because of the spatial variability and heterogeneity of the Bhutanese
conditions. The approach was considered to be useful for broad Renewable Natural Resource
(RNR) planning and all other spatial planning purposes that affect land use and the land cover of
rural communities.

The SLM implementation was hampered by the remoteness of rural communities and associated
difficulties in reaching the inputs to such communities in time. Further, the lack of labor
availability due to rural-urban migration at the household level is a key constraint for adoption
and successful implementation of project interventions. As a result, vulnerable households face
more constraints to adapt SLM intervention through a combined effect of small land holdings,
the need for direct returns of their limited land holdings, a general lack in farm labor and lack of
access to markets.

Way Forward

It is important to understand combining a package (SLM program) for both short-term and long-
term benefits as practiced towards the later part of the project period will be a critical success
factor.

As short-term interventions, promotion of improved farm yard manure, cattle sheds, stone bunds
and Napier hedgerows are recommended since they proved to generate both beneficial impact on
the land, through reduction of land degradation processes, and at the same time impacted with
direct benefits on the livelihoods of farming households.

The SLM activities such as protecting upstream resources can offer contributions to watershed
protection, which further benefits downstream hydropower generation. Therefore, a future
financial arrangement such as a plough back mechanism or payment for environmental services
would keep farmers encouraged to adopt SLM activities and help contribute towards enhancing
rural cash income generation.

It is important to strengthen the Land Management Unit at the National Soil Service Center and
in the Renewal Natural Resource Centers with adequate staffing and other resources prior to
opening up nodal agencies in the regional research and development centers.

It is proposed that responsible agencies should continue efforts to mainstream sustainable land
management principles into sectoral plans and programs by preparing national level SLM work
plan and budget for the Eleventh Five-Year Plan by compiling plans from gewogs and
dzongkhags, which will be essential for the effective development of SLM approaches. In
addition, for the sustainability of project interventions and learning, SLM approaches and



                                                67
practices should be replicated and scaled up in other parts of Bhutan and included beyond the
Eleventh five-Year Plan.

Sustainable Land Management being a multi-sectoral approach with long-term benefits would
deem continued stakeholder sensitization and awareness creation at all levels starting from the
center to the gewog and chiwog levels.

Efforts should be made to align the national action plan to combat land degradation with the ten-
year strategic plan and framework for the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.
The UNCCD’s ten-year plan sets out operational objectives on issues including awareness
raising, policy framework, science and technology and capacity building to enhance the
implementation of the Convention.

It will also be beneficial to undertake economic assessment of land degradation and sustainable
land management practices and its impacts in Bhutan.
