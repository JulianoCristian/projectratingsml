                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The earning opportunities of the target households (PDO 1) were bolstered by the expanding implementation of livelihood and rural infrastructure subprojects in MRDP 2. In addition,
                         a greater proportion of the most vulnerable households among the targeted beneficiaries were able to avail of the livelihood opportunities provided by the project. The access rate of
                         CFAD resources by women and IP-headed households has reached 70% . Both the mid-term (15%) and end-project (30%) access targets for these households have long been
                         exceeded.

                         The mainstreaming of decentralization reforms, in line with PDO 2, was also well under way. The pilot-testing of the MRP 2-based Interim Operations Manual for LGU engagement
                         has been finished and is being finalized into a DA Harmonized OM (HOM). Meanwhile, the DA Planning Service’s initiative in better integrating Local Development Plans (LDPs) in
                         Regional Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plans (AFMPs) ensured national government support and coordination with local priorities. These initiatives will also be up-scaled
                         and replicated nationwide as part of the PhP500 mn Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP). All these measures ensure that a decentralized system of agri-fishery
                         investment and services will be embedded in the Department's programs and initiatives with the LGUs.

                         The $3.0 million WB/AusAID TA for the MRDP 2 continued to provide much needed capacity-building and training for the implementers of the project in support of PDO two. 2. The
                         TA included building awareness and capacity for harnessing PPPs for the delivery of agri-fishery services and investments, especially by the LGUs.
