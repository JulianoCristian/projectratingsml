 Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project was implemented over 7.5 years, including a two-year extension from its effectiveness on July 3. 2007, to its closing on December 31,
 2014. The goal of implementing MRDP2 across 26 provonces and 225 municipalities was achieved. The results directly attributable to investments
 (monitored through Core Bank Indicators added in agreement with the Bank, November 2012) under the project were extensive and included:
 1. 1,976,694 direct project beneficiaries of whom 49% were women
 2. 111 km of new rural roads were constructed
 3. 1,203km of rural roads were rehabilitated
 4. 688 linear meters of single lane bridges were constructed
 5. 2,175 ha of new irrigation were developed and 2,907 ha of irrigation and drainage were provided with improved irrigation and drainage services
 6. 19 Water used associations formed or strengthened. Some 24,925 people were provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage services of
 whom 7,098 (28%) were women
 7. 104,708 people provide with access to improved water sources
 8. 1800 community water points constructed or rehabilitated
 9. 4,059 CFAD (livelihood & micro-enterprise) sub projects were undertaken involving 180,285 beneficiaries. Of those 46% were women and 24%
 were IPs. Among the IPs some 45% were women
 10. 720 ha (GEF) and 1,031 ha (NRM) of marine and fish sanctuaries have been established
 11. 449 ha (GEF) and 697 (NRM) of mangrove forest have been rehabilitated and protected, and
 12. 994 ha (GEF) and 2,191 (NRM) of agro-forest or 96% of the original target have been rehabilitated and protected
 While the project was a second phase of what was projected to be 15 year program (APL), the institutional reforms supported by the project evolved
 more rapidly than originally envisaged. As such the project has provided the platform on which a nation-wide rural development program has been
 launched under the Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP).

         Achieved: Household real income in the project areas was increased to PhP98,649.00, a 36% increase. Likewise the target of increasing
         average household incomes by 10% above the control was also achieved. Control group real incomes increased to PhP92,609.00 a 10%
         increase compared with the 36% increase in the project areas. The baseline for the Control group was 16% above the baseline for the
         project areas, but household incomes grew more rapidly for project areas and significantly overtook income levels of the control group.
         (Core Indicator: The total number of beneficiaries under the project is estimated at 1,976,694 of whom 49% were women).

               Not Achieved: The Target of 10% increase in coral and sea-grass cover was not achieved. The average coverage of sea-grass in the two
               sample sites was 41%, which represents a 15% decrease from the baseline for those sites. The average cover of live hard coral in the seven
               sample sites was 36%, or an average increase of about 7%. However, one site showed a 150% increase which would seem to be
               unrealistic. Taking out that site, the data suggests as a 16% average decrease in live coral for the sites sampled.

               It was agreed during the 7th Implementation Support Review (January 30 to February 13, 2012) that this indicator was technically impractical
               to measure and it was agreed that DA would request the dropping of the indicator. Although this was subsequently approved by the Project
               Advisory Board, it would seem that due to an oversight, a formal restructuring request to the Bank was never done.

               Achieved. On average for all 25 municipalities studied/ sampled, total agricultural and rural infrastructure investments grew by 93% by
               project completion. Existence of areas that exhibited a decline in agriculture and rural infrastructure investments during MRDP period may
               be due to a shift in the budget priorities or large agricultural expenditures prior to MRDP.

               Government.

               Achieved. The lenght of time needed to reach the market by taking a ride is reduced by 35% after the implementation of FMR subprojects
               compared to the time before. (Core Indicators: 111 km of new rural roads were constructed, 1,203 km of rural roads were rehabilitated, and
               688 linear meters of single lane bridges were built)

               Not achieved. After FMR implementation average produce transportation costs increased by 9% and average passenger fare increased by
               4%. This indicator may well have been inadequate to capture the benefits of more transport options and frequency that often follow
               construction or rehabilitation of roads e.g., from carabao drawn or once-a day large 4-wheel drive trucks to more frequent smaller jeepneys,
               motorized tricycles and buses. Such better service of transport, coupled with the increased cost of fuel may account for the relatively small
               increase in cost. Supporting this is that produce transport costs were 13% higher in non-project areas.

               share of targeted households having water delivered to household premises is increased from 10% at baseline to 72% at the end of the

               private sector increased by 7% on average. Although lower than the target (+25%), the high baseline made it impossible to achieve targeted
               growth,. A satisfactory outcome at 94% was achieved.
