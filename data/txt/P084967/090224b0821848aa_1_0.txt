                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The target household income increase of the project beneficiaries was exceeded by more than 100% by mid-term. Since then, the accomplishment rates of livelihood and rural
                         infrastructure sub-projects, the means through which earning opportunities are expanded, have unfailingly increased by double-digit rates during every Bank mission compared to
                         what were achieved during the preceding mission. The same robust rate of progress has been posted during the 10th Bank Implementation Support Mission . Moreover, the
                         instruments for mainstreaming target reforms are in the process of being finalized and upscaled. The project is, therefore, likely to achieve its development objectives by the extended
                         project closure date of December 31, 2014.

                         The earning opportunities of the target households (PDO 1) are bolstered by the continuing double-digit percentage point increases in both physical accomplishment and
                         disbursement rates. In addition, a greater percentage of the most vulnerable households among the target beneficiaries were able to avail of the livelihood opportunities provided by
                         the project. The access rate of CFAD resources by women and IP-headed households increased from 59% during mid-term to 61% during this latest mission. Both the mid-term
                         (15%) and end-project (30%) access targets for these households have already been exceeded. Currently, about 53% of CFAD beneficiaries are women-headed households.

                         The mainstreaming of MRDP 2 reforms in line with PDO 2 is also well under way. The pilot-testing of the Harmonized DA Interim Operations Manual (IOM) for LGU engagement, and
                         the DA Planning Service’s initiative in better integrating Local Development Plans (LDPs) in Regional Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plans (AFMPs) ensures that there are
                         effective instruments for the institutionalization of the target reforms. The pilot-testing of the IOM is nearly finished and the DA Secretary will form a TWG which will facilitate the
                         finalization of the IOM into a Harmonized OM for DA-LGU Engagements for eventual mainstreaming and use of the whole Department. These reforms will also be up-scaled and
                         replicated nationwide as part of the PhP500 mn Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP). All these measures ensure that a decentralized system of agri-fishery investment
                         and services will be embedded in the Department's programs and initiatives with the LGUs.

                         The $3.0 million WB/AusAID TA for the MRDP 2 continued to provide much needed capacity-building and training for the implementers of the project. The TA is scheduled to close by
                         end-December 2013. However, the 2012 local elections disrupted the schedule of trainings so that an extension of the closing date would be needed in order for the TA to fully
                         complete its programmed activities.
