F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives
The long term APL program’s purpose is to improve incomes and food security in the targeted rural
communities within all of the provinces in Mindanao. The program is focused on strengthening
rural public investment programs (supporting the implementation of the AFMA), reinforcing the
LGC institutional framework, while ensuring close involvement of rural communities in the design
and implementation of public investment programs intended to improve productivity and
livelihoods. Taken together, these initiatives aim to support the GOP’s key objectives of tackling
poverty and ensuring food security.

The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in: (i) improving livelihood
opportunities for targeted communities in Mindanao under the Project; and (ii)
institutionalizing a decentralized system for agriculture and fishery services delivery that
promotes participation, transparency, and accountability.

Global Environment Objectives
The GEF project shares the same overall PDO as the larger IBRD project, namely, (i) improving
livelihood opportunities for targeted communities in Mindanao under the Project; and (ii)
institutionalizing a decentralized system for agriculture and fishery services delivery that promotes
participation, transparency, and accountability. The specific global environment objective of


                                                 4
the Project is to assist the Recipient in conserving critical coastal and marine biodiversity,
supported by sustainable land management in linked upland areas, by removing barriers to
mainstreaming marine and coastal biodiversity conservation; through co-management of
critical marine habitats; and by the introduction of improved, upstream land management
practices that would simultaneously arrest land degradation and benefit landholders who
are predominantly poor farmers, fisher folk, and/or indigenous people.

                 almost 700 to over 1000%. The increases in expenditures were greatest in 2011 and
                 2012 corresponding with the peak in program implementation for RI, CFAD, and
                 NRM subprojects under MRDP2. Based on this data and feedback from LGUs and
                 stakeholders, there has been an upsurge in agricultural sector expenditures across the
                 MRDP2 program areas that has been sustained though not at the same levels as in
                 2011 and 2012..

achievement)    respectively. Savings were therefore computed by comparing the difference
                between the transport costs in non-project areas and project areas at baseline
                with those at project completion. Transport costs were cheaper by
                PhP0.11/kg at baseline in program areas and by PhP0.15 at end of project.
                There was therefore a relative cost savings of PhP0.04/ kg or 36% when
                compared with the relative baseline difference. These savings exceeded the
                target of 10%, although the actual transport cost has increased during the
                period under review, primarily due to general increases in the price of fuel
                and the adjusted passenger fare for public utility vehicles.

                 more reliable availability of irrigation water also encouraged some farm
                 households to put previously idle lands into production. (Core indicators: 2,175

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives
   Design


Context at Appraisal
1.       The project was approved in May 2007 at a time when weak economic performance had
constrained the country’s ability to reduce poverty and meet its development objectives. GDP
growth and investment per capita were among the lowest in the region and the government was
facing a significant fiscal deficit. Reversing this through sustainable economic growth and greater
social inclusion was therefore at the heart of the Medium Term Philippine Development Plan
(MTPDP 2004-2010) and central to the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy 2006-2008
(CAS). The strategic goals of the MTPDP and CAS were to enhance agricultural productivity and
agribusiness, asset [land] reform, responsible management of natural resources and the
environment, and public sector/expenditure rationalization to improve public service delivery.
Promoting poverty reduction and rural growth, specifically in the island of Mindanao where MRDP
was focused, was and continues to be, central to both the Government’s and Bank’s strategic
objectives, given; (i) the island’s distinct climatic and geographic advantages favor agriculture and
fisheries, (ii) a large proportion (almost a third) of the country’s poor live there, and (iii) the goal
of advancing peace in the region through provision of greater economic opportunities remains a
high priority.

2.       The CAS objectives and institutional underpinning for MRDP were also built on legislation
that had been enacted to enhance the policy and institutional framework for agriculture and rural
development environment including (i) the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA)
of 1997 which sought to enhance the competitiveness of Philippine agriculture and (ii) the Local
Government Code (LGC) of 1991 which inter alia devolved greater responsibility for agricultural
service delivery to Local Government Units (LGUs). But despite the directions provided by AFMA
and the LGC, at the time of MRDP2 appraisal there was still wide spread perception among
stakeholders that policy and institutional distortions had not been able to address market and price
signals, the inordinately high marketing costs, nor had the envisaged devolution of responsibilities
for service delivery to LGUs been implemented. LGUs did not have the resources to take on
agriculture service delivery responsibilities legislated through the LGC, and the Department of
Agriculture (DA) remained highly centralized. The bulk of DA’s resources were delivered through
commodity programs (rice, corn, sugar, high value crops, livestock and fisheries), providing
fertilizers, seeds, planting material, and animal dispersal. Integration between programs was often
lacking and the emphasis was on achieving production targets. Although localized plans were
routinely prepared by DA Regional Field Offices (RFOs), these were often not supported through
the budget process. There was little active engagement of Local Government Units (LGUs) and
stakeholders in planning or implementation, and natural resource degradation, fisheries and
biodiversity depletion were continuing unabated.

3.      It was in this context that the first phase of MRDP was implemented from 2000-2004 as
an APL and satisfactorily completed all of the triggers set for the follow-on MRDP2, which was
implemented from 2007 to 2014. This was the second phase of what was envisaged to be a 15 year
program of support from the Bank for rural development in Mindanao. MRDP2 expanded the
support for agriculture related infrastructure and livelihood activities in Mindanao, but also
included a substantial element of institutional strengthening designed to promote decentralization
of the DA in programming and service delivery in line with the goals of AFMA. Similar



                                                  23
institutional strengthening objectives were being pursued at that time under the Diversified Farm
Income and Market Development project (DFIMD, 2004-2009)1. Notably, while the institutional
reforms failed to be implemented under DFIMD, they were ultimately achieved under MRDP2
along with the project’s subsequent evolution into a nation-wide program under the Philippine
Rural Development Project (PRDP) 2. MRDP2 was designed to include a fully blended GEF
operation, but due to a change in GEF processing procedures, the activities relating to coastal and
marine biodiversity conservation were approved almost 2 years later. Pending that approval, a small
NRM component was incorporated in MRDP2to kick-start the GEF related activities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
4.     Programmatic Objective. The long term APL program’s purpose is to improve incomes
and food security in the targeted rural communities within all of the provinces in Mindanao.

5.       The agreed triggers to move from APL Phase 1 to 2 were (a) APL2 Project Preparation to
be initiated once about 60 percent of the APLI Loan has been disbursed, (b) Implementation
evaluation of APL I to be carried out: social assessment of an initial group of eligible APL2
provinces to be carried out, (c) Institutional arrangements for implementation tested out and
adapted based on experience in APL I: multisectoral committees for the Community Funds
operating satisfactorily, (d) Overall satisfactory performance of APL 1, using the mid-term
evaluation as a basis for assessment, (e) APL2 Loan to be approved once 80 percent of APLI Loan
is disbursed, and the balance is substantially committed

6.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) MRDP 2. The objective of the Project was
to assist the Borrower in: (i) improving livelihood opportunities for targeted communities in
Mindanao under the Project; and (ii) institutionalizing a decentralized system for agriculture and
fishery services delivery that promotes participation, transparency and accountability.

7.       The key outcome indicators that were to be measured were; (a) an increase of 20% in
average household incomes of beneficiary communities over baseline and 10% over a control
group; and (b) 35% of target beneficiaries report significant improvement in LGU service delivery
at the end of MRDP 2. The PDO in the PAD and Loan Agreement were consistent.

8.          
1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators

9.        The global environment objective of the Project was to assist the Recipient in conserving
critical coastal and marine biodiversity, supported by sustainable land management in linked upland
areas, by removing barriers to mainstreaming marine and coastal biodiversity conservation; through
co-management of critical marine habitats; and by the introduction of improved, upstream land

emphasis to market-related activities, rather than production targets of major commodities. The project closed
in 2009 with an unsatisfactory rating having failed to achieve the planned reforms.

  The Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP), supported by a US$501.25 M Bank loan and US$ 7 M
GEF Grant, was approved August 29, 2014. Its design builds on that of MRDP2 and will be rolled-out
nation-wide. The Project will facilitate the integration and financing of local investments developed using a
value chain approach through a consultative process with local stakeholders.

management practices that would simultaneously arrest land degradation and benefit landholders
who are predominantly poor farmers, fisher folk, and/or indigenous people. The GEO was to be
measured by the following indicators: (a) increase in fish population as indicated by 30% increase
in fish biomass and density; (b) decrease by 10% in siltation and sedimentation in coastal areas;
and (c) increase by 10% in live coral cover and sea grass cover3

1.4 Revised PDO (and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

10.      There were no revisions of the PDO or its key indicators. One Intermediate Outcome
Indicator designed to measure the decrease in sedimentation and siltation due to NRM subprojects
was dropped at mid-term for technical reasons 4 . Two performance-related budgetary support
indicators were also dropped, as the activity was canceled by the Borrower early in project
implementation. An additional five Intermediate Outcome Indicators were added with the
restructuring that provided additional financing through the AusAid TF011929. These additional
indicators complemented the assessment of the PDO.

1.5 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
11.     There were no formal revisions of the GEO. The dropped Intermediate Outcome Indicator
referred to above to measure the decrease in sedimentation and siltation, was also a GEO Outcome
Indicator.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries
12.     The main beneficiaries were (i) the large number of poor rural households, indigenous
people, and particularly those engaged in the agriculture sector in the targeted provinces of
Mindanao, (ii) DA, principally at the regional level in Mindanao (i.e., Regional Field Units now
known as Regional Field Offices (RFOs)), and (iii) Provincial and Municipal Local Government
Units (PLGUs and MLGUs) . The project covered 225 municipalities in all 27 provinces of
Mindanao. (Under the first phase APL the coverage had been 32 municipalities in 5 provinces).

1.7 Original Components
13.     The project had the same four components as MRDP I with modifications incorporating
the lessons from that project, particularly in regard to strengthening capacity of LGUs and
communities to manage and execute programs and to make the process of Government more
transparent and accountable. Additionally, emphasis was given to improving the capacity of the

  The GEO indicators have been used as the basis for evaluating outcomes of the GEF supported activities in
this ICR, and as discussed further in the ICR, those indicators are seen to have been overly ambitious. This
somewhat common problem with ambitious and difficult-to-measure GEO indicators due to the longer-term
nature of issues being addressed, has reportedly been the subject of recent discussions with GEF: the
suggestion now being that GEF contributions should be measured in terms of how the PDO has been served
by the GEF project.
4
  The decision to drop the indicator designed to measure the decrease in sedimentation and siltation was
agreed at mid-term as it was technically not feasible. This was endorsed by the Project Advisory Board but
seemingly due to an oversight, this was never formalized.

DA as a service provider working with LGUs and to be more effective in its planning and
development. Details are as follows5:

A.     Investment for Governance Reform and Program Administration (IGR) (total cost
US$4.4 M: There were three sub-components:

i)       Improving the capacity of Participating LGUs in resource management and service
delivery in agriculture and fisheries
ii)      Enhancing the capacity of DA to support participating LGUs’ agricultural planning and
development and agricultural research and extension through local community participatory
process.
iii)     Strengthening the capacity of participating LGUs in project implementation and
coordination through the provision of technical assistance and operating support.

B.      Rural Infrastructure (RI) (total cost US$83.852M): This comprised a program of sub-
projects to improve access to basic rural infrastructure services and to enhance their operation and
maintenance standards. Key activities were;

    a) Construction and/or rehabilitation of selected farm to market roads and single lane bridges,
       together with a program for routine maintenance, monitoring and evaluation of their
       construction and rehabilitation,
    b) Construction and/or rehabilitation of selected community-owned and managed run-of-river
       communal irrigation systems, together with a program for routine maintenance, monitoring
       and evaluation of their construction and rehabilitation.
    c) Construction and/or rehabilitation of selected level-2 (communal faucets) rural potable
       water supply systems.
    d) Undertaking other selected rural infrastructure projects to enhance agricultural and
       fisheries productivity and access to markets by rural communities, and
    e) Carry out a Performance-based Grant program in the LGUs participating in infrastructure
       sub-projects to promote good governance and enhance local revenue generation and to
       assist in financing of infrastructure sub-projects (This activity was dropped during the first
       Restructuring of the project See Section 1.9)

C.      Community Fund for Agriculture Development (CFAD) Sub-Projects (total cost
US$30 M). This involved a program to address diverse investment priorities of rural communities,
consisting of financing of CFAD sub-projects which met community preferences and responded to
local priorities, including food security interventions, community managed livelihood and
agribusiness activities, alternative income generating activities, and small infrastructure.

D.      Natural Resource Management (NRM) (total cost US$ 5.4M plus US$6.351 from
GEF). This supported a program to conserve upland resources, coastal and marine biodiversity.
The additional GEF support significantly expanded the scope of activities eligible for financing
though;
    a) Strengthening the capacity of communities, Participating LGUs and national agencies
        involved in the conservation of upland resources, coastal and marine biodiversity6.

    b) Introducing and demonstrating sustainable land management practices and marine and
       coastal protection measures to the communities involved in the conservation of upland
       resources, coastal and marine biodiversity through natural resource management sub-
       projects7, and
    c) Increasing community awareness of direct linkages between upland natural resources
       management and coastal natural resources management8.

    d) In addition to the above, the GEF grant supported for CFAD type subprojects in GEF sites,
       referred to as Sustainable Income Generating Activities (SIGA) and Strengthening of
       Community Partnership in Monitoring.

1.8 Revised Components
14.      There were no changes to the components. During implementation, technical assistance
was provided through additional funding from AusAid, designed to enhance Components 1 and 2
by; i) strengthening the selection and implementation of subprojects, ii) facilitating the completion
of subprojects to the standard and quality required, iii) strengthening governance to promote
transparency, fairness and efficiency in contracting by LGUs, iv) enhancing the level of technical
support being provided by Regional Program Coordinating Offices (RPCOs) to LGUs, and v)
improving the business environment to encourage agri-business entrepreneurs.

1.9 Other significant changes
15.     There were nine Level 2 restructurings as summarized in the Data Sheet, Section H. It was
also agreed through an exchange of letters (November 20, 2012; Annex 6) to monitor some
additional parameters in keeping with the Bank’s introduction of “Core Indicators” as a means to
obtain more effective feedback and monitoring of Bank supported projects9. The first restructuring
(12-22-2009) was soon after loan approval when the Borrower requested dropping of the
“Performance Grant” incentive scheme 10 . The removal of that incentive, as will be further
discussed in this ICR, reduced LGU interest in participating in the project and resulted in an 18-
month hiatus in project start-up. The second restructuring (09-9-2010) reallocated US$2.3M from
the RI to IGR component reflecting the earlier appraisal estimates which had been scaled back by
the Borrower during negotiations. Two subsequent restructurings (11-15-2011 & 06-26-12)

  Core Indicators agreed and subsequently measured (see ICR datasheet) were (i) number of direct project
beneficiaries and (%) female, (ii) area (Ha) provided with irrigation and drainage services, (iii) number of
water users provided with new/improved, (iv) number of operational water user associations created and/or
strengthened, (v) roads constructed (km), (vi) roads rehabilitated (km), (vii) number of people provided with
access to improved water sources, (viii) number of improved community water points constructed or
rehabilitated.
10
   Performance Grants were an innovative feature under the second phase of MRDP2 introduced and DOF
and designed to strengthen the incentive for LGUs to participate in the project under the Governments
prevailing 50:50 (NG/LGU) cost sharing formula required for all externally funded projects. The project was
designed to pilot test the performance-based grants mechanism for LGUs which would apply to the
subprojects being supported under the Rural Infrastructure Component. Measures of performance were to
include adherence to practices which would promote good governance and measures which would enhance
local revenue generation. Based on LGU performance, an additional 20% grant from the national government
would then be provided to participating LGUs for the implementation of their priority local infrastructure.


                                                    27
increased the levels of prior review for procurement, reflecting the considerable improvements in
procurement capacity among LGUs as the project evolved. The US$3M AusAid grant (TF011929)
was approved through restructuring (02-29-2012) and another restructuring (07-27-2012) was done
to reallocate US$200,000 of the GEF Grant (TF094704). The other three restructurings (14-12-
2012, 20-12.2012 & 12-20-2013) related to the two-year extension of the Loan and the AusAid
Grant to December 31, 2014.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
16.     Soundness of the background analysis: Project design was informed by the first phase of
MRDP which had been implemented with from 2000-2004 and closed with a satisfactory rating.
The second phase APL was conditioned on “triggers” that were achieved in implementing MRDP
I. Those triggers related to achievement of satisfactory operational/disbursement targets as
summarized below 11 . Preparation of MRDP2 spanned 2 years and involved broad stakeholder
consultation by the DA and Bank team. Key lessons were taken into account in the design of
MRDP2, i.e., (i) Institutional changes for a more decentralized and market oriented system of
service delivery would take long-term and sustained Government and Bank commitment; hence
the 15 year APL program, (ii) the participatory approach was important for political and social
ownership, (iii) the “learning-through-doing” approach had proven to be effective, (iv) capacity
building needed to be action-oriented, incentive-based and linked with local investment
requirements, (iv) strengthening of grass-roots organizations was essential for meaningful
development, (v) the M&E and financial reporting systems needed strengthening, and (vi) financial
incentives would be needed if LGU cost sharing of investments was to be achieved.

17.       Likewise, the design of the NRM component which was supported by a GEF grant, built
on the lessons learned from the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Conservation (CMBC1) project,
which was implemented as part of the first phase MRDP APL, i.e., (i) local communities and
Peoples Organizations (POs) must be directly involved in the management, protection and
conservation of marine sanctuaries; (ii) the Fisheries Code is more efficient than the NIPAS Act in
fostering local ownership and simpler procedures; (iii) the various laws (LGC, Fisheries Code,
NIPAS, and Wildlife Act) need to be harmonized; (iv) more effective support to LGUs would be
facilitated by having one lead agency; (v) capacity building can be better leveraged and
institutionalized at the LGU and community levels; (vi) livelihood activities should be resource-
based and designed to provide alternative livelihoods; and (vii) destructive agricultural practices in
the upland and forest areas impact severely on recovery of mangroves, coral reefs and sea-grass
beds. 


11
   The triggers for moving from APL 1 to APL 2 were met, i.e., Preparation for APL 2 started when 60
percent of the APL 1 Loan was disbursed; completion of the Social Assessment of the next group of
provinces, which expressed interest to participate; approval of APL2 Loan upon 80 percent disbursement of
APL l Loan; testing out and adoption of institutional arrangements for implementation, based on
experience; satisfactory operationalization of the multi-sectoral committees; overall satisfactory
performance at mid-term; improved arrangements for routine road maintenance sourced from increased
budgetary allocations by LGUs; completion of at least 60 percent of proposed infrastructure program in a
particular province for its continued involvement in APL2; improved rural development planning and
allocation o f budgetary resources by LGUs, with community involvement; and greater integration of DA
programs into LGU RD plans, synchronized through the regular planning and budgeting process and
schedules.


                                                   28
i)       Assessment of the project design; There was no formal Quality at Entry (QAG) review of
the project. To the extent the project had the same four components as MRDP I and incorporated
the lessons from that project, the design had a solid foundation. The focus on strengthening of
LGUs and communities to manage and execute programs, and on strengthening the DA as a
decentralized service provider were also well founded and in accordance with both the Local
Government Code (1991) and the overarching goals of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization
Act of 1997 (AFMA). The choice of the DA as the lead agency was appropriate since at the time
of project preparation, the DA was the main agency undertaking rural development, land
management and livelihood support in Mindanao. The design of the project was flexible enough
to accommodate changes during implementation such as the reduced role of the DA in social
formation and basic livelihood activities as this role expanded under the Department of Social
Welfare and Development (DSWD)12 and as NRM-“Ridge-to-Reef” leadership shifted to DENR,
with DA providing a supporting (convergence) role. Such flexibility proved to be crucial and the
basis for even more far-reaching reforms in the DA and its ways of doing business that are now
being pursued under the follow-on PRDP. That said, the design of the project did not initially
provide for adequate staffing at the Regional Project Coordinating Office (RPCO) level to oversee
safeguard issues and no funding was provided for conduct of social and environmental assessments.
This proved to be a problem in the early years of implementation until staffing was strengthened.
As experienced with other Bank assisted projects in the Philippines, procurement capacity of LGUs
was quite weak requiring considerable inputs from the Bank team during the start-up years. The
technical assistance provided by AusAid TF011029 in February 2012, which had been discussed
during the design of the project, proved to be a valuable factor in facilitating implementation.

An apparent deficiency in the design and an important lesson for future operations was the manner
in which NRM (Ridge-to-Reef) and GEF linked interventions were designed. Outcomes were only
weakly linked to achievement of the PDO, and NRM-GEF interventions were implemented
independently from CFAD and Rural Infrastructure investments. Compounding this weakness was
the overly ambitious GEO (see Section 3.2 and footnote 3) relative to the small size of the amounts
invested (NRM US 4.6 M; 3.6% and GEF US$5.3M; 4% of project cost), the disparate nature of
implementation over 24 LGUs, inadequate provision for technical support and interagency
collaboration, and minimal ownership in the DA for the interventions, as NRM is the core mandate
of DENR. The lead role assigned to DA was therefore somewhat at odds with what would normally
have been a support role, e.g., in provision of seedlings and technology for agro-forestry. Despite
these shortcomings, the IGR, RI and CFAD components which together comprised 94% of the
Loan and 100% of the AusAid TA grant, were well designed and closely linked with the
achievement of the PDO as subsequently borne out during implementation. On balance therefore,
it would seem that a moderately satisfactory rating for quality at entry is appropriate.

ii)      Assessment of Risks and Adequacy of Government’s Commitment: At appraisal the
project was identified as having Moderate Risk based on the successful experience in implementing
the first phase of the APL. All risks were identified as Moderate (M) and were the same for the
Bank Loan and GEF grant13. The assessment of risks and measures built into the design for their


12
   DSWD social programs developed during the project included KALAHI-CIDDS, ARMM Social Fund,
and Mindanao Trust Fund.
13
   Risks identified were: i) Deterioration in peace and order which it was felt could be accommodated through
provisions to make changes under which LGUs participated, (ii) frequent changes in LGU officials which it
was felt could be mitigated through building of capacity and local ownership, (iii) risks that LGUs would not
follow-through on commitments, for which it was felt the national government commitment for infrastructure


                                                    29
mitigation were for the most part adequate. Peace and order did not deteriorate and while the
anticipated changes in LGU officials did occur to varying degrees, the focus on establishing and
monitoring transparent processes and accountability served the project well. DA-Regional field
units were strengthened and supported under the project, backed-up by the efficient management
and functioning of the Project Support Office (PSO).

18.       The political risks for the project were however underestimated. While a fiscal study done
during preparation confirmed that most LGUs had the capacity to cost-share, the policy of cost
sharing was a matter of considerable debate and the time. At appraisal cost sharing was envisioned
to be on basis of 80% (loan) and 20% (LGU). Subsequently, the Borrower determined that the cost
sharing should be 50:50 and introduced a system of “Performance Grants” to provide LGUs an
incentive to participate in the project. Within months of Loan effectiveness, the policy on cost
sharing was changed and the Borrower requested a restructuring to remove “Performance Grants”.
This left the project without adequate incentive for LGU participation (see footnote 15). Also
underestimated was the commitment of the DA to implement the decentralization of its service
delivery (refer PDO2). At project appraisal there had only been limited implementation of the
AFMA Act (1997) and the LGC (1991) which embodied principles of decentralization. The risks
were recognized at appraisal, but DA management’s reluctance to actively pursue the reforms was
not fully appreciated given the active participation of the DA staff in preparing the project. This,
together with the experience with failed reforms under DFIMD, provides a lesson, that, at least in
the Philippine context, agreement on reforms and even instructions to that effect from management,
does not automatically translate into implementation unless such reforms are actively promoted by
the Oversight Agencies and fully accepted by the staff of the implementing units within the Agency.
In the case of both the decentralization of services and the “performance-based grant scheme”, this
level of support was lacking.

19.      That said, the project design and APL lending instrument did correctly recognize that the
institutional reforms being pursued were a long-term objective (15 years) requiring sustained
Government and Bank commitment. Under MRDP2, that process benefited greatly from the
fortuitous change in agriculture sector policy and leadership of the DA around mid-term in project
implementation. As discussed further in this ICR, those policy and strategic changes expanded
upon the reforms embedded in AFMA (Act 1997) and the LGC (1991), and ultimately led to the
successful outcomes of the project.


2.2 Implementation
20.     The project was implemented over 7.5 years, including a two year extension in closing to
December 31, 2014. The goal of implementing the project in 225 municipalities in all 27 provinces
of Mindanao was achieved. The allocation of loan proceeds between components agreed at
negotiations remained largely unchanged except for the increase in the IGR component agreed
through restructuring (see Section 1.9). Overall project costs remained close to appraisal estimates



subprojects of an additional 20% through Performance Grants would be an adequate incentive, (iv) untimely
funding due to tight fiscal constraints were to be overcome by requiring LGUs to provide “up-front”
counterpart funds, and (v) the concern that DA-Regional Field Units might be unable to provide coordination
and oversight of LGU implementation was addressed by changing the role of the Regional Program
Coordinating Office from “coordinating” to “supporting” the DA-RFOs under MRDP2, and issuance of a
Special Order to that effect.


                                                    30
(Annex 1)14. The GEF Grant for US$6.351M which had been planned at appraisal to support the
NRM component was signed two years later on October 16, 2009. But because of the delay in start-
up of the project, the timing of approval of the GEF Grant did not have any significant impact on
project implementation to that point. The design of the project as discussed below was sufficiently
flexible to allow for refinements through Level 2 restructurings as implementation evolved. The
participatory approach and partnership arrangements pursued with LGUs proved to be a key design
factor in the achieving the project PDOs. The Technical assistance provide through AusAid
TF011029 was effectively integrated and contributed significantly to the ultimate achievement of
the project’s objectives.

21.     Implementation had two distinct phases; before mid-term (2007-mid 2010) when
implementation was very slow and after mid-term (2010-2014) when implementation accelerated
and ultimately resulted in successful outcomes. There were several lessons from this
implementation experience that seemingly have been recognized and taken into account in the
design of the follow-on PRDP.

22.     First Phase: Within months of signing the Loan Agreement, the Borrower reversed its
decision under the Loan to pilot test the use of “Performance Grants” and requested a restructuring.
This innovation had been included in the project design at the suggestion of the Department of
Finance (DOF) as a means to provide a financial incentive for LGUs to participate under the project,
given the Borrower’s decision to adopt a 50: 50 (National Government-Local Government (NG-
LGU)) cost sharing under the project (for MRDP1 it had been 90:10)15. The Bank had reservations
about the removal of this incentive and before agreeing to restructure, undertook an assessment as
to whether sufficient LGUs would still participate. Although that assessment indicated the project
would still be implementable, this proved to be overly optimistic as LGUs continued to voice
reluctance to participate and disbursements remained low. By the end of 2009, 18 months after
Loan Effectiveness, project implementation was rated MU and disbursements were only at 9.4%
compared with the 21% estimated at appraisal. Nevertheless throughout this period, there was
continued strengthening of safeguards, procurement and financial management by the PSO and
Regional Field Offices of the DA (RFOs).



14
   While indicative targets were set for RI infrastructure targets at appraisal, these were based on unit costs
at the time. Subsequently design standards and unit costs were changed by DPWH to improve climate
resilience and reduce O& M, notably through concreting of farm to market roads and associated
engineering upgrades.
15
   Underpinning the decision to drop the “Performance Grants” were practicality concerns on issuance of
“Certificates of Performance”. This coupled with a looming water crisis (el Nino effects) caused Government
to reprioritize the $3m allocated to “Performance Grants” to supporting water supply and irrigation. The NG-
LGU Cost-Sharing Policy was also in a state of flux at the time in that the policy provided for only 50:50
cost-sharing for the least developed class of LGU. It was much less generous for more developed LGUs. At
the Bank’s urging, a 50:50 cost sharing was agreed for MRDP2 irrespective of “LGU class”. A fiscal study
done during project preparation supported the view that 50: 50 was insufficient incentive for LGUs to
participate, hence the Bank’s acceptance of the “Performance Grant” incentive scheme. With its dropping
through restructuring, the project entered a period of inadequate incentive for LGU participation. Arguments
for re-examining the policy have often been made. While there have been some adjustments, they have been
piecemeal, e.g., in regard to solid waste, wastewater and sanitation. A key argument for changing the policy
has been that it is inconsistently applied. Only loan-funded projects involving the LGUs that use the MDFO
as fund conduit or cashier are covered. Projects which are locally-funded or funded through bilateral grants
are not subjected to the policy. As such the policy holds sway over only a fraction of the public funds intended
for similar purposes. (Note: the Bank’s Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for DFIMD also points to
the cost-sharing policy as a major implementation bottleneck).


                                                      31
23.      The Mid-term review was delayed by 15 months to June 2011 at the request of
Government, given the delay in start-up. At that time only 20% of the loan had been disbursed,
implementation progress was rated as MU, and the PDO was still optimistically MS. The GEO
was rated as S, largely because the GEF Grant had only recently been approved. Noteworthy is that
to this point, the project PDO of achieving a “decentralized system of service delivery” was
encountering considerable resistance within the DA as an institutional reform to be implemented
more broadly across the DA. The mid-term review done by consultants hired by the DA was found
to be lacking in that it did not provide any new insights as to how project implementation might be
accelerated. A somewhat independent review done by the Bank proved far more valuable and the
recommendations from that review paved the way for subsequent implementation refinements that
ultimately contributed to successful outcomes.

21.      Second phase: Coincident with the mid-term review (2011), institutional support for the
project changed dramatically when, as discussed in Section 1.1, the incoming Aquino
Administration (mid-2010) realigned the agriculture sector strategy in accordance with the AFMA
Act (1997) (on which MRDP2 had also been designed). The most significant factor was the
recognition by the incoming DA Management of how the operational “know-how”, experience and
institutional capability that had been developed under MRDP2, could be used to implement the
new agricultural sector strategy. With this leadership and a number of mid-term refinements in the
project design, the pace of implementation of MRDP2 began to accelerate. At the same time,
MRDP2 implementation procedures and processes became the basis on which the design of the
follow-on, nation-wide PRDP was designed. Key factors that underpinned this acceleration of
implementation were:

a) Resolution of the Incentive Framework for LGU participation: The NG-LGU cost sharing
   impasse was resolved when, for DA’s 2010 budget (calendar year), some PhP 256 M (US$ 5.6
   M) was provided under an arrangement that provided for cost-sharing of 50% loan, 40% DA
   budget and 10% LGU (50:40:10) to support the construction of Farm to Market Roads (FMRs)
   under the project. This Counterpart Funding Arrangement (CFA) proved to be successful and
   was expanded in subsequent years to include all investments under MRDP216.
b) Refocusing of CFAD investments: The livelihood subprojects as originally designed (e.g., to.
   provide livestock, seed dispersal, technical assistance etc), often in areas with limited
   agricultural potential, were refocused on supporting People’s Organizations (POs) and
   cooperatives with a view to building more sustainable income earning livelihood activities and
   micro-enterprises. This brought the design more in-line with DA’s mandate, especially since
   at the time the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) was increasingly
   providing livelihood support for more vulnerable groups in keeping with that agency’s
   mandate.
c) Refinement of DA’s role in supporting LGUs: The “Investment for Governance Reform (IGR)”
   component was designed to support LGUs and “bottom-up” selection and design of
   infrastructure and CFAD subprojects. At mid–term, however, it was recognized that
   inadequate attention was being given to how locally identified subprojects linked with
   provincial, regional and national sector plans. It did not provide for overlaying strategic
   productivity objectives, such as vertical integration of production and marketing through value
   chains, or targeting of production support based on climate or crop suitability. Nor were
   adequate strategic considerations taken into account as to where infrastructure investments
   were made, or how linkages were made with other road networks or private sector initiatives.


16 CFAD cost sharing was 50 (loan); 30(DA): 20 (LGU)


                                                32
   The design of the IGR component was therefore reoriented to help the DA deliver more
   strategically focused programs through and in partnership with LGUs. This reorientation was
   facilitated by the US$3 M Technical Assistance grant from AusAid approved in February
   201217.
d) Process/Capacity Strengthening: Implementation was facilitated though; (i) assignment of
   more staff to the PSO and RPCOs, ii) more devolution of authority to RFOs, iii) strengthening
   of the PSO-Safeguard unit, iii) introduction of geo-tagging to enhance monitoring of
   construction and O &M, iv) regular contractors meeting to clarify procedures and expedite
   procurement, v) active engagement by the Project Advisory Board (PAB), vii) special studies
   improve the cost-effectiveness of specific investments (Annex 6), viii) new base line studies
   to overcome earlier methodological problems, and ix) improvements to expedite the
   disbursements to LGUs.
e) Training and Coaching: The PSO, together with technical assistance facilitated by the Bank
   through FAO and the AusAid TF, embarked on an extensive program of training and coaching
   to address skill gaps identified in writing project proposals, community mobilization,
   participatory planning, procurement financial management, operations and maintenance,
   monitoring and the use of geo-tagging. This led to significant improvements in LGU capacity
   for which they have expressed much appreciation.

22.      During this period (2010-2014), there was continued evolution of the procedures and
institutional strengthening, along with a ground-swell of support from within the DA for a
decentralized service delivery approach18. A revised work program was put in place and
actively pursued. In reality, during the last two years of project implementation, there was
something of a “blurring” between the implementation of MRDP2 and the pilot testing and
preparation for PRDP. This however was appropriate and in keeping with the decision to
roll-out a nation-wide program. Accordingly, by the time of loan closing, some US$12M
of infrastructure works for retroactive financing under PRDP had been developed by the
MRDP2-PSO.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
Utilization
23.      M&E Design. Key design elements comprised a detailed results monitoring framework,
studies to define the baseline for the Results Framework, several subcomponent studies on quality
and implementation aspects, as well as mid- and end-term evaluations. The M & E system was
integrally linked with DA’s overall management information system and this linkage was
strengthened as the project progressed and served the project well. That said, the design relied on
completing a “baseline study” for the Results Framework as part of the project. As commonly


17
   A prior AusAid Technical assistance grant had developed governance criteria for O& M of infrastructure
investments and this was also factored into the project, particularly in the preparation of Operational Manuals
18
   Key refinements in the design in preparing for PRDP were: (i) preparation of a harmonized Infrastructure
Operation Manual for application across all DA Programs, (ii) enhanced decentralized planning through
preparation of Regional Agriculture and Fishery Modernization Plans (RAFMPs), (iii) Vulnerability and
Suitability assessments along with Value Chain Analyses (VCA) were developed to improve the targeting of
investments, (iv) CFAD subprojects focused on the value chain strengthening and enterprise development,
rather than livelihoods per se, (v) FMRs were better integrated with the overall road network, while design
and implementation procedures were improved and standardized, and vii) geo-tagging was mainstreamed to
facilitate procurement and overall M& E of investments.


                                                     33
occurs when not done prior to project approval, contractual delays and the need to repeat some
surveys meant that the baseline was not established until 2010, two years into implementation.
However, in this case, since the project start-up was delayed by 18 months, the delay in establishing
the baseline had less consequence in terms of being able to measure performance than otherwise
would have been the case. Importantly the same methodology and sampling frame was used for
both the baseline and end of project analysis.

24.     There were 5 PDO/GEO indicators and 27 Intermediate Outcome Indicators covering the
Loan, GEF grant and AusAid Trust Fund. Two indicators were dropped prior to mid-term (on LGU
Resource Generation and on Siltation & Sedimentation). Another eight intermediate (Bank Core)
indicators were agreed with the DA through an exchange of letters (see section 1.9). Although this
was never formalized through restructuring, these core indicators were monitored and collectively
provide a good basis on which to assess the project’s outcomes.

25.      M&E Implementation and Utilization: The Project Support Office (PSO) was responsible
for M&E in collaboration with Regional Project Coordination Offices (RPCOs). They routinely
collected information and Progress Reports were submitted monthly to DA-Management through
the PSO. Such information would appear to have been used effectively by management in
providing guidance and in ensuring training and resources were adequate. Given the focus on
“catching-up” the 18 month delay in project start-up, the emphasis was largely on meeting annual
plans and disbursement targets. More focus on monitoring progress towards achieving
performance indicators for the project would have been helpful in keeping the focus on outcomes
in addition to achievement of physical and disbursement targets. There were also weaknesses in
the measurement of the GEF-NRM indicators that made an assessment of outcomes difficult, with
different methodologies being used at different times. A series of studies were however undertaken
(Annex 6) to review qualitative aspect of the investments and these provided valuable feedback
which was acted upon. An important innovation which is now required for all investments by the
DA, is the use of geo-tagging. This cost-effective and simple-to-use tool provides an unprecedented
level of transparency and helps ensure good governance. Overall the M&E system for the project
would seem to have been effective and staffed with a dedicated and competent team.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
26.      Environment and Social Safeguards: The Project triggered World Bank policies on
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01), Pest Management (OP/BP 4.09), Involuntary
Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) and Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10). Environmental and Social
Assessments of Mindanao’s Indigenous Peoples were conducted to develop Frameworks and
Guidelines for the project. These served the project well and the overall implementation of the
Safeguard policies was satisfactory. All RI, NRM and big ticket CFAD subprojects underwent
internal safeguard reviews by either the RPCO or PSO. Some 20 of the largest RI subprojects were
pre-reviewed for safeguards compliance by the Bank. The RPCOs and PSO inspected 90% of the
RI subprojects, 47% of NRM subprojects and 7% CFAD subprojects. Bank Implementation
Support Reviews also inspected 30 RI, 5 NRM and 20 CFAD subprojects. To enhance participation
by IPs and women, a 30% target allocation was set for their engagement in preparing Barangay
Development Plans. This proved to be effective in that some 24% CFAD beneficiaries were
members of the indigenous communities of whom 45% were women. Overall women accounted
for 47% of CFAD beneficiaries.

27.     As previously discussed, difficulties were initially encountered as the design did not
provide funding for social and environmental assessments. This together with limited capacity in



                                                 34
the LGUs made it difficult in the early years to produce good quality Environmental and Social
Management Plans (ESMPs), land acquisition documentation etc. During the first two years of
implementation, safeguard compliance was also not pre-requisite for subproject approval and a
number of infrastructure subprojects were approved with incomplete safeguards documents. The
PSO was also focusing more on the adequacy of documentation rather than providing qualitative
assistance, such that ESMPs contained only generic measures and many were inconsistent with the
subproject's Feasibility Study and the Detailed Engineering Design. To the Bank Review team and
PSO’s credit, this was addressed early in the project’s implementation and resulted in a Social and
Environmental Safeguards unit being created.

28.     Procurement under the project was rated moderately satisfactory throughout the
implementation period and satisfactory at project completion. Close Bank oversight was
maintained through a combination of prior reviews, post reviews, site visits, virtual site visits
through geo-tagging (since 2010) and regular meetings with the PSO staff. Procurement
arrangements for MRDP2 were based on the lessons from the first phase of MRDP, including the
need to harmonize with Government procedures as recommended in the Country Procurement
Assessment Report19. At project start-up there were already some 36 subprojects (US$5 million)
ready for award and almost 100 community livelihood subprojects were at an advanced stage of
processing. Based on the satisfactory supervision by the PSO as well as reasonably good
compliance with procurement procedures by the LGUs, the initial prior review threshold of
US$300,000 for the RI was subsequently increased to US$1,000,000.

29.     Significant procurement related innovations, for which considerable credit is due to both
the Bank and PSO staff, were; i) regular meetings with Contractors to clarify procedures and
provide feedback on how procedures could be streamlined, ii) electronic downloading of the
bidding documents from the MRDP2 website20 and iii) introduction of geo-tagging as a means to
improve efficiency and transparency. This tool has been mainstreamed to cover all DA-financed
sub-projects and is being increasingly adopted nationally and internationally. Specific benefits from
geo-tagging include; i) improved monitoring including publically accessible information and
images on all contracts involving infrastructure, ii) improved governance21, iii) greater competition
with the average number of bidders for each sub-project increasing about three-fold, iv) enhanced
quality control with LGUs and contractors required to submit geo-tagged photos showing that the
required works were accomplished, and (v) citizen engagement in monitoring.

30.     Financial Management: Throughout the project, financial management was mostly rated
as moderately satisfactory. Financial covenants included the submission of the quarterly Interim
Financial Reports (IFR) and annual audited project financial statements. In 23 out of the 26
instances, the IFRs were submitted either by the due date or within 30 days. All IFRs were found
to be acceptable to the Bank. Of the six audited project financial statements, three were received
by the due dates with unqualified audit opinions while the latest three reports were received within
2 months of the due date and with qualified audit opinions. The main reasons for qualification



19
   The Country Procurement Assessment Report provides for procurement by the LGUs to be undertaken in
accordance with the Philippine Procurement Law (RA 9184) and the Local Government Code. All
procurement, other than International Competitive Bidding, uses the Government’s own procedures, with the
exception of eight provisions in the national law which are not acceptable to the Bank.
20
   RA9184 provides for the electronic posting of the Invitation to Bid (PhilGEPS).
21
   By way of example, the tool alerted DA officials to a 9 km road where geo-tagged photos revealed that the
first 3 and final 1.2 km had been financed under a separate program. In another case geo-tagging revealed
inflated costs as the area was reported as mountainous whereas geo-tagging revealed that area was flat.


                                                    35
were i) CY2012 non-recognition of foreign exchange loss in the foreign currency denominated cash
at year-end and failure to conduct actual physical count of property, plant and equipment and (ii)
CY2011 and 2010 unrecorded deposits and withdrawals from a current account; un-reconciled
difference in accounting records and inventory reports of Property, Plant and Equipment; and non-
performance of physical count for its reported current year-end balance. Other issues included in
the audit observations and recommendations were (i) delayed submission by LGU of Statement of
Receipts and Disbursements and Certificates of Fund Status; (ii) delayed submission by Partner
Agencies of monthly financial reports; and (iii) Property, Plant and Equipment without the
corresponding Acknowledgement Receipt of Equipment forms. All audit issues were subsequently
addressed adequately.

31.     Financial management of the GEF grant was also rated as moderately satisfactory
throughout the project. There was compliance with financial covenants in regard to submission of
the quarterly Interim Financial Reports (IFR) and the annual audited project financial statements.
Of the 16 IFRs submitted, all were submitted on time or with less than 30 day delays. All were
found to be acceptable. The audit reports were unqualified. For both the Bank Loan and the GEF
Grant, internal financial controls were found to be generally sufficient. Actions arising from FM
implementation reviews were addressed and largely resolved before the next review mission.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
32.      The next phase of MRDP2 is already underway at project completion, albeit on a much
larger scale than originally envisaged. At the time of appraisal of the first MRDP, it was expected
that the program of investments in Mindanao would span some 15 years. Four phases of Bank
support through and APL were planned. MRDP2 therefore included a set of “Triggers”, much as
had been done under MRDP I, through which a third phase APL would be considered for approval.
With the change in Government Administration and leadership in the DA in mid-2010, the design
and implementation of MRDP2 was seen as offering a platform through which the DA could roll-
out its broader agenda, based on an updated Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Plan (AFMP).
The close match between what was being promoted under MRDP2 and the DA’s revised strategy
(both having been based on the AFMA Act), coupled with the institutional experience, Operational
Manuals and active participation of LGUs under MRDP2 provided the design and operational
capability to rollout a far more ambitious program of rural development nation-wide. The originally
planned third phase APL was therefore replaced by the PRDP which builds on DA’s updated AFMP
(2010-16) to raise rural incomes, create employment and improve the competitiveness of the
agriculture and fisheries sector. The strategy to achieve this will be through a value-chain, market-
oriented and integrated service delivery approach in partnership with LGUs, expanding on the
approach developed through MRDP2.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Relevance
Rating: High)
33.      Relevance of Objectives: The PDO remains relevant and fully consistent with Government
priorities to promote inclusive growth and reduce poverty. It is also consistent with the AFMA
(1997) and the LGC (1991). MRDP2 and its successor PRDP are in line with the overall goals of
the Philippine Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY15-18 and the updated Philippine
Development Plan. Specifically MRDP2 through the follow-on PRDP is linked to the CPS through:
Engagement Area 3 on Rapid, Inclusive and Sustained Economic Growth, particularly in terms of
helping increase economic growth, productivity and jobs in rural areas; Engagement Area 4:
Resilience to climate change, environment, and disaster risk management, particularly on resilience
to climate change impacts, improved natural resource management and sustainable development;
and Engagement Area 5: Peace, institution building, and social and economic opportunity,
especially on supporting economic development in conflict-affected regions. The Philippines’ GEF
National Programmatic Framework Document is also fully anchored in the Philippine
Development Plan and prioritizes the objectives of the Biodiversity Focal Area, as well as
supporting the International Waters Focal Area. MRDP2 goals and activities remain fully consistent
with those focal areas. Follow-on GEF Grant activities under PRDP would support the “Scaling-
up Partnership Investments for Sustainable Development of the Large Marine Ecosystems of East
Asia and their Coasts” (GEF Program ID: 4635) aimed at supporting the commitments made by
PEMSEA Country Partners.

34.      Relevance of Design and Implementation: MRDP2 was designed on the experience gained
in implementing a first phase MRDP. Design refinements around mid-term were both timely and
key to the achievement of the project’s outcomes. The emphasis given to strengthening local level
planning and building partnerships between LGUs and the Department of Agriculture were
consistent with the AFMA Act, which although approved in 1997, had not been effectively
implemented. MRDP2 through its design was instrumental in building consensus and support for
the decentralized reforms of both AFMA and the LGC. The effectiveness of this “learning-through-
doing” approach is an important lesson from the project (Section 6). The relevancy of the design is
further highlighted by the fact that MRDP2 has provided the platform through which the “Next
Phase” of MRDP2 is already underway in the form of a national program under PRDP. Although
the APL approach was abandoned in the formulation of the national PRDP, the triggers in the
design of MRDP2 for a Phase 3 APL (see para 5) correctly focused on the importance of having
strong LGU participation and commitment to rural development; a key factor in the design of the
PRDP. Importantly, the project investments supporting rural infrastructure and sustainable
livelihood/enterprise activities were critical and mutually reinforcing to the achievement of the
PDO in substantially raising household incomes achieved under the project. That said, and as
previously discussed, the relevancy of the relatively small GEF-NRM investments could have been
improved if more integrally linked with the infrastructure and enterprise development investments.
To some extent this was an issue of implementation rather than design, but it does present an
important lesson in that NRM is a complex undertaking where incentives, livelihoods, cultural,
social and political aspects need to be addressed, along with technical considerations. The design
did not adequately allow for this, or the key role of DENR in NRM (see Section 6).




                                                37
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global
Environment Objectives (Rating of PDO Outcomes: Satisfactory;
Rating of GEO Outcomes: Moderately Unsatisfactory)
35.      The PDO for the project had two elements; (i) PDO1; to improve livelihood opportunities
for targeted communities in Mindanao; and (ii) PDO 2; to institutionalize a decentralized system
for agriculture and fishery services delivery that promotes participation, transparency and
accountability. Investments under the project in rural infrastructure (RI) and micro-enterprise
development (CFAD) were directly supportive of income and employment generation under PDO
1, while the institutional reforms under the IGR component were directly linked with achievement
of PDO2 as illustrated in Annex 2, Tables 1 to 3 and discussed below. This assessment finds the
PDO was satisfactorily achieved. On the other hand, the conservation aspects of the NRM
component, being long-term in nature were supportive of the GEO (Annex 2, Table 4). As also
discussed below, this assessment finds those objectives to have been overly ambitious and the
outcome Moderately Unsatisfactory.

36.    PDO 1: Improve access to livelihood opportunities of targeted communities: The
Performance Indicator of increasing average household incomes of beneficiary communities by
20% and 10% higher than a control group was achieved, i.e.,

 Household income in the project areas was increased to PhP102759; a 36% increase in nominal
  terms, or a 20% real increase22. Likewise the target of increasing average household incomes
  by 10% above the control was also achieved. Control group real incomes increased to
  PhP96468, a 10% increase compared with the 36% increase in the project areas. The baseline
  for the control group, which enabled a “with and without” project analysis, was 16% above the
  baseline for the project areas. Household incomes grew more rapidly for project areas and
  significantly overtook income levels of the control group.

37.     Key results and intermediate outcomes from project interventions that contributed to
achieving PDO1 are detailed in Annex 2. The methodology is also detailed in Annex 2 and
primarily involved household surveys following the same methodology used to establish the
baseline. A total of 1,920 respondents were interviewed encompassing beneficiaries from all
interventions under the project, providing a 97% confidence level. Just as the average household
incomes increased significantly under the project, the number of beneficiaries impacted was also
substantial with the total number estimated to be 1,969,895. Of these, 49% were women and 32%
IPs.

38.     The sources of household income at project completion came from the following activities:
non-farm (58%), on–farm (39%) and off-farm (3%). Likewise, the main sources of growth in
household incomes came from non-farm (67%) and from on-farm (15%). There was a decline of
40% in off-farm activities as a source of income. The large increase in non-farm household income
can be particularly attributed to the rapid increase in passenger and produce transport services
(mainly from tricycles) that followed improvements under the project in providing all–weather road
access. By contrast the fall in off-farm activities as a source of household income was found to be



22
   Neither the Project Appraisal Document nor the Loan Agreement specified whether the target was in real
or nominal terms. In either case the 20% targeted increase was achieved.



                                                   38
due in large part to the drop in seasonal farm labor, as people moved to more profitable, non-farm
and on-farm activities that developed as a result of the project.

39.      Analysis of the significant increase in household incomes shows the benefits came largely
from investments in rural infrastructure and from CFAD sub-projects. Together these investments
accounted for 89% of the project costs. With improved road access, there have been increased and
better paying employment opportunities as well as significant household cost savings from a 36%
decrease in relative freight charges, along with a 69% decrease in time needed to reach markets.
Such reduced freight charges and better vendor penetration into previously inaccessible areas have
resulted in higher prices and returns for commodities, as this has improved quality and reduced
post-harvest losses that previously resulted from having to transport produce and goods over very
rough and often impassable tracks to markets.

40.      Productivity increases and better employment opportunities leading to increased household
incomes have also resulted from the construction and rehabilitation of community irrigation
systems and potable water supplies. Cropping intensity increased from 129% to 180%, as a result
of more reliable and timely irrigation water supply in the 2,907 ha of irrigated land rehabilitated
and 2,175 ha of new land brought under irrigation. The installation of potable water supplies has
significantly freed-up household time for other income earning activities by reducing time spent
fetching water (by 67%) and by reducing morbidity due to water borne diseases (from 29% to less
than 5%). While a disaggregation of data in terms of how much each of these improvements
contributed to raising household income was not possible, the collective benefits undoubtedly
underpinned the 36% (20% real) increase in household incomes under the project.

41.      Household incomes of CFAD direct beneficiaries were analyzed separately and again
showed an increase of around 35%, with the main source of such incomes coming from i) an
increase in production (42%), ii) an increase in volume of products marketed (24%), iii) an increase
in the price of products sold (31%), and iv) training and adoption of technology (3%). Factors rated
by the farmers in the order of importance in contributing to production increase were (i) support
services (29%), ii) better quality outputs (26%), iii) technology (28%), and iv) good weather (16%);
providing further anecdotal evidence of benefits that can be attributed to the project. Some 4,058
CFAD sub-projects, were supported of which 3,488 (86%) were considered as livelihood support
activities (e.g., livestock and crop production), while 570 (14%) supported micro-enterprise
development (e.g., agro-processing, coconut net production, fish ponds). Overall there were
180,285 direct beneficiaries from the CFAD projects and some 28,406 jobs were created (e.g.,
haulers, mixers, drivers, construction workers, facility operators, caretakers and laborers).

42.     Given the significant increase in household incomes in project areas along with
considerable and the mutually reinforcing benefits from the main investments, a satisfactory rating
for PDO1 would seem well justified..

43.     PDO 2: Institutionalize a decentralized system for agriculture and fisheries service delivery
that promotes participation, transparency and accountability, The Results Framework did not
specifically provide a PDO indicator, but it was noted in the PAD that this PDO would be assessed
against outcome indicators for Component I (IGR). Those indicators were achieved i.e.,

 Beneficiaries reported an 87% level of satisfaction with LGU service delivery in the program
  areas at project completion: a substantial increase over the baseline of 37%. LGUs in project
  areas were assessed as having improved their service delivery by 48% more than their




                                                 39
  counterparts in the sampled non-project areas. 23 But there was also an 80% improvement
  recorded in satisfaction levels with service delivery in non-project areas. This may be a
  reflection of the decentralized system of service delivery implemented by the DA through its
  RFOs in Mindanao which would have benefited all LGUs, whether or not they received
  investment support under MRDP2.
 At project completion 100% LGUs rated their ability to plan and implement investments as
  satisfactory or better, due to the project (the target was a 70% improvement).
 Based on the five Municipal LGUs and six PLGUs sampled where accounting records
  separated expenditure sufficiently to enable a thorough analysis, there were large increases in
  LGU agricultural sector expenditures, ranging from almost 700 to over 1000%. The increases
  in expenditures were greatest in 2011 and 2012 corresponding with the peak in program
  implementation for RI, CFAD, and NRM subprojects under MRDP2. Based on this data and
  feedback from LGU and stakeholders there has been an upsurge in agricultural sector
  expenditures in the MRDP2 program areas. (Target was a 15% increase in expenditure)

44.      While these were positive outcomes, since “the institutionalization of a decentralized
system of service delivery” is a process, it was felt that the above indicators were insufficient to
assess the extent to which decentralization has in fact taken place. The assessment of PDO2 was
therefore subjected to further analysis to determine; i) whether decentralized planning and budget
allocations are being made and actually implemented, ii) if LGUs and other stakeholders have an
effective role in determining the needs and types of service delivery provided by the DA and/or
from other sources based on economic and technical consideration, iii) that accountability for
quality of service delivery is being applied, and iv) that systems are in place to support and sustain
the decentralized approach. The findings, based on these additional assessment criteria provide
compelling evidence that MRDP2 can be credited with much of what has been achieved and that a
satisfactory rating is justified. It is also noteworthy that the institutional strengthening of LGUs
which was achieved under the project, particularly in terms of their planning and investments
support for rural development, were key MRDP2 triggers for what would have been a Phase 3 APL.
The significant strengthening achieved has provided the underpinning for the much larger, follow-
on national PRDP. It is also noteworthy that the significant institutional strengthening of LGUs
which was achieved under the project, particularly in terms of their planning and investments
support for rural development, were key MRDP2 triggers for a Phase 3 APL, but which that in fact
has provided the underpinning for a much larger, national PRDP. Supporting evidence is
summarized below and detailed in Annex 2.

     a) Decentralization of DA functions through the devolution of authority and responsibilities
        to each of the Regional Field Offices (RFOs) has been quite extensive under the project.
        Regional Executive Directors have been delegated authority and autonomy for planning,
        budgeting, technical content of programs and nature of service delivery. While certainly
        this devolution reflects the change in way of doing business across the DA implemented


23
   The higher than expected baseline of (37%) compared with the 35% target set at appraisal clearly
underestimated perceptions as to levels of satisfaction with service delivery and could perhaps be attributed
to other government programs including MRDP1. Nevertheless, feedback from stakeholders suggests the
strategy under MRDP2 of bringing the subproject planning process down to the barangay level and the
targeting of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups) contributed to the increased and focused delivery of
services.




                                                     40
          by the DA’s management which assumed office around mid-term in the project, the
          Operational Procedures (Manuals) and implementation experience that had already been
          built under MRDP2 can be credited with accelerating the pace and comprehensiveness
          with which the decentralization process was implemented in Mindanao. Accordingly,
          RFOs in Mindanao have been more advanced that other regions in effectively coordinating
          the technical programs and inputs provided through DA-national Bureaus, Agencies and
          Commodity programs that were previously largely provided “top-down”. Through this
          devolution, LGU technical and infrastructural requirements are now being planned and
          delivered in Mindanao in accordance with joint DA-LGUs planning/ agreements that
          actively involve stakeholders at the local level and are reflected in greatly strengthened
          LGU rural development plans and investments. This is not institutionalized in other
          Regions not covered by MRDP2. The “MRDP way”, as it has become known, has
          therefore become a cornerstone of DA’s institutional reform process which will be rolled
          out nation-wide under PRDP.

      b) Transparency, participation and accountability in the decentralization of service delivery
         have been substantially strengthened as a result of the project. This is reflected by several
         factors attributable to MRDP2 interventions, especially the extensive training and on-the
         job capacity building supported through the IGR component with AusAid TF assistance
         (e.g., in planning, M&E, procurement, safeguards, financial management systems,
         feasibility study preparation, supervision of works, contract management, O &M & geo-
         tagging). Of note is that while many LGUs initially lacked the capacity and/or governance
         requirements to participate in MRDP2 (including the need to have the DILG “Seal of Good
         House Keeping”), with assistance provided under the project they were quite rapidly able
         to build capacity and meet project participation criteria. Another, albeit anecdotal
         reflection of transparency and accountability, is that what is often referred to by politicians,
         contractors, LGUs etc, as “the MRDP2 way”, has become synonymous with “doing works
         the clean or proper way”. Confidence in the transparent and fair competitive process
         established under the project is further evidenced by the fact that early in project
         implementation, only two bids/bid invitation were being received from contractors,
         whereas by the end of the project the average was 6 bids/ bid invitation, and

      c) Institutionalization of the decentralized approach to service delivery has been formalized
         though adoption of detailed Technical and Operational Manuals developed under MRDP2.
         Collectively they specify all procedural, technical, financial and monitoring requirements
         for planning, implementation and O&M. Institutionalization of the process and its
         sustainability has been reinforced by the required strict adherence to the guidelines and
         protocols in the Operational Manuals. EVSA, VCA and geo-tagging tools24 developed and
         piloted under MRDP2 (in preparation for PRDP) have further consolidated the institutional
         reforms by ensuring that the technical basis underpinning local plans for investments and
         services are based on scientific criteria and follow well defined standards. The approval
         (December 2014) under MRDP2 of a harmonized manual for DA-LGU Engagement on
         Agriculture Support Infrastructure that, beginning CY2016, will cover all DA programs, is
         a further reflection of the degree to which the decentralized service delivery reforms under
         MRDP2 have been institutionalized.

45.      The Global Environment Objective was to assist in conserving critical coastal and marine
biodiversity, supported by sustainable land management in linked upland areas, by removing
barriers to mainstreaming marine and coastal biodiversity conservation. The key indicators in the
Results Framework for the GEO were not achieved as indicated below:

 The Target of 30% increase in fish biomass and density in targeted protected areas was not
  achieved. Average fish biomass per site ranged from 4.2-6.8 kg/500m2 (equivalent to a 12-29%
  decline using two different surveys). Average fish density per site ranged from 249 to 425
  individuals/500m2. The trends in average fish density are less clear, with one survey indicating
  a decrease of 18% while the second survey indicating an increase of 23%. Different
  methodologies and data sources used for the analysis make it difficult to draw definitive
  conclusions other than that the targets were not achieved.
 The Target of 10% decrease in siltation and sedimentation could not be measured. It was
  agreed during the 7th implementation support mission that this indicator was impractical to
  measure. Although identified for restructuring, it was never formally dropped.
 The Target of 10% increase in coral and sea-grass cover was not achieved. Average coverage
  of sea-grass species per site was 34% (equivalent to a 15% decrease). The average cover of
  live hard coral per site ranged from 30-35% based on two surveys (equivalent to a 16% and
  14% decrease respectively).

46.      The GEO outcomes were highly ambitious given the relatively small scale of the
interventions and the unrealistically short timeframe in which to bring about attitude changes and
fishing practices. The time frame was also short for having measurable improvements in coral
growth, fish stocks and biomass, especially since the critical mass of fish stock, coral and sea-grass
in these sites was at a low level from the outset of the project. Compounding this, the median size
of marine sanctuaries was quite small, ranging from 12 to 80 Ha, and the area was also reportedly
severely affected by Typhoon Pablo in 2013. Some LGUs reported having difficulties managing
the fish sanctuaries, with poaching and dynamite fishing continuing in some areas. By contrast, the
three GEF sites that set up larger marine sanctuaries (almost twice the size of the overall average),
experienced significant improvements in their coral cover (improved from poor to fair). The
difficulties dealing with the complex technical and social issues largely account for only 89%
disbursement of the GEF grant at loan closing. Despite the failure to meet GEO outcomes, there
was a substantial achievement of NRM Project Intermediate Outcome Indicators for both the Loan
and GEF grant as summarized in Annex 2, Table 4. Taking those achievements into consideration
a moderately unsatisfactory rating for the GEO-NRM aspects of the project seems fair.

3.3 Efficiency (Rating: Substantial)
47.      The base case Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the project is estimated at 28% (ex-ante
the ERR was 22%). The base case net present value of the project’s net economic benefit stream
(ENPV), discounted at 15% is positive at US$ 40.9 million, compared with the ex-ante ENPV
estimated of around US$ 25 million. The analysis shows that the project, both by component and
as a whole, is economically viable and has generated more economic benefit than was expected at
appraisal. The same methodology was used for both the ex-ante and ex-post analyses, while also
taking into account other benefits that accrued under the project. Details of the economic analysis
are provided in Annex 5. Benefits of the key investments that together comprised 89% of project
costs are summarized below:

a) Farm-to-Market Roads (FMRs): 1,203 km of farm-to-market roads were rehabilitated and 111
   km newly constructed. Additionally, 688 lineal meters of bridges were built. Benefits resulting



                                                 42
    from improved road surfaces and all weather access include improved market linkages,
    transport services, reduced transportation costs, time savings, improved health services as a
    result of health units being built and serviced in previously inaccessible areas, and improved
    school attendance. The ex post ERR for FMRs was determined to range from 13% (for one
    case) to 59%, with an overall average of 32%.

b) Communal Irrigation Subprojects (CIS): 2,907 hectares of irrigated land were rehabilitated and
   2,175 hectares of new land were brought under irrigation. Some 24,925 people were provided
   with new or improved irrigation and drainage services. Agricultural productivity was enhanced
   through increased yields and cropping intensity. The ERR for these investments is estimated to
   be 21%.

c) Potable Water Systems (PWS): Some 1800 community water points were rehabilitated or
   constructed, providing improvements in domestic water supply for some 104,708 people.
   Benefits were derived from time savings in fetching water and reduced incidence of waterborne
   diseases. ERRs are in the range of 19% to 36% with an average of 25%.

d) Community Fund for Agricultural Development (CFAD): Some 4,059 subprojects were
   undertaken, of which 3,488 (86%) were considered as livelihood support activities, while 570
   (14%) supported micro-enterprise development. 85% of sub projects were found to have
   sustained financial viability. There were 180,285 direct beneficiaries and some 28,406 jobs
   were created with average income increases of 35%. Incomes of CFAD direct beneficiaries
   also increased by around 35%. The financial analysis of a sample of CFAD subprojects showed
   returns (IRR) to be in the range of 30% to 73%.

48.      Unquantifiable benefits resulting from the project have also accrued from increased
economic activities coming from trade and employment as a result of strengthening rural
enterprises and supporting value chain development. Additionally, LGUs have become more
economically self-reliant through the substantial institutional development and capacitation that
accompanied the devolved delivery of agricultural services, accompanied by business process
enhancements. With regard to the relatively small NRM-GEF component (7.5% of project cost),
the key indicators of increasing fish biomass, coral and sea grass growth were not achieved and
reliable quantification of benefits from the investments is not feasible . Nevertheless, it is
reasonable to expect some economic benefits under the project resulting from strengthening joint
LGU and community management of critical biodiversity areas, and from the promotion of
technologies for conserving, rehabilitating and utilizing natural resources in coastal, marine and
terrestrial habitats.

49.     GEF-Economic Analysis: While the GEF support for the project was “fully blended” a
separate analysis was conducted in light of the somewhat different nature of the investments and
ambitious, longer-term nature of the GEO in regard to increasing seaweed and coral cover and fish
biomass. Essentially, the GEF supported investments sought to reverse the ecosystem degradation
in coastal, marine and upland areas, Overall, the GEF-NRM support which accounted for 7.8% of
project costs, had an EIRR of 16.87% at project completion. This was slightly lower than the
modest EIRR estimated at appraisal of 17.55%.




                                               43
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating

Overall Project Rating: Satisfactory
Overall GEO Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

50.      The project substantively achieved or exceeded the PDO indicators and those outcomes
have been substantiated through other quantitative, anecdotal and stakeholder feedback. In terms
of relevance, the outcomes were fully consistent with Government priorities to promote inclusive
growth and reduce poverty. Likewise from an efficiency perspective, the economic analysis for
the project shows a significant overall ERR of 28%, with significant benefits accruing from each
of the main investment categories under the project; i.e., Rural Roads (ERR 32%), Community
Irrigation Systems (ERR 21%), Potable Water Systems ( ERR 25%) and livelihood and enterprise
subprojects (IRR 30+%). The outcome of raising rural household incomes for some 1.96 million
people (46% women) to levels that substantially exceeded appraisal estimates is a significant
achievement. The decentralized institutional reform and service delivery aspects of the project are
part of a reform process that has only begun to show benefits during the latter half of the project.
Being a process, there is much that still needs to be done, particularly in regard to systematizing
the delivery of agricultural technical services. That, however, will take time pending further
reforms across the DA’s many technical agencies, though clearly this was beyond the scope of
MRDP2. Importantly, the sustainability of the reform process has been secured through the follow-
on PRDP, now under implementation. A Satisfactory rating for the Overall Project (PDO) is
therefore justified.

51.      The GEO on the other hand was not achieved. The outcomes were highly ambitious given
the relatively small scale of the interventions and the unrealistically short timeframe in which to
bring about attitude changes in regard to conservation and fishing practices needed to underpin the
expected increase in biomass of fish, corals and sea-grass. Counterbalancing this poor performance
in terms of expected outcomes, it should be acknowledged that substantial progress was made in
establishing marine sanctuaries, regenerating coastal mangroves and hillsides and in getting LGUs
focused and committed to invest in protection and enforcement of natural resources. These limited
outcomes, while demonstrating what can be done, also point to the need for such future investments
to have a stronger institutional and governance focus, provide more resources for alternative and
sustainable livelihoods, and take account of the need for sustained support over the longer term if
significant impact is to be achieved. On balance a Moderately Unsatisfactory GEO rating seems
appropriate.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (Rating:
Satisfactory)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

52.      The project and particularly the CFAD component were designed to “target disadvantaged
and vulnerable sectors in order to provide opportunities for increased incomes from agriculture and
fishery production”. While the disaggregation of data based on gender and indigenous people
assisted was not included in the indicators at appraisal, this data was in fact collected by the PSO-
M&E unit in accordance with the agreement to make use of core Bank Indicators (see section 2.3).
The results show considerable social formation and strengthening of POs in enterprise development
for the 180,285 CFAD beneficiaries. The participation of women in CFAD subprojects accounted



                                                 44
for 36% of beneficiaries, while that of Indigenous People (IP) was 19%. Overall, for the 1.96
million project beneficiaries, some 49% were women. This suggests the targeting of women and
IPs under the project was effective. In terms of poverty impact, and as discussed in section 3.2,
income levels were increased by some 36% in nominal terms, 16 percentage points above a control
group with similar characteristics.

(b)Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.      This was a key PDO for the project which has been addressed under Section 3.2. As already
noted, significant institutional reform of both the DA and LGUs has been catalyzed through the
pilot testing and implementation of a range of decentralized innovations in partnering with LGUs,
strengthening planning, budgeting, technical design, feasibility study preparation, O&M, and
M&E. These various institutional reforms have already begun to impact on the way of doing
business across the DA. The predominantly top-down production focus of the past is now being
complemented by strategies designed to support LGU identified infrastructural and technological
interventions needed to underpin the transformation of the sector's large number of small-scale
producers to become more market-oriented and vertically-integrated with agri-business.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

54.      The main point to note is that whereas MRDP2 was seen at appraisal as the second phase
of what would need to be a 15 year APL program, that program has now been replaced and
expanded into a nation-wide program under PRDP. MRDP2 has in effect become the first phase of
a national rural development program. Another significant impact which was not fully anticipated
was the pace of capacity and institutional development that occurred among LGUs participating
under the project. Whereas the project had been designed to implement a decentralization process,
this in effect catalyzed “bottom–up" capacitation and institutionalization by LGUs as they
responded to the financial incentives under the project. Collectively, these were significant and
satisfactory outcomes. Finally, although observed in other projects, the extent to which economic
activity was generated through provision of all-weather road access, coupled with the benefits from
ensuring such roads are linked to national highways, has greatly influenced the DAs approach to
supporting farm to market roads. As a result, geo-spatial, web-based tools are now being made
available under PRDP to assist local planners in selecting and designing roads to support and
optimize economic growth and job creation.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
Workshops
55.    A stakeholder workshop was conducted with the ICR team during the last Implementation
Review for the project 25 . Significant feedback, apart from that of DA staff reporting on
implementation experiences, was as follows:




25
  The Stakeholder Consultation (September 26-28, 2014) involved a broad spectrum of stakeholders under
the project. Discussions were held with separate groups of stakeholders as well as in plenary sessions in
which results and outcomes were presented and discussed. LGU mayors were strongly represented along
with the Governor of Davao del Norte. Likewise all DA Regional Executive Directors attended along with
other agency and DA project staff.


                                                   45
          LGUs were highly appreciative of the support received under MRDP2. Mayors uniformly
           commented on how the project had not only capacitated them through training and
           technical assistance, but also “shown them” how to go about getting resources for
           development that previously they had considered “un-accessible”. Collectively they
           expressed a sense of empowerment from the project and pointed to numerous cases of
           where development under MRDP2, particularly rural road construction, has led to other
           benefits, e.g., DOH support for construction of Rural Health Centers, improved school
           attendance, reduced transport costs through increased competition, improved drainage
           leading to higher crop yields, and the ability of LGUs to access other program resources.

          Regional Executive Directors (REDs) of the DA expanded on the significant changes they
           had experienced due to the project and how the “MRDP2 Model” was now referred to as
           the way forward for the DA as it sought to change from “rowing” (or implementing
           programs), to “steering” (providing financial and technical support for LGU
           implementation). MRDP2 was reported as having provided the operational procedures and
           experience they needed to implement a decentralized system of service delivery. Enabling
           this was the increased level of authority now vested in them by the Secretary of Agriculture
           to plan, coordinate and direct activities, as well as supportive DBM budget processes that
           provides for the downloading of budget directly to the RFOs.

4. Assessment of Risk to                           Development             Outcome   and     Global
   Environment Outcome
Project Development Outcome Rating: Moderate
Global Environment Outcome Rating: High

56.      With the follow-on US$ 501.25 M PRDP already under implementation, there is reason to
be cautiously optimistic that the institutional reforms supporting decentralized service delivery by
the DA will be sustained. Importantly the institutional reforms are also backed-up by the AFMA
legislation of 1997, the Local Government Code of 1991, and significant budget reforms instituted
by DBM to support the decentralized planning and budgeting process and accountability. While
experience with the process of institutional reform, especially in the DA, has at times experienced
“roll-back’, notably to periods of “top-down” and “production oriented targeting”, the current
Government Administration will be in office until 2016. That provides time to consolidate the
institutional reforms started under MRDP2 through the follow-on PRDP. Importantly, PRDP was
designed to cross Administrations26, thereby providing for a continuum of implementation in the
interest of sustaining the reforms. Experience from implementing MRDP2 has shown there have
been no instances of where political changes at the local or provincial level have had anything but
a positive impact on project implementation and the sustainability of the investments. A further
reinforcing factor has been the approval of the DA’s Rationalization Plan in 2013 which provides
for a number of organizational and administrative reforms that should, if implemented well,
collectively strengthen the decentralized and devolved way of doing business in the DA.

57.      The risk to sustaining the GEO outcomes is high, given the failure to achieve the GEO
indicators and the fact that the activities financed under the NRM and GEF component are not part
of the core mandate of the DA. There is a reasonable chance that some of the intermediate outcomes
will be sustained, given that all municipalities have integrated their NRM Plans into the Municipal


26
     Philippine Administrations are limited to a six-year, non-re-electable term.


                                                        46
Development Plans and some have set aside a separate budget. Several LGUs have also used the
MRDP2 resources to leverage additional funds from NGOs and other Government programs to
expand their mangrove rehabilitation and plantation programs. Behavioral changes have also been
observed in some targeted areas, including intercropping, planting of fruit trees, use of organic
fertilizer and practices to prevent erosion. The SIGA activities, on the other hand, were often very
small and are unlikely to develop into viable business enterprises.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

58.      Preparation of the project spanned about two years, with MRDP I finishing in 2004 and
MRDP2 being approved in May 2007. Project preparation was built on the successful design and
outcomes of MRDP1 which also included a number of “triggers” that had been set by the Bank as
conditions for a second phase. Attention was given by the Bank preparation team to strengthening
the management structure for the project through the PSO by ensuring sufficient and qualified
staffing from the outset and a shift in its role from oversight to providing support. Concomitantly
the MRDP2 design correctly provided for the strengthening of the Regional Program Coordinating
Offices (RPCOs). The early discussions with AusAid which led to complementary TA support for
the institutional reforms, as well as with GEF for NRM strengthening was also well conceived.
The Bank’s role in designing and pursuing institutional reforms under the project in line with the
AFMA Act and Local Government Code was particularly commendable, despite experience under
the DFIMD project at the time where there had been back-tracking by the DA on similar reforms.
In that regard it is evident that the lessons of MRDP 1 were well addressed.

59.     On the other hand it would seem that in terms of risks, the commitment to the reform
objectives of the project were underestimated by the Bank in light of difficulties being encountered
in implementing the DFIMD project (2004 to 2009). There was also an ongoing debate at the time
among Oversight Agencies surrounding NG: LG cost sharing that effectively resulted in an 18
month hiatus in project start-up. As previously noted it was therefore fortuitous that through a
change in Administration and agriculture sector strategy around mid-term, that the pace of
implementation accelerated. The design issues previously discussed through the inclusion of a
small NRM component (3.6% of the Loan) has important lessons for future operations. The
component had the appearance of being “tacked-on”. Being conservation based with long-term
objectives, it was only peripherally linked to achieving the PDO and not integrated with other
project components except the GEF. NRM investments were also too widely spread and
inadequately funded to have significant impact. Given, however, that the main design of the project
was sufficiently robust to enable satisfactory outcomes to be achieved, albeit with a two year delay,
a Quality at Entry rating of Moderately Satisfactory seems fair.

(b)Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

60.    Project Supervision was managed by staff from the Philippine Country Office.
Implementation Reviews were done twice yearly throughout the project and correctly identified
and documented the implementation issues in a timely manner. Aide Memoires shared with
Government were comprehensive and direct in highlighting concerns and issues needing follow-


                                                 47
up. The Aide Memoires were agreed with DA-Management and provided detailed monitoring and
assessments of technical achievements and issues under each component vis-à-vis agreed targets
as well as monitoring of procurement, FM and safeguard aspects. “Management Action Matrices”
defining specific areas needing action were regularly incorporated in Aide Memoires and reflected
in Bank management letters to the DA Secretary after each review mission. The 18 month delay in
project start-up certainly contributed to a preoccupation with “catching-up” and tended to focus
Bank attention more on “disbursements and achievement of annual physical targets than on
reporting of progress towards achievement of outcomes. ISRs and Aide Memoirs were lacking in
that regard. That said, the necessary data collection and quite a number of special studies were
undertaken to enable a sound and timely evaluation of the project. While there was strong technical
oversight of the relatively small NRM-GEF linked component, stronger institutional/ management
oversight of that component should have identified the overly ambitious outcome expectations. In
retrospect, it would seem the NRM-GEF component design should have been restructured to be
more narrowly focused, with perhaps better outcomes. That aside, restructurings were done as
required except for the oversight in not formally “dropping” the technically non-feasible
measurement of an intermediate outcome indicator for NRM on levels of siltation and
sedimentation. The input by the Bank at mid-term and the recommendations emanating from that
review were critical in reshaping the project and building ownership in the DA.

61.      Beyond the above mostly good supervision practices, the Bank can be credited with
supporting project implementation in additional ways that certainly contributed to the evolution of
the project and the ultimate achievement of satisfactory outcomes. These included; i) extensive on-
the job training by Bank staff for the PSO, RPCOs and LGU staff, especially in regard to financial
management and procurement, ii) effective use made by the Bank through locally hired experts to
assist project implementation that enabled issues identified through Supervision missions to be
quickly addressed and coaching provided as necessary (e.g., in feasibility report preparation,
safeguards, engineering design aspects etc.), iii) special studies were facilitated by the Bank (e.g.,
through FAO) to provide timely interim assessments and recommendations on various
implementation aspects, iv) the geo-tagging innovation developed by the Bank under MRDP2, that
has been internationally recognized as good practice, greatly strengthened the transparency of
interventions and has enabled monitoring of investments at levels not previously possible, and iv)
the close working relationship maintained between the Bank team and the Project Management
(PSO) was undoubtedly a key factor behind the proactive approach of the PSO throughout
implementation in seeking solutions and in facilitating the evolution of the project from a second
phase APL, to the forerunner of a nation-wide program under PRDP. On balance, a Moderately
Satisfactory rating is warranted.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.     The Bank’s long-term commitment to the reform process based on AFMA and the LGC
which it supported through two phases of MRDP, and subsequently through PRDP, is in itself
commendable. Although the AFMA Act and LGC were enacted in 1997 and 1991 respectively,
this well formulated legislation had never been fully embraced nor resourced appropriately by the
responsible national agencies. Institutional reforms in the DA linked to AFMA and the LGC had
also been unsuccessful through the Bank’s support for the DFIMD project. However, under
MRDP2, the Bank’s perseverance in supporting the goals of AFMA and the LGC have paid off
with the DA’s adoption of what is now commonly known as the “MRDP2 way” in implementing
investments through and in partnership with LGUs. The Bank’s considerable experience was
effectively brought to bear in helping to guide and support the DA management throughout this
process. Particularly noteworthy has been the supervision support given to strengthening safeguard


                                                 48
provisions and monitoring in feasibility studies, strengthening of financial management,
particularly by LGUs, and the considerable training provided in planning, financial management,
preparation of feasibility studies and procurement, together with introduction of groundbreaking
geo-tagging. The attention given to developing operational procedures and design standards
applicable to all DA programs has also forged the way for this to be mainstreamed in the DA
through the PRDP. The close working relationships between the DA and the Bank Team in the
Manila office has been commendable. This very satisfactory performance notwithstanding, there
were some design issues in regard to the small NRM & GEF linked component that were overly
ambitious and given the limited resources and time frame available could well have been
restructured to be more narrowly focused, with perhaps better outcomes. On balance a Moderately
Satisfactory rating is well deserved.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.       The project was appraised at a time of fiscal constraints and commodity price shocks that
tended to accentuate the Administration and DA leadership focus on achieving production targets
of major commodities, principally rice and corn. As a result, those nationally controlled commodity
programs overrode what had been the more market oriented and decentralized agricultural service
delivery goals of AFMA (1997) and the devolution of functions to Local Governments required
under the LGC (1991). Prior to mid-term of MRDP2, there was little support for internalizing the
decentralized reforms of either AFMA or the LGC that were in fact central to the design of MRDP2.
The debate over appropriate NG: LGU cost sharing levels also remained an unresolved issue for
the first two years of the project. A clear policy on this is still in abeyance at project completion.
The inclusion of the DOF inspired “Performance Grant” scheme in the project as an incentive for
LGU revenue generation had to be retracted within months of loan approval. On the other hand,
following the change in Administration in 2010, Borrower27 support for the project increased as
the benefits of the devolved planning and investment became apparent and there was strong support
from the Borrower for the two-year extension of the Loan closing to compensate for the delays in
project start-up. That proved to be crucial for the attainment of the project’s objectives. The
Borrower oversight agencies are also to be credited for supporting the sustainability and further
institutionalization of reforms initiated under MRDP2, through their support and approval of the
follow-on PRDP. On balance therefore, a Moderately Satisfactory rating for the Government
performance seems fair.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     Implementation, as previously discussed, had two distinct phases corresponding to the
change in Administrations in July 2010. From project effectiveness in 2009 to June 2010,
implementation of MRDP2 was slow. Although due mainly to uncertainties created by debates
surrounding the NG: LG costs sharing, DA management at the time was also insufficiently
proactive in trying to resolve the issue and there remained little appetite in the DA to follow-through

on the decentralization reforms that were at the core of the MRDP2 design. That said it was the
CFA arrangement developed by DA Management at the time which ultimately broke the cost-
sharing impasse, although it was not until after the change in Administration when the required
budget was allocated by the incoming leadership of the DA. Under that new leadership, a strong
commitment was made to the Bank that every effort would be made to turn the project
implementation around, given that the revised policies and strategies of the DA were aligned with
AFMA, which also underpinned the design of MRDP2. Thereafter the CFA was funded, staff
constraints in RPCOs were addressed, authority of RFO was strengthened, devolved
implementation in partnership with LGUs was pursued, and the project became a central focus of
the DA management as the instrument for achieving their ambitious vision of a nation-wide rural
development program that in fact has eventuated through PRDP. Also commendable is that
throughout implementation, the PSO was proactive in organizing and conducting training for RFO
and LGU staff; e.g., in planning, geo-tagging, feasibility study preparation and analysis, FM, and
procurement. Particularly notable has been the transparency and good governance followed
throughout implementation, as reflected by there being no significant mis-procurement or related
incidences, public posting on the MRDP2 website of all procurement supported by geo-tagging,
including list of contractors “blacklisted for poor performance. The management of the project’s
PSO participated actively in the design and preparation of the follow-on PRDP project, thereby
achieving a seamless transition from MRDP2 to the national program. Overall, giving due weight
to the development impact attributable to the Implementing agencies performance, than to start-up
implementation issues, an overall Satisfactory rating for the DA’s performance would seem
appropriate.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.      From the foregoing assessment, the success of the project owes much to; (i) the
commitment and professionalism of the PSO in implementing the project, and (ii) to the DA
management support and commitment to follow-through on the approach and reforms. Since the
change in leadership in mid-2010, the DA management has been proactive in finding solutions to
difficult issues and in recognizing the opportunities for harmonizing procedures and approaches
across the DA. At the same time the approval of the oversight agencies of the follow-on PRDP
under the same CFA arrangement, without formally addressing the long standing issues
surrounding the NG/LGU cost sharing formula for externally funded projects, remains a policy
issue that needs to be resolved. On balance a Moderately Satisfactory rating would seem to be
appropriate.

6. Lessons Learned

i)   Institutional Reform. MRDP2 provides a good example of both the considerable time it can
     take to bring about significant institutional reform and the importance for the Bank of
     maintaining the engagement through dialogue, sector work and projects as appropriate over the
     longer term. In that same context, MRDP2 also demonstrates how progress on institutional
     reform can at times be more effectively pursued through smaller projects that build a ground-
     swell of support within the institution, rather than through national programs that can be seen
     as more threatening by vested interests. The success of MRDP2 in contributing to broad based
     institutional reform, whereas DFIMD failed when focused at the national level during the same
     time period, is a case in point.




                                                 50
ii) LGU Capacity. Within the Philippine socio-political context, an important lesson relates to the
    capacity of LGUs, particularly those in poor rural areas which are broadly believed among
    national agencies, notably the Oversight Agencies, to be weak and incapable of undertaking
    detailed planning, feasibility studies, procurement, financial management and the like. The
    evidence from MRDP2 shows that when confronted with the appropriate financial incentives
    and provided with clear direction and support, such LGUs can quite quickly come up to speed
    in strengthening their capacity and procedures. Moreover, experience from the project has
    shown that, once capacitated and “shown-the-way”, the level of motivation and effectiveness
    in seeking out other programs and resources, even by poor LGUs, should not be underestimated.

iii) The nexus of “bottom-up” and Strategic Objectives. The merits of CDD have been well
     demonstrated and the approach is central to many Bank supported projects in the Philippines,
     e.g., though Kalahi-CIDDS, ARMM Social Fund, and Mindanao Trust Fund. This was also a
     central element in the design of MRDP2 and the means to facilitate the implementation of
     subprojects responding to local demand. The approach has been particularly effective in
     addressing the needs of poor and vulnerable groups. However as MRDP2 has demonstrated in
     the case of the DA, the agency charged with ensuring national food security and development
     of a modern and competitive agriculture sector, the CDD approach needs to also incorporate
     and overlay of National and Regional strategic objectives to ensure the cost-effectiveness of
     programs. Examples from MRDP2 highlight this point, e.g., development of rural roads at the
     request of communities that do not link to main arteries or markets and requests for support for
     enterprises or crops that are not particularly suited to the area. The design of MRDP2 was
     refined at mid-term to reflect this learning and the design of PRDP has further expanded on the
     experience. The process now provides for national and regional strategic objectives to be
     integrated at the provincial level with local plans and stakeholder inputs to better balance
     strategic objectives and comparative advantage, with locally “felt-needs”.

iv) Natural Resource Management-issues for implementation. Under MRDP2, NRM subprojects,
    with the support of GEF, were designed and implemented as “free standing” activities. Several
    lessons come from this experience. Firstly, as implementation proceeded it became evident that
    NRM-GEF goals, particularly in regard to “marine protected areas” adjacent to populated
    coastal areas could not have any hope of being achieved without greater attention to alternative
    and sustainable income generating activities. Secondly, rather than implement NRM-GEF
    subprojects as “free-standing” activities, they could have been more effective if integrated as
    part of other components (CFAD and RI). Thirdly, the limited loan funding allocated to the
    NRM-GEF activities, coupled with the wide-spread selection of NRM sites in 24 LGUs, overly
    diluted the ability to have a meaningful impact with the available resources, and: Fourthly,
    NRM is a complex undertaking where incentives, livelihoods, cultural, social and political
    aspects need to be addressed, along with technical considerations. These take significant
    periods of sustained effort and the associated institutional issues can be complex and depend
    very much on sustained local incentives and commitment. The failings of the largely
    technological approach pursued under this small component of MRDP2, coupled with overly
    ambitious objectives, provide important project design lessons.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component and Overall Project Assessment
1.      The project was implemented over 7.5 years, including a two year extension from its
effectiveness July 3, 2007, to its closing on December 31, 2014. The goal of implementing MRDP2
across 26 provinces and 225 municipalities was achieved. The results directly attributable to
investments28 under the project were extensive and included:

        1,976,694 direct project beneficiaries of whom 49% were women.
        111 km of new rural roads were constructed
        1,203km of rural roads were rehabilitated
        688 linear meters of single lane bridges were constructed
        2,175 ha of new irrigation were developed and 2,907 ha of irrigation and drainage were
         provided with improved irrigation and drainage services
        19 Water used associations formed or strengthened. Some 24,925 people were provided
         with new/improved irrigation and drainage services of whom 7,098 (28%) were women.
        104,708 people provide with access to improved water sources
        1800 community water points constructed or rehabilitated
        4,059 CFAD (livelihood & micro-enterprise) sub projects were undertaken involving
         180,285 beneficiaries. Of those 46% were women and 24% were IPs. Among the IPs some
         45% were women
        720 ha (GEF) and 1,031 ha (NRM) of marine and fish sanctuaries have been established
        449 ha (GEF) and 697 (NRM) of mangrove forest have been rehabilitated and protected,
         and
        994 ha (GEF) and 2,191 (NRM) of agro-forest or 96% of the original target have been
         rehabilitated and protected.

2.      In terms of outcomes, as discussed below, the PDOs for the project were achieved while a
moderately unsatisfactory outcome was achieved for the GEO. Nevertheless, there was substantial
achievement of virtually all Loan and GEF Intermediate Outcomes. Notably, while the project was
a second phase of what was projected to be 15 year program (APL), the approach and institutional
reforms supported by the project evolved at a more rapid pace than originally envisaged. The
project has provided the platform on which a much larger and nation-wide rural development
program has been launched under the Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP)29.

Project Development Objectives

3.       The PDO for the project had two elements; (i) PDO1; to improve livelihood opportunities
for targeted communities in Mindanao; and (ii) PDO 2; to institutionalize a decentralized system
for agriculture and fishery services delivery that promotes participation, transparency and
accountability. Investments under the project in rural infrastructure (RI) and micro-enterprise

   The Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP), supported by a US$501.25 M Bank loan and US$ 7
M GEF Grant, was approved August 29, 2014. Its design builds on that of MRDP2 and will be rolled-out
nation-wide. The Project will promote more inclusive rural development by supporting smallholders and
fishers to increase their marketable surpluses, and their access to markets. Also supported are changes in the
planning, resource programming & implementation practices of the DA. It will facilitate the integration and
financing of priority local investments derived from the DA’s AFMA plans which have been developed using
a value chain approach, and through a consultative process with local stakeholders.

development (CFAD) were directly supportive of income and employment generation under PDO
1 (Table 1) while the institutional reforms under the IGR component were directly linked with
achievement of PDO2. The conservation aspects of the NRM component, being long-term in
nature, were more supportive of the GEO. This assessment finds the PDO for the project was
satisfactorily achieved as discussed below.

4.       PDO 1: Improve access to livelihood opportunities of targeted communities: The
Performance Indictor of increasing average household incomes of beneficiary communities by 20%
and 10% higher than a control group was achieved. Overall, the results show the following at
project completion:

 Household real income in the project areas was increased to PhP102,759;a 36% increase in
  nominal terms, equivalent to a 20% real increase. Likewise the target of increasing average
  household incomes by 10% above the control was also achieved. Control group real incomes
  increased to PhP96,468, a 10% increase compared with the 36% increase in the project areas.
  The baseline for the Control group was 16% above the baseline for the project areas, but
  household incomes grew more rapidly for project areas and significantly overtook income
  levels of the control group.

The total number of beneficiaries is estimated to be 1,976,614, of whom 49% are women (Table
2).

5.       A summary of the methodology followed in evaluating the project outcomes is provided
below30 and detailed in the Consultant’s report (ref. Annex 6, report viii). The results reflect end
2013 data. Household Surveys were the primary data collection method used to compare
beneficiary conditions at project completion with equivalent baseline data. Mindanao-wide, the
annual average nominal household income in areas covered by the project was 6.5% higher in 2013
than the annual average income of families in non-project areas of Mindanao. This reflects a
significant change since 2010 (MRDP2 baseline survey), when nominal household incomes were
higher in non-project areas (i.e., Project areas; PhP67589 (PhP13518 per capita income) and Non-
project areas PhP78471 (PhP15,694 per capita income). Nevertheless, at that time both project and
non-project per capita incomes were below the country’s poverty threshold of PhP16,871 (2009).
Four years later, annual average nominal household incomes across Mindanao were PhP102759
and PhP96,468 for the project areas and non-project areas, respectively. In per capita terms this
corresponds to PhP20552 and PhP19294 for project and non-project areas, whereas the 2012 annual
per capita poverty threshold for the country was PhP18,935. This reflects a significant reversal of
the average household economic condition, especially in project areas. The household nominal
income of target communities in MRDP2 areas rose by 36%, while that in non-MRDP2 areas it
grew by 10% (using CPI 2006 as base year and an 11.9% increase in commodity prices from 2010–
2013).

6.      A disaggregation of the data shows considerable Regional and minority group differences.
Target beneficiaries in Region 10 recording the highest average increase in household nominal
income (45%) over baseline, followed by Region 12 (20%), Region 13 (17%) and Region 11 (2%).
There was negative increase recorded for Regions 9 (-6%) and ARMM (-25%), although target
beneficiaries in ARMM reported a two-fold increase in on-farm income, from PhP15,743 to


30
   The evaluation used the same five data collection methods as for the Baseline Survey i.e., Household
Surveys, Focus Group Discussions, Key informant interviews, and LGU Survey questionnaires. Secondary
data was collected on (i) physical outputs and expenditures (ii) institutional processes and strategies adopted
by DA-RFOs, LGUs, and beneficiaries, governance reforms, (iii) profiles of community organizations
established and, (iv) listing of LGUs that participated in each component of the project. For both the baseline
and Project Completion evaluation, Household Surveys were the primary source of data. Half of the
respondents were drawn from program areas, with the other half comprising a control group from non-
program areas. Using the Fisher (1989) and Kish (1975) formulas for determining sample size, a total of 960
households were estimated for each group, providing a 97% confidence level. Respondents were randomly
selected beneficiaries of the RI, CFAD, and NRM components based on unequal-multi-stage cluster sampling.
In the non-program areas, households were randomly selected based on barangay listings. The selection of
control municipalities was based on the similarities of their characteristics with the target municipalities in
terms of poverty incidence, absence of foreign-assisted projects, population of women and IPs, as well as
distance from each other. The evaluation measured: (i) regional differences in on-farm, off-farm, nonfarm,
and total household income; (ii) incomes of female-headed households; and (iii) incomes of IP households.
(On-farm: income derived from farmer’s own farm (i.e., rice, corn, fish, livestock, etc.); Off-farm: income
derived from other farms i.e. labor wage, rent of farm, equipment/animals, or any service fee from working
in other farms); and Non-farm: income derived from sources not related to farming activities (all other
incomes not counted in on-farm and off-farm).




                                                      57
PhP39,944. Noteworthy also is that while there was a significant 36% increase in average annual
household incomes for MRDP2 project areas as a whole that per capita incomes in project areas
are still roughly on par with the national per capita poverty threshold levels of PhP 18,904 for most
regions. For Region 10 per capita incomes in the project areas were significantly lower at PhP
14,613. These results notwithstanding, the focus of MRDP2 on areas where poverty and the
existence of vulnerable groups were more pervasive could account for the relatively low per capita
income levels, despite the significant gains that can be attributed to the project. Likewise, average
per capita incomes for IPs at PhP16,915 were also lower than the annual average per capita poverty
threshold level..

7.       The main sources of household income at project completion were from on-farm (39%),
off-farm (3%), and non-farm (58%)31. Household incomes from on-farm activities rose by 15%,
and from non-farm activities, by as much as 67%. The significant increase in non-farm incomes is
attributed in part to the benefits from CFAD subprojects, as well as from improved road conditions
that have led to more people having motorcycles which they use for transporting passengers and
produce. Income from agricultural production has shifted somewhat to non-farm activities
perceived as providing more attractive income source. By contrast, off-farm household incomes
dropped by about 40% due in part at least to the shift in work from seasonal farm labor to on-farm
or non-farm activities.

8.      PDO 2: Institutionalize a decentralized system for agriculture and fisheries service delivery
that promotes participation and accountability. The Results Framework did not provide a PDO
indicator, but it was noted in the PAD that this PDO would be assessed against outcome indicators
for Component I (IGR). Those indicators were achieved i.e.:

 Beneficiaries reported an 87% level of satisfaction with LGU service delivery in the program
  areas at project completion: a substantial increase over the baseline of 37%. LGUs in project
  areas were assessed as having improved their service delivery by 48% more than their
  counterparts in the sampled non-project areas. 32 But there was also an 80% improvement
  recorded in satisfaction levels with service delivery in non-project areas. This may also be a
  reflection of the decentralized system of service delivery implemented by the DA through its
  RFOs in Mindanao which would have benefited all LGUs, whether or not they received
  investment support under MRDP2.
 At project completion 100% LGUs rated their ability to plan and implement investments as
  satisfactory or better, due to the project (the target was a70% improvement).




31
   On-farm: income derived from farmer’s own farm (i.e., rice, corn, fish, livestock, etc.); Off-farm: income
derived from other farms i.e. labor wage, rent of farm equipment/animals, or any service fee from working
in other farms); and Non-farm: income derived from sources not related to farming activities (all other
incomes not counted in on-farm and off-farm).
32
   The higher than expected baseline of (37%) compared with the 35% target set at appraisal clearly
underestimated perceptions as to levels of satisfaction with service delivery and could perhaps be attributed
to other government programs including MRDP1. Nevertheless, feedback from stakeholders suggests the
strategy under MRDP2 of bringing the subproject planning process down to the barangay level and the
targeting of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups) contributed to the increased and focused delivery of
services.




                                                     58
 Based on the five Municipal LGUs and six PLGUs sampled where accounting records
  separated expenditure sufficiently to enable a thorough analysis, there were large increases in
  LGU agricultural sector expenditures, ranging from almost 700 to over 1000%. The increases
  in expenditures were greatest in 2011 and 2012 corresponding with the peak in program
  implementation for RI, CFAD, and NRM subprojects under MRDP2. Based on this data and
  feedback from LGU and stakeholders there has been an upsurge in agricultural sector
  expenditures in the MRDP2 program areas. (Target was a 15% increase in expenditure)

9.       Given the process involved in institutionalizing a decentralized system of service delivery,
the above indicators did not enable the extent to which decentralization has taken place to be
evaluated. For this ICR therefore, the methodology used was to assess; i) whether decentralized
planning and budget allocations made were effectively implemented?, ii) do LGUs and other
stakeholders have an effective role in determining the needs and types of service delivery provided
by the DA and/or from other sources?, iii) is accountability for quality of service delivery is being
applied?, and iv) are systems in place to support and sustain the decentralized approach?. Based on
this methodology, the evaluation shows that MRDP2 can be credited with much of what has been
achieved and that an institutionalized and decentralized system for agriculture and fisheries service
delivery is well accepted and quite advanced among DA-RFOs in Mindanao. A Satisfactory rating
of this indicator is therefore warranted.

10.      MRDP2 can be credited with establishing the systems, operational procedures and
confidence within the DA to pursue a decentralized system more widely across its commodity
programs and bureaus nation-wide. That undoubtedly will take time and be a graduated process
under PRDP, given the diversity of agencies and entrenched “ways of doing business”. The process
is however underway with the decision to roll-out decentralized processes under PRDP; a
significant step being the recent approval of a harmonized Manual for DA-LGU Engagement
prepared under MRDP2 which standardizes protocols and procedures for infrastructure investments
across all DA programs.

11.      With the decentralized system developed under MRDP2, DA-RFOs have reported
substantial improvements in their capacity, operational experience, Procurement, FM, Safeguard
and MIS procedures. They also reported significant improvements in their ability to plan and
coordinate technical services formerly provided “top-down” by DA line agencies. Likewise LGUs
reported having gained significant benefits from the decentralized approach to service delivery that
has given them the responsibility for implementing DA programs and enabled them to determine
the type and nature of technical services needed; drawing upon DA line agencies, state universities,
NGOs and the private sector. LGUs have established their own systems to accommodate this new
way of doing business by the DA. The degree to which even relatively weak LGUs have been able
to respond under MRDP2 is something that is seemingly not well appreciated by National
Government agencies, It provides an important lesson, at least in the Philippine context that i.e.,
“LGUs perceived as having weak governance and capacity, can quite rapidly find mechanisms
through training, outsourcing etc., to prepare quality feasibility studies, fulfill processing
requirements, and contract for other services as needed, once given the right incentives”; of the
type provided by MRDP2. Key results and intermediate outcomes from project interventions that
contributed to achieving this PDO are summarized in Table 3.

Global Environment Objective (GEO)

12.      The GEF-NRM support provided under the project was to assist in conserving critical
coastal and marine biodiversity, supported by sustainable land management in linked upland areas,
by removing barriers to mainstreaming marine and coastal biodiversity conservation. Based on the
assessment in sites where comparison with baseline (2010 study) was possible33, the key outcome
indicators in the Results Framework for the GEO were not achieved as indicated below:

 The Target of 30% increase in fish biomass and density in targeted protected areas was not
  achieved. The average fish biomass in the three sample sites ranged from 4.2-6.8 kg/500m²; a
  12-29% decrease from the baseline. The average fish density in the seven sample sites ranged
  from 249-425 individuals/500m². The trends in average fish density are less clear, with one
  survey indicating a decrease of 18% while the second survey indicates an increase of 23%.
  Different methodologies and data sources used make it difficult to draw a final conclusion.
 The Target of 10% decrease in siltation and sedimentation could not be measured. It was
  agreed during the 7th implementation support mission that this indicator was impractical to
  measure. Although identified for restructuring, it was never formally dropped.
 The Target of 10% increase in coral and sea-grass cover was not achieved. The average
  coverage of sea-grass in the two sample sites was 34%, which represents a 15% decrease from
  the baseline. The average cover of live hard coral ranged from 30-35% based on two surveys
  (equivalent to a 16% and 14% decrease respectively). These computations exclude “outlier
  data” from two sites that showed an increase of 150% and 96% respectively.

13.     The GEO outcomes were highly ambitious given the relatively small scale of the
interventions, the unrealistically short timeframe in which to bring about changes in attitude and
fishing practices, and because the coastal reefs selected were prone to sedimentation. The time
frame was also short for having measurable improvements in coral growth, fish stocks and biomass,
especially since the critical mass of fish stock, coral and sea-grass in these sites was at a low level
from the outset of the project. Compounding this, the median size of marine sanctuaries was quite
small, ranging from 12 to 80 ha, and the area was also reportedly severely affected by Typhoon
Pablo in 2013. Some LGUs reported having difficulties managing the fish sanctuaries, with
poaching and dynamite fishing continuing in some areas. By contrast, the three GEF sites that set
up larger marine sanctuaries (almost twice the size of the overall average) experienced significant
improvements in their coral cover (improved from poor to fair). Despite the failure to meet GEO


33
   An assessment was done by consultants (July to September 2014) using an enhanced line intercept
transect approach (a photo transect was used for greater accuracy). Difficulties resulted from the lack of
comparable baseline information in most of the sites. A validation exercise was done in October 13 to 24,
2014 in some sites to strengthen the accuracy of the findings. A joint BFAR-DA-LGU-SDS team
conducted the re-assessment in five sites using a simple line intercept transect method. The results
generally confirmed the initial results, except for change in fish density. While the initial assessment
showed a significant decrease, the validation showed a significant increase. The difference was mainly
attributed to the different methods used and inclusion of some “outlier” data. The validation exercise used a
qualitative approach log-scale method, which relied more on stakeholder perception, as opposed to the
photo enhanced line intercept transect used in the initial assessment. Clear deficiencies are apparent in how
sites were delineated and sampled, as well as how the processes by which the fish biomass, coral and sea
grass baseline was measured, subsequently monitored and assessed at project completion. This led to
considerable variation in the data and controversy as to the accuracy and interpretation of the data. That
said, an analysis of the orders of magnitude from the various data sets support the overall assessment that
the GEO was not achieved.

Project Intermediate Outcomes

14.      The indicators against which the project was to be monitored and evaluated were modified
on three occasions. A fourth revision was proposed but not formalized in the second to last (i.e.11th)
Implementation Review Mission for the project34. The first formal change was the dropping of the
indicator on LGUs adoption of accountability measures linked to the Performance-based grants.
The second change was the addition of ‘Core Indicators” although this was not formalized through
restructuring. The third change followed the approval of the AusAid supported technical assistance
grant (TF011929) which expanded the monitoring of Component 1 (Investment for Governance
Reform and Program Administration (IGR)). The following summarizes the main outputs by
component.




34
  The March 2014 Bank Review mission recommended restructuring to improve assessment of outcomes,
but this did not occur. It was suggested some indicators should be elevated to the level of the PDO as they
measured PDO outcomes while some ‘intermediate’ indicators were dropped or replaced as they were
actually results, rather than the more appropriate output indicators. Coming late in the project’s
implementation, this recommendation was never formally adopted.

Cost at Appraisal; US$4.4 M plus $3M grant (TF 011929). Actual cost at project completion;
US$ 9.79 M (223%) of appraisal).

15.       The three sub-components were designed to:

i)   Improve the capacity of Participating LGUs in resources management and service delivery in
     agriculture and fisheries to perform the full range of functions assigned to them under the LGC
     and AFMA. The approach was to be through a “Learning-by-doing” which proved to be
     effective during MRDP1.
ii) Enhance the capacity of DA to support participating LGUs’ agricultural planning and
     development and agricultural research and extension through local community participatory
     process. and,
iii) Strengthen the capacity of participating LGUs in the project implementation and coordination.
     At the LGU level, training and non-training interventions on project support and coordination
     were designed to target staff from the planning and financial management offices, plus those
     coming from the offices of the LGU agriculturist and engineers assigned project facilitation
     roles. For DA, capacity-building was to be directed at officially-designated personnel of the
     RFUs and key service units at the DA central office, particularly those for planning, field
     operations, and financial management, and
iv) Program Support and coordination.

16.     The above activities were subsequently complemented through the AusAid TA which
sought to:

i)  Strengthen the ability of the Municipal LGUs to identify, select and implement infrastructure,
    livelihood and natural resource subprojects; enhance complementary ability of Provincial
    LGUs, DA Regional Field Units (RFUs, RPCOs & PSO)to provide the MLGUs with
    enabling support all throughout the subproject cycle, and
ii) Establish a platform for Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) to further enhance the process of
    agriculture and fishery services and investments delivery emphasizing the value chain approach
    in selected MRDP 2 sites.

17.    The achievements vis-a-vis the Performance Indicators set for Component 1 (IGR) were
fully met as summarized below and in the Results Framework (see ICR Datasheet). The
complementary outcomes supported by the AusAid- TF011929 are summarized in Table 5.

 At project completion, 100% of LGUs rated their ability to better plan and implement
  investment programs (control systems, planning, supervision) as satisfactory or better, due to
  the project (target was 70%).
 Beneficiaries reported an 87% level of satisfaction with LGU service delivery in the
      program areas at project completion (by 80% in non-program areas): a substantial
      increase over the baseline of 37%. LGUs in project areas were assessed as having
      improved their service delivery by 48% more than their counterparts in the sampled
      non-project areas (The target was 35% although this proved to be below the baseline of 37% ).
  (See additional discussion above under PDO2).
 Based on the five Municipal LGUs and six PLGUs sampled where accounting records
  separated expenditure sufficiently to enable a thorough analysis, there were large increases in
  LGU agricultural sector expenditures, ranging from almost 700 to over 1000%. The increases
  in expenditures were greatest in 2011 and 2012 corresponding with the peak in program

     implementation for RI, CFAD, and NRM subprojects under MRDP2. Based on this data and
     feedback from LGU and stakeholders there has been an upsurge in agricultural sector
     expenditures across the MRDP2 program areas. (The target was for a 15%increase in
     investment)
    Level of satisfaction with selection and implementation of subprojects among DA-RPCOs,
     LGUs, farmer-clients and private sector increased by 7% on average which is lower than the
     target (+25%). However, the baseline was already very high (88% on average) making it
     impossible to achieve targeted growth. Taking it into account as well as recognizing the fact
     that the project’s activities managed to increase it up to 94% on average, this outcome is
     assessed as largely achieved.
    All studied subprojects were finished in acceptable quality and within standard costs. This
     result exceeds targeted 80%.
    On average LGUs’ satisfaction with the fairness, transparency and efficiency increased by
     around 5% each. This result is lower than the target (+50%). However, the baselines were
     already very high making them impossible to achieve targeted growth. Taking it into account
     as well as recognizing the fact that the project’s activities managed to increase satisfaction with
     fairness, transparency and efficiency up to 92%-93%, this outcome is assessed as largely
     achieved.
    As for satisfaction of participating LGUs with technical and other support provided by their
     respective RPCO and Provincial LGUs in the preparation, processing and implementation
     oversight of the sub-projects, it is also achieved target (although the baseline was already very
     high exceeding the target).
    Agribusiness entrepreneurs with stronger confidence in the business environment in the target
     sites. Target: at least 50% increase in agribusiness entrepreneur confidence.
    Target for POs in terms of stronger confidence in the business environment is achieved with
     54% growth. As for the Private Agribusiness Entrepreneurs, their baseline was identified as
     high as 89% making it impossible to achieve targeted 50% growth. Taking it into account and
     recognizing the fact that the project’s activities managed to increase it up to 100%, this outcome
     is assessed as largely achieved.

18.      As also discussed in relation to PDO 2 above, these indicators do not capture the full range
of institutional developments attributable to the project which occurred though an evolution in the
approach and scope of activities. Whereas the original design sought to “improve the capacity of
LGUs to perform the full range of functions assigned to them under the LGC and AFMA”, this was
refined at mid-term to focus more on strengthening the partnership between the DA and LGUs in
planning and implementation of subprojects that, while responding to local demands, were also
linked with DA regional and national strategic objectives. As the project evolved, it became clear
that while there were merits in supporting agricultural development in a decentralized manner
through community (bottom-up) participation, there was also a need to be more strategic in how
such investments were made. In particular, the need to be more strategic in a) which agricultural or
fishery products to support, based on their regional and ecological comparative advantage, and b)
the strengthening of linkages between production and marketing (value chains). This refinement
was underpinned by the development and piloting under MRDP2 of three innovative tools,
developed largely through the assistance provided by the AusAid TF i.e., i) the Vulnerability and
Suitability Assessment (VSA)35 tool which facilitated prioritization by modeling factors such as


35
   Under the PRDP, the targeting of interventions to raise incomes of poor farmers and fishers has been
strengthened through an Expanded Vulnerability and Suitability Assessments (EVSA) which are GIS–based
and take account of socio-economic conditions, agricultural and fishery productive capacity as well as
agronomic and fishery vulnerability and suitability. This is then used to enhance the GIS-based targeting of


                                                    64
land suitability for crop and fishery production; frequency of extreme weather events and adaptive
capacity of municipalities based on income and infrastructure levels, ii) Value Chain Analysis
(VCA) to identify regional agricultural and fishery commodity priorities and opportunities, and iii)
the use of the geo-tagging technology to help ensuring regular monitoring and supervision of sub-
projects, even in hard to reach areas, as well as an adjunct to the procurement process. Collectively,
the workshops, training, studies, preparation and pilot testing of manuals provided under MRDP2
in the application of these tools, provided the basis on which the much larger follow-on PRDP
program was developed36.

19.      Another “evolution” in approach under MRDP2 was in ways to foster Public-Private
Partnerships (PPPs). Whereas the initial focus under the AusAid TA was through skills workshops
to train and support LGU initiatives to attract private sector agricultural and fishery investments,
this led to and facilitated a refinement in ways to strengthen public-private partnerships based on
value chain analysis and particularly through support for small agricultural and fishery enterprise
development. This refinement has led to the new focus of DA under the follow-on PRDP which is
to (a) to provide catalytic investments to spur economic development through critical rural
infrastructure that have constrained the development of value chains; and (b) to support the
clustering and vertical integration of small-scale producer groups and associations with those
already involved in agro-processing and marketing.

interventions and to tailor strategies to enhance climate resiliency of production. The EVSA tool takes
account of socio-economic indicators such as poverty magnitude, poverty incidence, number of farmers and
fishers, size of production area, etc. Poverty maps have been prepared to help target interventions under the
project. The strategies and targeting of income generating interventions through the EVSA is further refined
through Value Chain Analysis (VCA); an analytical tool that focuses on identifying priority commodity value
chains, gaps and needs for particular areas.

   PRDP (US$501.25M Loan US$7M GEF) seeks to: (a) link national food security and commodity goals
with support responding to localized agricultural suitability, vulnerability and comparative advantage; (b)
raise productivity; and (c) facilitate the vertical integration of groups involved in agricultural, livestock and
fishery production, with those involved in processing and marketing to enhance value chain efficiencies and

Component 2: Rural Infrastructure (RI) (Estd cost at Appraisal US$83.852M. Actual cost at
project completion; US$82.4 M (98%) of appraisal).

20.     This supported a program of sub-projects to improve access to basic rural infrastructure
services by rural communities and to enhance these rural infrastructures operation and maintenance
standards, as well as monitoring and evaluation of their construction and rehabilitation.
Investments were planned in;


                                                   66
i) Construction and/or rehabilitation of selected farm to market roads and single lane bridges,
ii) Construction and/or rehabilitation of selected community-owned and managed run-of-river
      communal irrigation systems,
iii) Construction and/or rehabilitation of selected level-2 (communal faucets) rural potable water
      supply systems, and
iv) Other selected rural infrastructure projects to enhance agricultural and fisheries productivity
      and access to markets by rural communities.

21.      At appraisal it was anticipated that infrastructure support would be provided to some 225
municipalities over 26 provinces and this was achieved. Collectively some 469 subprojects were
completed. The success of the RI component was facilitated by the substantial training provided
during the initial stages of the project for technical personnel of the PSO, RPCOs, PLGUs and
MLGUs in regard to feasibility studies, engineering designs, procurement, contract management &
supervision, materials quality testing, geo-tagging, financial management and O&M. Quality
assurance and quality control were strengthened as a result of the project with the RPCO conducting
regular supervision and monitoring activities of the detailed engineering plan and technical
specifications. The geo-tagging technology introduced under the project greatly facilitated this
process.

22.      While indicative targets were set for RI infrastructure targets at appraisal, these were based
on the loan allocation and unit costs at the time. Subsequently design standards and unit costs were
changed by DPWH to improve climate resilience and reduce O& M, particularly through
concreting of farm to market roads and upgrading of gravel roads to concrete paved roads and the
re-designing of drainage facilities to provide for a minimum diameter of cross-drains of 900 mm,
including the adjustment of interval for drainage manholes. .

23.      All Intermediate Outcome indicators were achieved as summarized below;

 The Target of a reduction of 30% reduction in travel time was achieved. The length of time
  needed to reach the market by some form of vehicle was reduced by 69% after the
  implementation of FMR subprojects. Likewise, the length of time needed to reach the market
  by walking is considerably reduced in the FMR areas, by 56%. The basic reference point was
  the distance from production areas to markets. The average time spent before the project was
  87.5 minutes (with a range of 30–300 minutes). This estimate was compared with the average
  time spent of 26.75 minutes (ranging from 5–120 minutes) after the program intervention, for
  a significant reduction in travel time of around 60 minutes, on average, or a significant 69%
  reduction in travel time from baseline. Apart from the improved road surface condition of
  mainly upgraded gravel FMRs, the participants cited the concreting of uphill stretches of road
  sections as a major contribution and good practice of the MRDP2. This reduced both travel
  time and the number of road accidents gave the beneficiaries a better sense of security while
  traveling even at night. This reportedly also contributed to greater benefits to farmers in terms
  of higher prices of their commodities in view of the higher quality of products for delivery to
  markets

 The Target of a 10% savings in passenger and transport costs was achieved. Passenger and
  produce transport costs were at PhP0.85/kg and PhP1.00/kg in the program and non-program
  areas, respectively, by project completion. This means that the transport costs generally
  increased, instead of decreased, by 12% and 15% from baseline of PhP0.76/kg and PhP0.87/kg
  in both areas, respectively. Savings were computed by taking the difference between the



                                                  67
    transport cost in non-program areas and program areas. The computed savings were
    PhP0.11/kg at baseline and PhP0.15 at project completion, resulting in an increase in savings
    of PhP0.04/ kg or 36.36% from baseline. These savings exceeded the target of 10%, although
    the actual transport cost has increased during the period under review, primarily due to general
    increases in the price of fuel and the adjusted passenger fare for public utility vehicles.

 The Target for increased cropping intensity was 150-180%. This was achieved with average
  cropping intensity in the project areas significantly increasing to 180%. The increase in
  cropping intensity primarily benefited the poor farmers cultivating farms averaging around 1
  ha or less. The more reliable water from communal irrigation systems (CISs) constructed/
  rehabilitated under MRDP2 enabled two rice crops/ year to be produced with some farmers
  getting three crops. The more reliable availability of irrigation water also encouraged some
  farm households to put previously idle lands into production. There was also some increase in
  cropping intensity in non-program areas to 173% at project completion due to the development
  of irrigation systems under other government projects.

 The Target of a 65% reduction in the time to fetch water was reduced by 67%. The number of
    people with access to improved water sources (using mid-term in the absence of baseline data)
    increased by 42%. Feedback suggests that for some systems, communities and barangays
    beyond the targeted areas benefited from the investments in potable water. The number of
    direct program beneficiaries is therefore believed to be conservative. The Target of a 50%
    reduction in reported water-borne disease incidents was achieved. Of the 1,920 households
    interviewed less than 5% reported being afflicted with waterborne diseases at project
    completion. Feedback indicates that the installation of potable water supply systems resulted
    in a considerable number of families transferring residence to have access to the improved
    water supply.

Component 3: Community Fund for Agriculture Development (CFAD) Sub-Projects (Estd.
Cost at Appraisal US$30 M). Actual cost at project completion; US$ 30.237 M (101%) of
appraisal).

24.      This continued the mechanism established under the first phase of MRDP through which
funds were made available to address diverse investment priorities of rural communities, consisting
of financing sub-projects which meet community preferences and responded to local priorities (e.g.,
food security interventions, community managed livelihood and agribusiness activities, alternative
income generating activities, and small infrastructure). The DA and the LGUs were to be
responsible for providing technical advice and other support services. Cost-Sharing was based on
an 80% (60% Loan Proceeds and 20% DA), and 20% LGU contribution. For income-generating
and livelihood expansion subprojects, CFAD beneficiaries were required to have equity equivalent
to 25 % of the total subproject cost. For small infrastructure subprojects, CFAD beneficiary’s equity
was equivalent to 10 % of the total subproject cost, either in cash or in-kind. In conflict-affected
areas of Mindanao where capacity was limited there was provision for Service Providers. Project
Outcomes vis-à-vis the targets set at appraisal were substantially achieved and directly attributable
to the project.

 The Target of a raising household incomes by 20% and 10% higher than control group was
  achieved. Incomes of CFAD direct beneficiaries increased by around 35% , with the main
  source of such incomes coming from i) increase in production (42%), ii) increase in volume of
  products marketed (24%), iii) increase in the price of products sold (31%), and iv) training and
  the adoption of technology (3%).



                                                 68
 The Target of 30% of CFA allocations being accessed by women and indigenous people was
  achieved. Data show that IPs and women got access to about 59% of allocated resources.

25.      Under the project some 4,059 sub projects were undertaken involving 180,285
beneficiaries. Of those 46% were women and 24% were IPs. Among the IPs some 45% were
women. In terms of viability, a review undertaken in 2013 found the financial viability of CFAD
subprojects to be about 85% on average. Non-viability averaging 15% was higher (around 50%)
in those regions (11 & 13) which had suffered from the extreme effects of Typhoon Pablo in 2013.
Lack of market outlets, low prices and high transportation cost were reported as major factors
contributing to low viability; a finding that has reinforced the direction in which MRDP2 has
evolved in seeking to better link infrastructure investments with value chain analysis and support.

26.     CFAD subprojects were initially capped at PhP 250,000 each and supported food security
interventions, community–managed sustainable agri-based livelihood, and small infrastructure
support. The decision at mid-term was to move away from such small livelihood projects that were
proving unsustainable by giving greater emphasis to establishing viable businesses and micro-
enterprises, as a means to increase productivity, sustainable incomes and employment generation.
More stringent selection criteria were introduced to qualify for CFAD subprojects that required the
target communities to be formally organized and registered with appropriate government
accreditation agencies and giving membership priority to target disadvantaged and vulnerable
groups, particularly poor farmers and fishers, women, IPs, and out of-school youth. Existing
functional community-based organizations such as women and IP associations, as well as
multipurpose cooperatives were also recognized and supported with technical and business
advisory services. This had the effect of both building ownership in the DA by aligning the CFAD
approach with DA’s core mandate and by improving the financial viability of the subprojects
supported. Associated with this change in focus, the level of financing for subproject increased to
PhP 250,000 to PhP 10,000,000. The experience from supporting micro-enterprises has provided
the basis for developing the operational procedures on which the follow-on PRDP has been
designed.

27.     Over the period from mid-term to loan closing, some 4,058 CFAD sub-projects, were
supported of which 3,488 (86%) were considered as livelihood support activities, while the 570
(14%) supported micro-enterprise development. Overall there were 180,285 direct beneficiaries
from the CFAD projects and some 28,406 job were created. As illustrated in Table 6, the average
number of jobs created ranged from 6 to 15 depending on the type of enterprise supported, with
agro-processing ventures generally providing the largest number of permanent jobs.

28.      A wide variety of subprojects were supported encompassing crop, livestock and fisheries
production, as well as integrated farming and pre- and postharvest storage, packaging and
processing facilities. Incomes of CFAD direct beneficiaries increased by around 35%, with the
main source of such incomes coming from i) increase in production (42%), ii) increase in volume
of products marketed (24%), iii) increase in the price of products sold (31%), and iv) training and
the adoption of technology (3%). The largest average increase in income (45%) was from
livelihood subprojects which were focused on the most vulnerable groups (Table 7). Incomes of
CFAD direct beneficiaries increased by around 35%, with the main source of such incomes coming
from i) an increase in production (42%), ii) an increase in volume of products marketed (24%), iii)
an increase in the price of products sold (31%), and iv) training and adoption of technology (3%).
In relation to the volume of produce marketed, beneficiaries of subprojects involving small
infrastructure had the highest increase of 117%, with beneficiaries of agro-processing next (46%),
followed by community-managed sustainable agri-based livelihood (43%). Understandably
beneficiaries of food security interventions registered the lowest increase in volume of produce
marketed of 20%. Factors rated by the farmers in the order of importance in contributing to
production increase were (i) support services (29%), ii) better quality outputs (26%), iii) technology
(28%), and iv) good weather (16%).

29.     This supported a program to conserve upland resources, coastal and marine biodiversity.
The NRM goals were supported through the complementary GEF grant and were designed to
support:

i) Institutionalization of participatory NRM Planning and Policy Development
ii) Establishment and co-management of marine sanctuaries and/or protected areas between
       communities, local government and national agencies
iii)   Introduction and demonstration of sustainable land management practices benefiting land users
       and fisher-folk.
iv)    Establishment of stream-bank stabilization measures that minimize soil erosion that drains to
       coastal areas.
v)     Provision of Sustainable Income Generating Activities (SIGA) to relieve pressure on the
       natural resources while also reducing poverty.
vi)    Development and mainstreaming of knowledge management systems that on a large-scale basis,
       increase awareness of stakeholders on the direct linkages between upland management and
       downstream impacts to coastal ecosystems;

30.     Despite the shortfalls in achieving the GEO outcome indicators discussed previously, the
project was successful in achieving and often over-achieving the NRM and GEF results indicators
as shown in Table 9:

NRN Intermediate Outcome

 The target of 10% decrease in siltation and sedimentation and in coastal areas was not possible
  to measure. This indicator was recognized as being technically too difficult to measure under
  the project at mid-term and was to be dropped through restructuring. A letter was sent to
  Government confirming this but it would seem that due to an oversight, the restructuring was
  never formalized, and
 The target of at least 20% increase in public awareness of importance of biodiversity
  conservation and SLM practices as measured by sample surveys was achieved: 91.6% reported
  being aware of land management practices and coastal & marine biodiversity conservation.
  90% reported participating in such activities (at mid-term).

GEF-NRM Project Outcomes

 Household incomes of beneficiaries from SIGA subprojects showed a 16% increase in average
  annual household income over the baseline due largely to growth in on-farm and non-farm
  incomes
 The Target of at least 75% of LGUs having mainstreamed NRM plans into development plans
  was achieved. All 11 LGUS have integrated NRM plans and implemented with their Municipal
  or city development plans.
 The Target of at least 75% of participating barangays and municipal LGUs have passed
  enabling resolutions and allocated funds was largely achieved: All 11 GEF LGUs have passed
  enabling resolutions to support SLM and coastal biodiversity conservation for which 55% have
  allocated funds. Of the five (5) sampled NRM LGUs all of them passed enabling instruments




                                                 71
    in support of coastal resources and biodiversity conservation and have allocated funds in
    support of their implementation, but only two allocated separate funds.
   The Target that at least 700 ha (GEF) {and 1,031 ha (NRM)} of marine and fish sanctuaries
    should be established and effective co-managed as confirmed by SP2 METT was largely
    achieved. Some 720 ha (GEF) {and 1,031 ha (NRM)} of marine and fish sanctuaries have been
    established. Management effectiveness has not been measured.
   The Target that at least 500 ha (GEF) {and 652.5 ha (NRM)} of mangrove forest would be
    rehabilitated and protected was largely achieved: Some 449 ha (GEF) and 696.5 (NRM) of
    mangrove forest or 99% of the original target have been rehabilitated and protected. 10
    additional hectares are to be implemented under a round two OGI GEF to be completed before
    the end of project.
   The target that at least 1,000 ha (GEF) {and 2,191 ha (NRM)} of degraded hilly land is
    rehabilitated with sustainable farming practices, multiple-use of indigenous species or assisted
    natural forest generation; was largely achieved. Some 887 ha (GEF) and 2,191 (NRM) of
    mangrove forest, or 96% of the original target have been rehabilitated and protected. 284
    additional ha are to be implemented under a round two OGI GEF to be completed before the
    end of project.
   The target that at least 30% of SIGA allocations are accessed by IPs and/or women in
    participating municipalities was achieved. More than 35% of all SIGA recipients were IPs and
    47% were women.
   The Target that at least 60% have active FAMRCs, Bantay Dagat and Bantay Gubat and
    volunteer groups in surveillance and enforcement and linked with existing enforcement bodies
    was largely achieved. All 11 GEF LGUs have active Bantay Dagat linked with CAFGU and
    PNP. In addition, San Agustin also involves FARMC and Bantay Gubat and Rizal the FARMC.
    Of the five (5) sampled NRM LGUs all of them have active FARMCs and Bantay Dagat or
    volunteer groups.
   The target that at least 60% of participating municipalities have formed partnerships with
    academe, scientific institutions, national agencies or other communities for monitoring
    activities was achieved. All 11 LGUs have closely collaborated with DA, BFAR, DENR and
    NCIP to support project activities in particular with regards to training and learning. In addition,
    2 LGUs have established linkages the academe, 1 with NGOs and 1 with the academe, NGOs
    and agencies such as DPWH and NIA.
   The target that at least 75% of participants doing training on PRA and resource assessment,
    environmental monitoring and IEE are applying the knowledge gained in actual work was
    largely achieved. Based on a survey conducted on the change in farming practices as a result
    of GEF, the vast majority of respondents indicated a range of changes in behavior, including
    intercropping, planting of fruit trees, use of organic fertilizer, erosion prevention methods etc.
   (Same as for NRM) The target of at least 20% increase in public awareness of importance of
    biodiversity conservation and SLM practices as measured by sample surveys was achieved:
    91.6% reported being aware of land management practices and coastal & marine biodiversity
    conservation. 90% reported participating in such activities.

31.      The above achievements have a reasonable chance of being sustained, given that all
municipalities have their NRM Plans integrated into the Municipal Development Plans and some
set aside a separate budget. Several LGUs have also used the MRDP 2 resources to leverage
additional funds from NGOs and other Government programs to expand their mangrove
rehabilitation and plantation programs). In particular, the project effectively supported the
mainstreaming of NRM plans into local development plans in all GEF sites. The LGUs
encompassing those sites also passed the necessary resolutions and enabling instrument to support
SLM and coastal biodiversity conservation. Importantly, behavioral changes have been observed
in the targeted areas, including intercropping, planting of fruit trees, use of organic fertilizer and
practices to prevent erosion. The SIGA activities, on the other hand, were often very small and are
thus unlikely to develop into viable business enterprises.

32.     A key observation is that the activities financed under the NRM and GEF component are
not part of the core mandate of the DA and thus rely on the support and technical advice and
guidance provided by BFAR, DENR and NCIP. Limited coordination mechanism currently exists
to ensure effective collaboration between these agencies. To ensure that these activities are
continued and possibly scaled up it will be critical to transfer the responsibilities to these partner
agencies to ensure full ownership and support.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
1.       An ex-ante economic and financial analysis was conducted at the project appraisal. It
estimated the overall economic benefits of the project that as expected would mainly be derived
from (i) the rehabilitation of farm to market roads and the subsequent savings in traveling time and
reduction in vehicle operating costs; (ii) communal irrigation schemes which will generate an
increase in farm productivity; (iii) improvements in the supply of potable water resulting in
increased time savings from collecting water and reduced incidence of water-borne related sickness
and disease; and (iv) community-based development through the availability of community funds.
The analysis was undertaken for the investments in infrastructure and the community subproject
components, from which quantifiable benefits can be estimated.

2.       As recommended by the WB ICR Guidelines, this ex-post economic and financial analysis
was conducted using the same methodologies and approaches that have been used in the ex-ante
analysis. However, it also took into account not only those benefits that have been identified during
the preparation of the project, but other benefits that have not been addressed previously. In addition,
this analysis was based on actual costs and data that became available upon completion of the
project implementation.

3.       Farm-to-Market Roads (FMRs): The project rehabilitated 1,203 km and constructed
111 km of farm-to-market roads. Additionally, 688 lineal meters of bridges were also built. By
rehabilitating these roads which were already part of an existing network of roads, the overall use
and value of the rural road network is increased. By ensuring that these roads are passable on a
year-round basis, greater benefits are generated in terms of: (i) reducing the cost of transporting
people, (ii) transporting agricultural produce to the market and (iii) transporting non-agricultural
produce.

4.       The ex-ante analysis of FMR component was based only on the results of one typical FMR
subproject, based on which the feasibility of the investment in FMR component was assessed. The
current ex-post analysis was based on modeling of 14 FMR subprojects implemented in the various
project areas. Financial and economic models have been developed for these sub-projects. These
models were based on the following assumptions:

   Road Condition: The models were based on the actual costs incurred during the implementation
    of the project. The costs mainly included the purchase of materials and equipment as well as
    labor costs. Thus, roughly 91% of FMR subprojects were targeted on rehabilitation of existing
    roads, while the remaining 9% of subprojects was focused on construction of the new roads.
    As it was expected at the project appraisal, the typical farm-to-market roads identified by the
    project had gravel or packed earth surface and were in very bad or bad condition. Most project
    roads had stretches that were impassable and therefore required major reconstruction. The
    rehabilitation of rural roads under the project brought the typical project gravel road to a good
    condition.
   Rehabilitation/Routine Maintenance costs: Actual investment costs of rural road rehabilitation
    varied from PhPl.4 million/km to PhP3.5 million/km depending on the region and subproject
    condition, with an average cost in the amount of PhP2.3 million/km. Actual investment cost of
    rural road construction is a bit higher than that of road rehabilitation and varied from PhPl.3
    million/km to PhP3.7 million/km depending on the region and complexity of construction, with
    an average cost at around PhP2.6 million/km.
   A routine maintenance cost per year equivalent of PhP41,904/km on average was also applied.
    Additional costs relate to the investments in capability enhancements for the local staff to



                                                  74
      implement routine maintenance works to ensure that the rehabilitated roads remain in a good
      condition.
     Investment Period: A 10-year life-span for newly constructed and rehabilitated rural roads
      regularly maintained by labour-based methods was assumed. Investments in road construction
      and rehabilitation start in Year 1 and routine maintenance in Year 2. Benefits were estimated
      and accrued as soon as the project FMR is constructed or improved.
     Vehicle Operating Cost (VOC) Savings: The analysis of the per kilometer cost associated with
      operating of each type of motorized and non-motorized vehicle traveling on the rural roads in
      the Philippines is conducted by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) on a
      regular basis. According to DPWH, VOC differences for gravelled roads were set as follows:
      Jeepney- 7.35 Php/km, Car/Van - 6.38 Php/km, Motorcycle - 1.06 Php/km, Tricycle - 5.52
      Php/km, Truck -18.38 Php/km.
     Value of Time (VOT) Savings. The impact assessment survey conducted for the evaluation of
      the rural roads for MRDP-2, showed time savings from 20 to 140 minutes of travel time among
      the beneficiaries as compared to the baseline. According to the National Statistics Office’s
      Labour Force Survey (as of January 2013) an average wage rate is PhP14.16 per hour and this
      rate was used in computing the value of the time saved.
     Standard Conversion Factor (SCF): To convert financial cost to economic, a standard
      conversion factor of 0.80 was applied to investment, O&M and VOC costs, and a CF of 0.60
      was applied to the value the time savings.

6.       Based on the assumptions and parameters above, the ERR for FMR subprojects is
estimated in the range of 13.30% to 58.74% depending on the subprojects with an average at
32.33%. The average ERR is well above an alternative cost of capital set at 15% and it is
comparable to the ERR estimated in the ex-ante economic analysis for traffic roads (used daily) at
20% and for development roads (used seasonally) at 33.5%.
The ex-post analysis also shows that almost all FMR subprojects have positive ENPV making on
average PhP 7,168.43. Average Benefit-Cost Ratio of the FMR subprojects in economic terms is
greater than 1 and is equal to1.7 (see Table 1 below).

7.      Results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that a 10% reduction in benefits would bring
down the ERR to the considerably lower level (10%) for only one subproject out of all analysed
FMR subprojects. However, the average ERR of all analysed FMR subprojects would still remain
quite high – 28% (see Table 2), ENPV would be still positive and BCR would be still greater than
1.

8.       Communal Irrigation Subprojects: Agricultural productivity in the project areas
improved since the project supported small-scale communal irrigation by rehabilitating existing
gravity schemes which were no longer operational or were inefficient and constructing new ones.
In total 2,907 hectares of irrigated land were rehabilitated and 2,175 hectares of land were brought
under irrigation. All together 26 CIS subprojects were completed by the end of the project and
24,925 people were provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage services.



                                                  76
9.       The rehabilitation of existing schemes supported farmers in shifting from unimproved
irrigation to improved irrigation hence increasing crop yields and cropping intensity as compared
to the before-project farming situation. The following benefits were considered in the analysis: (a)
an overall increase in cropping intensity as greater area of land was brought under irrigated
agriculture; (b) an improvement in farm productivity as adequate amounts of water are made
available in a timely manner; and (c) crop diversification (i.e., vegetable growing).
Financial Analysis: Representative crop budgets have been prepared based on the actual data of
two CIS subprojects, with key parameters and assumptions for crop budgets and farm income
analysis outlined below:

   Incremental benefits are assessed by comparing the net benefit (after all costs) from without-
    to with-intervention scenarios. Only benefits accrued to the farm area brought from
    unimproved to improved irrigation are considered under the analysis that focuses on project
    rehabilitation. All agricultural area falling within the influence area of a newly constructed
    scheme is considered in the assessment of new construction.
   Agricultural Seasons: While the Mindanao region as a whole is classified as having rainfall
    more or less evenly distributed throughout the year, farmers recognize two distinct agricultural
    seasons, a wet season which spans May to September and a dry season which spans October to
    April. Moreover, wet season irrigation is more productive with yields around 10% greater than
    those dry season yields in this region.
   Cropping Intensity:-The model assumes that with project (WP) there will be 100% cropping in
    the wet season and 100% cropping in the dry season; in the without project (WoP) scenario,
    the cropping intensity is assumed to be 100% in the wet season and 50% in the dry season.
   Full development benefits: Full development benefits for newly-constructed and rehabilitated
    communal irrigation systems are accrued in the year immediately following construction and
    rehabilitation works.

10.     The estimated investment costs for rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems and
construction of a new system were PhP 52,000 and PhP 122,000 per hectare, respectively.
Recurrent cost per annum is estimated at PhP12,000 per hectare per year. Project lifespan is pegged
at 20 years.

11.     Based on the above the incremental farm income is estimated at PhP66,500 on average
once the irrigation construction and improvement works are completed. This is based on the farm
income analysis which depicts the average income improving substantially from PhP50,500 per
year under the WOP scenario to PhP79,500 per year under the WP scenario.
Economic Analysis: The financial prices were converted into economic prices using the CFs as
defined below: (a) For converting construction costs of new schemes and rehabilitation of existing
schemes, the Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.8 was applied; and for the major tradable
goods (paddy), the parity prices were used; (b) for agricultural labor, a conversion factor of 0.60 is
used in assessing the ERR for the entire irrigation subproject; and (c) a conversion factor of zero is
applied to irrigation user fees and land tax since they are considered as transfer payments.

12.     Based on the above assumptions, the ERR for the communal irrigation subprojects is
estimated in to be in the range of 20.7% to 21.8% with positive ENPV and BCR greater than 1.
Sensitivity to a 20% reduction in benefits reveal that these CIS subprojects would still yield an
acceptable ERR (at around 16%-17%).

13.    Improvement of Water Supply Systems: The project supported improvements of
domestic water supply for the upland and lowland communities in the participating LGUs. By the



                                                 77
end of the project implementation 54 communal water faucets or 1800 community water points
were rehabilitated and constructed. Some104,708 people are provided with an access to improved
water sources. The total capital expenditure amounted to USD 7.14 million with an average cost of
USD132,260 per unit for either Level 1 or Level 2 water system. The unskilled labor and raw
materials and supplies required for the annual operation and maintenance of the systems were
provided by the beneficiary barangay.
The analysis of this component was based on the analysis of six different water supply subprojects
selected as the most representative subprojects. It is based on benefits generated by the project with
the following assumptions:

     The economic analysis for the water supply subprojects considered only the benefits derived
      from time savings for fetching potable water as these could be used for income generating
      activities by the beneficiary households. The savings in time according to the subprojects data
      was from 18 to 25 minutes per day per household. The assumed wage rate that was used in
      subprojects’ financial and economic models was in the range of PhP200 to PhP250 per day
      which was converted into economic price by using 0.6 – a conversion factor for unskilled
      labour.
     The benefits of avoidance of waterborne diseases were also estimated, including the savings of
      working time due to morbidity reduction, reduced economic loss due to decreased premature
      death and savings in medical expenses.
     Non-quantified benefits include increases in beneficiary household productivity as a result of
      the availability of water as an input for household activities and other social benefits.

14.     The analysis showed that the economic rate of return of the analyzed water supply
subprojects is in the range of 18.7% to 35.8% with an average at 25.2%, which is well above the
discounting rate of 15% (see Table 3). The economic NPVs for all subprojects are positive and
BCR ratios are greater than 1. This means that all subprojects generate sufficient amounts of
benefits and are economically viable. Sensitivity analysis showed that the economic viability of
analysed subprojects is not threatened by a 20% decline in benefits and it does not have a significant
impact on the subprojects’ ERR and ENPV.

15.      Community Fund for Agricultural Development (CFAD) Subprojects: The CFAD
subprojects were to address diverse investment priorities of rural communities and to meet their
preferences and responded to local priorities, including food security interventions, community
managed livelihood and agribusiness activities, alternative income generating activities and small
infrastructure.




                                                  78
Cost-Sharing was based on an 80% (60% Loan Proceeds and 20% DA), and 20% LGU contribution.
For income-generating and livelihood expansion subprojects, CFAD beneficiaries were required to
have equity equivalent to 25 % of the total subproject cost. For small infrastructure subprojects,
CFAD beneficiary’s equity was equivalent to 10 % of the total subproject cost, either in cash or in-
kind.

16.     Under the project some 4,059 subprojects were undertaken involving 180,285 beneficiaries.
In terms of viability, a review undertaken in 2013 found the financial viability of CFAD subprojects
to be about 85% on average. CFAD subprojects were initially capped at PhP 250,000 each and
supported food security interventions, community–managed sustainable agri-based livelihood, and
small infrastructure support. After the mid-term the level of financing for subproject increased to
PhP 250,000 to PhP 10,000,000.

17.     In total 4,058 CFAD subprojects were supported by the project, of which 3,488 (86%) were
considered as livelihood support activities, while the 570 (14%) supported micro-enterprise
development. Overall there were 180,285 direct beneficiaries from the CFAD projects and some
28,406 job were created. Incomes of CFAD direct beneficiaries increased by around 35% , with
the main source of such incomes coming from i) an increase in production (42%), ii) an increase in
volume of products marketed (24%), iii) an increase in the price of products sold (31%), and iv)
training and adoption of technology (3%).

18.      In relation to the volume of produce marketed, beneficiaries of small infrastructure support
category had the highest estimated percentage increase of 117%. The second place was taken by
the beneficiaries of agro-processing (46%), followed by the community-managed sustainable agri-
based livelihood (43%). Beneficiaries of food security interventions registered the lowest increase
with 20%. Factors rated by the farmers in the order of importance in contributing to production
increase were (i) support services (29%), ii) better quality outputs (26%), iii) technology (28%),
and iv) good weather (16%). According to the CFAD impact assessment study, CFAD sub-projects
that are engaged in production registered an increase in the volume of production by 45% on
average. In relation to the volume of produce marketed, beneficiaries of small infrastructure support
category have the highest estimated percentage increase of 117%. The second are the beneficiaries
of agro-processing (46%), followed by the community-managed sustainable agri-based livelihood
(43%), while the beneficiaries of food security interventions registered the lowest increase with
20%.

19.     In general, the sub-projects under CFAD had generated an average of seven jobs. Among
these jobs are haulers, mixers, drivers, construction workers, facility operators, caretakers and
laborers. Based from the result of the survey interview of the sample household beneficiaries, their
income had increased by 35% on the average. The financial analysis of several CFAD subprojects
showed that the financial investment return (IRR) of such subprojects is quite high and it is in the
range of 29.8% to as high as 72.7%. The financial NPV of the CFAD subprojects is also positive
and BCR is greater than 1 (minimum 1.23). This means that CFAD subprojects are financially
viable and give good financial return. According to economic analysis of the CFAD subprojects
costs and benefits, they would generate about USD 36 million of net economic benefits over next
20 years after the project completion.

20.     GEF-Economic Analysis: While the GEF support for the project was “fully blended” a
separate analysis was conducted in light of the somewhat different nature of the investments and
ambitious, longer-term nature of the GEO in regard to increasing seaweed and coral cover and fish
biomass. Essentially, the GEF supported investments sought to reverse the ecosystem degradation
in coastal, marine and upland areas, Overall, the GEF-NRM support which accounted for 7.8% of


                                                 79
project costs, had an EIRR of 16.87% at project completion. This was slightly lower than the
modest EIRR estimated at appraisal of 17.55%. Financial analyses were calculated for both upland
and coastal livelihood SIGA activities, and showed FIRRs ranging from 25% (eggplant production)
to around 40% for fish cage and seaweed production. Farm incomes from coastal livelihood
activities supported through the GEF were roughly double those obtained in upland areas (PhP
59.632 (coastal) vs Php 32,934 (upland); The difference being attributed to greater diversification
and market outlet opportunities in coastal areas compared with upland, often infertile areas with
limited access. Farm incomes as a result of the project varied greatly, ranging from 3%-58%.

21.      Overall economic analysis of the project: Given the above benefit and cost streams, the
base case Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the project is estimated at 28.3% (ex-ante ERR was
estimated at 21.5%). The base case net present value of the project’s net economic benefit stream,
discounted at 15%, is positive and it is USD 40.9 million (ex-ante ENPV was estimated at around
USD 25 million). The analysis shows that the project, either by component or as a whole is
economically viable and it would generate more economic benefits than it was expected at the
project appraisal.

    III.     Project Benefits

10.    The average net annual household incomes of all direct beneficiaries increased by as much
as 36%, from Php 75,630 to PhP 102,759, exceeding the target of 20% increase over baseline, and
10% over the control group by the end of the Program was achieved. (see Table 5)

11.      Both MLGUs and PLGUs rated their ability to plan and implement investment programs
as better or higher. This is especially true for the CFAD subprojects as the beneficiaries felt that
these were primarily designed for their benefit.

12.     The bottom-up planning of the BDP preparation made the beneficiaries, especially the
women and the IPs more involved in the Program. The BDPs were also incorporated in the bigger
scale which was the Annual Investment Plans of the MLGUs and the PLGUs.

13.      MRDP2 conducted capability building activities (trainings, workshops) and subproject
planning process not just to P/MLGUs but also to the barangay level and even the People’s
Organizations (POs). These activities contributed to a 35% increase of beneficiaries who reported
significant improvement in the LGUs’ delivery of services from midterm to EOP. The frequent
interactions between the LGU and the beneficiaries resulted in fast action of feedbacks/complaints,
constant guidance, monitoring, and provision of technical advice, which contributed to the success
of the subprojects.

reduced to 28% while the 10% of the people have water delivered/piped in to their respective houses
increase to 72%. Overall, time to fetch water in program areas was reduced by reduced by 69%

15.      There was an increase of 38% in the number of people with access to improved water
sources. The construction of potable water supply (PWS) also resulted in a greater number of water
users than the number of direct beneficiaries. Neighboring barangays were able to access the
established water supply systems. The PWS was also being used for other economic activities (i.e.
gardening, livestock raising) which added to the income of the households. The time to fetch water
was also reduced by 69.4%. In addition, only a very small number of beneficiaries reported to have
been afflicted with waterborne diseases. (see Table 8)

16.     The construction and rehabilitation of roads made the travel time for the beneficiaries
from the production areas to markets reduced from 55 minutes in average to 36 minutes or 35%.
The reduced travel time was important to the farmers as they were able to sell good quality
produce in the market, thus enabling them to sell at a higher price. Improved roads also gave the
beneficiaries additional safety and security when traveling. (see Table 9)

17.      The irrigation systems increased the cropping intensity from 129% (baseline) to 191-237%.
The irrigation system which has become more dependable and efficient enabled the farmers to put
their lands into a more productive use. Some of them were able to produce more than one crop of
paddy rice in a year, which was not possible before the program.

18.      Through massive and constant IEC activities, community involvement, and trainings for
community organizations, there was a positive achievement in the level of community awareness
and community participation in the need to protect and monitor globally significant endangered
marine animal species, considering the geophysical condition and political climate in the NRM
municipalities. Some of the MLGUs were able to established fish sanctuaries to conserve coral
reefs, sea grasses, and mangroves that serve as habitats for these species.

19.     The participating MLGUs under the NRM component were able to pass enabling
instruments and allocate funds in support of coastal resources and biodiversity conservation. These
MLGUs also have operational and active FARMCs and Bantay Dagat or volunteer Coast Watch
groups.

    IV.      Performance of the Borrower and the Executing Agencies

20.      The Department of Agriculture has satisfactorily performed its task of providing overall
supervision of the Program. Although there were problems encountered at the start of the Program,
particularly the small number of takers for RI subprojects, the DA was able to come up with a
resolution. There was an adjustment made in the cost-sharing policy for RI subprojects, which
reduced the LGUs’ counterpart from 50% to 10%. This cost sharing arrangement was crucial and
viewed by the beneficiaries to be of great value. Immediate response to the concerns of the Program,
catch-up plans, and the commitment to the rural development of Mindanao resulted in the
satisfactory overall performance of the Program.

    V.      Performance of the Bank

21.   Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. During supervision missions, drawing of
component activities and strategies were integrated into one Program’s composite plan.

    VI.     Conclusions

22.      Generally, MRDP APL1 has satisfactorily achieved its purpose of putting in place the
institutional, financial and community-based planning and management systems for supporting
rural development within the targeted agricultural and fishing communities in the 25 provinces and
225 municipalities. Although it went through an arduous process, the stakeholders remained
committed to the program, which brought back the implementation progress into the right track
after suffering initial start-up problems due to the 50:50 NG: LGU sharing scheme. Catch-up plans


                                                87
were crafted and successfully implemented that resulted in the consistent “Satisfactory”
performance rating given by the World Bank starting Year 2011 and throughout the remaining
years of APL2. Below are the major findings, lessons learned and insights in the implementation.

   VII. Lessons Learned

   1.      Lessons learned during the overall implementation of the project are worth considering
         in the Philippine Rural Development Project (PRDP) and with other similar undertakings.
         The weaknesses in this project can subsequently be prevented while its strengths
         duplicated in order to achieve the ultimate goal of developing the countryside, reducing
         poverty and increasing the income of our farmers and fisherfolks.

   2.      The MRDP1 provided important lessons that were proven to be valuable in the APL2.
         The strong will and commitment of the implementing agencies like the World Bank, DA,
         MRDP-PSO, DA RFUs, and LGUs and the close coordination with relevant partner
         agencies has attained a satisfactory level of well-defined and harmonized delivery of
         services that were able to address the needed interventions in the communities and
         initiating strong.

   3.       The different components were able to adapt to the needs and priorities of the
         communities. Various development approaches and strategies were implemented to
         ensure the smooth coordination, adaptability and relevance to the beneficiaries of the
         different sub-projects. These consisted of (1) participatory planning processes; (2)
         integrated programs; (3) decentralization of functions; (4) demand/community driven
         projects; (4) convergence of MSCs; (5) social preparation; (6) social mobilization; and
         (7) institutionalization of the various stakeholder organizations and groups.

   4.      Through the convergence of MRDP implementers and other stakeholders, like the
         MSCs, CFAD prioritize projects towards intended beneficiaries such as marginalized
         farmers IPs and women. The LGUs role in development planning and project
         management was also strengthened. The participatory processes of the POs led to
         community empowerment and gender equity (more women were involved in the
         projects).

   5.      The coordination and collaboration from the regional level down to the beneficiaries
         involving the various sectors greatly benefited the harmonious and congruent delivery of
         services especially in institutional support, appropriate technology, monitoring and
         evaluation of the projects. A significant outcome of this process led to the maturity and
         growth of many POs.

   6.      The capability skills of the LGUs were greatly enhanced in the following: participatory
         governance, project development and management system. The valuable result of their
         expanded roles led to demand driven projects and a stronger partnership between LGU
         and the communities.

   7.       Regular reflection workshops with various key stakeholders paved the way in eliciting
         and sharing various concerns and challenges encountered in the course of operation
         which led the program management to improve the implementation approaches and
         strategies appropriate to the situation.




                                              88
8.    Adoption of contractor’s billing as the basis for releasing of funds to LGUs instead of
      tranching scheme minimizes the problem on liquidation of funds by the LGUs.

9.    Concreting of sloped areas of rural roads was a strategy that the target communities
      because of the resulting reduction in reported road accidents and the lower maintenance
      costs of motorcycles and other vehicles.

10.     MRDP2’s attempt to introduce results monitoring at the project level was a worthy
      initiative to bring local stakeholders’ focus and effort on “planning for results” and
      “managing projects for results,” as well as to measure the contribution of project
      outputs to the achievement of desired outcomes.

11.    The bottom-up planning approach, which generated subprojects from the BDPs
      and the incorporation of BDPs’ priorities in the AIPs of MLGUs and PLGUs,
      as a precondition for MRDP2 assistance, achieved two important outcomes. First, it
      brought the LGUs at all levels to work closely to get subproject support from MRDP2
      and ensured that subprojects addressed the communities’ priority needs. Second, this
      approach increased the sense of ownership of the subproject by the target
      community/beneficiaries who participated in the identification of the subproject. In effect,
      MRDP2 was able to use program funds as a leveraging mechanism, not only to mobilize
      local resources, but also to enable key local stakeholders to talk, plan,and act together.

12.     The Program has been successful in collaborating with participating LGUs as active
      partners in the implementation of MRDP subprojects. This milestone triggered the DA
      to commission the Program, through the IGR component, to spearhead the harmonization
      of DA-LGU engagement in the thrust to achieve a standardized process in making
      transactions with LGUs. Close coordination with the DA, through its Agri-Pinoy
      Commodity Programs, in the harmonization of technical standards, procurement process
      and M&E using the MRDP as the operational platform was facilitated. To date, a
      harmonized Operations Manual on Rural Infrastructure has been finalized while the
      Implementation of Livelihood Projects Operations Manual are being finalized.

      Program Enhancement and Innovations

13.   Social and Environmental Safeguards. From its introduction and integration in the
      formulation of RI investment proposals, the SES is now encompasses all the project
      components to ensure that people and the environment are not adversely affected by the
      subproject implementation. It conforms to the existing environmental laws of the
      government, the World Bank and the policies on protecting indigenous people, women
      and the poor communities.


14.   MRDP2 website. The Program has established its own website, www.damrdp.net, in
      2009 to live up to the advancement of information and communications technology while
      securing broader and stronger influence in project implementation.

15.   Procurement Procedures. The Program has espoused harmonized procurement
      guidelines, which are now being used in the implementation of rural infrastructure
      subprojects. The harmonized procedures serves also as transparency measure which has
      improved bidder’s participation in subproject implementation. All bid opportunities
      under RI component are being posted in PhilGEPs and downloadable bidding documents
      are made available for bidders in MRDP website.



                                            89
16.     Geotagging. In 2011, the Program launched its innovative strategy in enhancing
        subproject supervision using the Global Positioning System (GPS). The technology is an
        initiative to further strengthen its established transparency in project implementation. It
        illustrates the overall development impact of subprojects and relationships to existing
        infrastructures and influence areas. Geotagging now forms part of the requirement in the
        procurement and implementation processes.

17.     This innovative tool was a vital tool for MRDP2 in promoting transparency in
        implementing sub-projects under the program. Thus, this was integrated in all Program’s
        systems such as: procurement system, subproject validation, progress monitoring system,
        contract management system and Operation and Maintenance of completed subprojects.

18.     Applied Geotagging Tool was now utilized by the prospective bidders to have a virtual
        visit of the project site. Moreover, relative to procurement and contract management
        systems, this tool is now part of the requirement for contractors to get paid for their work.
        The contractors are required to take actual photos that commensurate to their Statement
        of Work Accomplished (SWA). Hence, geotagged photos of the sub-project prove its
        existence.


VIII. Recommendations

1.     Co-management arrangements for coastal and marine biodiversity conservation should be
      formally established through MOAs and LGU ordinances, and intensive community-
      based IEC activities must continue in order to sustain the already high level of community
      awareness and understanding of the need for coastal and marine resources and
      biodiversity conservation.

2.     For greater program impact, DA should manage the NRM, CFAD, and RI components in
      a more integrated manner, and not as distinct subprograms. This means that planning for
      NRM subprojects should consider functional and spatial connectivity’s with CFAD and
      RI subprojects, and vice versa, to achieve economic objectives without sacrificing
      environmental integrity.

3.      Role of LGUs and POs post-MRDP2. MLGUs should integrate the MRDP2
      Sustainability Plans into the municipal and barangay development plans and in the
      Municipal AIPs. For this purpose, it is important that the MLGUs are able to secure local
      ordinances or legislative resolutions, which may include realignment or adjustment of the
      functions of the planning officers (MPDCs) and/or MAs so that they could synchronize
      their efforts and harmonize support for the continued operation of MRDP2 activities after
      phase-out.

4.     The innovative process of drawing subprojects based on priorities identified in
      BDPs must be replicated in future rural development programs. However, the integration
      of program components at the project/subproject level must be initiated at the planning
      stage to ensure resource complementation among stakeholders and better achieve the
      program outcomes and impact.
