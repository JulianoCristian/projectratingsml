                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The target household income increase of the project beneficiaries was exceeded by more than 100% by mid-term. Since then, the implementation of livelihood and rural infrastructure
                         sub-projects, the means through which earning opportunities are expanded, has unfailingly accelerated. It accelerated even further during this mission period. Moreover, the
                         instruments for mainstreaming target reforms continued to be developed. The project is, therefore, in a stronger position to achieve its development objectives.

                         The earning opportunities of the target households (PDO 1) are bolstered by the better-than-expected implementation of rural infrastructure (RI) sub-projects, and by the healthy
                         progress of livelihood sub-projects. The mainstreaming of MRDP 2 reforms in line with PDO 2 is also well under way. The continuing progress in the pilot-testing of the Harmonized
                         DA Interim Operations Manual (IOM) for LGU engagement and the DA Planning Service’s initiative in better integrating Local Development Plans (LDPs) in Regional Agriculture and
                         Fisheries Modernization Plans (AFMPs) ensures that there are effective instruments for the institutionalization of the target reforms. Moreover, these reforms will be up-scaled and
                         replicated nationwide as part of the institutional reforms to be implemented in the PhP500 mn Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP). All these measures ensure that a
                         decentralized system of agri-fishery investment and services will be embedded in the Department's programs and initiatives with the LGUs.
