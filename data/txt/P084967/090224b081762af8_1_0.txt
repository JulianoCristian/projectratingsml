                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project's implementation progress has further accelerated and is, therefore, in a stronger position to achieve its development objectives.

                         The fast-tracking of implementation of its rural infrastructure and livelihood sub-projects is expected to have a strong and positive impact on the earning opportunities of the target
                         households (PDO 1). The mainstreaming of MRDP 2 reforms in line with PDO 2 is also well under way. The continuing progress in the pilot-testing of the Harmonized DA Interim
                         Operations Manual (IOM) for LGU engagement and the DA Planning Service’s initiative in better integrating Local Development Plans (LDPs) in Regional Agriculture and Fisheries
                         Modernization Plans (AFMPs) are expected to be effective instruments for the institutionalization of the target reforms.

                         A 2 – year extension for the project’s closing date is being processed within the government. The official government request is yet to be submitted to the World Bank for review and
                         approval. In addition, the current project staff is overstretched because of the need to further accelerate project implementation to meet targets and to maintain quality control while
                         speeding up implementation as well as because of the competing demands for PRDP preparation. DA and project management, therefore, decided to further expand the manpower
                         and operational support for the project.
