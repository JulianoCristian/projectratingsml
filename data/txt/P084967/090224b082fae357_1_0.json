Some lessons learned included:\n            MRDP-2 provides a good example of both the considerable time\n            it can take to bring about significant institutional reform\n            and the importance for the Bank of maintaining the\n            engagement through dialogue, sector work, and projects as\n            appropriate over the longer term. The evidence from MRDP-2\n            shows that when confronted with the appropriate financial\n            incentives and provided with clear direction and support,\n            such local government units (LGUs) can quite quickly come up\n            to speed in strengthening their capacity and procedures. The\n            design of MRDP-2 was refined at mid-term to reflect this\n            learning and the design of Philippine Rural Development\n            Project (PRDP) has further expanded on the experience. The\n            process now provides for national and regional strategic\n            objectives to be integrated at the provincial level with\n            local plans and stakeholder inputs to better balance\n            strategic objectives and comparative advantage, with locally\n            felt-needs. The failings of the largely technological\n            approach pursued under this small component of MRDP-2,\n            coupled with overly ambitious objectives, provide important\n            project design lessons."}, "docdt": "2015-06-21T00:51:04Z"}
