"Ratings for the Ethiopia/Nile Basin\n            Initiative Power Export Project : Ethiopia-Sudan\n            Interconnector for Ethiopia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            low; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: it is critical that the outcomes\n            and the targets are defined to be consistent with the\n            Project's broader objective. An interconnection project\n            creates the capacity to generate exports and revenues, as\n            well as lay the groundwork for future interconnection\n            opportunities. The indicator targets should also take into\n            account not only the interconnection's technical\n            capacity but also the political economy risks and\n            contractual delays. Contractual frameworks should be\n            established early on, ideally by the time of project\n            appraisal. While contractual issues are still feasible as\n            occurred in this project, the risk of contractual delays\n            could be mitigated with agreements in place at the time of\n            appraisal. Transmission projects are inherently complex,\n            with implementation impacted by technical, safeguards, and\n            construction issues. Such risks are compounded in\n            interconnection projects with political economy risks such\n            as in sub-regional projects. It is imperative that the\n            expertise and oversight planned for the supervision of\n            projects is sustained throughout implementation. Lapses in\n            enforcement of the occupational safety and health aspects of\n            social safeguards can lead to serious accidents and even\n            deaths. The Bank's engagement is important with all\n            parties to an interconnection project to enable due\n            diligence, supervision, and monitoring of the commensurate\n            investments in the countries."}, "docdt": "2013-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
