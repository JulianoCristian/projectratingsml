                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's long-term development objective is to improve the effectiveness of the power systems in the Eastern Nile region by promoting regional power trade
                         through the establishment of coordinated planning and the erection of transmission interconnections in the context of multi-purpose water and energy resources
                         development in the region. The Project also takes advantage of the hydro-thermal complementarity of the Ethiopian and Sudanese systems to reduce overall generation
                         costs and improve the availability and reliability of supply in the two countries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The Project’s development objective is to promote Ethiopia's power export revenue generation capacity through the development of regional trade opportunities in the context of the
                         NBI regional effort.
                         GOE has signed Construction Agreement, Operations Agreement and Power Purchase Agreement with Sudan. The transmission line contract and the substation contract were
                         signed on December 18, 2008, and became effective respectively on April 14, 2009 and on July 13, 2009. As per the initial Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between

                         EEPCo and NEC of Sudan, export of electricity should have started from July 1, 2010. Both the governments later negotiated to start the trading of electricity from September 2011.
                         While the transmission line has been completed, two shunt reactors in the Shehedi Substation and the telecommunication equipments to allow the NLDCs in Ethiopia and Sudan to
                         communicate are still to be installed.

                         The transmission line consists of three sections. (i) Bahir Dar - Gondar, (ii) Gondar - Shehedi, and (iii) Shehedi - Matema. As of June 2012, The transmission line construction
                         planned under the project has been completed and the transmission line has been commissioned and limited trade started on November 4, 2012. The project also includes three
                         substations. One each in Bahir Dar, Gonder and Shehidi. While most of the works under the substation contract has been completed, the contractor still needs to finalize the
                         installation of two shunt reactors and telecommunication equipment, without which the electricity trade will not reach the expected contractual level. Since July 2011, EEPCO has
                         been facing difficulty to make payments to the substation contractor but the issue is now resolved and outstanding equipments are therefore expected to be delivered before the
                         closing date.
