                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's long-term development objective is to improve the effectiveness of the power systems in the Eastern Nile region by promoting regional power trade
                         through the establishment of coordinated planning and the erection of transmission interconnections in the context of multi-purpose water and energy resources
                         development in the region. The Project also takes advantage of the hydro-thermal complementarity of the Ethiopian and Sudanese systems to reduce overall generation
                         costs and improve the availability and reliability of supply in the two countries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The objective of this project is to export electricity to Sudan. GOE has signed Construction Agreement, Operations Agreement and Power Purchase Agreement with Sudan. The
                         transmission line contract and the substation contract were signed on December 18, 2008 and became effective respectively on April 14, 2009 and on July 13, 2009. As per the initial
                         Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between EEPCo and NEC of Sudan, export of electricity should have started from July 1, 2010. Both the governments later negotiated to
                         start the trading of electricity from September 2011. While the transmission line has been completed, two shunt reactors in the Shehedi Substation and the telecommunication

                         equipments to allow the NLDCs in Ethiopia and Sudan to communicate are still to be installed.

                         The transmission line consists of three sections. (i) Bahir Dar - Gondar, (ii) Gondar - Shehedi, and (iii) Shehedi - Matema. As of June 2012, The transmission line construction
                         planned under the project has been completed and the transmission line has been commissioned. The project also includes three substations. One each in Bahir Dar, Gonder and
                         Shehidi. While most of the works under the substation contract has been completed, the contractor still needs to install two shunt reactors and telecommunication equipment, without
                         which the electricity trade will not begin. Since July 2011, EEPCO has been facing difficulty to make payments to the substation contractor. The substation contractor has also not
                         been able to transfer funds to the equipment manufacturers due to reasons beyond its control. Recently, the implementing agency (EEPCo) and the contractor reached an
                         agreement to amend the existing contract such that EEPCo shall sign direct contracts with the manufacturers in order to ensure payment and supply of the equipment to the project
                         site.

                         However, since the Credit Closing date was June 30, 2012, based on GOE's request, the credit closing date has been extended by twelve months, up to June 30, 2013, to provide
                         adequate time to EEPCo to complete this project under the new procurement arrangements.
