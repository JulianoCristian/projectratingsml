                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's long-term development objective is to improve the effectiveness of the power systems in the Eastern Nile region by promoting regional power
                         trade through the establishment of coordinated planning and the erection of transmission interconnections in the context of multi-purpose water and energy
                         resources development in the region. The Project also takes advantage of the hydro-thermal complementarity of the Ethiopian and Sudanese systems to reduce
                         overall generation costs and improve the availability and reliability of supply in the two countries.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation Status: Objective of this project is to export electricity to Sudan. GOE has signed Construction Agreement, Operations Agreement and Power Purchase Agreement
                         with Sudan. The transmission line contract and the substation contract were signed on December 18, 2008 and became effective respectively on April 14, 2009 and on July 13, 2009.

                         As per the initial Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between EEPCo and NEC of Sudan, export of electricity should have started from July 1, 2010. Both the governments
                         later negotiated to start the trading of electricity from September 2011. While the transmission line has been completed, two shunt reactors in the Shehedi Substation and the
                         telecommunication equipments to allow the NLDCs in Ethiopia and Sudan to communicate are still to be installed.

                         The transmission line consists of three sections. (i) Bahir Dar - Gondar, (ii) Gondar - Shehedi, and (iii) Shehedi - Matema. As of November 2011, construction of the transmission
                         lines of all three sections are complete. EEPCO has carried out the line inspection and commissioned the line. The project includes three substations. One each in Bahir Dar, Gonder
                         and Shehidi. While most of the works under this contract has been completed, the contractor still needs to install two shunt reactors and telecommunication equipment, without which
                         the electricity trade will not begin. Starting from July 2011, EEPCO is facing difficulty to make payments to the substation contractor. As a result, the work has been delayed. EEPCO
                         facilitated the contractor to open a foreign currency account in Ethiopia to resolve the fund transfer problem to the contractor. However, since the Credit Closing date is December
                         31, 2011 and EEPCO has lost valuable time at the end of the project period, GOE is requested the Bank to extend this credit closing date by six months, up to June 30, 2012, to
                         provide adequate time to EEPCo to complete this project.
