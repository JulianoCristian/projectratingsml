1.      The closing date for Ethiopia - Ethiopia/Nile Basin Initiative: Ethiopia-Sudan
Interconnector, Credit 4375-ET, P074011 will be extended by one year from June 30,
2012 until June 30, 2013. This project was approved on December 20, 2007 with a
closing date of December 31, 2011. At the request of the Government of Ethiopia, the
original closing date was previously extended to the current closing date of June 30,
2012. With this second extension of the closing date the credit will be extended
cumulatively for eighteen months.

2.      The transmission line construction planned under the project has been completed
and the transmission line has been commissioned. Three substations planned under the
project are almost complete. The project performance is currently rated as Moderately
Satisfactory given the delays in construction. The Project Development Objectives
continue to be achievable.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow sufficient time to the implementing
agency to complete project construction activities. The substation contractor (Sunir Co.,
Iran) has not been able to transfer funds to the equipment manufacturers due to reasons
beyond its control and is considered as force majeure. Recently, the implementing
agency (EEPCo) and the contractor reached agreement to amend the existing contract
arrangements such that EEPCo could sign direct contracts with the manufacturers, and
thus ensure payment and supply of the equipment to the project site.

4.     Due to this contract amendment and the ensuing delay in completing construction,
the implementing agency requires additional time to complete the project construction
works. Based on the revised implementation plan submitted by EEPCO, the project
works are expected to be complete by June 30, 2013.

5.      There is no audit report outstanding for this project and the last audit was found
satisfactory based on an action plan to remove audit qualifications.
