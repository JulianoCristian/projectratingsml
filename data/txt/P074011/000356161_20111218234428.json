 the power systems in the Eastern Nile region by promoting\n            regional power trade through the establishment of\n            coordinated planning and the erection of transmission\n            interconnections in the context of multi-purpose water and\n            energy resources development in the region. The extension is\n            necessary to allow sufficient time to the implementing\n            agency to complete project construction activities. Since\n            June 2011, the implementing agency couldn't transfer\n            funds to the substation contractor due to reasons beyond\n            project control. The closing date of the project will be\n            extended from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2012. This\n            will be the first extension of the project which is\n            extending the closing date by about six months from the\n            original closing date."}, "docdt": "2011-12-09T00:00:00Z"}
