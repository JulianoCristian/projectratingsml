"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The development objective of the\n            Ethiopia/Nile Basin Initiative: Ethiopia-Sudan\n            Interconnector Project is to improve the effectiveness of\n            the power systems in the Eastern Nile region by promoting\n            regional power trade through the establishment of\n            coordinated planning and the erection of transmission\n            interconnections in the context of multi-purpose water and\n            energy resources development in the region. The closing date\n            for the project will be extended by one year from June 30,\n            2012 until June 30, 2013. This project was approved on\n            December 20, 2007 with a closing date of December 31, 2011.\n            At the request of the Government of Ethiopia, the original\n            closing date was previously extended to the current closing\n            date of June 30, 2012. With this second extension of the\n            closing date the credit will be extended cumulatively for\n            eighteen months. The transmission line construction planned\n            under the project has been completed and the transmission\n            line has been commissioned. Three substations planned under\n            the project are almost complete. The project performance is\n            currently rated as moderately satisfactory given the delays\n            in construction. The project development objectives continue\n            to be achievable. The extension is necessary to allow\n            sufficient time to the implementing agency to complete\n            project construction activities. The substation contractor\n            has not been able to transfer funds to the equipment\n            manufacturers due to reasons beyond its control and is\n            considered as force majeure. Recently, the implementing\n            agency Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) and the\n            contractor reached agreement to amend the existing contract\n            arrangements such that EEPCo could sign direct contracts\n            with the manufacturers, and thus ensure payment and supply\n            of the equipment to the project site. Due to this contract\n            amendment and the ensuing delay in completing construction,\n            the implementing agency requires additional time to complete\n            the project construction works. Based on the revised\n            implementation plan submitted by EEPCO, the project works\n            are expected to be complete by June 30, 2013. There is no\n            audit report outstanding for this project and the last audit\n            was found satisfactory based on an action plan to remove\n            audit qualifications."}, "docdt": "2012-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
