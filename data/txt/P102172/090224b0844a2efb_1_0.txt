﻿EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A. Project Summary
A Loan Agreement numbered 7717-TU was signed between Republic of Turkey (the
Borrower) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ("the Bank") on June
30, 2009 in order to finance Health Transformation and Social Security Reform Project
(HTSSRP) carried out by Ministry of Health and Social Security Institution(SSI). The Project
name was changed as "Project in Support of Restructuring of Health Sector" and Component
B cancelled with amendment on April 25, 2013 in the Project.
There are 9 Categories under A Component of Project in Support of Restructuring of
Health Sector named as Supporting the Strategic Plan of Ministry of Health. A Component is
implemented by central organization and subsidiaries of Ministry of Health under
coordination of Project Management Support Unit. Negotiations about the cancellation of
amounts that will not be used under Component C by Social Security Institution continue.
According to Financial Statements of Project implemented by Ministry of Health, total
amount disbursed is Euro 49.218.448,84 as of December 31, 2015 and amount disbursed
within 2015 is Euro 4.783.008,58.
B. Objectives of Audit
The objectives of our audit are;
a) To give an opinion on whether the financial statements, prepared as of December
31, 2015 and for the year then ended, give a true and fair view of the financial position of the
Project in accordance with the cash receipts and disbursements basis of accounting,
b) To determine, as of December 31, 2015, whether Ministry of Health has complied,
in all material respects, with the rules and procedures of the Loan Agreement numbered 7717-
TU.
c) To examine whether adequate supporting documentation has been maintained to
support claims to the World Bank for reimbursements of expenditures incurred with respect to
SOEs and to evaluate eligibility of these expenditures for financing under the World Bank
Loan Agreement numbered 7717-TU.
C. Scope of Audit
We have carried out an audit of financial statements of the Project as of December 31,
2015 and for the year then ended in accordance with the cash receipts and disbursements basis
of accounting. We have also performed a compliance audit on whether Project activities are in
line with Loan Agreement and related World Bank Guidelines.
Our audit was conducted in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing
published by International Federation of Accountants and related World Bank guidelines.


﻿Within the context of the Cost Sharing Agreement (CSA) signed between Ministry of
Health of the Republic of Turkey and United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on
December 29, 2005, it is understood that all the documents related to expenditures, salaries
and per diems of field coordinators assigned by the UNDP are kept in UNDP's premises and
Project Management and Support Unit does not have supporting documents related to those
expenditures. Therefore, there is an important scope limitation for our audit with respect to
the part of the project implemented by the UNDP.
This Report is prepared for the part of the Project in Support of Restructuring of
Health Sector numbered 7717-TU which is implemented by Ministry of Health.
D. Audit Results
Our audit resulted with qualified opinion due to inaccessibility to the documentation
kept by the UNDP.
In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Ministry of Health has complied, in all material
respects, with the rules and procedures of the Loan Agreement and related World Bank
Guidelines.
On the other hand, with respect to SOEs, adequate supporting documentation has been
maintained to support claims to the World Bank for reimbursements of expenditures incurred;
and these expenditures are eligible for financing under the World Bank Loan Agreement
numbered 7717-TU.
E. Management Recommendations
A management letter, dated June 07, 2016, to the attention of the Ministry of Health
was issued separately from this report. The objective of this Management Letter is to enable
the auditors to communicate appropriately to those charged with governance and management
deficiencies in internal control that the auditors have identified during the audit and that, in
the auditors' professional judgment, are of sufficient importance to merit their respective
attentions. For this purpose, our recommendations in order of priorities are attached to the
Letter.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO REPUBLIC OF TURKEY MINISTRY OF HEALTH
We have audited the accompanying Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds,
Statement of Cumulative Investments, Statement of Requests for Reimbursement (SOE
-         Statement) and Statement of Special Account of the Project in Support of Restructuring of
Health Sector as of December 31, 2015, and for the period then ended, and a summary of
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. The financial statements
have been prepared by Ministry of Health based on relevant provisions of the World Bank
Loan Agreement, numbered 7717-TU.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Ministry of Health is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
financial statements in accordance with the relevant provisions of the World Bank Loan
Agreement, numbered 7717-TU, and for such internal control as management determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audit, and to determine whether Ministry of Health has complied with, in all material respects,
the requirements of the World Bank Loan Agreement, numbered 7717-TU. We conducted our
audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement and
whether Ministry of Health has complied with, in all material respects, the requirements of the
World Bank Loan Agreement, numbered 7717-TU.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

﻿REPUBLIC OF TURKEY MINISTRY OF HEALTH
PROJECT IN SUPPORT OF RESTRUCTURING OF HEALTH SECTOR
(LOAN NO. 7717-TU)
NOTES ON PROJECT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDING ON 31.12.2015
1. GENERAL INFORMATION ON THE PROJECT
The Government of the Republic of Turkey applied to the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (WB) to finance the Project in Support of Restructuring of
Health Sector (Health Transformation and Social Security Reform Project), and obtained a
loan (LN-7717-TU), with the Loan Agreement entering into force on 29 September 2009.
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Labour and Social Security, and the World Bank came to
agreement on the following components:
COMPONENT A: Supporting the Strategic Plan of MoH (2009-2013)
A. 1: Strengthening preventive and primary health care services
A.2. Implementing Public Hospital Reforms
A.3. Improving the quality of health services
A.4. Institutional restructuring and capacity building
A.5. Managing pharmaceutical and medical devices regulation
A.6. Improving health information systems
A.7. Supporting inter-sectoral health responsibility and aligning health policies with world
standards
A.8. Functionalizing the National Public Health Agency
A.9. Provision of equipment, technical assistance, technical services and training for MoH to
strengthen the collaborations with other countries and international organizations in the field of
development of health policies, and to share country experiences
COMPONENT B: Performing Pilot Studies in relation to Output-based Financing of the
Prevention and Control ofNon-communicable Diseases (7NCDs)
B. 1: Output-based financing for family medicine practices

addition of the new sub-component A.9 titled "Provision of equipment, technical assistance,
technical services and training for MoH to strengthen the collaborations with other countries and
international organizations in the field of development of health policies, and to share country
experiences", which aims to share with other countries the experiences Turkey has gained with
the Health Transformation Programme, have been completed. Talks with the Undersecretariat of
Treasury and the World Bank regarding the amendments made in Component C titled "Capacity


﻿Building for the Social Security Institution (SSI)" and the cancellation of the amount not to be
used under this component by the SSI as of 25 September 2012, were completed and the said

II of the Law no. 5018, the expenditures under component A.5 of the said agency, no longer able
