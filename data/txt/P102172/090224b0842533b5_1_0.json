       were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: providing a\n            broad support to the strategic plan development and\n            implementation through disintegrated micro activities\n            creates problems in monitoring and evaluating progress on\n            the main objectives of the project. Capacity building and\n            technical assistance by bringing in international expertise\n            and knowledge is appreciated by the Borrower who also\n            realizes the importance of using robust approaches in health\n            system reforms and improvements. Proper risk assessment of\n            possible uncertainties likely to emerge during\n            implementation and having a flexible design allowing to\n            mitigate such risks is a necessity. In order to minimize or\n            avoid delays and challenges in Project implementation, both\n            the Bank and the Ministry of Health (MoH) can think of\n            effective means and mechanisms to try to retain critical\n            human resources to the extent possible (civil servants and\n            the consultants) within the MoH project management unit.\n            Throughout all phases of the project (with or without\n            restructuring) design, monitoring, and supervision of the\n            results framework necessitates close, regular, and timely\n            attention by the Bank to make sure that the project\n            objectives and project development objective (PDO)\n            indicators are in line and consistent to reflect the\n            outcomes of the project. For projects supporting broader\n            reforms, failure to timely monitor and to detect the\n            possible deterioration on the reform trends may lead to\n            misinterpret the outcomes in the medium and long run and to\n            misread the sustainability."}, "docdt": "2016-01-28T01:28:01Z"}
