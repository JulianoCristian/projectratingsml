                         The specific objectives of the Project are: (i) increasing the effectiveness of the Social Security Institute (SSI) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in formulating and
                         implementing reforms in provider payments and health systems performance; and (ii) piloting output-based financing for non-communicable diseases (NCD) prevention

                         The Project has disbursed 61% of loan proceeds.

                         Some of the Government’s main achievements supported under the Project include increased access to family medicine providers, which resulted in an increase of primary care

                         patient satisfaction with primary care services in provinces where family medicine was introduced increased from 69 percent in 2004 to 89.8 percent in 2012. Patient satisfaction with
                         health services in public hospitals increased from 41 percent in 2003 to 76 percent in 2011.

                         The approval of the Decree Law No. 663 on the Organization and Duties of the Ministry of Health and Its Affiliates on November 3, 2011 has further helped establish the legal basis
                         for the reforms being supported by the Project by defining the stewardship role of the MOH, increasing hospital autonomy, expanding family medicine services and further
                         strengthening performance management and pay for performance initiatives.

                         The recent completion of the Ministry’s medium-term strategic plan, covering the period from 2013 to 2017, confirms its commitment towards implementation of the reform program,
                         and strengthens the basis for continued support under the Project.

                         Notwithstanding these significant achievements, the Project has suffered from implementation delays, reflected in a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating of Implementation Progress in
                         the last ISR. This reflects a considerable slow-down in disbursements as the MOH and SSI reconsidered the focus of the project, resulting eventually in the request to cancel the
                         output-based financing and SSI-related activities under the project, the incorporation of new activities (including a new sub-component on international knowledge sharing) and the
                         extension of the project implementation period. A considerable turnover of staff in the project implementation unit and the resulting need to rebuild procurement capacity, as well as
                         change in Minister while discussions on a project restructuring and extension were ongoing contributed to the delay in project implementation and the finalization of the restructuring.

                         A forthcoming restructuring (Board submission foreseen second quarter of FY14) of the project is expected to continue the recent acceleration in activities and efforts to consolidate
                         the reform results. The revised PDO is achievable. The project is being streamlined with the cancellation of components, disbursement has picked up and a new implementation plan
                         is being finalized. The updated procurement plan with all activities has been cleared.
