Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project has disbursed 82% of loan proceeds.
 Some of Government's main achievements supported under the Project include increased access to physicians at all levels of health care services
 (from 7.3 to 8.2 outpatient per capita visits between 2009 and 2013). The share of total visits to a physician in primary health care, on the other
 hand, was decreased from 38% to 35% between 2009 and 2013 (after a peek in 2011, with 40%). Since the implementation of the two-phased support
 to the Health Transformation Program, patient satisfaction with overall health services increased from 65.1 percent in 2009 to 74.7 percent in 2013. In
 2013, the rate of unsatisfied patients raised for the first time after 2009, with 14.7%.

 After the approval of the Decree Law No. 663 on the Organization and Duties of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Its Affiliates on November 3, 2011,
 the MOH completed its restructuring in November 2012, which has further helped establish the legal basis for the reforms being supported by the
 Project by defining the stewardship role of the MOH, increasing hospital autonomy, expanding family medicine services and further strengthening
 performance management and pay for performance initiatives. The MOH’s medium-term strategic plan, covering the period from 2013 to 2017 confirms
 its commitment towards implementation of the reform program, and strengthens the basis for continued support under the Project.

 After the completion of project restructuring in May 2014, the project started approaching its revised objectives. The disbursement has picked up and a
 new implementation plan is being finalized. The updated procurement plan with all activities has been cleared by the World Bank.

 The overall implementation capacity - including human resources management and fiduciary issues - of the MOH Project Management Support Unit
 (PMSU) has improved, however the sustainability of the capacity in the last year of project implementation remains as an important risk. In line with the
 increased disbursement rate, the Implementation Progress rating of the Project is kept as Moderately Satisfactory.
 The Bank team will conduct a last supervision of the project in early 2015 and start the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report.
