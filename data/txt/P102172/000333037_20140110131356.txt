B. Project Status
Page 4 of 16


﻿The Worid Bank
The Loan was approved on June 11, 2009 in the amount of Euro 56.1 million (USD 75.12 million equivalent).
The loan became effective on September 29, 2009. The Project is the second phase of the World Bank's support
to the Republic of Turkey's Health Transformation Program. The first phase, through the Health Transition
Project, supported the introduction of the family medicine model, and helped build capacity of the Ministry of
Health (MoH) and the Social Security Institution (SSI) to expand health insurance coverage and improve family
medicine service delivery. The Project supports broad reforms in the sector aimed at increasing hospital
autonomy, expanding family medicine services, and further strengthening performance management and
pay-for-performance initiatives.
The Original PDO is to: (i) increase the effectiveness of the SSI and MOH in formulating and implementing
reforms in provider payments and health systems performance; and, (ii) pilot output-based financing for
non-communicable diseases (NCD) prevention and control. Originally, the Project had three components: (A)
Support for MOH's strategic plan; (B) Piloting output-based financing for preventive health services and (C)
Capacity building of the SSI.
Progress towards achieving the Project's Development Objective (PDO) has been rated fully or moderately
satisfactory throughout the course of the Project, as reflected in the most recent Implementation Status and
Results reports (ISR).
One of the Government's main achievements supported under the Project includes increased access to family
medicine providers, which resulted in an increase of primary care services utilization from 2 to 3.3 outpatient
visits per capita between 2009 and 2011. Since the implementation of the two-phased support to the Health
Transformation Program, patient satisfaction with primary care services in provinces where family medicine was
introduced increased from 69 percent in 2004 to 89.8 percent in 2012. Patient satisfaction with health services in
public hospitals increased from 41 percent in 2003 to 76 percent in 2011. The approval of the Decree Law No.
663 on the Organization and Duties of the Ministry of Health and Its Affiliates on November 3, 2011 has further
helped establish the legal basis for the reforms being supported by the Project by defining the stewardship role of
the MOH, increasing hospital autonomy, expanding family medicine services and further strengthening
performance management and pay for performance initiatives. The recent completion of the Ministry's
medium-term strategic plan, covering the period from 2013 to 2017, confirms its commitment towards
implementation of the reform program, and strengthens the basis for continued support under the Project.
Notwithstanding these significant achievements, the Project has suffered from implementation delays, reflected
in a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for Implementation Progress in the last ISR. This reflects a considerable
slow-down in disbursements as the MOH and SSI reconsidered the focus of the project, resulting eventually in
the request to cancel the output-based financing and SSI-related activities under the project, the incorporation of
new activities (including a new sub-component on international knowledge sharing) and the extension of the
project implementation period. A considerable turnover of staff in the project implementation unit and the
resulting need to rebuild procurement capacity, while discussions on a project restructuring and extension were
ongoing, further contributed to delays in project implementation and the finalization of the restructuring.
A Level II Restructuring aimed at urgently addressing the Ministry's request to proceed with several activities
under the new sub-component on knowledge sharing was agreed in amendment letter dated April 25, 2013. It
extended the closing date to May 31, 2015, changed the official name of the project, added a sub-component, and
revised the results framework to reflect the new sub-component.
This Restructuring Paper reflects the proposed Level I Restructuring and addresses the partial cancellation of the
SSI component, the cancellation of the output-based financing component, the change in PDO and Results
Framework, the reallocation of funds between components and disbursement categories and the cancellation of
unspent funds under the SSI Component. The timing of this Level I Restructuring was influenced by the recent

﻿The Worid Bank
changes in administration of the health sector and confirmation of the focus of the project activities.
With this proposed restructuring, the project is expected to continue the recent acceleration in activities and
efforts to consolidate the reform results. The new PDO is achievable and the rating, currently "Moderately
Satisfactory", is expected to be upgraded to "Satisfactory" after the Restructuring. The project is being
streamlined with the cancellation of components and disbursement has accelerated. The updated procurement
plan has been cleared.
Financial Management is rated as "Satisfactory", reflecting good performance in overall financial management
arrangements. There are no outstanding issues in the audit reports for the Project other than the fact that the
auditors didn't have access to the supporting documents kept by the UNDP related to the contract signed between
the MoH and UNDP. This issue is currently being resolved and is not expected to be a concern going forward.
The Procurement rating was downgraded to "Moderately Unsatisfactory", to reflect the weak capacity of the
implementing agency in this area, particularly in terms of planning. However, recent efforts to strengthen the
capacity in procurement, as well as stronger links to the implementation plan are starting to show results. The
Bank continues to work closely with the MOH to address this aspect, through focused implementation support
and capacity building efforts in the area of procurement.

Original PDO
The Original PDO is to: (i) increase the effectiveness of the SSI and MOH in formulating and implementing
reforms in provider payments and health systems performance; and, (ii) pilot output-based financing for
non-communicable diseases (NCD) prevention and control.
Originally, the Project had three components: (A) Support for MOH's strategic plan; (B) Piloting output-based
financing for preventive health services and (C) Capacity building of the SSI.
Change in Project's Development Objectives
Please describe the change and explain the reason for change
The original PDO reflected the activities of all three components. Through this proposed restructuring, the
Component B is being fully cancelled, the Component C is being partially cancelled, and as such the revised
PDO reflects only the projected achievements of the Component A. This restructuring paper further streamlines
the PDO and the results framework to reflect the cancellation of output-based financing pilot and remaining
activities on capacity building of the SSI component. The Annex 1 to this RP reflects the changes in the Results
Framework.
The revised PDO is presented below.

Components
Change to Components and Cost
Explanation:
The Components B is being fully cancelled and the Component C is being partially cancelled, as some funds
were already spent under its implementation.
The activities under Component B aimed at piloting a new financing scheme, output-based financing for
Non-Communicable Disease Prevention and Control. The pilot was cancelled after the Ministry of Health (MoH)
decision to roll-out the new scheme nationwide immediately. As that decision was taken, conducting a pilot was
no longer relevant. The activities of Component B, the pilot, were never started. However, as the program is
being rolled out, support to and monitoring of the implementation remains relevant and is included under
Component A1.3.3. Some funds originally planned for the Component B (USD 5,229,937.65, equivalent to EUR
3,861,000) will be reallocated for Component A.
The activities under Component C were implemented under the Social Security Institute Pharmaceuticals and
Medical Equipment Institute. After the re-organization of the MoH, the institutional structure of the
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices was changed to a separate Agency. As an Agency, it can no longer be a
recipient of the Project funds. The undisbursed funds (USD 3,352,816.76, equivalent to EUR 2,475,000) will be
cancelled from the loan.

﻿The Worid Bank
Explanation:
The Social Security Institute is no longer an implementing agency. The Primary Health Care General Directorate
of the MoH, Provincial Health Directorate, Community Health Centers and Family Medicine Practices will no
longer be responsible for the implementation of the Component B, which is being fully cancelled. The Inter
Agency Coordination is not necessary any longer.
Change in Financial Management
Explanation:
The Component B will be fully cancelled and as a result, the arrangements for the payment of the capitation for
the PHC services are no longer relevant for the project financial management.
Change(s) in Appraisal Summary
Appraisal Summary Change in Economic and Financial Analysis
Explanation:
Economic and Financial Analysis: the original economic and financial analysis was prepared for the overall
APL, the Health Transformation and Social Security Reform Project (HTSSRP) of which this ongoing project is
the second phase. Since HTSSRP is a "framework" project, largely supporting technical assistance, training and
goods, the objective of the economic analysis was not to provide quantitative estimates of an economic rate of
return (ROR) based on a cost-benefit analysis. Rather, the analysis focuses on: (i) evaluating the Health
Transformation Program from a public finance angle, to determine if state involvement is justified in the areas
supported under the project, and (ii) presenting a fiscal sustainability analysis of Universal Health Insurance
(UHI), including under a scenario of macroeconomic downturns. The proposed restructuring, even though it
cancels components (or parts of them), does not impact the above mentioned analysis and therefore no update or
changes in benefit analysis is required. The assumptions remain the same.
