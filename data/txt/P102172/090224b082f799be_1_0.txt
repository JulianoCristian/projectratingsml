Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Project has disbursed 88.2% of loan proceeds and will disburse 92.4% by May 31, 2015. The project was extended by four (4) months from May
 31, 2015 to September 30, 2015, allowing maintaining institutional capacity until the expected effectiveness date of the new project in September 2015.
 Implementation progress has shown recent improvements. Since the two restructurings, project management accelerated implementation resulting in an
 increased in disbursement level. In response to slow disbursement and implementation concerns, the project was restructured twice.

 Component A (Support to Strategic Plan) activities have been successfully implemented, including the last added component under which two
 international conferences on health reform were financed. Other achievements include the introduction and scaling up if the Family Medicine program
 and improved quality of family medicine providers, the public hospital reforms, the institutional restructuring and the improved Health Management
 Information System.
 Component B (Output-based Financing of Health Services): this pilot never started and was cancelled because government decided to finance the
 activities nationwide.
 Components C (Capacity Building for Social Security Institution) was partially cancelled. Several activities were implemented before restructuring with
 positive results; a more efficient and more effective delivery of SSI services by using asynchronous modes of training to meet miscellaneous training
 needs of the staff with regard to Universal Health Insurance and Social Insurances transactions. Central and local level staff receive training on Social
 Security Reforms in a timely manner. An additional sub-component was added: sharing Turkey's experience.
