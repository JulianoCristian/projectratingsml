                This indicator was introduced as an alternative to indicators that was dropped
                under the restructuring in March 2013 as it is more measurable and a better
Comments        indication of the effectiveness of the reforms. It was not achieved. This could be
(incl. %        attributed to inadequate increase on the supply side, which could not keep up
achievement) with the increase from the general demand for care. Since 2013, there has not
                been a significant increase in the number of family physicians which also
                exacerbated the ever increasing workload of family medicine.

                This indicator was added during the restructuring in March 2013. It was not

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1. The Health Transformation and Social Security Reform Project (HTSSRP), which was
renamed in March 2013 as the Project in Support of Restructuring of Health Sector
(PSRHS) was an integral part of the Government of Turkey’s (GoT) implementation of the
Health Transformation Program (Program) covering the period 2003 to 2013. 2 The
Program’s overall objective was to improve the governance, efficiency, user and provider
satisfaction and long-term fiscal sustainability of the Turkish health care system.

2. The original loan was approved on June 11, 2009 in the amount of Euro 56.10 millio n
(USD 75.12 million equivalent), and the Loan Agreement (LA) became effective on
September 29, 2009. The Project was the second phase of an Adaptable Program Lending
(APL) of the World Bank’s support to the Program. The first phase (APL 1) which was
implemented between 2004 and 2009 through the Health Transition Project (HTP -
P074053), supported the introduction of the family medicine model, and helped build
capacity of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Social Security Institution3 (SSI) to
expand health insurance coverage and to improve family medicine service delivery. The
total amount for the APL 1 was Euro 49.40 million (US$60.60 million equivalent). The
HTP was restructured following the mid-term review (MTR) in September 2006 and was
closed on June 30, 2009. 4 The second phase continued under the Project to support broad
reforms in the sector aimed at increasing hospital autonomy, expanding family medicine
services, and further strengthening performance management and pay-for-performa nce
initiatives.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

3. Country and Sector background. Turkey was adversely affected by the global
financial crisis in 2008. However, the structural progress observed in the financial and real
sectors since 2001 and prevailing economic and fiscal policies helped the country to
appropriately address the downturn. Social security and universal health insurance reforms
were helpful in protecting the vulnerable population during this economic downturn, while
maintaining fiscal sustainability.

4. Main Health Sector Issues. By the time of appraisal in 2009, while key health
outcomes (such as life expectancy at birth, maternal mortality ratio, and infant mortality
rate) were showing steady progress and Turkey was performing better than the upper
middle income countries such as Mexico and Brazil, Turkey continued to lag behind in
international comparisons with OECD. Communicable diseases were the major contributor


2
  The Program was a ten-year health reform program aimed at addressing the major challenges in the Turkish health
sector. The Program was included in the GoT’s Ninth Development Plan and formed the basis for the M inistry of Health’s
Strategic Plan for 2010-2014 with an accompanying performance-based budget.
3
  The UHI Law of 2008 unified the previously fragmented social insurance schemes (active and retired civil servants,
blue- and white-collar workers in the public and private sectors, and the self-employed, as well as green card holders)
under a single institution, the Social Security Institution (SSI).

to Turkey’s burden of disease, but Turkey started facing the challenges of the
epidemiological transition, with non-communicable diseases (NCD) increasingly taking
centre stage. The health reforms targeted institutional and organizational changes to
eliminate fragmentation and duplication in the health financing and delivery systems and
to assure universal access to health insurance and health services.

5. Country Partnership Strategy and Rationale for Bank involvement. The Bank was
and remains an important source of support for policy and system reform in the Turkey
health sector. At appraisal, the Project 5 was consistent with the Turkey Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS). 6 The CPS development objective for the health sector fully supported the
GoT’s Ninth Development Plan (2007-2013) whose main health sector-related objective
was to “make the health sector effective.” The Project was supportive of Pillar II of the
CPS (Equitable human and social development). One of the expected results under Pillar
II was “The health care system has improved governance, efficiency, user and provider
satisfaction and long-term sustainability”. Support to social security reforms and
continuation of support to the Government’s Health Transformation Program were
identified in the CPS as key priorities during the CPS period. The operation was expected
to directly contribute to achieving these priorities.

6. From the GoT’s perspective, the Bank’s global knowledge and technical experience in
health reforms and institutional development made it an important partner for the
implementation of the Program. Monitoring and evaluation of these reforms, with strong
emphasis on results, was considered as instrumental for achieving sustainability. The Bank
was uniquely positioned to contribute to this and the continued implementation of the
Program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the LA listed the original PDO as: (i)
increasing the effectiveness of the MoH and the SSI in formulating and implementing
reforms in provider payments and health systems performance; and (ii) piloting output-
based financing for NCD prevention and control.

8. Key indicators were as follows: (i) increase in the utilization of primary health care;
(ii) increase in the percentage of first-time visits to specialists that are referred by family
medicine practices; (iii) increase in client satisfaction with health services; (iv) decrease in
SSI expenditures on pharmaceuticals and outpatient health care; (v) more decrease in
smoking prevalence among 18-29 age group in Output-Based Financing pilot provinces
relative to non-pilot provinces; and (vi) more decrease in high blood pressure in population
in Output-Based-Financing pilot provinces as compared to non-pilot provinces.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9. A Level 1 Project Restructuring, approved by the Board in January 2014, 7 revised the
PDO as follows: “to increase the effectiveness of the MoH in formulating and
implementing reforms in provider payments and health systems performance”. In the
original Project design, the output-based financing scheme was envisaged as a pilot and
highlighted as such in the original PDO. In accordance with the MoH’s decision not to pilot
this option using Project funds but to implement it nationwide, this part of the PDO was no
longer relevant and, therefore, removed. References to SSI were also removed in the PDO
as the Borrower had decided to carry out activities originally planned under Component C
(Capacity building of the Social Security Institution) using its own funds.

10. While the PDO was revised in January 2014, the Results Framework was revised twice:
once in March 2013 with a Level 2 Project Restructuring, 8 and at the time of the Level 1
Project Restructuring in January 2014. In March 2013, one PDO indicator was dropped,
two were revised, and two new indicators were added. With the March 2013 restructur ing
four Intermediate Outcome Indicator (IOI) were dropped, one was revised and seven new
IOIs were added. March 2013 restructuring covers only the changes related with
Component A. In January 2014, three PDO indicators and seven IOIs that were related
with Component B and C were dropped. Annex 10 presents an assessment of Project
achievements towards outcomes, including information on the Project’s original and
revised Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), the rationale for the revisions, and targets
value at Closing.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

11. Relative to the APL 1, the APL 2 had a wider scope of beneficiaries on both the demand
and supply side (in addition to the MoH and SSI). The main beneficiary was the Turkish
population for whom the Project aimed to improve access to health care and their health.
Women and children were of special focus as part of the performance-based activities of
the family medicine scheme. Among the general population, people with low socio-
economic status and living in geographically remote areas remained as a priority to benefit
from increased Primary Healthcare (PHC) coverage through the scaling up of family
medicine. On the supply side, health providers and the MoH staff were the beneficiaries of
capacity building interventions (training, knowledge sharing activities, seminars etc.) to
improve the quality and efficiency of health care delivery and strengthen the MoH’s
capacity in effective policy formulation and implementation.

1.5 Original Components

12. The Project had three main components as described below:

1.6 Revised Components

13. The Project was restructured three times, in March 2013 (Level 2), January 2014 (Level
1), and May 2015 9 (Level 2). Project components were revised through the Level 2 Project
Restructuring of March 2013: (i) sub-components A.3 and A.4 were revised in line with
the organizational restructuring according to the Decree Law no. 663; and (ii) sub-
component A.9 was introduced to strengthen collaboration with other countries and
international institutions in health policy development and to share Turkey’s experiences.
Component B was cancelled with the January 2104 restructuring as a result of the MoH’s
decision to roll out the model nationwide hence making the pilot no longer relevant. The
MoH later indicated that the job description of family physicians already included NCD
prevention and control activities. No funds were spent under this component. As the output-
based financing (OBF) was being rolled out, some funds originally planned for support to
implementation and monitoring of the activities were reallocated to Component A. In
addition, with the January 2014 restructuring the undisbursed funds under sub-component
A.5 were reallocated within Component A as the newly established Pharmaceutical and
Medical Devices Agency will not be able to disburse funds due to its new budget structure.
Component C was partially cancelled as some funds were already spent during
implementation; the undisbursed funds were cancelled from the loan. Details on the
revisions made as part of these restructurings are presented in Annex 10.

1.7 Other significant changes

14. In addition to changes above, the following changes were also made under the three
restructurings:

1st Restructuring: (i) extension of the Loan Closing Date by 22 months from July 31, 2013
to May 31, 2015; and (ii) change of the Project name from “Health Transformation and
Social Security Reform Project (HTSSRP)” to “Project in Support of Restructuring of
Health Sector (PSRHS)”.

2nd Restructuring: reallocation of funds between disbursement categories.

3rd Restructuring2015 10 : (i) a second and final extension of the Loan Closing Date by 4
months from May 31, 2015, to September 30, 2015 in order to complete all activities
planned under Component A, and maintain critical fiduciary as well as operational capacity
and institutional memory until the expected effectiveness of the new Health Systems
Strengthening and Support Project (Board approval September 21, 2015). 11

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15. Soundness of background analysis was satisfactory. In addition to the informa tio n
from global best practices in health reforms, the Project design duly incorporated the
findings of studies conducted prior to Project start. These included the Burden of Disease
Study (2006), the Joint Portfolio Performance Review for Turkey (2007), OECD-World
Bank Review of the Health Sector in Turkey, and Program (2008). 12 The Project also
benefitted from in-depth background analysis conducted under the Program, which
evaluated many key aspects of Turkey’s health system 13 , including health system
resources, health financing, health service delivery and organizational framework.

16. Assessment of the Project design. The Project’s design was adequate to support
ongoing health reforms in Turkey. Considering the long term nature of the health reforms,
the choice of a two-phase APL was also adequate. Project components were designed to
support continued health reform, mainly along the lines of strengthening PHC (scale-up of
the family medicine model and addressing NCD), continuing public hospital reforms,
strengthening Health Management Information System (HMIS), and building institutio na l
capacity. While it was not a novelty for the country, the output-based financing for NCD
in primary care could be considered as an important effort to expand results-based

financing (RBF). While the PDO and the envisaged components are deemed to be highly
relevant and internally coherent to further advance the implementation of the on-going
HTP, a certain degree of disconnect remains between thee components and the activities
on one hand, and the PDO and the indicators on the other hand, which became all the more
prominent after the restructuring (of the PDO) and elimination of some of its indicators.
More specifically, the project PDO was all about strengthening MOH’s capacity to become
a truly effective steward of the health system, yet many of the activities undertaken under
the Component A were mostly in relation to strengthening quality of service delivery at the
primary care level, as reflected in the set of PDO and IOI focusing on either inputs
(training), outputs (the number of visits) or outcomes (patient satisfaction) in conjunctio n
with service delivery.. Most of the activities under the project were training programs or
consultancies, having indirect effect on the broader outcomes (i.e. utilization, client
satisfaction). The relation between project activities and project objectives from a health
system functions perspective has been elaborated in detail in Annex 11.

17. The QER of October 2008 indicated the need for PAD to provide more detail on
readiness in terms of how technical inputs would be identified to work with the client. QER
also noted to incorporate these under implementation arrangements which PAD did,
describing how each component will be implemented by the responsible institution.

18. Adequacy of the Government’s commitment. Strong alignment of project design with
the Program, higher MoH policy documents and strategic plans contributed to the
continuation of MoH’s ownership. The Program formed the basis for the MoH’s Strategic
Plan and the accompanying performance-based budget. The Project was developed in a
way to duplicate the successful design of the previous Project that supported the Program
to ensure continuation of the GoT’s ownership and support.

19. Assessment of risks. The discussion on the risk identification and mitigation measures
included the risk pertaining to the legal amendments necessary to implement OBF
component as this was rated as substantial. The mitigation measures indicated possible
legal changes at different levels with the probability of occurrence and finally gave a
moderate risk rating. This rating was partly influenced by the Program’s successful
implementation and the GoT’s strong ownership at the time of Project preparation. It was
not very easy to foresee any political or governance related risks (such as changes in the
upper management of the Ministry, the Project Unit, and the implementing units). Still, the
likelihood of delays or problems in the legislative amendments could have been elaborated
in more detail in the risk mitigation section as critical prerequisites for a successful start
and implementation of the component. This would then keep the risk for the OBF
component as substantial.

2.2 Implementation

20. The Project became effective on September 29, 2009, and closed on September 30,
2015, 26 months later than the original Closing Date of July 31, 2013, as a result of two
extensions. The Mid-term Review (MTR) took place as part of Bank visits that took place



                                              8
during the period October-December 2011. Discussions were held on the revisions of the
PDO and the Results Framework and of a proposed merger of Components A and B.

21. Progress towards achievement of the original PDO and the overall Implementa tio n
Progress (IP) were rated satisfactory in the first years of Project implementation. The first
downgrading happened in October 15, 2012 setting the IP rating to Moderately
Satisfactory due to delays in decisions regarding the implementation of Component C
related to SSI. This was followed with the downgrading of the DO rating to Moderately
Satisfactory, and IP rating to Moderately Unsatisfactory on March 31, 2013. The reasons
for the downgrading were as follows: (i) the second PDO: piloting output-based financ ing
for NCD prevention and control was unlikely to be met in its current formulation; (ii)
finalization of the restructuring was delayed due to extended discussions between
implemented agencies; (iii) disbursement was slow due to changes in the MoH
management and MoH’s reorganization; and (iv) implementation capacity at the PMSU
was weakened due to turnover of key staff. After the first restructuring of March 2013,
implementation capacity and quality started improving with the recruitment of consulta nts.
Though the PDO indicators (reflecting the previous year’s performance) started to worsen
after 2013, in line with the positive recovery in the implementation capacity and gradual
increase in the pace of disbursement the IP rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory
on June 28, 2014, while the DO rating was kept as Moderately Satisfactory. The PDO
rating was downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory just before the Closing Date on
September 30, 2015, as three out of four PDO indicators were below the closing date
targets.

22. Factors outside the control of the GoT. None.

23. Factors within the control of the GoT. The necessary change in legislation to
implement the OBF pilot for component B was approved two years after the project became
effective. Even after the passing of the legislation, uncertainties on the part of the MoH
remained on the implementation details of the OBF model. Although a high level Inter-
Agency Steering Committee (IASC) was planned to be established, with representatives of
the Under-secretariat of Treasury, Ministry of Development (MoD), 14 MoH and SSI to
provide inter-agency coordination, oversight and policy guidance for overall
implementation of the Project, this has never materialized.

24. The project restructuring on the PDO and Intermediate Outcome Indicators took almost
two years to complete with the March 2013 and January 2014 restructurings due to
changing decisions of the implementing agencies on major issues. The SSI had informed
the Bank team of its decision in early 2011 to cancel the undisbursed portion of the loan
under Component C (Capacity Building of the Social Security Institution) but the new SSI
management decided not to cancel the unused loan proceeds until late 2011. As the SSI
could not get an agreement with the MoD on the activities to be implemented under the
Project, the remaining funds under Component C could be cancelled only in 2013. There
were long series of exchanges with the MoH in order to finalize the restructuring document


14
     M oD was called the Undersecretariat of State Planning Organization before 2011.

                                                            9
of December 2013. The process took longer than expected due to changing demands of the
MoH upper management.

25. Factors within the control of the implementing agencies. Delays in the decision
making processes (specifically about the use of Project funds) and frequent departure of
Project-related staff capacity (especially on procurement and financial manageme nt)
caused delays in implementation thus adversely affecting timely disbursements.

26. The original disbursement lag was 21.69 percent or 24 months at the time of closing.
The Project has suffered from delays in disbursement throughout its implementation. At
the time of the Level 1 restructuring of January 2014, US$ 49.12 million equivalent (65.4
percent) were disbursed out of the total loan amount of US$ 75.12 million. Disburseme nts
followed a similar trend after the restructuring and reached 93.5 percent of the loan at the
time of closing. 15

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

27. Design at approval . The PAD included an M&E framework with six PDO indicators
and ten IOIs with baselines set and target values indicated. While original PDO indicators
and intermediate indicators captured the essence of the PDO, they were not all adequate,
as only one of the PDO indicators has any face validity vis-a-vis the stewardship functio n;
and some of the indicators were either not relevant, or could actually be measured with the
available data.. Selected PDO indicators reflected the health system overall utilizatio n,
intermediate outcomes and to some extent, final health outcomes. The outcome indicator
linked to component A (on patient satisfaction) and those linked to components B and C
(on selected NCD conditions’ prevalence, coverage, behavior change and strategic
purchasing) were appropriate in measuring critical areas of health system performance.
While the indicators were ambitious, the significantly positive progress of the reform and
its implementation, as well as the GoT’s strong ownership and engagement in the reform
justify their selection. However, the main issue with the M&E design was that the
indicators were selected on the basis of their predictive validity to gauge the
implementation of the overall reform program, rather than of the activities under the
Project.

28. Implementation. While the majority of the indicators were tracked regularly for the
purpose of the ISRs, there had been challenges in data collection and consistency at times.
Issues related to data collection and reporting can be summarized as follows:
    • Data collection for intermediate outcome indicators related to component B was
    contingent upon the actual start of the OBF pilot. However, the pilot did not materia lize
    and, therefore, necessary legal changes did not take place.
    • Different data sources for some of the intermediate outcome indicators were used
    after the MoH reorganization, which led to data inconsistencies as noted in ISRs (e.g.,



15
  New withdrawal applications were processed after the loan closing (US$ 389,969) and unused balance of the
designated account was transferred to the Loan Account on February 19, 2016 (US$ 457,471.42) .

                                                   10
   data on patient satisfaction varied from 89 percent (in September 2012 and February
   2013 ISRs) to 73 percent (in September 2013 ISR).
   • New reporting methodologies were used by the MoH after its reorganization. For
   instance, data on annual visits to family physicians were collected from the MoH
   statistics yearbook starting in December 2014, as recorded by ISRs.
   • Timely monitoring of some indicators was affected by the transfer of the TUSAK to
   the General Directorate of Health Research (GDHR) as part of the MoH reorganiza tio n
   of 2011.
   • As the downturn in the PDO indicators after 2013 was not effectively monitored,
   corrective action could not be realized until the last stages of project implementation.

29. Revisions as part of the restructuring. Both the PDO and intermediate outcome
indicators were revised in March 2013 and January 2014 as explained in detail under
Section 1.3. The restructuring papers were not clear enough to reflect the details of the
revised M&E framework including information on reporting frequency, data sources and
responsible units and justification for revision, cancellation, progress to date and likelihood
of achievement. The restructuring mainly focused on addressing changes related with the
PDO indicators that were linked with the dropped or discontinued components. For the
remaining component, the restructuring was opportunistic (rather than corrective) as the
PDO indicators were performing satisfactorily at the time of restructuring, and the
disconnection between the project activities and their effect on the PDO indicators was not
taken into consideration sufficiently.

30. Utilization. The following were observed with regards to utilization:
    • Findings of surveys and studies conducted by MoH implementing units on NCD
    (diabetes, etc.) were used for strategy development. Survey results proved to be
    important in defining priorities for adopting new strategies and health care programs
    and developing prevention and promotion programs.
    • The PMSU involvement in M&E responsibility was limited to monitor ing
    intermediate outcome indicators.
    • Many of the intermediate outcome indicators reflected a specific action being
    accomplished—process indicators. Hence, these indicators had little value for decision
    making or resource allocation.
    • Indicators which would have had an impact on decision making and resource
    allocation were dropped due to the cancellation of components B and C. These
    indicators could have measured results on critical interventions, such as coverage,
    behavioral change, intermediate health outcomes and improvements in health financ ing
    system (cost control and strategic purchasing).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

31. Safeguard. The original Project and the restructurings were rated appropriately as
environmental Category C with no adverse impacts expected. During the preparation phase
of the Project none of the safeguard policies was triggered as Project activities were going
to be implemented within physical footprint for any type of construction –including minor
civil works. During restructurings, there were no amendments to the Integrated Safeguards

                                              11
Data Sheet of the Project since the content of the restructurings did not have any
implications related to environmental and/or social safeguard policies of the Bank. Since
the safeguard policies were not triggered there was no environmental or social assessment
prepared for the Project and none were prepared during Project implementation. Safeguard-
related implementation support visits were not needed, therefore not conducted by the Bank
during implementation.

32. Procurement. Procurement was rated moderately satisfactory over the life of the
Project. Though the Project implementation did not suffer from procurement-related
delays, the rating was given to reflect the weak capacity of the implementing agency in this
area, especially around the time of the Level 1 restructuring. The Bank worked closely with
the MoH to address this aspect, through focused implementation support and capacity
building efforts in the area of procurement. The rating was kept moderately satisfactor y
until closing mainly due to the continuing need for capacity building (due to lack of
experienced civil servants or consultants), as well as the inefficient coordination between
the MoH procurement units and the PMSU.

33. Financial Management. The Project had initially two implementing entities (the MoH
and SSI). As the Project implementing entity, in charge of Components A and B, the MoH
has maintained satisfactory financial management arrangements for the Project all through
implementation. The SSI maintained satisfactory arrangements until Component C was
cancelled. The PMSU which was responsible for providing financial management support
to all MoH implementing units also kept the accounting entries for the Project. The
accounting entries were used in following the Project`s financial position against foreign
currency and in generating Project financial statements. The basis of the accounting entries
prepared by the PMSU was the payment confirmations of the Central Bank of Turkey. In
order to improve the information flow from the general directorates, the PMSU has
developed an integrated system which all general directorates were required to utilize at all
stages of the procurement processes. Through this system the PMSU was able to ensure
that the internal control procedures were applied by all general directorates and the required
supporting documentation for accounting entries were completed and flowed on a timely
basis to the PMSU. This has contributed significantly to the satisfactory rating of the
financial management arrangements throughout Project implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34. The revised PDO continued to be relevant. Increasing the effectiveness of MoH in
implementing the health reforms and in health system performance has been embedded in
the new Health Systems Strengthening Support Project (P152799, approved on September
21, 2015), where the particular focus is on strengthening the family medicine system and
to effectively address the prominent epidemiological changes in the country (NCDs and
aging population, in particular). The new Project’s PDO is: to improve primary and
secondary prevention of selected NCDs, increase the efficiency of hospital manageme nt,
and enhance the capacity of the MoH for evidence-based policy making.” Results through
improvements in those areas are expected to positively contribute to the Turkish health
system performance.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

35.     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation is rated Substantial under the
original project and Modest after Level 1 restructuring.

36.       Relevance of Objectives (rating - PDO 1: Substantial/PDO2: Substantial). The
Project’s objectives before and after restructuring were responding to the health sector
challenges and identified government priorities. The implementation of a transformed
health financing, delivery and regulatory framework is still a key element of achieving the
National Health Sector Program goals. The Program reform, which the Project supported,
was instrumental in achieving universal health coverage to enhance equity substantia lly
and lead to quantifiable and beneficial effects on all health system goals, including an
improved level and distribution of health outcomes, enhanced fairness in financing and
better financial protection, and increased user satisfaction. 16 The objectives are also in line
with the higher level objectives of the GoT (Ninth and Tenth Development Plans, and the
MoH’s medium-term strategic plans), and of the Bank’s CPSs. 17 The Project’s support to
strengthen preventive and primary care through scaling-up the family medicine program is
still relevant today as family medicine system is in its early stages in Turkey and needs
further improvements to become more effective and fully settled. Support to preventive
care for the control of NCDs is also particularly relevant today as the disease burden of
NCDs has become prominent and will continue to be substantial in the medium and long
term. Original PDO on increasing the effectiveness of the MoH and SSI in formulating and
implementing reforms in provider payments and health systems performance is relevant
since provider payment systems and health system performance are not one-time- only
agenda items and are subject to continuous improvement.

37. Relevance of Design and Implementation (rating - PDO 1: Substantial/PDO2:
Modest). the results chain under the original project had a sound underlying logic overall
where the Project components were reasonably expected to conclude in a number of critical
outputs (or intermediate outcomes): such as scaled-up family medicine program, piloted
Public Hospital Union model, developed pay-for-performance (P4P) system to control
health providers with the objective of ensuring increased utilization of primary health care,
and increased client satisfaction of health services. The results chain revised with the first
Level 2 and Level 1 restructurings, on the other hand, focused only on the PDO indicators
that were about service delivery, though the restructured Project was mainly about
stewardship and governance. The original PDO indicators on patient satisfaction, selected
NCD prevalence, coverage, behavior change and strategic purchasing were complementing
each other from a health system performance perspective. When components B and C were
dropped or discontinued, the integrity of the preliminary design was affected.

38. Institutional and implementation arrangements at the entry were appropriate. First, at
the operational level and with regards to the Project management itself, the decision to use
existing MoH technical implementing units reduced significantly the need for additiona l
consultants and management capacity. Second, the project envisaged the assessment of
progress and achievements of the project each year in line with the MoH’s annual
implementation and procurement plans. And third, periodical audit arrangements intended
for Component B, for family physicians’ reporting on NCD related activities, were
beneficial to ensure continuity and quality of follow up of these interventions. However,
the design after Level 1 restructuring failed to build an efficient M&E framework on NCD
related activities.

39. The interventions mostly comprised of the capacity building efforts and they were
relevant to support the reform elements of the Program rather than attaining Project
objectives. Capacity building efforts under component A focused particularly on health
system stewardship, primary health care strengthening, health information system and
NCDs in particular. Interventions designed under component B were relevant as they
intended to introduce, through pilots, the output-based payment model for the preventions
and control of targeted NCDs and to assess the effects of the model on health outcomes
related with the targeted NCDs. Component C capacity building efforts focused mainly on
strategic purchasing which is an important element of UHC deepening/sustainability.
When Component B and C were dropped/discontinued the interventions under the project
failed to serve the puposes of PDO indicators in general.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

40. Efficacy (rating - PDO 1: Modest/PDO2: Modest) is rated Modest under origina l
Project and Level 1 restructuring. This rating is based on the analyses of the
accomplishment of project PDO indicators and intermediate outcome indicators as well as
the contribution of project activities to the achievement of the PDOs. Two PDO indicators
were achieved and one partially achieved out of the six original PDO indicators at the time
of the Level 1 restructuring. Only one PDO indicator out of four was achieved at the time
of Project closing according to administrative and survey data (Statistical Yearbooks) from
the MoH, and the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK)’s Life Satisfaction Surveys. See
Annex 10 for details.

PDO achievements before restructuring

41. Achievements of PDO 1: increase the effectiveness of the SSI and the MoH in
formulating and implementing reforms in provider payments and health systems
performance. At the time of restructuring the project was on track to successful
achievement of the two key outcome indicators’ then-targets, associated with this project
objective. Therefore PDO was substantial . Annex 11 includes the details on indicators.

42. The utilization of primary health care increased. Indicator target partially achieved.
With increased access to family medicine providers, utilization of primary care services
increased to 3.3 outpatient visits per capita in 2011 compared with 2.1 in 2008. Though the

                                            14
utilization rate started falling in 2012 (3.1 outpatient visits per capita), the target was on
track at the time of restructuring.

43. The percentage of first-time visits to specialists that are referred by family medicine
practices increased. Indicator target achieved. The target of 1.5 was met in 2010 as
reported by the MoH based on the HMIS data.

44. Client satisfaction with health services increased. Indicator target achieved its then-
target at the time of restructuring. The target of 70 percent was met in 2012, as the patient
satisfaction with health care services increased from 63.4 percent in 2008 (baseline) to 89.8
percent.

45. SSI expenditures on pharmaceuticals and outpatient health care decreased. The
indicator was neither achieved nor shown progress. Though the rate was declining in 2011
(38.7 percent), the expenditures on pharmaceuticals and outpatient health care reached 41.8
percent at the time of the restructuring, which was even higher than the baseline figure
(38.7 percent)

46. Achievements of PDO 2: Piloting output-based financing for non-communica ble
diseases (NCD) prevention and control. Output-based financing component of the
Project was never launched and was subsequently dropped with the Level 1 restructur ing
as the government decided to implement the OBF nationwide under its own funding. At
the time of the restructuring, there was no activity related with the following related key
indicators: (i) smoking prevalence among 18-29 age group in OBF pilot provinces
decreases more relative to non-pilot provinces; and (ii) high blood pressure in population
in OBF pilot provinces decreases more as compared to non-pilot provinces. Therefore, the
ICR team rates progress towards these indicators as negligible. Information on the current
status of smoking and hypertension prevalence is presented in Annex 10.

PDO achievements after Level 1 restructuring of January 2014

47. Achievements of the revised PDO: Increase the effectiveness of the MoH in
formulating and implementing reforms in provider payments and health systems
performance. With project support, the family medicine (FM) model has been an
important reform implemented by the government in the health sector, aiming at increasing
access to health services and making the sector ready to deal in a cost effective manner
with core health issues (such as growing burden of NCD). The project led to the successful
achievement of one key outcome indicator associated with this project objective, but well
ahead of the restructuring (Reorganization of the MoH with exclusive focus on health
sector stewardship function).

48. Per capita annual visits to family medicine physicians and Share of family medicine
visits in total visits: Indicator targets not achieved. These two indicators related to family
medicine scheme and its utilization were not met. This could be attributed to inadequate
increase on the supply side, which could not keep up with the increase from the general
demand for care.

                                             15
49. Human resources in health, both in terms of family physicians and family medicine
staff (specifically nurses and midwives), were insufficient. Since 2013, there has not been
a significant increase in the number of family physicians which also exacerbated the ever
increasing workload of family medicine. Number of registered patients to each family
physician was high when compared to international standards 18 . High volume of patients
reduces the time allocated to each patient thus narrowing the scope of a thorough
examination. High workload of family physicians could also be considered among the main
reasons for reduced patient satisfaction with regards to family medicine leading to a
reduction in per capita visits to family physicians.

50. Additionally high workload of family physicians does not allow implementing a
formal/mandatory referral system, which was piloted during the early phases of the
Program, but did not work due to this high workload. The public has not yet reached an
adequate level of awareness about the crucial role family medicine as most of the patients
see family medicine centers as a place to go for prescription or obtain referrals for hospital
care. TUIK’s 2014 Life Satisfaction Survey clearly highlights the tendency of population
for provider choice at higher levels of care rather than the primary level: Irrespective of
having a social insurance, patients prefer public hospitals as the first contact point of health
care; Almost half of the population with social insurance and around two thirds of those
without social insurance seek care from public hospitals. Only around one third of both
groups seek care at primary level, through family medicine centers (Figure 4 in Annex 10).
Survey findings suggest that more patients prefer public hospitals than family medicine
centers since: (1) they are more satisfied with services provided in public hospitals; (2)
visiting public hospitals is a necessity for them and (3) co-payments are low. Close location
of the family medicine centers is the only factor which affects the provider choice towards
family medicine (Figure 5 in Annex 10).

51. Client Satisfaction with health services: Indicator targets not achieved. The rate
concerning client satisfaction with health services was not met and presented a decreasing
trend since 2011. TUIK's Life Satisfaction Survey of 2014 19 indicated the main problems
in the health service provision as perceived by the patients are: (1) the existence of co-
payments for medical examinations (60.9 percent of the population); (2) the existence of
medical test and laboratory fees (53.6 percent of the population); (3) insufficient number
of physicians and health personnel (51.1 percent of the population); (4) medicine prices
(48.7 percent of the population); and (5) waiting time for medical examination and medical
tests (35.3 percent of the population).

52. Ministry of Health reorganized and focuses exclusively on the health sector
stewardship function: Indicator target achieved. The PDO indicator concerning the
stewardship function of the MoH was met with the approval of the Decree Law on the

The establishment of the PHeI, the PHoI and the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices

Decree Law. The Cancer Institute is expected to be established under the newly established
Turkish Institutes of Health Sciences 21 (TUSEB) which aims to promote research and
development on health sciences and technology.

General discussion on the achievement of project development objectives

53.      With the restructuring and cancellation of the two components and with the revision
of the PDO, the project concentrated on component A. In line with the revised PDO of
increasing the effectiveness of the MoH in formulating and implementing reforms in
provider payments and health systems performance, component A focused on supporting
MoH for health system performance improvement . To this end, project activities
addressed different dimensions (functions) of the health system (stewardship, resource
generation, service delivery-utilization and financing), which in themselves, produced
dimensional/functional results contributing to the overall system performance. Annex 2
and Annex 11 (1) elaborate project’s inputs-activities and outputs/outcomes and (2)
provide a visual mapping of these activities with the health system dimensions. 22 Though,
the interventions under the project provided timely resources, flexibility, and mobility to
the MoH to attain Program higher objectives, this success could not be rightly/fa ir ly
reflected to the Project rating. As a result, the project rating was adversely affected despite
the full achievement of IOIs and significant attainments made throughout the reform such
as the success on the areas of MCH and ANC.

54.      A broader health system level observation reveals that increased health sector
spending is a major driver of the achievements: TURKSTAT data suggests that health
expenditure as % of GDP increased from 4.8% in 1999 to as high as 6.1% in 2008. Figures
for the last few years are around 5.3%. The achievements for the ante natal care (ANC)
and mother and child healthcare (MCH) services are worthy of note. In fact, ANC and
MCH care constituted an important strategic priority for Turkish health system and had
direct relevance with the project’s role in expanding family medicine. Improvements on
these areas are not only limited with improved historical trends, results also highlight
improved equity among east and west (thus improved regional and socio-economic status
equity).

55.      Health Outcomes: According to interagency estimates, between 1990 and 2010
Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) was reduced by 70%. Turkey exceeded the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) target set for ¾ MMR reduction. While regional differences do
still exist, they seem to have become less prominent. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) also

   Health system dimensions are represented as Turkish Health System Strategic M ap, which constitute the basis of the
Health System Performance Assessment Study of 2012. Same strategic map is also included in the M oH’s 2013-2017
Strategic Plan.

improved during the Program. MoH Statistical Yearbooks suggest that between 2009 and
2013 IMR decreased by 40% allowing Turkey to also exceed the MDG target for 2/3
reduction in IMR. Sub-national inequalities in IMR have also been reduced.

56.     Coverage: Immunization improved both in terms of coverage and depth. Number
of antigens increased from seven in 2002 to 13 in 2012. Turkish Demographic Health
Surveys suggest that coverage increased both nationwide and on regional level and regional
differences decreased. Ratio between best covered and worst covered regions decreased
from 1.6 in 1993 to 1.1 in 2013.

57.     Coverage and regional equity for ANC also improved. Between 1993 and 2013
the share of women having at least one ANC visit to a health care provider increased by
35.8%. Interregional differences have also declined as the ratio between the best and worst
covered regions for ANC visits decreased from 2.61 to 1.06. Annex 3 provides a more
detailed analysis on the achievements for MCH and ANC.

3.3 Efficiency

58. Efficiency (rating - PDO 1: Substantial/PDO2: Substantial) is rated Substantial under
the original Project and Level 1 restructuring.

59. Design efficiency. The Project supported the strengthening of preventive and primary
health care through scaling up family medicine program and implementing preventive care.
This way, the Project aspired to contribute to improving efficiency, especially when
addressing NCDs, through: (1) reducing the work load on secondary care provision; (2)
increasing access to care; (3) producing better health outcomes in the longer run; and (4)
allowing for more cost effective interventions (in many countries preventive NCD
interventions are significantly cost effective than clinical treatment of such conditions).

60. Implementation efficiency. With regards to the interventions and Project related
activities, the hospital management reform, the unification of the health insurance schemes,
the family medicine program, as well as the restructuring of the MoH function to
stewardship all contribute to increasing efficiency in the health sector.

61. Cost Effectiveness. As per justification in the original PAD, the economic analysis for
the Project consists of an evaluation of the Program from a public finance angle. However,
a traditional economic analysis with rates of return analysis has not been attempted.
Additionally, as the Project is the second phase of the original APL, there is no economic
analysis providing quantitative estimates of the economic rate of return based on a cost-
benefit analysis. In this respect the discussion on the economic impacts of overall health
reform interventions supported by the Project are based on the criteria of Musgrove
framework for public sector involvement in the health sector as presented in the PAD and
on the evidence from the literature. A broader discussion is presented in Annex 3.




                                            18
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

62. The project’s overall outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory. Table 1 below
presents a summary of detailed ratings in order to arrive at an overall rating of outcome for
the original and revised PDO. While relevance and efficiency criteria were substantia l,
efficacy was modest under the original Project and after the Level 1 restructuring. The
overall rating reflects significant shortcomings in the operation’s achievement of its
objectives as explained under section 3.2 above. The weight represents percentage of loan
disbursed over the total loan amount of 65 percent at the time of the Level 1 restructur ing
(Table 2).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63. Scaling up of family medicine increased access and quality of care in poorer and more
rural areas implying improved equity. As has been elaborated in Annex 10, performance-
based activities of family physicians on MCH and ante-natal care (ANC) led to highly
positive health outcomes for women and children.




                                             19
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64. Several of the Project’s components positively contributed to MoH’s strengthe ning
where involved units used Project resources to bring international experience and
knowledge to build institutional capacity for the continuing reforms. Among those efforts,
the General Directorate of Health Research (GDHR) promoted in-depth research for health
system which would provide valuable and critical input for evidence-based decision and
policy making. The GDHIS established and maintain critical capacity to further develop
the MoH’s information systems. All the implementing units related with preventive and
primary care were moved under the PHeI. The PHoI assumed the service provision
responsibility. International expertise was also instrumental in supporting public hospitals
in their effort to improve and measure quality of care.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

65. No unintended outcomes or impacts have been observed.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

66. Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

67. The ICR team rates the risk that project development outcomes will not be mainta ined
as Moderate. Key reforms are currently preserved in a solid legal framework by law and
in the GoT’s strategic planning (10th Development Plan, the MoH Strategic Plan), and
therefore unlikely to be reversed.

68. The Project mainly funded capacity building, training and institutional strengthe ning
within the MoH and closely involved stakeholders such as family physicians. Since the
MoH staff and family physicians are direct beneficiaries of the Project capacity building
efforts, medium to long term effects are considered sustainable.

69. The declining trends of patient satisfaction can be considered as early indication for
further fine tuning and planning within the health system. Increasing workload and scope
of family physicians despite stagnating pay structures, disproportionate rights of patients
and physicians in favor of the former, lack of formal mandatory referral system in the
absence of sufficient health workforce at the primary care level are among the main areas
that need to be addressed. While the primary care/family medicine service delivery model
has been successfully scaled up nation-wide, a shift towards public/private partnership
through inpatient based service organization and delivery model in large urban settings is
likely to undermine the further progress in maintaining and safeguarding hierarchy across
levels of healthcare.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

70. Main Strengths. The main strengths in ensuring quality at entry were (i) extensive
background work and analysis; (ii) the APL design that supported Turkey’s health system
reform; and (iii) a clear rationale for Bank’s involvement. Planned interventions were
poverty focused and gender-sensitive. The Project focused on improving the coverage and
accessibility of health services in favor of the poor population and emphasizing the health
and well-being of women and their children. Preparation activities included the assessment
of fiduciary-related risks, the articulation of a sound set of actions and other measures to
reduce these risks and the establishment of structures within the implementing units for
assuming the full range of fiduciary responsibilities. A Quality Enhancement Review
(QER) conducted on November 13, 2008 made recommendations that were incorporated
into the Project design: (1) definition of the PDO to clearly distinguish between the
government’s Program and the objectives of the Project; (2) reduction in the number of
indicators to the most critical ones from a preliminary long-list; (3) inclusion of
performance indicators to reflect the Project goal of cost containment for financ ia l
sustainability; and (4) inclusion of an explicit objective of strengthening Turkey’s capacity
to measure and use health metrics in decision making as reflected in two IOIs linked to
components A and C.

71. Shortcomings: There was a certain degree of disconnect between the PDO,
components and the activities which became more noticeable after the restructuring of the
PDO and elimination of some of its indicators. The primary development objective of the
Project was strengthening the stewardship function of the MOH, yet the components,
activities and most of the indicators were about service delivery function. The activities
envisaged within the scope of the Project were only indirectly linked to the expected
outcomes of the results framework, especially after restructuring. While the definition of
each sub-component was detailed and had a connection with the results, the activities
planned under the Project did not have direct effects on the outcomes. Though data
collection instruments were selected carefully, and responsible units for data collectio n
were defined prudently, the M&E design had few shortcomings during the preparatory
phases (See Section 2.3). Risk assessment and risk mitigation plans were sound overall,
with the exception of the legal risks related to Component B. The legal changes were only
approved in November 2011 (a delay of almost two years).

b. Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory




                                             21
72. Bank’s performance       during    Project    implementation    is   rated   Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

73. The Bank teams engaged with the MoH and SSI on a wide variety of health and social
security policy and technical issues at all stages of the Project, and provided technical
support. Three Bank staff assumed TTL responsibility during Project implementation with
handover missions. Though the supervision activities were performed regularly, and Aide-
memoires and ISRs were prepared periodically, the Bank teams could not effectively rate
the performance of implementing units. Although the Bank teams provided timely and
precise support to the implementing units in an environment where the decision making
processes of the MoH and SSI were slowed down due to organizational restructuring and
frequent changes in managerial levels, the Bank teams did not note the badly performing
PDO indicators and did not make timely changes on the DO ratings. This was critical as
the restructuring failed to adjust the results framework with the project activities.

74. Some shortcomings on M&E supervision are noted after the Project restructuring. As
there was inconsistent reporting on indicators, the Bank team wanted to work directly with
the implementing units to collect most recent and relevant information on expected
outcomes and to regularly report on outcome indicators, but could not succeed in doing so.
Instead, the Bank team continued working closely with the PMSU in line with the
communication protocol agreed with the MoH. As a result, the flow of information as
reflected in ISRs post-restructuring was broken. After restructuring, the Bank overlooked
to ensure/supervise consistency on indicator-related content in the ISRs. Indicators which
were dropped at restructuring continued to appear in the ISRs system rather than being
deleted or simply notified as dropped. This created some level of confusion for the ICR
team while reviewing the ISRs.

c. Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

75. The overall Bank performance is judged to be Moderately Unsatisfactory on the basis
of a rating of moderately satisfactory for quality at entry and moderately unsatisfactory for
supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance

a. Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76. With regards to the institutional framework, the GoT had extensive experience in
dealing with the World Bank, including under the framework of Project lending. The
Government provided a strong enabling environment, especially politically, as several
important legislations were passed such as the MoH Restructuring Decree Law, and
relevant regulations for the establishment of affiliated institutions of the MoH (includ ing
the PHeI, and PHoI). The performance of the Treasury (Borrower) and the Ministry of
Development (MoD) – in charge of the development plans and annual programs - were

                                             22
notable in providing timely support and guidance to the Project and overall program
management. However, the planned high level Inter-Agency Steering Committee (IASC)
with representatives of the Treasury, MoD, 23 MoH and SSI to provide inter-agenc y
coordination, oversight and policy guidance for overall implementation of the Project, the
IASC was never functional.

b. Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

77. The performance of the MoH and the SSI is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Overall,
the MoH’s commitment to the health reform and ownership of the Project remained high
throughout the life of the Project even though there were pitfalls related to MoH’s
reorganization, restructuring of the Project, and the changes in upper management –
including the Minister. The SSI has also continued strengthening its institutional capacity.
However, due to changing decisions of the implementing agencies on major issues, the
restructuring process took almost two years. Additionally, the delays in decision making
had resulted in negative consequences in implementation, and not full disbursement of the
loan proceeds. While the role of the Bank in sharing knowledge and policy advice was
generally recognized in some areas, the implementing agencies could not establish a direct
link between the reforms and the Project as well.

c. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

78. Given the challenges presented above, the overall borrower performance is rated as
moderately unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

79. Providing a broad support to the strategic plan development and implementa tio n
through disintegrated micro activities creates problems in monitoring and evaluating
progress on the main objectives of the Project. Project activities should be interdepende nt
with each other to mutually reinforce each other’s contribution towards the broader
development objective rather than leading to discrete results –even though they support a
part of the broader Strategic Plan.

80. Capacity building and technical assistance by bringing in international expertise and
knowledge is appreciated by the borrower who also realizes the importance of using robust
approaches in health system reforms and improvements. It would be of high value added
for Projects supporting sector reforms to introduce a well-focused and customized
approach to bring in international expertise and knowledge. Striking examples such as the
following good practices supported by the project are (1) providing training programs and

                                                           23
consultancy for Public Hospitals and PHC system to increase the quality of care; (2)
providing advisory activities for research framework and priority agenda to set the
direction for the continuing reforms and to evaluate the achievements of Program; and (3)
developing in-house capacity in the General Directorate of Health Investments in legal,
financial, operational, and structural aspects of contract management of PPP investments.

81. Proper risk assessment of possible uncertainties likely to emerge during
implementation and having a flexible design allowing to mitigate such risks is a necessity.
There should be an in-depth exploration of the legislative background for any Project
component/element as well. Component B of the Project suffered from the uncertainties
concerning the legislation. While the risk analysis in the PAD included a discussion on the
likelihood of different scenarios, there was no discussion on a scenario that no legisla tive
arrangements take place to allow the effective start of the component, and how to address
it. A detailed analysis of the legislation (or the lack of legislation) could have revealed
potential obstacles for proper implementation. This would then necessitate a more detailed
risk analysis considering a number of scenarios, including the worst case one.

82. In order to minimize or avoid delays and challenges in Project implementation, both
the Bank and the MoH can think of effective means and mechanisms to try to retain critical
human resources to the extent possible (civil servants and the consultants) within the MoH
Project Management Unit. Development of handover arrangements and training would also
help ensuring a smooth transition. In the long term, these are also important for institutio na l
memory. Frequent loss and high turnover of such human capacity caused many delays and
created challenges throughout the Project, especially in the areas of project manageme nt,
financial management and procurement.

83. Throughout all phases of the project (with or without restructuring) design, monitor ing
and supervision of the results framework necessitates close, regular and timely attention
by the Bank to make sure that the project objectives and PDO indicators are in line and
consistent to reflect the outcomes of the project. Failure to overlook any gaps between
project development objectives and key indicators might result in unrealistic outcome
ratings as it was the case for this project. Considering the success of the Program, the
Project could have got a higher rating if the M&E activities could focus on PDO indicators
that were more correlated with the substance of the Program.

84. For projects supporting broader reforms, failure to timely monitor and to detect the
possible deterioration on the reform trends might lead to misinterpret the outcomes in the
medium and long run and to misread the sustainability. In the case of this project and for
the family medicine system in particular, decreased patient satisfaction as well as decreased
utilization can be the early warnings on reforms changing direction. Such changes in the
reform focus risk losing the achievements acquired and they threaten the sustainability of
the reforms.

 A     Support for MOH’s Strategic Plan for 2010-2014: The objective of this component was to build the capacity of the MOH to become an effective steward
       of the health sector and complete service delivery reforms. The component financed goods, technical assistance, services and training required for eight
       out of ten programs of the MOH’s Strategic Plan for the Health Sector for 2010-14.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

No formal economic and financial analysis was included in the PAD. No net present value
(NPV), economic rate of return, cost effectiveness, or cost-benefit analysis was calculated,
and thus no baseline is available for comparison. As with most health reform Projects, no
formal economic and financial analysis is conducted here because of the difficulties in
attribution to a policy-oriented Project. Instead of a traditional economic analysis, this
section elaborates the outcomes of the health reform from a public finance angle, according
to Musgrove’s three criteria and provides an overview of impact of improved health
outcomes on economic growth from the literature.

Musgrove framework for public sector involvement in the health sector

State intervention in the health care markets is justified on the basis of (1) optimal
production of public goods (2) subsidization of poor population who cannot afford the
health insurance or the inexpensive health care that the non-poor can finance out-of-pocket
and (3) correction or offset of failures in the health insurance markets. Overall, meeting
those criteria contributes to the health system performance results as (1) good health
outcomes (2) cost control (3) patient and provider satisfaction and (4) medical and financ ia l
equity. State-based health interventions create a significant share of the impact of health
spending on health improvements thus forming the basis for public health expenditure to
be somewhat more effective than private expenditure for improved health. The Project’s
PAD takes reference of three criteria of Musgrove framework:

Criteria 1: Public goods specifically apply for the implementation of family medicine and
its scope on MCH activities which are highly relevant from a public health implementa tio n
and disease control perspective of health public goods. In terms of results, immuniza tio n
and ANC efforts helped to improve maternal and child health outcomes (infant mortality
rates and maternal mortality ratio (MMR)). Additionally, regulation updates and
developments, implementation of mandates, provision of information and health research
can be considered as other important public goods produced within the scope of Program.

Significant improvements have been observed for Mother and Child related health
outcomes where maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and infant mortality rates (IMR) are
largely reduced. According to interagency estimates, MMR is reduced from 67 deaths per
100,000 live births in 1990 to 20 deaths in 2010 per 100.000 live births (Figure 1). MoH’s
2013 statistical yearbook suggests MMR as 15.9 per 100.000 live births. 25 Turkey
exceeded the MDG for MMR target set for ¾ MMR reduction. Regional differences do
still exist, however, they seem to be less prominent. MMR improved in the all regions with
the exceptions of West and Central Anatolia. Program period was also successful to

significantly reduce MMR in some less developed regions (North East Anatolia and East
Black Sea) (Figure 2, MoH Statistical yearbooks).
Figure 1                                                               Figure 2 26




Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) also improved during Program. MoH Statistical Yearbooks
suggest that IMR decreased by 40% from 13.1 per 1.000 live births in 2009 to 7.8 per 1.000
live births in 2013 (Figure 3) allowing Turkey to also exceed the MDG target for 2/3
reduction in IMR.. Sub-national inequalities in IMR have become less prominent, however,
the gap between the best and worst performing regions is still almost twice as much (Figure
4).

Figure 3                                                             Figure 4




Turkish Demographic Health Surveys also suggest remarkable improvements for infant
mortality. The decade prior to the Program shows improvement in the mortality ratios, but
the decrease for all infant mortalities was higher during Program period (Figures 5 and 6).
Regional results also suggest improvement both in terms of overall decline and reduced
gaps among regions (Figures 7 and 8).

Criteria 2: Poverty and equity: Equity in terms of access to health care improved during
Program. Considering access to maternal and child health services is a good proxy for
access to basic health care services., One can conclude that the access to basic health care
significantly improved especially through the performance based incentives on mother and
child health activities within the scope of family medicine scheme. Differences between
east and west with large socioeconomic disparities have been largely reduced mainly for

   The NUTS classification (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) is a system used by EU to divide the economic
territory for the purpose of the collection, development and harmonization of statistics and to make socio-economic
analyses of the regions. NUTS1 is a classification for major socio-economic regions under which Turkey has 12 regions.

Surveys highlight the improvements in mother and child health efforts (one of the highest
priority areas of the Program):

Immunization uptake improved both in terms of coverage and depth. Number of antigens
increased from seven in 2002 (BCG, combined diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus, oral polio,
measles, and hepatitis B) to 13 in 2012 (with the addition of Haemophilus influenzae type
B, rubella, mumps, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, varicella, and hepatitis A). Figures 9
and 10 below show the increased coverage for measles immunization nationwide and on
regional level. Increase in coverage also came with increased equity where striking regional
differences decreased. On the regional level, highest coverage was 93 percent and lowest
coverage was 58 percent in 1993. By 2013, highest coverage for regions reached to 97
percent and lowest coverage rose to 88 percent (Figure 10).

Figure 9                                     Figure 10




Coverage and regional equity for ANC also improved. While the share of women having
at least one ANC visit to a health care provider was 62.3 percent in 1993 nationwide, this
figure rose to 97 percent in 2013 (Figure 11). Equity improvement was substantial too: In

                                            34
1993 on the regional level, highest coverage was 86 percent and lowest coverage was 33
percent. By 2013, highest coverage for regions reached to 99 percent and lowest coverage
rose to 93 percent (Figure 12).

Figure 11                                      Figure 12




Similarly, share of deliveries at a health facility and deliveries attended by skilled health
personnel increased nationwide (Figure 13) and in all regions implying accelerated equity
improvement: In 1993 on the regional level, share of delivery at a health facility was 80
percent for the highest region and lowest figure was 30 percent. In 2008, highest coverage
was 98.3 percent and lowest coverage was 72.3 percent. By 2013, highest regional
coverage reached to 99.8 percent and lowest figure rose to 91.7 percent (Figure 14).

Figure 13                               Figure 14




Criteria 3: Failings peculiar to insurance markets for health (efficiency and equity):
Unification of insurance schemes increased breadth and depth of insurance coverage for
the overall population but the increase for lower income population was more significa nt:
Increase in obligatory insurance coverage was prominent for the first three poorest
expenditure deciles (Figure 15). Content of the benefits package evolved with Program.
The breadth of the insurance coverage increased for the overall population but the increase
for lower income population was more significant; increase in obligatory insurance
coverage was significant for the poorest expenditure deciles. For the out-of-pocket
expenditures, percentage of individuals whose health care cost exceeds different thresholds
of their total non-food expenditures decreased significantly during Program period.
Impoverishment effects of out-of-pocket payments have also been reduced. 27

(i) For 15 percent budget threshold the decrease (percent change) between 2003 and 2011
is 42 percent, (ii) for 25 percent budget threshold percent change is 45.5 percent and (iii)
for 40 percent budget threshold percent change is 66.7 percent (Figure 16).

Impact of improved health outcomes on economic growth: An overview from the
literature
A recent study by Amiria et al (2013) 29 indicates that the improvements in the health
outcome indicators concerning mother and child health have an effect on GDP growth and
that the causal effect of maternal and child mortality on GDP is generally stronger in high-
income countries and upper middle-income countries. Considering the fact that Turkey is
an upper middle income country and has witnessed significant improvements on MCH
health outcomes (especially during the Program through the performance based approaches
adopted within the family medicine scheme), one might conclude that these improved
health outcomes positively affected the GDP growth. Same study presents efficiency rates
calculated for each country using data envelopment analysis (DEA) in a Barro framework
where the efficiency rate for any given country demonstrates the magnitude of the impact
of MCH outcomes on GDP. For Turkey, the efficiency rate is given as 80.8 percent for the
period 2001-2010. The interpretation of this efficiency rate is that if under-five mortality
rate is reduced by 1percent, and the average GDP increase for this period is 4.28 percent, 30
then GDP in Turkey would increase by 3.46 percent (0.808*4.28 percent). Another study

larger in developing countries than in developed ones.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Comments by the Undersecretariat of Treasury (Borrower) on the ICR

1. Project Restructurings:

The Borrower notes the several restructurings the project has gone through and would
therefore like to underline the importance of accurately calibrating the demand and supply
sides of the project. The goodness of fit between project activities and project objectives
should have been more strongly established in order to avoid delays and complicatio ns
during implementation.

The borrower notes that several indicators remain unachieved after restructuring. Several
original project indicators were dropped after restructuring due to difficulties in data
collection and disaggregation (page iii, indicator 1, indicator 2). The Borrower therefore,
opines that a forward looking and realistic analysis of the capacity of the implementing
entity, in particular in data collection, should be conducted during the selection of PDO
indicators.

2. Closing Date Extensions:

Similarly, revisions in the project closing date suggest that project design must be carefully
crafted during preparation stage, reflecting realistic expectations from implementing
agencies, in line with their respective capacities. Also, the Borrower notes that the closing
date of the project was further extended in order to preserve “critical fiduciary as well as
operational capacity and institutional capacity until the expected effectiveness of the new
Health System Strengthening and Support Project”. Taking this opportunity, the Borrower
would like to highlight the importance of locking in capacity building in a sustainable way
in MoH as opposed to temporary and ad-hoc solutions to capacity challenges as they arise.

3. Supervision of Projects:

While the legislation to implement the Output Based Financing pilot for component B has
taken more time than foreseen (paragraph 23), better communication with relevant
institutions, in order to reassess client demands, is imperative for making timely
interventions in order to prevent a larger scale project derailing at a later stage.

In that respect, project supervision by the Bank must be strengthened. To support the
Borrower in taking timely action on the issues accentuated in successive aide-mémoires,
the Bank and the Borrower should also explore solutions on the senior management level.
The disbursement profile of the project can be raised through improved performance of the
implementing entities and close monitoring and supervision of that performance by the
Bank. Thereby, additional financial costs for the Borrower can be avoided within the scope
of the project. These points are particularly salient in connection with the satisfactor y

Health Transition Project Phase 1 and 2, and then it has changed and made an important
progress in health system through PSRHS, and this change has assumed a structural
identity through Decree Law No. 663, which is based on four primary justifications. Turkey
has realized critical improvements in service supply and demand thanks to a great health
reform namely Health Transition Project (HTP) over the past decade. These improveme nts
have reflected positively on health outcomes, trends in health financing and utilization of
health services. This Project has bolstered the sustainability of all these positive
developments and achievements. In addition; it facilitated the increase of employme nt,
improvements of public services, achievement of objectives included in MoH 2013-2017
Strategic Plan, development and implementation of policies and programs set in the field
of health.
The performance of Project Management capacity built within the Ministry was mainta ined
by being supported with trainings and human resources under this project. In the next
period; the present situation, which was realized by revealing the benefits of this systems
and placing the project management culture within the organization systematically, will be
carried to higher levels.

Other achievements of the project are as follows:

Presidency, Mother and Child Health, Tuberculosis Control, Malaria Control, Cancer
Control Units" were incorporated and Public Health Institution of Turkey was established
when the Decree Law on the Organization and Duties of Ministry of Health and its



                                             48
Affiliates No. 663 was published on the Official Gazette numbered 28103 (bis) and dated
02.11.2011.
• Cancer Institute was established under the roof of Turkish Institutes of Health Sciences.
• Thanks to the daily trainings given to 40.000 persons on Project Management, a project
management and project planning infrastructure was built within MoH. Standard
documents on project management were prepared, and project preparation standards and
methods were determined during the preparation process of the project.
• A capacity (workforce, equipment) was built within the MoH to reach the objectives
set under the Project.
• Highly skilled human resources that cannot be recruited from the public resources were
employed as "consultants" and thus the Ministry's performance was enhanced.
• A capacity was built in order to measure, evaluate and improve the performance of
health system.
• National and international standards on health have started to be developed.
• Measures were taken to ensure the sustainability of reforms realized under the Project.

3. Lessons Learned

Fundamental changes taken place in the organizational structure of the Ministry of Health
during the preparation process of the project and incorporation of General Directorate of
Primary Health Care, Refik Saydam Hygiene Center Presidency, Mother and Child Health,
Tuberculosis Control, Malaria Control, Cancer Control Units within the Public Health
Institution of Turkey and the new structure emerged as a result of these changes resulted
in serious problems in terms of management and execution of the project. These problems
also had a substantial impact on coordination works. The subtitles of the new project and
the new executives were defined within the context of reorganization, and all stages were
expressed to the units, which did not take part in the process earlier, from the very
beginning. Subsequent involvement of implementing units in the project phase resulted in
difficulties in execution and management stages of the project at times. Problems
encountered during the implementation of Project had also determined the potential
development opportunities. Efficient maintenance of the coordination process is important
in terms of getting the expected results from the projects.

Comments by the Social Security Institution on the ICR

1. Background

The agreement for "Health Transformation and Social Security Reform Project" to be
carried out by the Ministry of Health and the Presidency of the Social Security Institutio n
(SSI) was signed on 30 June 2009 between the Republic of Turkey and the Internatio na l
Bank of Reconstruction and Development. €56.10 million was allocated for the Project that

                                              49
was to be carried out by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Social Security Institutio n
(SSI). €3.090 million of said allocation was set aside for use in funding the activities carried
out by the Social Security Institution.

The loan granted to SSI was allocated for realization of the actions included under
Component C of the “HTSSRP Loan Agreement”. In the original version of the loan
agreement, Component C titled “Capacity Building of the SSI” reads as follows:
    • C.1. Provision of technical assistance and training for SSI, with the objective of
    enhancing SSI’s capacity for the implementation of universal health insurance, in the
    following areas: (a) implementation and promotion of universal health insurance
    regulations, health provider contract management, invoice control, benefits package,
    monitoring and evaluation; and (b) expenditure management in SSI, includ ing
    expenditure tracking and reporting and strengthening of relevant expenditure
    databases, supporting the Reimbursement Commission of SSI in improving their
    capacity to make payment decision based on available evidence-based criteria.
    • C.2. Provision of support to the SSI’s Project Implementation Unit for effective
    Project management.

In this framework, no loan portions were disbursed for any of the activities in 2009. During
the 2010-2012 activity periods of the project, activities carried out were funded under the
budget lines for consultancy services, training and project overheads.

In SSI's request filed with the Undersecretariat of Treasury on 31/01/2011, it was stated
that a significant portion of the granted loan could not be used due to high operational costs
and since the need for consultancy and training services, which constitute the loan
components, has already been met, and it was requested that the loan be cancelled after
setting aside an appropriate amount for the "Activity to Develop Asynchronous Training
Monitors to Enable On-line Delivery of SSI Trainings" along with €220,559.76
corresponding to one-year remuneration for the Training consultant.

However, it was later decided that the loan be utilized by the Directorate General of
Universal Health Insurance in order for the realization of the actions included under
Component C of the "HTSSRP Loan Agreement", which the Undersecretariat of Treasury
had been requested to cancel; hence, the Undersecretariat of Treasury was asked to
disregard our letter dated 26/12/2011 and numbered 23509416 on the cancellation of the
loan.
With the amendment made in the Loan Agreement, Component C of the Project was
redefined as follows:
    • Provision of technical assistance and training for building the capacity of the SSI:
    Establishment of a distance learning system for universal health insurance applicatio ns.
    • Provision of support to the SSI Project Implementation Unit for effective project
    management including the financing of operational costs.
    • This sub-component will finance the Project Coordination Unit for effective
    management of the project.




                                              50
In line with the objective of said component, for the purpose of providing technical support
and capacity building through better management of the policy and programme decisions
included under the scope of the Universal Health Insurance, the expenditure components
and outputs of the 3 (three) projects of the Directorate General of Universal health
Insurance were sent to the Ministry of Development with our letter dated 16/04/2012 and
numbered 7174484 as required under Footnote 60: "Spending shall be enabled only after
the project expenditure components and outputs are defined and approved by the Ministr y
of Development" in the 2012 Investment Program.

The reply letter of the Ministry of Development stated, in brief, that all the newly proposed
projects cover capacity-building actions and are characteristic training-consulta nc y
projects, that the projects included in the 2012 investment program and the new projects
mostly consist of institutional capacity-building components of the same characteristics,
that the work processes planned within the project scope cannot possibly yield the expected
results fully in the one-year period remaining for project completion, and that the actions
that have significance for the Institution should be enabled by making a revision in the
2012 investment program, consequently informing that spending within the scope of
2009K130150 Health Transformation and Social Security Reform Project was not found
appropriate.

In this context, the Undersecretariat of Treasury was asked to take the necessary actions
for concluding the cancellation transactions for the loan granted to our Institution with the
letter dated 27/07/2012 and numbered 585562.

This annex provides complementary discussion on assessment of project outcomes.

(A) Status of PDO and Intermediate Outcome Indicators Before and After Restructuring

Tables 1 and 2 summarize the PDO indicators and Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs) before and after restructuring and provide
the reasons for revision and cancellation at the time of the March 2013 and January 2014 restructurings. In this section, two restructur ings
changing the PDO indicators and IOIs were considered as one ultimate restructuring. There were 6 original PDO indicators and 13
original IOIs. After restructuring, there were a total of 4 PDO indicators and 9 IOIs. 32

  With the level 1 restructuring on January 7, 2014, 4 IRIs related with Component A, which were added during the first restructuring on M arch 26, 2013, were dropped as they
have already been achieved. However, the restructuring paper noted that these IRIs would be in ICR. Therefore, the Bank teams monitored the progress of the dropped IRIs.

Intermediate Outcome indicators for Component A presented a diverse picture: Out of six IOIs, one was achieved, two were showing
progress and three were subject to revision. IOIs for component B did not materialize since this component never started and was
cancelled. Similarly, IOIs for component C were not measured since activities related with these indicators were not conducted under
the Project (Table 4).

(D) Achievements of PDO indicators

(D) (1) Client Satisfaction with health services: Data from TUIK life satisfaction surveys of 2011 and 2014 show that the perception
of the population on the problem areas of the health care system deteriorated implying that more people think that co-payments, test
fees, number of health care staff, medicine prices, waiting time and medical examination are problematic areas of the health care system.
In addition, perception of the population on the problem areas of the health care system changed for the worse at the family medicine
centers as opposed to public hospitals: percent change in people using family medicine centers and perceiving co-payments, test fees,
number of staff, medicine prices, waiting time and medical examination as a problem is greater than the percent change in people using
public hospitals and perceiving co-payments, test fees, number of staff, medicine prices as a problem in public hospitals. Perception
related to waiting time and medical examination at public hospitals shows as improving (Figure 1).

Figure 1                                                                  Figure 2

Health care utilization data show a clear indication of decline in patient satisfaction as well. Figure 2 shows a decline in per capita visits
at the primary care level since 2011 whereas per capita visits to MoH hospitals had a steady increase. As elaborated in the discussion on
family medicine utilization indicators (visits to family physicians), the decline in patient satisfaction concerning waiting time and
medical examination may be highly related with the insufficient number of family physicians and family medicine staff. High patient
workload is a factor that adversely affects the medical examination time and quality. Supply side increases for primary care are not


                                                                     64
promising either. Figure 3 below suggests that specialization is still the priority choice for medical school graduates and increase in the
number of specialist physicians is higher than the increase in the number of general practitioners during the period 2010-2014.

(D) (2) and (D) (3) Per capita annual visits to family medicine physicians and Share of family medicine visits in total visits

These two utilization indicators were not achieved. Health human resources for family medicine are insufficient and the number of
registered patients to each family physician is high; reducing the time allocated to each patient. This can negatively influence patient
satisfaction and reducing per capita visits for family physicians. Since 2013, there has not been a significant increase in the number of
family physicians (Table 7).

The absence of a mandatory referral system and the fact that the public see family medicine centers as a place to go for prescription or
to obtain referral for hospitals care are other reasons for reduced per capita visits. Almost half of the population with social insurance
and around two thirds of those without social insurance go to public hospitals. Only around one third of both groups seek care at the

primary level, through family medicine centers (Figure 4). Additionally, more patients prefer public hospitals than family medicine
centers for perceived better services, perceived necessity to visit hospitals and low co-payments (Figure 5).

(D) (4) Ministry of Health reorganized and focus exclusively on the health sector stewardship function: The PDO indicator concerning
the stewardship function of the MoH was achieved with the approval of the Decree Law of 2011. The establishment of the PHeI, PHoI,
and PMDA was completed within a year following the enactment of the Decree Law. The Cancer Institute is expected to be established
Turkish Institutes of Health Sciences 34 (TUSEB), which aims to promote research and development in health sciences and technology.

Smoking prevalence baseline and actual data values provided in the last ISR of September 2015 were taken from GATS survey of 2008
and 2012 in Turkey. The smoking prevalence rates take into account the overall population as opposed to 18-29 age group as defined
for the output-based financing component indicator. Global Adult Tobacco Surveys (GATS) of 2008 and 2012 35 suggest a decrease in
the smoking prevalence among adults from 31.2% in 2008 to 27.1% in 2012, representing a 13.1% relative decline. Smoking prevalence
among males decreased from 47.9% in 2008 to 41.5% in 2012 implying a relative decline of 13.4%. Smoking prevalence among females
decreased from 15.2% in 2008 to 13.1% in 2012 implying a relative decline of 13.8%. More recent data from WHO 36 also suggests
decline in the smoking prevalence for both gender; smoking prevalence among males has decreased from 42.7% in 2012 to 39.5% in
2015 implying a relative decline of 7.5%. Smoking prevalence among females has declined from 13.5% in 2012 to 12.4% in 2015
implying a relative decline of 8.1%. Best buy interventions on tobacco control were implemented succesfully by MoH and contributed

to the decrease in the smoking prevalence. The interventions included tax increases, 37 smoke-free indoor workplaces and public places,38
health information and warnings 39 and bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. 40

Hypertension prevalence : Two studies conducted by Turkish Society of Hypertension and Renal Diseases 41 in 2003 and 2012 indicate
a slight decline in hypertension prevalence among the general population from 31.8% to 30.3% implying a change of 4.7%. Decline for
female hypertension prevalence was significant from 36.1% to 32.3% with a relative decline of 10.5%. Male hypertension prevalence
however increased from 27.5% to 28.4% with a relative increase of 3.3%. Same studies indicate an increased awareness among
population for hypertension: from 40% in 2003 to 54.7% in 2012. Antihypertensive drug use among overall population has remarkably
increased during this period, from 31% in 2003 to 47.5% in 2012. To conclude, while the change in the HT prevalence is not very
significant, the significant improvement in population awareness and behavior change as reflected to antihypertensive drug use, might
lead to improved disease burden in the medium term. The preliminary findings for the 2013 Burden of Disease study42 indicate that both
smoking and hypertension are among the most important risk factors of NCDs.
