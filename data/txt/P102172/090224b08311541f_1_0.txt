Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 While the project was very important for moving the reforms forward, out of 6 initial PDO indicators, only one is achieved as of September 2015. 3 of the
 PDO indicators were dropped during restructuring in January 2014 since the relevant components were no longer within the scope of the project. For
 indicators concerning the utilization of family medicine care (indicators 1 and 2), although there have been increases in the indicator values in time, the
 most recent figures show a decline leaving the increase insufficient to achieve the PDO targets.

 The Project has been instrumental in increasing access to family medicine providers, which resulted in an increase of primary care services utilization:
 per capita annual visits to family medicine physicians increased from 2.61 in 2009 to 2.76 in 2014. Patient Satisfaction levels increased by around 6
 percentage points from 65.1% to 71.2% during the period of 2009-2014. After the approval of the Decree Law No. 663 on the Organization and Duties
 of the Ministry of Health and Its Affiliates on November 3, 2011, the MoH has completed the institutional arrangements and mandates for the affiliated
 institutions by the end of 2012. These changes in the organization structure have further helped establish the legal basis for the reforms being
 supported by the Project by defining the stewardship role of the MOH, increasing hospital autonomy, expanding family medicine services and further
 strengthening performance management and pay for performance initiatives.

         The reason for revising this PDO is related with the need to evaluate the utilization of primary health care services provided by the family
         medicine physicians only. Though per capital annual visits to family medicine physicians increased between 2009 and 2011, the trend
         turned downwards starting from 2012.

         Original PDO indicator: Increase in the % of first-time visits to specialists that are referrals by FM practices (dropped)
         Revised PDO indicator: Share of FM visits in total visits

         Original baseline and target figures were dropped as MoH could not be able to provide the breakdown of the first time visits to specialists.
         The lack of a mandatory referral system nationwide and the disconnection between the Family Medicine Information System and the
         Health-Net made the follow-up on this indicator difficult.

         Baseline: 35.00 (2009)

         Though the share of FM visits in total visits increased between 2009 and 2011, and the end-line target was almost met in 2011, the trend

         PDO Indicator: MOH reorganized and focus exclusively on health sector stewardship function
         This indicator was included into the project during the restructuring in January 2014.

         Target was achieved.
         Data source: Decree Law No. 663 dated November 3, 2011.

         An important objective of the Adaptable Program Loans was to redefine the role of the MoH as a steward (focusing on policy formulation,
         regulation and monitoring and evaluation) rather than a provider for the health sector. The MoH underwent a major restructuring in
         November 2011 (Statutory Decree No. 663). The Decree redefined the role of the MOH mainly as a steward (focusing on policy formulation,
         regulation and monitoring and evaluation) rather than a provider for the health sector. Under the new setting, the General Directorates are
         now responsible as service units for its policy formulation, planning, and regulatory functions, and some previous General Directorates
         became affiliated agencies, such as the Drugs and Medical Devices Institution, the Public Hospitals Institution (PHoI), and the Public Health
         Institution (PHeI).
