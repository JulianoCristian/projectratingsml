quality and efficiency of public\n            spending in education, health and social assistance, and\n            protecting the poorest and vulnerable groups from adverse\n            impacts of economic crisis by strengthening Brazil's\n            safety net programs. The specific objectives of the project\n            are to: 1) strengthen human development program\n            effectiveness through application of an improved framework\n            of fiscal federalism, including inter-governmental cost\n            sharing, better policy coordination, transparent budgetary\n            planning and consumer voice; 2) reduce inequality by\n            redirecting federal financial support to targeted\n            interventions that benefit the disadvantages groups; and 3)\n            eliminate disparities between high and low performing\n            providers of public social services through enhanced quality\n            and efficiency. This programmatic lending deepens the\n            already implemented sector reforms by supporting policies\n            and programs with direct impact on poverty reduction and\n            economic growth."}, "docdt": "2003-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
