3.       Program Description


Overall Program. The objective of the Programmatic Human Development Sector Reform Loan
(PSRL) program is to reduce poverty by improving the quality and efficiency of public spending in
education, health and social assistance, and protecting the poorest and most vulnerable groups from
adverse impacts of economic crises. In particular, it seeks to:

    · Strengthen human development program effectiveness through application of an improved
         framework of fiscal federalism, including inter-governmental cost sharing, better policy
         coordination, transparent budgetary planning and consumer voice;

    · Reduce inequality by redirecting federal financial support to targeted interventions that benefit
         the disadvantaged groups; and,

    · Eliminate disparities between high and low performing providers of public social services
         through enhanced quality and efficiency.

The PSRL was planned as a three-phased programmatic operation. The first loan (covered by this ICR)
acknowledged Brazil's achievements in human development, supported the continuity of the most
effective programs, and protected the budget of these programs. The second loan would strengthen and
expand social policies and programs, while providing flexibility regarding the mechanisms the
Government may employ to deliver the particular policy or pursue the chosen objective. The third
operation would institutionalize and consolidate these policy reforms.

PSRL-I.      As previously stated, the First Programmatic Human Development Sector Reform Loan
(PSRL-I) supported an ongoing program of human development reforms that address core sector issues
of targeting, resource allocation, and efficiency of spending. In addition, the loan was intended to
signal to the markets the commitment of the new Brazilian administration to sound economic and sector
policies as well as to finance part of the nominal fiscal deficit and the external financing requirements
of the public sector. Specifically, it supported:

    (i) The substantial progress on social policies and outcomes achieved over the previous three
         years.   These policies resulted in an innovative set of programs at the federal level to
         decentralize the delivery of social services, to place a floor on basic education and health
         spending, to reduce inter-state and inter-municipality inequalities, and to develop institutional
         mechanisms to coordinate, focus and improve assistance for disadvantaged populations;

    (ii) The protection of budgets and monitoring of implementation of effective social policies
         during times of transition and instability. By safeguarding 21 core program budgets, the
         PSRL-I intended to help the new administration--which took power in January 2003 in a
         challenging macroeconomic environment--to continue sound human development policies
         deemed critical for guaranteeing continued growth and poverty reduction.

    (iii)The commitment by the new administration to the continuation, improvement, and
         expansion of these effective social policies aimed at better sector outcomes.                The
         continuation of sound policies and their improvement was a central objective of the
         programmatic nature of this loan.

   Economic and Political Context. The PSRL-I was prepared in a unique and particularly
   delicate context, posing both challenges and opportunities. Project preparation took place
   during a political transition from a centrist liberal administration to an unprecedented left-
   leaning administration with a strong social and anti-poverty agenda. Given uncertainties
   that surfaced during the electoral period, Brazil faced a potentially difficult and critical
   macroeconomic environment, accentuated by international speculation on the new
   administration's commitment to existing economic and fiscal policies. At the same time,
   human development had been a centerpiece of the eight-year mandate of the outgoing
   administration and was at the forefront of the new administration's policy agenda for
   economic growth and poverty reduction. The protection of education, health, and social
   protection programs which were already yielding positive results--even in a tight fiscal
   situation--was fundamental for the administration's national credibility. Brazil's need to
   balance its fiscal constraints and its social agenda made this operation more relevant and
   necessary as an instrument for protecting and strengthening the country's social safety net.
   Project preparation benefited from efficient collaboration between the Bank team, the
   outgoing government team, and the transition team for the new administration. This
   afforded strong ownership of the program and contributed to the successful completion of
   its first phase.


4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs


   The PSRL-I achieved all its intended objectives. Bank assistance for the program was prepared
   rapidly and with the full collaboration of the outgoing Government with the participation of the
   new administration's transition team. At the critical time of political transition, when investor
   confidence was weak and there was high financial volatility and uncertainty, the operation signaled
   to markets the new administration's commitment to sound human development policies and, more
   importantly, the Bank's continued commitment to supporting Brazil's economic and social
   priorities. In line with the severe fiscal constraints facing the Government, the operation was
   highly selective with respect to the programs recommended for continued budgetary support. Most
   importantly, the operation provided a solid basis for dialogue between the new administration and
   the Bank on social sector policies, which has led to a fruitful dialogue in the context of new
   initiatives in the areas described below.

   All loan conditions were met and the loan was fully disbursed shortly after effectiveness. More
   significantly, the PSRL-I provided the correct incentives to ensure policy continuity, consolidation,
   and enhancement. This is evident from the significant achievements and progress made by the
   governments in its social agenda over the past 12 months:

        · The 2003 approved budgets for the selected programs matched the amounts agreed under
            the PSRL-I and were executed at an average 94 percent level (97 percent in health and 90
            percent in education and social protection), even though 2003 was a year of fiscal austerity
            and deep budget cuts. A number of programs show higher executed budgets than the
            original amounts; other programs had their budgets reduced since the revenues legally ear-
            marked to fund them were lower than expected (see Annex 2).

        · Several policy lines and programs have been enhanced and work continues to progress in
            that direction. The most promising new development is the unification of the roster of



                                                 - 3 -

           recipients of federal financial subsidies (Cadastro Único), and the approval (in January
           2004) of a law unifying many of these programs in a single family assistance program
           ("Bolsa Família").1 This initiative is expected to increase the efficiency of social spending
           by eliminating multiple administrations of conditional cash transfer programs, and by
           improving the targeting of benefits. The unification will also promote complementarity of
           the interventions by focusing on the family as the beneficiary unit, rather than the
           individual.

      · The budgets for the programs protected in the PSRL-I that were approved for 2004 are in
           line with the central concept of the Program and reflect the Government's strong
           commitment to pursue sound human development and poverty reduction policies. Funding
           for the core programs in 2004 match program targets in nominal terms. The main observed
           changes have to do with the unification of Bolsa Escola, Auxílio Gas, PETI and Bolsa
           Alimentação into the new Bolsa Família Program, for which a R$ 5.4 billion (US$1.9
           billion equivalent) budget was approved for FY04.

      · The Government has expressed interest in continuing with the Program and has asked the
           Bank to proceed with the preparation of the second phase of its assistance. The proposed
           Technical Assistance Loan (TAL), currently in the final phases of preparation, shall be
           instrumental in helping the Government define additional improvements to the core
           programs and policy lines.

      · In the education sector, one of the key reforms in the Government's agenda is the
           expansion of the federal education development fund -FUNDEF- beyond the fundamental
           cycle (grades 1-8) to cover one grade of pre-primary and secondary education as well. This
           new fund - FUNDEB- is already under discussion and maintains some of the key elements
           of transparency and equity that made FUNDEF successful and technically sound. Other
           important policies have been maintained and enhanced, such as the accountability
           framework established with the SAEB student achievement national test, and the ENEM
           test for 11th grade graduates. Some proposed changes to be introduced to the Provão (the
           test for evaluating the university programs) have been a source of concern, but technical
           and political discussions continue in this regard. While other programs, such as textbook
           distribution and distance education, have continued successfully, others are in the process
           of being enhanced, such as the national teacher training initiative: a national network of
           agencies (Universities, NGOs, research labs) has been competitively selected and charged
           with the task of developing in-service teacher training packages that can be readily used by
           municipalities and states.      Moreover, the Government has demonstrated interest in
           expanding quality interventions to more municipalities, and it is piloting it through the
           Bank-financed Fundescola IIIA Program. Work on developing a mechanism to expand
           early childhood education (ECD) has been slow, and fiscal constraints have delayed this
           effort.   Finally, reform of higher education to increase its efficiency and expand
           opportunities to students, particularly poorer ones, is a key mandate of the Ministry of
           Education. All-in-all, progress in some education policy areas is steady, while in others
           the political and technical circumstances have posed challenges.

      · In the health sector, the central planning mechanisms to implement the Operational
           Regulations for Health Care (NOAS) decentralization norms (the PDR and PDI) have been

        carried out. The coverage of the family health program (PSF) has increased from 32 to 36
        percent and the benchmark of 50 percent coverage is expected to be reached by mid-2006.
        Progress towards the objective of strengthening the federal resource transfer system is
        evident. The Ministry of Health has increased the percentage of resources transferred to
        states and municipalities through block grants to 80 percent (up from 70 percent in 2002).
        A pilot program is being implemented in six states to track the use of federal resources
        transferred for disease surveillance, and a plan to scale-up the tracking system is being
        prepared.     Proposals to consolidate a number of transfers are being discussed.
        Differentiated PSF federal transfers for high-density urban areas were established and the
        formula for low-density rural areas is under study. A monitoring system to track
        compliance with the constitutional mandate to further reduce the financing gap between
        rich and poor regions (EC-29) was established and studies are being carried out to develop
        parameters for setting needs-adjusted per capita spending floor for basic health care. In
        other areas, some progress is also being made in introducing results-based management
        tools in the health sector, in implementing a system to reduce fraudulent claims, and in
        institutionalizing a referral and counter-referral system for the PSF program.

A detailed description of the implementation of the PSRL targets and triggers is listed in Annex 1
and the budget allocations to these programs in listed in Annex 2.


5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

As previously stated, the PSRL was prepared at a time of historical political transition in Brazil
when there were significant risks that the new administration might derail the orientation of well-
established social policies that had been successfully implemented over recent years. The country's
sound and sustained macroeconomic policies were equally under threat from the spillover of the
Argentine crisis and negative market perceptions of the impending political transition. Given this
background, four factors positively affected the implementation of this loan: the choice of
instrument, the coordination with other multi-lateral organizations, the collaboration between the
two administrations (outgoing and incoming), and the Bank's highly skilled project preparation
team.

        · The choice of instrument, programmatic adjustment lending, was highly relevant,
            reflecting an appropriate mix of actions oriented to achieving short-term
            macroeconomic and sectoral impacts as well as those aimed at sustaining the sectors'
            long-term development goals. It signaled to markets both the commitment of the
            incoming administration to sound economic and sectoral policies as well as provided a
            long-term collaboration framework between the new administration and the Bank.
            Furthermore, it ensured partial financing of the nominal fiscal deficit and the external
            financial requirements of the public sector, while protecting sound social programs.
            Furthermore, the "tranching" and apportionment of conditionality enabled the Bank to
            quickly support the incoming administration while reducing the Bank's risk exposure.
            It also provided the new administration with more time to work out the details of the
            Program to be implemented with support from subsequent phases (PSRL II and III).

        · The complementarity with other multi-lateral organizations. The PSRL complemented
            the assistance provided by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to Brazil in
            the social sectors and is consistent with the ongoing US$30 billion IMF standby
            arrangement.     The IADB's operation supports enhancements to four successful cash
            transfer programs (Bolsa Alimentação, Bolsa Escola, Agente Jovem, and Programa de


                                               - 5 -

            Erradicação do Trabalho Infantil); in its first phase, Bank assistance provided support
            to protect the budgets for these programs, among other social programs. The IMF's
            standby arrangement seeks to maintain the GDP primary surplus targets and inflation
            under control; Bank's assistance seeks to protect the most vulnerable groups under a
            tight fiscal environment through ensuring the continuation of successful social
            programs and to promote greater efficiency in those programs.

        · The collaboration between the two administrations during the transition process,
            including the participation of both the outgoing and incoming administrations during
            formal negotiations, enabled the Bank's team to rapidly engage the newly appointed
            Ministers in the discussion of this program in general and the first phase in particular
            and, more importantly, to ensure their commitment to the social programs supported by
            it.    This collaboration was particularly important since the PSRL I supported
            successful social policies of the outgoing administration, and subsequent phases of this
            programmatic operation will be conditional on the continuation and strengthening of
            the existing policy framework.

        · The Bank's highly skilled multi-sectoral preparation team supported by management
            at all levels with broad-based support inputs from across the Bank ensured creative,
            quality, and effective work carried out under challenging circumstances. As stated by
            this operation's Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA), this team ensured the delivery of a
            "well-crafted, ground-breaking and highly relevant product...with speed, focus, and
            vision ...".

        · The solid set of Sector Investment Loans (SILs) and sector studies (ESWs) covering
            education, health, and social protection prepared over the last five years provided for a
            strong technical base to support the policy choices and recommendations made under
            this operation.


6. Bank and Borrower performance

Bank. The Bank's performance is rated highly satisfactory. This rating is consistent with the one
given by the QEA team. The multi-sectoral preparation team was highly experienced in technical
issues and operational procedures and the operation successfully built on the Bank's substantial
experience in the health, education and social protection sectors in Brazil accumulated through
lending and sector work. Additionally, there was total mobilization on management's part as well
as quality input from other parts of the Bank to support the speedy delivery of this operation.
Effective communications with both the outgoing administration as well as the incoming one, close
collaboration with the transition team, and a well-coordinated timing with the political transition
ensured ownership of the operation and, most importantly, commitment to the social policies that
were included as the operation's triggers. The resulting operation was well conceived, timely and
of strategic relevance.    The creative choice of instrument was highly appropriate as it both
addressed Brazil's urgent needs as well as minimized the Bank's own risk and ensured a long-term
dialogue on key social policies.   Overall, both design and implementation of the operation were
highly successful.

Borrower. The Government's performance was also highly satisfactory. The commitment of both
the outgoing and incoming administrations to human development, through ensuring the continuity
of a set of successful social programs was instrumental in the smooth process of design and



                                              - 6 -

implementation of the PSRL-I. The skillful and transparent engagement of both teams and the
maturity and civility of the democratic transition are commendable. The new administration's
transition team participated as observer in the negotiations, and--once in office--issued a second
policy letter supporting the Program. This strategy proved strategic in consolidating government
support during implementation.      The Government's performance during supervision was also
highly satisfactory, and there were no difficulties meeting the triggers that allowed the one-tranche
loan to be fully disbursed shortly after it became effective. The quality of the work done reflected
the performance of well-integrated and experienced teams that were able to mobilize support across
the Government.


7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent PSRL Stages

    · The PSRL-I delivered immediate help to protect key social programs by providing
        budgetary support. But in the long run its most important contribution is likely to be that
        of improving efficiency in the use of public resources in the social sectors. Thus, the
        Technical Assistance Loan, currently under preparation, remains of foremost importance to
        the subsequent phases of this operation as it will, among other actions, finance an improved
        information base and reliable system of impact evaluation, which will then permit gradual
        expansion and improvement of the effectiveness of social programs to be supported by the
        PSRL II and III.

    · While the PSRL-I focused on policies directly under the responsibility of the Federal
        Government, advancing those interventions would benefit from close coordination with
        State and Municipal Governments, which are often in charge of implementing social
        policies and, in some cases, are willing and able to leverage them.        Thus, subsequent
        phases of this Program could benefit from promoting further alignment with state and
        municipal policies, and close monitoring at all levels.

    · The success of the PSRL-I was due to a well-thought combination of factors, including a
        seasoned multi-sector preparation and supervision team that was able to appropriately link
        priority macroeconomic and sectoral concerns, as well as a carefully select set of social
        programs that were fully functional, efficient, and with a solid track record. The effective
        integration of activities and reform programs for education, heath, and social protection
        along cross-cutting programmatic and reform themes led to the development of an
        appropriately designed matrix of objectives, actions, and benchmarks. Subsequent phases
        of this Program should continue benefiting from this well-integrated multi-sector team, as it
        has proven to be a cornerstone for the success of the Bank's assistance in support of the
        Government's program.
