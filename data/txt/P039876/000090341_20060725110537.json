The\n            world-class collections held at National institute of\n            Biodiversity (INBio) represent the results of 10 years of\n            hard work and have a high scientific value. The project\n            overestimated the degree to which local communities and\n            stakeholders would be able to understand or define their\n            needs for biodiversity information. Create an enabling\n            environment for science to work with local and international\n            communities. Biodiversity information is so vast that no one\n            institution can specialize in all groups or all areas.\n            Product-based thinking is important for the sustainability\n            of knowledge-based institutions. The discussions and\n            donor-funded work revealed that the sustainability of the\n            conservation areas depends on the benefits generated for\n            society and the local communities. INBio staff are motivated\n            and committed to the success of the institution. Training\n            local individuals, such as park rangers and hunters, to\n            become parataxonomists empowered them to become one of the\n            most successful elements of the biodiversity development program."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
