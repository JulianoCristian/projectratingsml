Water Project (HWP) in Lesotho were as follows:\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to development\n            outcome was moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Community Development Support\n            Project were as follows: outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was significant; Bank performance was\n            highly unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            highly unsatisfactory. Some of the lessons learned include:\n            a successful construction program does not necessarily mean\n            a successful development program. Attention is needed to the\n            full objectives of a project, including \"software\"\n            as well as \"hardware.\" LHWP- 1B's successful\n            water infrastructure program will be a main pillar in\n            Lesotho's development program for decades to come. But\n            the royalties did not go to poverty reduction, the\n            project's most fundamental objective. Also, while\n            LHWP-1B was strong in all aspects related directly to\n            construction (engineering, physical works and water\n            delivery), it performed weakly in software aspects (capacity\n            building, training and resettlement). Lesotho and South\n            Africa's \"good practice\" water treaty has\n            features that may be relevant elsewhere. The following\n            features have contributed to success: (i) clarity and detail\n            in the treaty document, including procedures for adjusting\n            to changing circumstances; (ii) appropriate institutions - a\n            bridging institution has worked well in coordinating actions\n            between the two countries; (iii) focused objectives; and\n            (iv) independent dispute resolution mechanisms within the\n            institutions themselves. The Bank's 20-year engagement\n            providing technical and policy support, and as a motivator\n            for the financial involvement of other lenders, also\n            contributed to the treaty's success. Safeguards\n            implementation should not be given second-tier priority, but\n            should receive the same attention as the main project\n            components. Successful implementation of a safeguard program\n            requires the same design and supervision qualities as other\n            project components."}, "docdt": "2010-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
