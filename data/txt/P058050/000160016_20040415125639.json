unsatisfactory, sustainability is highly unlikely,\n            institutional development impact is negligible, and Bank\n            performances is unsatisfactory while Borrower performance is\n            highly unsatisfactory. Among the lessons learned were the\n            following:  Without Government commitment, a small amount of\n            money will not leverage a much larger amount of money.\n            Aligning key Project documents is important; failure to\n            harmonize the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the\n            Development Credit Agreement (DCA) can lead to confusion\n            during implementation and completion. Appropriate measures\n            need to be taken, including the provision of necessary\n            resources, as soon as deficits (such as failure to adhere to\n            the Operational Manual) are identified, or once attainment\n            of the development objectives became questionable. Given the\n            stated importance of this Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL)\n            to the lending scenario for Lesotho, insufficient Bank\n            resources (both human and financial) were provided to ensure\n            the appropriate support. Bank staff could avert problems,\n            such as those experienced in this Project, at an earlier\n            stage by paying closer attention to disconnects (unrealistic\n            ratings) in Project Status Report ratings. Support for\n            poverty monitoring may not be best placed in Community\n            Demand-Driven (CDD) operations. Given the Bank's goal\n            of poverty reduction, an appropriate mechanism, outside of\n            CDD operations, for supporting the monitoring of poverty\n            needs to be identified."}, "docdt": "2004-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
