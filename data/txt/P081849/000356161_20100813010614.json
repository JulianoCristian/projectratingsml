Telecommunications\n            Technical Assistance Project for Bangladesh were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: this project\n            was relatively small from an investment perspective, but it\n            was very opportunistic and focused as it was specifically\n            designed to take advantage of the high-level political will\n            to undertake telecom sector reforms, and to support the\n            newly-established regulatory agency which needed significant\n            strengthening. The initial delays and risks to project\n            outcomes could be reasonably attributed to the lack of\n            sufficient resources at the implementing agencies when the\n            project started. Hence, the credit could have required the\n            Government to allocate sufficient staff resources at the\n            implementing agencies, and the project design should have\n            provisioned for full-time and incentivized staff for\n            implementation. Ministry of Post and Telecommunications\n            (MOPT) also tried to address this issue during\n            implementation by submitting an amended Technical Assistance\n            Project Proforma (TAPP) for additional resources and having\n            its staff trained under the project. The project seized the\n            opportunity of high-level political will to restructure\n            Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB), but\n            encountered an unexpectedly high level of resistance from\n            BTTB's management and labor unions. Hence, the use of\n            methodological approaches such as political economy and/or\n            stakeholder analysis could have provided more realistic\n            contextual basis for future projects."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
