improve the\n            performance of Bangladesh's telecommunications sector\n            through strengthening elements of the policy, institutional,\n            and regulatory framework in order to promote the competitive\n            provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services.\n            There are two main project components. The main objective of\n            the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MOPT) component\n            is to separate the policy and operational roles of the\n            Government. This will be achieved through 1) restructuring\n            the Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB); and 2)\n            strengthening the policy function in MOPT. Technical\n            assistance will be provided to implement BTTB restructuring\n            and convert it from the present Government board into a\n            company, registered under the Company's Act. Support\n            will be provided to carry out a number of activities\n            including: a) re-examining Ordinance XII of 1979 (amended in\n            1995) that established BTTB; b)asset/liability allocation;\n            c) Financial audit and creation of opening financial\n            statements; d) a cost-based tariff study; e) Examining\n            options for rationalization of labor force; f) public\n            relations; g) development of a business plan; and h)\n            development of a performance contract for BTTB. Technical\n            assistance support for consultancy and training programs\n            will be provided in order to strengthen MOPT's capacity\n            to carryout its policy functions. This will include a)\n            policy review and formulation; establishment of processes\n            and procedures for policy monitoring and evaluation; and\n            re-examination of Bangladesh's WTO commitments and\n            preparation of a new telecommunications offer; b)\n            development of a universal access strategy; c) other studies\n            on policy issues such as convergence, market structure,\n            competition; d) capacity building and professional\n            development through in-country, on the job and external\n            training programs; and e) procurement of equipment and\n            systems to facilitate information sharing and dissemination,\n            within and outside of MOPT."}, "docdt": "2003-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
