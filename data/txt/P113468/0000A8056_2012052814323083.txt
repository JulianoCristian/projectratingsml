                         1.       The objective of this project is to improve food security for the most vulnerable population, including children, and increase smallholder rice production in
                         project areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The last visit to the field was undertaken in February 2012 at the ICR mission of the parallel Emergency Food security Support Project (P120214) funded by the European Union. But
                         the last comprehensive supervision mission to this project was undertaken in November 2011. The next mission was planned for end April and due to the political situation in the
                         country did not happen. Therefore, this report will be based on mission findings of December 2011 supplemented by the observation of the mission undertaken in February 2012
                         during ICR mission of the parallel project funded by the European Union.

                         This project has two Grant Agreements. One Grant Agreement was with World Food Programme for the Implementation of Component 1 (TF092979) and the Second is with
                         Government of Guinea-Bissau for implementation of components 2 and 3 and it is implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (TF092980). The
                         implementation of Component 1 was completed in September 2010 and there are no pending issues. Components 2 and 3 are still under implementation and the closing date was

                         extended from March 31 2012 to June 30, 2012. Due to the extraordinary circumstances in the country and as a precautionary measure, the Bank will extended the Closing date
                         beyond June 30, 2012 to give some time to the Bank to assess the situation. The extension of the closing date would also allow time for the task team to complete the preparation of
                         the Additional Financing before the parent project closes. The Additional Financing on the amount of US$7 million will be funded through the GFRP. The GRFP steering committee
                         approved the allocation of the funds on August 7, 2011, and the concept memo was approved by the CMU on November 18, 2011. The RVP approval date was scheduled for June
                         20, 2012 but due to the current political situation it is unlikely to process this operation under this scheduled.

                         In terms of implementation status, Components 2 and 3 were progressing well. In February 2012 the Government requested the extension of the closing date and reallocation of the
                         grant proceeds for the following reasons: (i) due to delays in the procurement of critical goods under the micro-projects (e.g. rice mills, millet mills and power tillers) since the
                         Recipient had to procure these goods from European and/or Asian countries; (ii) the Recipient required additional to tested some equipment on arrival and delivered to the
                         beneficiaries, who, in turn, needed to be trained in the efficient and safe use of the equipment which required additional time. The reallocation of Grant Proceeds was necessary to
                         make resources available to meet the cost of project activities for the micro-projects and the operational costs under the proposed extension period.

                         Component 2 has two sub-components; the first sub-component is designed to provide Matching Grants (US$2,100,000) to support communities and smallholder organizations to
                         increase food production. In February, about 465 micro-projects were under implementation and the total disbursed amount was US$1,318,000 (66%). The remaining balance was
                         fully committed and procurement of goods was underway. The second sub-component is designed to strengthen the technical capacity of MARD. About 130 people among
                         smallholder groups and staff of the Ministry of Agriculture benefited from training from this sub-component. The training provided opportunities for smallholder and staff of the Ministry
                         of agriculture to improve their knowledge on (i) seed production; (ii) procurement; (iii) organization of producer organizations through a smallholder visits to other communities in
                         Senegal; (iv) environmental and social safeguards; and (v) formulation of projects to staff of the Planning department. Component 3 Support all implementation of the project
                         activities including monitoring and evaluation. At the regional level, the project was also involved in the preparation of demonstration camps for farmers to increase rice productivity.
