The project will be part of said assessment,\n            and when resumption of communication is determined, the team\n            will seek formal validation of the extension and preparation\n            of the action plan. Guinea-Bissau is a fragile country, and\n            the international community has already warned about\n            aggravation of the food crisis in light of the coup. Once\n            the assessment is complete, a rapid re-engagement of project\n            implementation will contribute to alleviate the problem. The\n            project's objectives are still achievable, and there\n            are key implementation actions to be completed. Supervision\n            is still ongoing to the extent possible. Due to the fact\n            that the Bank is still assessing the situation and has not\n            resumed communications with the government, there is\n            currently no request from government to extend the project.\n            The extension is motivated due to the extraordinary\n            circumstances in the country, and as a precautionary\n            measure, in order to give time to the Bank to assess the\n            situation. The project development objectives are still\n            achievable and, as indicated, there is still money to be\n            disbursed to complete the procurement and payment of\n            critical goods."}, "docdt": "2012-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
