{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Emergency Food Security\n            Response Project for Guinea-Bissau were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was high,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: country\n            ownership ensures achievement of development objectives,\n            particularly in fragile countries where government\n            leadership is lacking. The involvement of national\n            non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in providing technical\n            assistance and on the-job training to producer groups\n            increases the likelihood of continued capacity building and\n            guarantees that new development management skills stay in\n            the communities that need those most. Capacity constraints\n            in fragile countries are persistent; they often negatively\n            affect results and must be properly mitigated during design\n            - not just implementation. The new global food crisis\n            response program (GFRP) project, currently being formulated,\n            has taken under advisement the lessons related to persistent\n            weak capacity and will rely heavily on world food program\n            (WFP) for implementation, monitoring and evaluation (M and\n            E), and fiduciary management. A minimum set of project\n            readiness conditions, coupled with intense implementation\n            support, is necessary for emergency operations to succeed."}, "docdt": "2014-04-28T00:00:00Z"}
