The closing date of the project will be\n            extended from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The\n            extension of the closing date is necessary for the following\n            reasons: first, as a precautionary measure in light of the\n            current exceptional circumstances in the country. Due to the\n            occurrence of a military coup in Guinea-Bissau on April 12,\n            2012, bank policy was triggered and the Bank has put\n            disbursements of all existing operations on hold. The\n            extension is motivated due to the extraordinary\n            circumstances in the country and as a precautionary measure,\n            in order to give time to the Bank to assess the situation."}, "docdt": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z"}
