                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The last visit to the field was undertaken from August 27-31. 2012 during the OP7.30 mission assessment. The primary objective of the mission was to carry out an assessment to
                         ascertain the feasibility of resuming the disbursements to the existing operations in accordance with the criteria set forth in the paragraphs 3 and 4 of the OP7.30.

                         During the mission I focused on supervising the ongoing Emergency Food Security Support Project (EFSSP) and assessing the readiness for a potential resumption of

                         The mission recommended the resumption of the disbursements on existing Bank operations as OP 7.30 criteria are met, and the Bank management agreed to the mission
                         recommendations on December 7, 2012. The resumption of disbursements will enable the project to honor its commitments with consultants and contractors and keep the minimum

                         level of staff in the project to prepare the final report and the implementation completion report and results to close the operation.

                         It was also agreed on recent staff meeting that to allow completion of the ICR and processing of the Additional Financing through World Food Programme that the closing date should
                         be extended from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013.

                         This project has two Grant Agreements. One Grant Agreement was with World Food Programme for the Implementation of Component 1 (TF092979) and the Second is with
                         Government of Guinea-Bissau for implementation of components 2 and 3 and it is implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (TF092980). The
                         implementation of Component 1 was completed in September 2010 and there are no pending issues. Components 2 and 3 are still under implementation and the closing date was
                         extended from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012. The Bank is processing extension of the Closing Date beyond December 31, 2012 to allow the project to complete its activities
                         and make payments of pending contracts since April 2012. In addition, the extension of the closing date would also allow time for the task team to complete the preparation of the
                         Additional Financing before the parent project closes. The Additional Financing on the amount of US$7 million will be funded through the GFRP, and it has been proposed to be
                         implemented by the World Food Program. The GRFP steering committee approved the allocation of the funds on August 7, 2011, and the concept memo was approved by the CMU
                         on November 18, 2011. The RVP approval date was scheduled for June 20, 2012 but due to the current political situation has been delayed.

                         In terms of implementation status, Components 2 and 3 were progressing well before the political events of April 2013. In February 2012 the Government requested the extension of
                         the closing date and reallocation of the grant proceeds for the following reasons: (i) due to delays in the procurement of critical goods under the micro-projects (e.g. rice mills, millet
                         mills and power tillers) since the Recipient had to procure these goods from European and/or Asian countries; (ii) the Recipient required additional to tested some equipment on
                         arrival and delivered to the beneficiaries, who, in turn, needed to be trained in the efficient and safe use of the equipment which required additional time. The reallocation of Grant
                         Proceeds was necessary to make resources available to meet the cost of project activities for the micro-projects and the operational costs under the proposed extension period.
                         Since no disbursement has been made since April and the situation remains the same related to payment of contractors and testing the equipment.
