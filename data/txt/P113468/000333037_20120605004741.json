The extension of the closing date is\n            necessary for the following reasons: First, there has been\n            some delay in the procurement of critical goods (e.g. rice\n            mills, millet mills and power tillers) since the borrower\n            had to procure these goods from European and/or Asian\n            countries. Second, the borrower requires additional time\n            since some of the equipment needs to be tested on arrival\n            and delivered to the beneficiaries, who, in turn, need to be\n            trained in the efficient and safe use of the equipment which\n            will take additional time. Furthermore, the closing date\n            needs to be extended in order to allow adequate time for the\n            completion of all project activities to assist farmers\n            involved in rice production."}, "docdt": "2012-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
