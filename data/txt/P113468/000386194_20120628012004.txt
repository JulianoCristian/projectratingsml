                     (Emergency Food Security Support Project)

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1. This Restructuring Paper, in connection with TF092980 of the Emergency Food
   Security Support Project (EFSSP) under the Food Price Crisis Trust Fund Response
   Program, seeks approval by the Country Director to extend the project’s Closing Date
   from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012. Any accompanying amendments to the
   project’s legal documents would also be made. The cumulative extension period from
   the original Closing Date is 15 months.

2. The extension of the Closing Date is necessary for the following reasons: First, as a
   precautionary measure in light of the current exceptional circumstances in the
   country. Due to the occurrence of a military coup in Guinea-Bissau on April 12,
   2012, Bank Policy OP7.30 was triggered and the Bank has put disbursements of all
   existing operations on hold. As a result, as per OP 7.30, no withdrawal applications
   can be processed for the ongoing operations until the Bank has undertaken a full
   assessment of the situation. The extension under this exceptional basis will allow the
   Bank to carry-out such assessment before taking a final action on the closing of the
   Project. The Project will be part of said assessment, and when resumption of
   communication is determined, the team will seek formal validation of the proposed
   extension and preparation of the action plan. Guinea-Bissau is a fragile country and
   the international community has already warned about aggravation of the food crisis
   in light of the coup. Once the assessment is complete, a rapid re-engagement of
   Project implementation will contribute to alleviate the problem.

3. Second, the Project’s objectives are still achievable, and there are key implementation
   actions to be completed. Supervision is still ongoing to the extent possible. The halt
   has contributed to additional delays in the procurement and payments of critical
   goods (e.g. rice mills, millet mills and power tillers) to complete the micro-projects.
   When re-engagement is allowed, the Recipient will also require additional time since
   some of the equipment needs to be tested on arrival and delivered to the beneficiaries,
   who, in turn, need to be trained in the efficient and safe use of the equipment.

4. The Project Implementation Unit on behalf of the Government has reaffirmed its
   commitment to the project’s activities, and the implementing entity is in full
   compliance with the Bank’s financial management requirements. There are no
   overdue audit reports or interim financial reports. The proposed extension is
   consistent with the Operational Policy (OP) 13.30 and Bank Procedures (BP) 13.30,
   and it complies with all requirements. Borrower/Implementation Agency performance
   is satisfactory.

5. The EFSSP is funded through the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund (FPCRTF)
   in the amount of US$5 million. The FPCR was approved by the World Bank on

                                            1
   September 22, 2008, became effective on February 9, 2009, and is scheduled to close
   on June 30, 2012. The PDO of the Project is to improve food security for the most
   vulnerable population of the Recipient, including children, and increase smallholder
   rice production in the regions of Bafata, Biombo, Cacheu, Gabu, Oio and Bissau.
   The Project has three Components, including: (i) Support to the Most Vulnerable
   Population; (ii) Support for Increasing Food Production; and (iii) Project
   Coordination Monitoring and Evaluation.

6. The Project has one Project Paper and two Grant Agreements (GA); one GA is with
   the World Food Programme (WFP) to implement Component 1 in the amount of
   US$1,500,000 (TF092979), which was successfully implemented and closed on
   September 30, 2010; and the second GA is with the Government of Guinea-Bissau to
   implement Components 2 and 3 in the amount of US$3,500,000 (TF092980).

B. PROJECT STATUS

7. The progress towards achieving the PDO and the implementation progress (IP) of the
   project are rated Satisfactory. The Project has three outcome indicators, and the last
   assessment undertaken in December 2011 showed that all three outcome indicators
   have already been achieved: (i) the number of students receiving one meal a day was,
   on average, 14,102, against a target of 14,000, and about 49 percent were girls; (ii)
   the project generated 285,000 food-for-work (FFW) days against a target of 160,000
   workdays planned for the duration of the project; and (iii) about 14,330 tons of paddy
   rice are estimated to have been produced on the rehabilitated rice land under the
   project, including the 2011/12 rice season. This exceeds the project target of 7,500
   tons of paddy rice by the current project Closing Date (June 30, 2012).

8. The total Grant amount of the TF092980 is US$3.5 million, of which US$2.93
   million (84%) has been disbursed.

9. Implementation Status by Component- Component 1 - Support to the Most
   Vulnerable Population (TF092979) closed on September 30, 2010 and was
   implemented by the World Food Programme (WFP). This component was designed
   to support the most vulnerable population through: (i) School feeding program (SFP);
   and (ii) Food-for-work (FFW) program to rehabilitate land for rice production. A total
   of US$1.5 million was allocated for this component; out of which US$0.50 million
   was for SFP and US$1.0 million were for the FFW. The FFW program dealt with the
   rehabilitation of low land and mangrove land that was used for planting rice and
   increasing rice production. All the funds were disbursed to the WFP in 2010 and the
   component was closed, as scheduled, on September 30, 2010. All the output and
   outcome indicators were achieved before this component was closed.

10. Component 2 - Support for Increasing Food Production (TF092980) is being
    implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD)
    through the Technical Coordination Unit (TCU) and it is designed to (i) provide Sub-
    grants to smallholder farmers’ groups aimed at increasing food production and
    providing agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and tools; and (ii) strengthen
    the technical capacity of the MARD to assist smallholder farmers and their
                                            2
   organizations. A total of 800 micro-projects were under implementation and it was
   expected to be completed by the closing date (June 30, 2012). In addition to the
   support to smallholder farmers through micro-projects, several activities were
   undertaken to strengthen the capacity of MARD as well as the TCU staff. A total of
   12 training activities were undertaken, including training in procurement, data
   collection, monitoring and evaluation and farmers exchange visit to Senegal. A total
   of 130 experts and farmers have been trained, against a target of 64. This component
   had a slow start-up but with the hiring of the TCU staff in May 2010, the performance
   improved and during the last supervision mission in December 2011, this component
   was rated Satisfactory.

11. Component 3: Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation
    (TF092980). The implementation of this component is also Satisfactory, and is also
    being implemented by MARD. Several activities were undertaken under this
    component, including hiring of all consultants involved in the implementation of the
    project, preparation of all project instruments such as Environment and Social
    Management Framework (ESMF), the operations manual, the annual work plans and
    budget, preparation of the Steering Committee Meetings and regular supervision
    missions. Operational activities undertaken under this component included
    preparation of communications’ material, such as videos related to project activities,
    and preparation of visibility material, such as billboards posted in several areas of
    project intervention.

12. Since this Project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2012, the Task Team is requesting
    to extend the Closing Date of the FPCR Grant for six months, until December 31,
    2012, to allow time to finalize implementation of the micro-projects, through the
    procurement and payment of critical goods (e.g. rice mills, millet mills and power
    tillers) since the Recipient had to procure these goods from European and/or Asian
    countries and the military coup further delayed the procurement and payment of
    goods; and to test some of the equipment on arrival before they are delivered to the
    beneficiaries, who, in turn, need to be trained in the efficient and safe use of the
    equipment, which will take additional time.

13. Safeguards
    The Project is rated Category B and three safeguard policies were triggered:
    Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP4.04) and Pest
    management (OP 4.09). The Government prepared and disclosed in the country and
    the InfoShop the Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF). The
    Government also prepared guidelines and procedures for social screening and
    pesticides use and management. There are no safeguards issues and Bank supervision,
    through communication with the PIU, is ongoing to identify any safeguards issues.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

13. Due to the fact that the Bank is still assessing the situation and has not resumed
    communications with the Government, there is currently no request from Government
    to extend the Project. The extension is motivated due to the extraordinary
    circumstances in the country and as a precautionary measure, in order to give time to
                                            3
   the Bank to assess the situation. The Project Development Objectives are still
   achievable and, as indicated, there is still money to be disbursed to complete the
   procurement and payment of critical goods.

14. Once the Bank determines to reestablish dialogue, the Bank will seek from
    Government the formal validation of the extension and an action plan for the
    extension period.

15. The Closing Date will be extended from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012.
