                         The last visit to the field was undertaken from January 25 to February 1, 2013. The mission was a follow up to the the Bank decision on December 2012 to resume disbursements
                         under the existing portfolio in Guinea-Bissau under the OP 7.30.

                         number of students receiving one meal a day was, on average, 14,102, against a target of 14,000, and about 49 percent were girls; (ii) the project generated 285,000 food-for-work
                         (FFW) days against a target of 160,000 workdays planned for the duration of the project; and (iii) about 14,330 tons of paddy rice are estimated to have been produced on the
                         rehabilitated rice land under the project. This exceeds the project target of 7,500 tons of paddy rice.

                         Both Grants TF092979 (US$1.5 million) and TF092980 (US$3.5 million) have fully disbursed. There is a balance of XOF 20.419.884 (US$40,000) with project that needs to be
                         justified before the Disbursement Deadline Date (December 31, 2013).

                         The project closing date is August 31, 2013 and the Government also delivered on August 8, 2013 the report on the impact of Matching Grants as agreed on January 2013.
