It is reiterated that in emergency\n            situations, where a rapid response from the Bank is needed,\n            the use of an existing loan is often likely to be the most\n            appropriate mechanism to achieve responsiveness. The\n            assessment of outcome is satisfactory, sustainability\n            likely, though the institutional development impact, only\n            modest. Lessons suggest that following the emergency,\n            reconstruction works, particularly those involving large\n            capital investments, and operation and maintenance\n            requirements, should be carefully appraised, subject to the\n            same technical, economic, financial, and institutional\n            analysis as for similar investments. And, during\n            implementation of similar projects, the Government should\n            avoid shifting responsibilities to other agencies during the\n            course of project execution, whereas a clear agreement on\n            responsibilities for project implementation at inception,\n            would both facilitate the likelihood for follow-up, and\n            sustainability after project completion. It is recommended\n            that countries with El Nino type phenomena experiences,\n            should undertake contingency planning, and preventive\n            measures, while many of these types of investments should be\n            incorporated in regular sector investment programs, during\n            non-emergency periods."}, "docdt": "2002-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
