{"cdata!": "Overall, the project outcome was\n            unsatisfactory. However results were mixed, for although\n            private sector strengthening, produced outputs in terms of\n            relevant outcome indicators, the quality of these outcomes\n            was inadequate. Hence, sustainability is rated unlikely,\n            though institutional development impacts are modest.\n            Furthermore, while the performance of the borrower is\n            unsatisfactory, based on the weak preparation efforts\n            stemming from the lack of consensus within the Government,\n            the Bank performance is rated satisfactory, not only because\n            of sound project preparation, and supervision, but because\n            of its responsiveness to, and understanding of the\n            Government's concerns. Two main lessons are learned\n            from this project. 1) New laws, and regulations are not\n            sufficient to produce effective policy changes, particularly\n            when political powers, will not enforce them. The\n            Government's commitment to financial reforms was\n            largely subdued, illustrated in the form of delays in\n            submitting, and approving new banking legislation,\n            aggravated by the reluctance to apply legislation timely,\n            and consistently. 2) Effective strengthening of the\n            financial sector, legal, and regulatory framework should\n            precede any credit line operation, not merely accompany it,\n            and, credit lines should not use public banks as financial\n            intermediaries. The project demonstrates the high risks\n            posed by a credit line operation, in a country with a weak\n            banking system, poor regulatory framework, and thriving\n            political influences."}, "docdt": "2001-03-08T00:00:00Z"}
