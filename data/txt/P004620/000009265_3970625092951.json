Post-Secondary Education Project is to help the Government\n            to ensure an adequate supply of suitably trained manpower\n            for formal employment and higher levels of education. This\n            will be achieved by improving educational opportunity and\n            quality in lower secondary education and strengthening\n            education sector management. The project will accomplish\n            improvement of educational opportunity through: (i)\n            expansion of lower secondary school enrollment; (ii)\n            development of a preservice diploma teacher training program\n            to train lower secondary teachers; and (iii) carrying out a\n            feasibility study for the Solomon Islands College of Higher\n            Education. Improvement of educational quality will be\n            attained through the provision of: (i) equipment and\n            teaching materials, including textbooks; (ii) in-service\n            upgrading for lower secondary teachers; (iii) staff\n            training, housing and consultants for the Curriculum\n            Development Centre; and (iv) new staff and consultants for\n            the Ministry of Education and Training (MET). Finally, the\n            project will also promote improvement of education\n            management through provision of: (i) staff and training for\n            establishing an Implementation and Planning Unit in the MET;\n            and (ii) consultants for the preparation of studies on\n            teacher utilization and incentives."}, "docdt": "1986-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
