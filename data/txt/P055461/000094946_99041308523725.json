There are five project components in\n            the first phase of the project. 1) Improvement of social\n            services will improve the targeting and delivery of social\n            services by a better identification of individuals,\n            entities, and relationships. 2) Improved fiscal efficiency\n            will decrease the number of unregistered potential taxpayers\n            and the level of evasions through incorrect tax returns,\n            increasing voluntary compliance through an increased\n            perception of risk of evasion detection. 3) Institutional\n            framework, infrastructure, and common services will provide\n            the legal and technology infrastructure within a\n            comprehensive institutional framework to address the need\n            for a sustainable, systematic and efficient information\n            interchange environment. 4) Management of system will\n            develop and implement the structure and processes to control\n            the execution of the project and eventually to manage the\n            on-going SINTyS program. 5) Project administration will\n            provide the administrative, accounting, and other services\n            to support project execution."}, "docdt": "1999-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
