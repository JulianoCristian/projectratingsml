The\n            project will finance the construction of about 7,900\n            cooperative godowns, providing almost two million tons of\n            storage capacity, in addition to about 127 cold-storage\n            units providing about half a million tons of cold-storage\n            capacity. The project would also provide for technical\n            assistance, training in cooperative marketing techniques and\n            cold-storage operations, and research development on\n            experimental storage facilities and related activities."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
