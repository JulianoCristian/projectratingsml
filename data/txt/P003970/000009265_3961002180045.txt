MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for $307 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a Financial
Sector Development Project. The proceeds of the loan would be passed on by
the Borrower to the five State Commercial Banks (SCBs) as interest free loans
repayable over 15 years, including 5 years of grace, to be subsequently
converted into equity ($300 million) with the prior approval of the Bank, and
to Bank Indonesia (BI) as a grant ($7 million).
2.        Background.  Indonesia's financial sector has undergone a dramatic
transformation to a competitive, market-based system since the introduction of
a series of reforms beginning in 1983. As a result of these deregulation
measures, the financial sector has been opened to broad-based private sector
participation. There are now over 180 private banks (including joint ventures
with foreign banks) in Indonesia, accounting for 45 percent of total deposit
money bank assets. This trend is likely to continue in the future since, as a
result of the new Banking Law, the SCBs are now subject to the same rules and
regulations as the private banks.
3.        Most of the policies needed to develop a more robust and balanced
financial structure are now in places interest rates have been deregulated;
credit ceilings abolished; entry barriers lowered; subsidized directed credits
drastically reduced; and steps taken to develop the money and capital markets.
Both the banking sector and the capital market have responded favorably to
these reforms, which have been made, in conjunction with real sector reforms,
within the context of an open capital account and a government policy of
refraining from the financing of budget deficits through domestic borrowing.
As a result, these reforms have contributed to a strong increase in private
sector investments, non-oil export growth, improvements in the efficiency of
capital use and accelerated economic growth.
4.        In this new environment, the Government's primary concern is to
promote a sound financial system, encourage competition, at the same time
taking appropriate steps to ensure stability. The new Banking Law, approved
by Parliament in March 1992, provides for 49 percent privatization of the SCBs
through the issuing of shares on the stock market.
5.        Rev Sectoral Constraints.  While the deregulation initiatives have
yielded substantial positive results, they have also led to a concentration of
credit among a few large business groups, and engendered new challenges. In
the past, the Government of Indonesia (001) exercised substantial direct
control over productive activities. As a consequence, the adequacy of
prudential regulations and bank supervision, commercial laws and their
enforcement, and the financial performance and condition of state-owned
financial institutions were not considered critical to the stability and
growth of the financial system. Rapid growth since deregulation has exposed
several weaknesses in the financial system:



-2-
(a) with the development of Indonesia'. market-oriented financial
system, a primary objective of the Government's supervisory role has
become that of ensuring the safety and soundness of banks, in order
to make them efficient savings mobilizers and allocators of
resources. At the same time, thl mushrooming of new financial
products and institutions in recent years has strained the capacity
of authorities to effectively supervise financial institutions and
regulate the markets properly;
(b) with each successive reform in the 1980s, Indonesia's laws governing
the financial sector became Increasingly antiquated and inadequate.
A system of laws and regulations is needed to promote the use of
contracts that are clear about the rights and obligations of
contracting parties. Similarly, In Indonesia, it is difficult to
obtain reliable information for lack of clearly defined accounting
and auditing requirements, which are a critical prerequisite for the
assessment and transparency of financial risk, improved credit
allocation and efficient intermediation. This not only has
increased the cost of doing business in Indonesia, but also has
resulted in the concentration of credit in a small number of
business groups;
(c) in spite of the 1983-1991 deregulation, the SCBs, which account for
about 45 percent of the assets of Indonesia's deposit money banks,
continued to operate outside the purview of the Banking Law. They
received in the past, differential treatment with respect to banking
regulations and have had disproportionate access to cheap and
captive sources of funds. Not only the SCBs benefitted from their
privileged position, but certain individual and group borrowers also
benefitted from their easy access to credit from the SCMe; and
(d) despite recent growth, the financial system remains underdeveloped
and important gaps remain at the long end of the market,
particularly In the availability of equity and equity-type
instruments. Partly due to the domestic balanced budget rule, there
is today a dearth of financial paper and a lack of benchmark
financial pricest market determined reference rates for both short-
term (interbank and money markets) and long-term (bond market) are
absent.
6.        While the 1983-1991 reforms have generated a favorable response from
both the banking sector and the stock market, the increasing number of market
participants snd new financial products have increased the risk of financial
instability, in the absence of an effective legal, regulatory and supervisory
apparatus. The GOI's policy of deregulation, Intended to promote rapid
economic development while also helping to ensure equitable distribution of
development gains, has resulted in unequal access to credit and thus de facto
limited competition In the real sector; many of the benefits of deregulation
have accrued to a few influential business groups. The recently passed new
Banking Law will help remedy this situation.



- 3 -
7.        Government Strateay.  The GOI's overall economic reform program is
designed to rationalize the incentive framework and economic regulations. The
Government's role has been gradually shifting from one of direct control of
productive activities towards one of facilitating the development of markets
and competition. Developing a competitive and robust financial system for
efficient resource allocation is a core element of this strategy. It requires
a regulstory framework that addresses market failures while retaining
competitive pressures in the industry, thus lowering the risk of financial
instability and reducing the economy-wide costs of capital formation. In
order to address the key remaining issues, the GOI has:
la) issued, in early-1991, a new set of prudential banking regulations,
including the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) guidelines
for minimum capital requirements;
(b) promulgated new legislation in March-April 1992 for banking, pension
funds and insurance companies;
(c) changed, in September 1992, the legal charter (into a limited
liability company) and senior management of each SCB;
(d) prepared Plans of Action for the five SCBs for improving their
efficiency, including timetables for reducing the proportion of
classified assets to total assets and bringing them into compliance
with legal lending limits;
(e) initiated a program to strengthen prudential regulations and the
supervisory apparatus for the securities market, with USAID's
assistance;
(f) taken steps to further deepen the money market and to develop a
transparent reference rate for variable rate lending by financial
institutions, with the assistance of a large multiiational bank;
(g)  initiated a program to improve the country's economic and commercial
laws, including provision for accounting and auditing standards,
with USAID's assistance; and
(h)  initiated steps to develop regulatory frameworks and prudential
safeguards for insurance companies and pension funds, as well as
guidelines for investment funds and venture capital, and to
establish a credit rating agency, with ADB's assistance.
8.        Total additional capital requirements to bring the SCBs into
compliance with BI's prudential regulations and with BIS guidelines (minimum
8 percent capital to risk-weighted assets ratio) by December 31, 1994, are
estimated at $3.6 billion (about 3.5 percent of 1990 GDP). A very large
proportion of the additional capital needs stem from two factors: (i) the GOI
did not inject new equity into the SCBs during the last 25 years and
appropriated 45 percent of after-tax profits as dividends; and (li) the
adoption of new prudential regulations related, for the first time, to loan
loss provisioning and minimum capital requirements based upon international
norms. The GOI has proposed to recapitalize the SCBs through: SCB retained



-4-
earnings; inclusion of outstanding BI liquidity credits qualifying as
subordinated term debt; SCB general loan loss provisions; the conversion into
equity of subordinated debt (defined as debt incurred by the SCBs under
subsidiary/onlending agreements entered into between the GOI and the
respective SCBs under completed and ongoing financial intermediary lending
operations financed by the World Bank and other bi- and multilateral
agencies]; and fresh infusions of equity, including the proceeds of the
proposed loan.
9.        Lessons Learned from Past Operations.  In Indonesia, the Bank Group
has approved, to date, a total. of $1.6 billion in 17 operations for financing
investments through a variety of financial institutions. The general focus of
loans made prior to the onset of the GOI'e financial sector reform program in
1983 reflected the Bank's traditional DFC-lending approach to single financial
intermediaries with emphasis on institution-building. Generally, subsidized,
directed credit programs that were supported under these operations were
ineffective in promoting productivity improvements and had only limited impact
in achieving their policy and institutional development objectives. The Bank
made two significant shifts in its lending operations in the mid-1980s. One,
it moved away from subsidized lending; and two, it incorporated an increasing
number of competing financial intermediaries. However, specific target groups
continued to benefit from the Bank's lending activities so as to redress
various market failures, and little attention was given to use of these
operations for promoting financial sector development. Following the
preparation of a Financial Sector Report in 1990 and the very substantial
reforms of the financial system undertaken during 1983-1991, the Bank strategy
now is to foster improvements in the efficiency of resource allocation in
Indonesia. In the short-term, the emphasis is on ensuring the safety and
soundness of the financial system and reducing uncertainty and risks in
private business transactions through a further strengthening of the
institutional infrastructure for formal finance. In the medium-term, the
focus includes phasing out the direct role of the public sector in the
financial system.
10.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank supports the GOI's
objectives and priorities for the farther development and efficient growth of
the financial sector. Over the last several years, the Bank has been involved
in an active policy dialogue with the GOI through sector and economic reports,
informal policy notes and discussions on specific issues. The Bank has also
supported the GOI's policy reform initiatives through several adjustment
loans, including two loans for private sector development in FY89 and FY91.
11.       The proposed project, developed over a period of almost two years,
required extensive preparatory work in c number of related areas--new Banking
Law, new prudential banking regulations, independent asset quality reviews of
the SCBs, new legal charters for the SCBs and detailed Plans of Action for the
SCBs. It also required great determination and foresight on the part of GOI
to design appropriate measures relating to the future operations and business
practices of the SCBs. The Bank, under a Project Preparation Facility (PPF
No. P-162), assisted the GOI in undertaking detailed asset quality reviews of
each SCB as well as defining technical assistance needs in the areas of bank
supervision and credit information. The financial support to the GOI for
recapitalization of the SCBs, and the associated Plans of Action and



-5 -
provisions for enhancement of SCB asutonomy under the project, are considered
critical to Improving the efficiency of resource allocation for the whole
banking sector.  The conversion of subordinated loans into equity--the leost-
expensive method of financing the recapitalization--would greatly assist the
GOI In view of its domestic balanced budget rule.
12.       Project Objectives.  The project's primary objective is to asslst
the 001 in changing past practices in the financial system regarding credit
allocatioun such changes would foster improvements in the efficiency of
resource allocation in the economy and more equitable treatment for firms and
individuals alike. Specifically, the project would be instrumental in
promoting a change in the ways in which the SCBs conduct business. The
project would assist the GOI ins
(a) strengthening prudential banking regulations;
(b) enforcing implementation of prudential regulations by strengthening
BI's bank supervision, and improving credit Information systems and
staff skillsl and
(c) promoting tho competitiveness and efficiency of the SCBs by
subjecting them to the same rules as the private sector (i.e., as
provided under the new Banking Law, BI's new prudential
regulations, and the  CB's new legal charters). This will allow
greater autonomy to the managements of the SCBs.
13.       The SCBe have been corporatized through a change in their lagal
charters. The SOBs balance sheets would be restructured and capital bases
strengthened, and they would be subjected to the play of market forces. With
Government's firm commitment not to inject additional equity after the SCB!
have come into compliance with prudential regulations, the SCBs would have to
raise future equity needs for asset expansion through the issuance of shares
in the equity market. This will occur as soon as they meet listing
requirements. At present, the SCBs do not meet listing requirements, i.e.,
being rated "sehat (financially sound)" for two consecutive years. The
project's recapitalization plan, including the agreed Plans of Action for
improving the SCBs' respective asset portfolios, would prepare them for entry
into the capital market.
14.       Prolect Description. The project comprises three components:
(a) technical assistance to BI for improving existing systems and/or
designing new ones for bank supervision and credit information, and
training of BI staff to implement effectively these systems;
(b) a line of credit to the five SCBe for the provision of subloans to
the private sector for carrying out investment projects. The Bank
funds would initially be disbursed on the basis of eligible
subproject expenditures and standard procedures regarding subproject
processing and procurement as provided under the Bank's standard
financial Intermediary operations in Indonesia; and
(a) the recapitalization of the SCB!.



- 6 -
15.       As part of the recapitalization and in order to achieve the
project's policy objectives, Bank funds on3ent by the GOI to the SCBs would be
subsequently converted by the GOI into equity, in three phases, upon
confirmation of compliance, satisfactory to the Bank, of the SCBs with their
respective Plans of Action, BI's independent asset quality reviews and new
prudential banking regulations. Due to the complexities involved in the
establishment of the appropriate policy framework vithin which to implement
the recapitalization of the SCBs, and to keep the momentum generated to date,
retroactive financing (in an amount of up to 10 percent of the Bank loan) for
subproject expenditures incurred after March 31, 1992 (the first phase of the
recapitalization period being April 1, 1992 to March 31, 1993), and for
consultants engaged by BI under the TA component, would be provided under the
project.
16.       The estimated total financing requirement for the project is $3.6
billion equivalent, with a foreign exchange cowponent of $0.9 billion. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10482-IND, dated October 19,
1992, is being distributed separately.
17.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations. agreements were reached with
the Borrower, BI and the SCBs on the following: (i) BI would issue, by
April 1, 1994, a new regulation (to be applicable to all banks in Indonesia)
defining the methodology to be used for establishing loan loss provisions in
the calculation of capital adequacy, to be effective no later than March 31,
1996. Therefore, while all banks in Indonesia would have to comply with
international Lorms on loan loss provisioning and capital adequacy by no later
than March 31, 1996, the SCBs would have to meet this requirement by
December 31, 1994; (ii) there would be no increase in the risk weighted assets
through December 31, 1994, of the two weakest banks (BBD and BDN) from their
respective March 31, 1992 positions, and no increase in the large borrowers'
portfolio of BRI from its March 31, 1992 position; (iii) the financing plan
for the SCB recapitalization component, including the provision that at least
80 percent of the SCBs' FY93 and FY94 after-tax profits would be converted
into equity (since the GOI has already made provisions for the SCBs' PY92
dividends in its FY93/94 budget, these dividend proceeds would be reinvested
as equity infusions). Any shortfall that might materialize during project
implementation would be met by the GOI through further equity infusions;
(iv) a Plan of Action for each SCB; (v) BI would carry out annual asset
quality reviews of each SCB to ensure that they are in compliance with the new
prudential regulations on loa1n loss provisioning and minimum capital
requirements, as well as with the agreed Plans of Action; (vi) the adoption of
Bl's Bank Rating System as the transparent mechanism for establishing
performance criteria to be used in determining annual bonuses for members of
the SCBs' respective Boards of Directors; (vii) asset growth after December
31, 1994, for each SCB would be supported through corresponding increases in
their respective capital bases, achieved through retained earnings and/or
issuance of shares in the capital market. The 001 would not provide
additional equity to the SCBs after December 1994 to support asset growth
except to maintain a maximum 51 percent shareholding in each SCB; (viii) any



- 7 -
funds channelled through the SCBa for the GOI's directed credit programs in
the future will be on a managed-fund basisl and (ix) criteria for the
selection and processing of subborrowers and subprojects financed with loan
proceeds.
18.       Conditions of loan effectiveness includes  (a) publication in the
official Gazette of amendment., satisfactory to the Bank, to the SCBs'
Articles of Association that provide them the authority to raise equity
through the issuance of shares in the stock market; (b) conversion into equity
of disbursed and outstanding amounts under completed and ongoing Bank loan.
and other subordinated debt as of December 31, 1991 (or equivalent
contributions of capital by the 001); (c) the signing of a Financial Agreement
between the Borrower and BI, and Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the
Borrower and the five SCBs; (d) amendment of existing Subsidiary Loan
Agreements for those Bank loans under completed and ongoing operations which
would be converted into equity under the proposed project; (e) adoption of the
agreed Plans of Action by the SCBs' respective Boards of Directors; and
(f) retention by BI of the services of at least one credit expert.
19.       The condition of disbursement for each SCB's second and third phase
allocations of loan proceeds under the project would be that the SCB has to
have satisfactorily complied with its agreed Plan of Action during the
previous first and second phases, respectively, of the recapitalization
exercise. Amounts disbursed under the recapitalization component during c_ch
phase would be converted into equity at the end of each phase, subject to each
SCB's compliance with its agreed Plan of Action and with the prior approval of
the Bank.
20.       Benefits.  The policy agenda underlying the project is expected to
lead to substantial efficiency gains in resource use In Indonesia. The
delinking of the relationship that now exists between the SCBs and a
relatively small number of industrial group borrowers should curb economic
concentration. By changing past practices in credit allocation that have
handicapped competitive forces not only in the financial sector, but also in
the real sector, the project would promote more vigorous development in the
real sector. The project supports the various initiatives undertaken by the
OI to strengthen basic institutional infrastructure--banking legislation,
reliable credit information system, prudential regulations and effective
supervision--for a stable and efficient banking sector. These initiatives
complement the GOI's other recent actions undertaken with bilateral and
multilateral assistance in furthering development of the money and capital
markets, and improving commercial law in order to facilitate and support an
increased level of private business transactions.
21.       iAsks. There are risks in that the SCBs may be slower than expected
in developing into efficient financial institutions due mostly to opposition
from vested interests (since changes in the ways SCBs do business in the
future will affect existing business relations, requiring adjustments in the
real sector) and/or an unexpected deterioration in ove: .11 macroeconomic
conditions leading to difficulties for the SCBs in upgrading the quality of
their earning assets. These risks are considered moderate, however, because
of the GOI's demonstrated determination to promulgate legislation that will



- 8 -
require, within the framework of the project, changes in the SCBs' past
practices as well as the GOI's track record of sound macroeconomic management.
22.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
