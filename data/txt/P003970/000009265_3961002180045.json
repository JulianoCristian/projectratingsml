The project comprises three\n            components:  (a) technical assistance to Bank Indonesia (BI)\n            for improving existing systems and/or designing new ones for\n            bank supervision and credit information, and training of BI\n            staff to implement effectively these systems; (b) a line of\n            credit to the five State Commercial Banks (SCBs) for the\n            provision of subloans to the private sector for carrying out\n            investment projects.  The Bank funds will initially be\n            disbursed on the basis of eligible subproject expenditures\n            and standard procedures regarding subproject processing and\n            procurement as provided under the Bank's standard\n            financial intermediary operations in Indonesia; and (c) the\n            recapitalization of the SCBs."}, "docdt": "1992-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
