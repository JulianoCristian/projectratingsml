unsatisfactory, with an unlikely sustainability. Although\n            the Bank performance is rated satisfactory, its handling of\n            project execution was too permissive regarding compliance\n            with legal covenants, and audit requirements, reflected in\n            the Borrower's deficient performance, whose repeated\n            breaches of loan covenants, included the resettlement\n            failure (despite availability of resources), failure to\n            replenish the special account, and reluctance to follow\n            procurement guidelines. Lessons mostly address the\n            importance of building stakeholders' commitment, and\n            ownership, and, designing sound institutional setup early\n            on. Identified reforms to improve urban sector management,\n            but relinquished in favor of civil works, confirms the\n            absence of Government commitment, an issue which should be\n            agreed prior to loan effectiveness. Furthermore, the\n            ambitious sector program, featuring a combination of\n            physical, and institutional elements, but not consistently\n            linked because of weak strategies and unclear prioritization\n            of actions, hindered even the usually successful physical\n            components. In addition, implementation arrangements -\n            critical at project design, and key conditions to project\n            success - and, performance indicators, were insufficiently\n            considered, which diverted decision-making, and weakened\n            project monitoring, respectively."}, "docdt": "1996-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
