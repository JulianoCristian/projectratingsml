The\n            request was submitted by inhabitants and people representing\n            inhabitants of the Nylon zone, Douala, Cameroon. They claim\n            to have been harmed and negatively affected by World Bank\n            activities relating to the above-mentioned Projects. In\n            their letter to the Panel, the Requesters claim that the\n            Projects have led to the destruction of their homes,\n            possessions and resources. They state that, as a consequence\n            of the Projects, about 500 people were forcefully evicted\n            from their homes. They further state that many of these\n            people have been without homes since then. According to the\n            requesters, the Government and local authorities have\n            promised them new houses, but this has not yet happened. The\n            requesters assert that until today no compensation has been\n            paid nor have they received appropriate housing. Under the\n            eligibility criteria of the Panel, the Panel may not\n            investigate Projects for which the loan has been closed or\n            more than 95% disbursed. Furthermore, paragraph 22 of the\n            Panel's Operating Procedures provides that the Panel\n            Chairperson will not register Requests if he or she finds\n            that the Request is without doubt manifestly outside the\n            Panel's mandate. Because the Projects closed,\n            respectively, on June 30, 1988, and June 30, 1994, the Panel\n            is not registering the Request in the Panel's Register,\n            and is advising the Requesters of this decision."}, "docdt": "2007-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
