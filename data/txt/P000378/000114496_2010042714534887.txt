increase in the disbursement percentages for two Categories of expenditures financed 
under the Loan, namely, Categories (3) and (4)(b) of the table set forth in paragraph

The other Categories remain as stated in the letter from the Bank dated December

The definition of "Subsidiary Financing" in Section 1.01 (p) is to read:
"(p) 'Subsidiary Financing' means a loan made or proposed to be made to a 
local 
collectivity by CFC, out of the proceeds of the Loan, for an income 
generating project (a 
sub-project) in accordance with Section 2.02 (a) (ii) of 
this Agreement;"
A new definition 'sub-project' is added as Section 1.01 (q) to read:
Page  2
"(q) 'sub-project' means an income-generating project to be financed in 
part by a 
Subsidiary Financing under Part A.4 of the Project; and"
 
The existing definition "CFA Franc" or "CFAF" set forth in Section 1.01(q) is 
now set forth in Section 1.01 (r).
Please indicate your agreement to the foregoing amendments by signing and dating 
the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to us.
Very truly yours,
