1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

At the time of project appraisal in 2000, Bulgaria was three years into the four-year
government mandate given in 1997 to its first strongly reform-minded administration
since transition (the next parliamentary elections were scheduled for mid-2001). Key
accomplishments during this period included the achievement of macroeconomic stability
following the hyperinflation of 1997, a large-scale privatization effort, and the initiation
of talks over EU accession (ultimately achieved in January 2007). After the sharp
economic collapse of the mid-1990s, economic growth was also restored.

The health sector also underwent very ambitious, wholesale reforms in the late 1990s. At
the heart of these measures was the replacement of the old-style Semashko system (with
budget funding and public ownership) with a new model that separated the purchaser and
provider functions in health care. Key legislation had created the National Health
Insurance Fund as the payment agency in 1998, and the Medical Institutions Act which
granted economic, legal, and financial independence to health care establishments.
Doctors and hospitals became independent contractors of the NHIF instead of salaried
employees of public institutions. The first National Framework Contract was signed in
2000, and established the prices and basic benefit package for which providers would be
reimbursed. The central tenet of these reforms was that replacing input-based budget
funding with activity-based funding would improve incentives for the delivery of
efficient, quality health services. This approach was in line with reforms adopted in
many other countries in the region.

The rationale for a World Bank-financed project was that significant investments and
external expertise would be required in order to support the new purchasing agency and
providers as they adapted to a very new and different health sector landscape. It was
recognized that in order to succeed, the National Framework Contract would require an
enabling environment including investments in IT systems, training, better equipment to
be able to deliver the benefit package to the satisfaction of the public, and external
expertise to help with the implementation of the new payment system. There was also a
strategic decision that engaging the World Bank would improve the likelihood that the
government would stay the course on its own health reform agenda. As such, the project
was closely linked with the Updated Government Program for health reform described in
the PAD (p.4).

The project was consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (1998), which
had identified as one of its priority areas "to raise levels and standards of social service
delivery to EU norms, and protect the poor and vulnerable during transition". In the
health sector, the CAS goal cited in the PAD was "to stop deterioration of the health
status of the population and gradually improve to Western Europeans standards". The



                                               1

World Bank already supported a health project, the Health Restructuring Project,
approved in 1996. It focused on primary health care, blood transfusion services, and
emergency medical services and was approaching its Closing Date when the follow-on
Health Sector Reform Project was under preparation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

As stated in the PAD, the Health Sector Reform Project's development objective was "to
support the Government of Bulgaria in implementing a fundamental reform of its health
sector, designed to improve access to quality health services and ensure financial and
operational sustainability. Through revised funding, provider organization, and provider
payment mechanisms, as well as the formulated package of benefits, the health system
will provide better access to more effective and efficient health care and health
promotion, especially for disadvantaged population groups and those in the remote areas"
(p.2).

The PAD identified specific performance indicators addressing the activities under each
of the sub-objectives. Under (a) access, indicators were specified for the following areas
of activity: increasing access to services, improving the quality of services, improving
capacity of providers, and improving communications with the public. Under (b)
ensuring financial and operational sustainability, indicators or qualitative analyses were
specified for: ensuring financial sustainability through labor adjustment, improving
information flows, and ensuring a fully-functioning health insurance system.

The key outcome indicators were as follows: (i) ability to implement reform within a
fixed percent of GDP spent on health care annually; (ii) administrative costs of NHIF as a
percentage of total revenue; (iii) operating surplus-deficit of NHIF; (iv) health
expenditures per capita by category of health provider; (v) percentage of population who
report that basic package of health care services is available to them within one hour from
home; (vi) percentage of population who report that health care services were provided
without coercion to provide extra payments or gifts.

The key output indicators were as follows: (i) number of physicians and other medical
personnel receiving severance payments; (ii) unit costs for specific services; (iii) number
of GP offices and hospitals equipped with information system technologies; (iv) premium
collection rates, number of subscriber registrations by location, utilization rates per
provider, and reimbursements to physicians; (v) number of GPs contracted with NHIF;
(vi) percentage of Roma who report satisfactory or better access to and treatment by GPs;
(vii) number of municipalities with current contracts to lease medical equipment to GPs;
(viii) medical audit results; (ix) disbursements and repayments to the investment program
for physicians and hospitals; (x) percentage of respondents who report being registered
with or knowing how to register with a GP, being aware of benefits provided and
expected OOP expenses for provision of services, and being aware of hotlines for
information and complaints.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification


                                              2

Although the project was restructured three times (discussed below in section 1.7), the
PDO remained the same. The restructurings were "corrective" in the sense that they
occurred as a result of weak commitment to the original design following changes in
government, and thus the project suffered from slow implementation.

There were no changes to the key outcome indicators, but four output indicators were
dropped and four were added. The dropped indicators were: (i) number of physicians and
other medical personnel receiving severance payments; (ii) unit costs for specific
services; (iii) medical audit results; and (iv) percentage of respondents who report being
registered with or knowing how to register with a GP, being aware of benefits provided
and expected OOP expenses for provision of services, and being aware of hotlines for
information and complaints.

The first one was dropped because the relevant subcomponent, the Labor Adjustment
Strategy, was dropped from the project. The second one was ill-conceived and never
fully articulated, and was likely dropped because unit costs were too difficult and costly
to measure with accuracy. The medical audits would also appear too costly to carry out,
and the proposed measurement approach (comparing practices that received equipment
with those who did not) became obsolete once all practices received equipment. The last
indicator was dropped because it was not tracked in baseline surveys, making any
progress impossible to measure. These questions were not explored in the end-of-project
household survey.

The four new indicators were as follows: (a) improvement of key efficiency indicators
responsive to the payment system: average length of stay and in-patient admissions per
100; (b) development of clinical care pathways or other related system to finance in-
patient services; (c) the national fleet of emergency medical vehicles are renewed; (d)
agreement with restructured facilities to monitor certain performance indicators as part of
financing plan.

The first two indicators were added because they captured a dimension of NHIF reform
that could be easily measured. The last two indicators were introduced to help monitor
new activities that were added during project re-structuring.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The intended project beneficiaries were to be the whole population of Bulgaria (including
minority and rural populations). Since the project was systemic in nature, and included
(for example, and inter alia) equipment for almost every primary health care clinic in the
country, this is an accurate assessment. Other program components that had nationwide
implications (and therefore population-wide beneficiaries) included IT systems and
training related to NHIF payment systems for the publicly-financed benefit package.


                                                3

The main organizational beneficiary was to be the NHIF, for whom the new IT system
was arguably the project's most important deliverable. Following project re-structuring,
other distinct organizational beneficiaries also emerged, as components were added to do
civil works at Alexandrovska and Maichin dom hospitals in Sofia, one-day surgery
centers in Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna, and municipal hospitals in Razgrad, Isperih, Kubrat,
Chirpan, and Radnevo.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The PAD described the components financed under the project as follows:

Primary and Ambulatory Care Reform is designed to facilitate the reform and
sustainability of the primary and ambulatory care sector. It includes providing practice
equipment for primary health care, funding physician office information systems,
providing training in GP practice management, funding a public information campaign to
inform the public about changes in the ambulatory care system, financing a health reform
investment program to provide low-interest loans for physicians, and funding a labor
adjustment strategy to transition surplus physicians out of the health sector in Bulgaria.

Hospital Care Reform is designed to facilitate the reform and sustainability of the
hospital care sector. It involves support for the implementation of reform of the hospital
system, including funding hospital information systems, providing training in hospital
management, funding a public information campaign to inform the public about changes
in the hospital care system, financing a health reform investment program to provide low-
interest loans to hospitals that make desired investments in new equipment and facilities,
and funding a labor adjustment strategy to transition surplus hospital staff out of the
health sector in Bulgaria.

Health Financing/NHIF will ensure a smoothly functioning health insurance
administration in Bulgaria. It would assist the National Health Insurance Fund in
establishing the technological infrastructure required to operate the national health
insurance system, including the extensive hardware and software systems needed, as well
as the training and technical assistance required to implement and maintain them.

Capacity Building is designed to strengthen the management and institutional capacity
within the Ministry of Health, the National Health Insurance Fund, and the health system
generally. It would fund project management and financial management, monitoring and
evaluation activity. It will also provide funds for the general training of NHIF, Regional
and local staff, and finance an essential public information campaign to inform
Bulgarians of the significant changes that will be taking place within their health care
system and advise them of how these changes will improve the overall delivery and
effectiveness of health care.

Table 1 shows the project components, with their original and actually disbursed WB
allocations. It highlights the significant reallocations across sub-components. Detailed
descriptions of each subcomponent appear in Annex 2 of the PAD.

The expected causal linkages with the PDO were as follows. Investments in equipment
and training for primary and hospital care (1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 2.1, and 2.4) were mainly
intended to improve access to quality care. The labor adjustment strategy (1.3 and 2.2)
was designed to address a perceived excess of labor in the sector, and thus to improve
efficiency and sustainability. The information systems (1.4 and 2.3) were rolled out to
support the new provider payment mechanism (e.g., through electronic submission of
medical claims to NHIF), and ultimately to achieve financial and operational
sustainability in the health sector. The same objective was the primary purpose of the
NHIF information system, training, and software development components (3.1, 3.2, and
4.1). The TA subcomponent (4.2) embraced a range of activities related to all aspects of
the PDO. The health information subcomponent (4.3) was targeted largely at the
operational sustainability aspect of the PDO. The quality of care capacity building
activities (4.4) were aimed at improving access to quality services as stated in the PDO.

1.6 Revised Components


                                               5

During project implementation, revisions were made in terms of allocations; however, the
only new subcomponent was Hospital Restructuring (2.5).

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The initially agreed project total value to be financed by IBRD was US$63.3m. At the
time that the loan agreement was signed, the total value in Euro was 68.9m. In addition
there was approximately 25.8m estimated to be financed by Government. Actual co-
financing was about 11.7m, with an additional 2.3m still to be spent after project
closure by the Borrower for recurrent costs of NHIF's IT system and other activities.
Thus, about 11m of co-financing never materialized, in part because the Labor
Adjustment Strategy was deemed no longer necessary. However, the Borrower
purchased additional ambulances based on the same tender process used for project-
financed ambulances after project closure.

The project was restructured three times, but none of these was formal and did not require
Board approval, as they did not entail any changes to the PDO or to the intended project
outcomes.

The first restructuring took place in April 2004. The government that took office in 2001
developed a new strategy for hospital sector restructuring in 2002, and indicated a
preference for re-orienting the project by shifting allocations from primary care to
hospital reform. It was argued that challenges in the primary care sector had been
resolved sooner than anticipated, while hospital reform would require greater attention.
The changes also entailed a sharp reduction in training activities, as it was argued that
these were either not necessary and/or should be the responsibility of newly-independent
providers.

Major changes in allocations included a reduction of funding for (i) UNICEF equipment
for primary care; (ii) GP management training; (iii) training for hospital administrators;
(iv) NHIF IT document workflow program; and (v) backup power supply. Instead, funds
were reallocated for the following new activities: (i) TA to develop a long-term strategy
for the hospital sector; (ii) hospital restructuring of national and municipal facilities,
including introduction of 1-day surgery centers, civil works at Alexandrovska
(laboratory) and Maichin dom hospitals in Sofia, and municipal hospitals in Razgrad,
Isperih, Kubrat, Chirpan, and Radnevo; and (iii) training of managers and specialists for
municipal health care (eventually cancelled).

The second restructuring took place in April 2005. This included an extension of the
Closing Date from September 30, 2005 until March 31, 2007. The main reasons behind
this restructuring were to accelerate disbursement, meet the perceived immediate
priorities of the sector and in particular hospital reform, and to consolidate and simplify
the major project tasks. The second restructuring reinforced the trend started in the first



                                                6

restructuring, namely, to shift project allocations from primary care to hospital care, and
to reduce training allocations.

Major changes in allocations included a reduction of funding for (i) GP and nurse
training; (ii) out-patient investment program; (iii) hospital hardware and software supply
(due to savings); (iv) training for hospital managers, nurses, and DRGs; and (v) other
minor changes. Instead, funding allocations were increased for: (i) medical equipment
for the hospital revolving fund; (ii) hospital repair works; (iii) NHIF software
development; (iv) NHIF IT training; (v) funding for a new activity, namely, civil works
to the neurology and psychiatric clinics at Alexandrovska hospital in Sofia; and (vi) an IT
consultant to assist NHIF in working with the software development company.

The third restructuring was finalized in January 2007. This included a second extension
of the Closing Date, from March 31, 2007 until June 30, 2008. This restructuring was
done largely in response to the need to accelerate disbursement and to adjust priorities
given the implementation lags related to the NHIF software development activity.

Major changes in allocations included a cancellation of the following activities: (i) TA to
assess health needs and resources in 28 regions (due to the addition of master plan
development noted below); (ii) development of a disaster back-up center for the NHIF
(since this could not be done until the main system was completed); (iii) upgrade of
NHIF servers (done by the government); (iv) IT training for NHIF (deemed unnecessary);
(v) training on DRGs (premature given the policy environment); and (vi) nurse training.
Instead, funding was allocated to the following new activities: (i) supply of emergency
vehicles; (ii) upgrade of the blood transfusion system; (iii) development of a hospital
master-plan; and (iv) TA to support the new pharmaceutical law.

Lastly, in June 2008, there were some final amendments to the loan agreement, including
reallocation of loan proceeds across categories, and a third extension of the Closing Date
until October 31, 2008. This was done in order to ensure the completion of the NHIF IT
software, one of the project's major deliverables.



2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The project had a number of significant strengths in preparation and design that
suggested good prospects for success at the time of approval. First, there was strong
ownership of the project. Ambitious health reform had already started in the late 1990s,
with several key pieces of legislation already passed (e.g., the National Health Insurance
Fund had been created and premiums were being collected). An Updated Government
Program had been released prior to project appraisal in early 2000 that identified priority
areas that in turn were reflected in project components. The Minister was actively
involved in project preparation. Successful reform efforts had been carried out by the


                                                7

same government in other sectors. The policy environment at the time of project
approval was very supportive of project activities and goals.

Second, extensive background analysis had been conducted. A PHRD grant had been
used to contract preparatory work by the Australian Health Insurance Commission to
examine a range of technical issues including financial modeling for insurance,
information systems, legal aspects, training programs, and public information campaigns.
The analytical work contracted by the Swiss Development Cooperation and USAID was
also integrated into preparation activities.

Third, there was a strong rationale for Bank involvement. The ambitious reform effort
implied significant investment needs (e.g., IT systems to make an output (service)-based
health financing model functional) for which Bank financing could play a key supportive
role. Equally important, as recalled by key government players at the time, the Borrower
recognized that significant external expertise would be required to provide guidance on
technical aspects of the reform effort, and drawing on the government budget to finance
international-standard consulting services would have been extremely difficult. From a
strategic standpoint, the Borrower believed that Bank engagement would provide a
crucial signal to stakeholders that there would be follow-through on health reform
commitments.

Finally, prospects for a successful program at the outset were also enhanced by the
existence of a well-performing set of investment operations (four) in the social sectors.
The Health Reform project was also consistent with the 1998 CAS framework.

However, there were also notable shortcomings in project design, which eventually
resulted in significant project implementation challenges.

First, the project was very complex and ambitious. The PDO statement includes
essentially every possible health system objective: access, quality, and sustainability,
with additional references to efficiency and equity. Components embraced primary care
and hospitals; payment and provision; efficiency and quality; capital and training; and so
on. The centerpiece was to build an IT infrastructure to support the health reforms,
which would be a complicated project in its own right, but added to this were disparate
topics ranging from equipment procurement to human resource retrenchment. To achieve
all this in five years was clearly optimistic. This is despite the fact that the "lessons
learned" from other ECA health projects cited in the PAD (p.13) acknowledges the
pitfalls of over-optimism and projects that are too complex. However, it should be noted
that this very broad agenda preceded the project, and was not created by it. The
government had set its ambitions high, and it was decided that the project would be
designed to embrace most of this agenda in order to play a supporting role across the full
range of activities.

Second, the monitoring and evaluation framework contained significant weaknesses, as
discussed in a later section (2.3).

Third, certain key risks to project success were under-appreciated or inadequately
mitigated. Two key risks that became prominent during implementation ­ a lack of
political will to optimize hospital infrastructure, and unsustainable cost growth due to the
introduction of uncapped fee-for-service reimbursement ­ were recognized in the PAD
but risk minimization measures were unconvincing (e.g., unclear references to `proven
effective approaches'). Ultimately these had to be addressed partly through the DPL
framework.1 Lastly, the change in government during scheduled elections that took place
less than one year after project approval would prove to seriously undermine project and
reform ownership, but was not acknowledged as a risk during appraisal.


2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

The major factors affecting implementation exerted a largely negative impact on progress
towards project objectives, and mainly reflected developments that took place at the
government level (including MoH) as opposed to the implementing agency level (PMU).

First, there were two changes in government during project life, and these posed major
obstacles to implementation. The first change followed elections in mid-2001, less than
one year after project effectiveness, and entailed a major loss of project and reform
ownership. Indeed, the entire reform effort, including the establishment of NHIF and
transition towards social insurance, was called into question. New legislation was passed
in 2002 affecting the original Health Insurance Act and Medical Institutions Act of the
late 1990s and the changes effectively undermined prospects for selective contracting of
providers by NHIF as well as hospital closure, both of which were key elements of the
reform architecture. In the subsequent 18 months, very little was achieved, contracts
were left unpaid, and the project was rated Unsatisfactory. The second change of
government took place in mid-2005. Key actors reported similarities between the two
changes in government with respect to project activities. In both cases, incoming
administrations called into question the financial conditions of the loan (i.e., interest rate),
the consistency of the project's activities with their own reform priorities, and the probity
of project contracts, before ultimately (after significant time had been lost) beginning to
reshape the project in accordance with their own priorities.

In addition to three governments during project life, there were also five Ministers of
Health and eight NHIF directors. The resulting challenge to continuity was perhaps (and
unfortunately) inevitable when project implementation lasts eight years. In large part due
to the government changes, and as described above, the project underwent major
restructuring three times during the course of implementation. The wisdom of these



1The later years of HSRP coincided with the implementation of the Social Sectors Institutional Reform
Development Policy Loan during 2007-2009. The health component of this operation focused on policy
reform in the areas of hospital financing, pharmaceutical policy, and development of a hospital master plan.

restructurings is discussed in the section addressing Bank performance with regard to
supervision.

The most complex project activity was the development of an integrated IT system for
the NHIF, and this encountered significant obstacles that posed major challenges to
project implementation. In particular, the government had already started Phases I and II
of software development (using its own funds) prior to project effectiveness, and the plan
was for HSRP to follow up by supporting Phases III and IV. However, the contractor
responsible for Phases I and II failed to deliver its work under controversial and much-
publicized circumstances in 2002, and the ensuing political fall-out was such that the
entire effort was stalled for a number of years. The project had to take on responsibility
for software development almost from scratch, and it was not until 2005 that this activity
­ among the most critical to project success ­ was re-launched.

Lastly, there were some other factors that affected implementation in the case of the large
hospital civil works at Alexandrovska in Sofia funded by the project. These included a
roof fire just prior to the commencement of renovations, and the realization that there was
a significant amount of water in the ground beneath the construction site. Both required
changes to design that entailed delays.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project's monitoring and evaluation framework was weak from the outset and
continued to suffer from shortcomings during the course of implementation.

Design

Shortcomings in M&E design include the following:

·   In the PAD (pp.26-30), many indicator targets are established without knowing yet
    the baseline values. For example, there are several statements such as "baseline TBD,
    target 80% improvement over baseline". Identifying quantitative targets in the
    absence of information related to the situation ex-ante is not a best practice.
·   The trade-offs between objectives such as efficiency, access, and quality are not
    addressed. For example, implementing reform within a fixed percent of GDP (PDO
    indicator #1) has implications for both (financial) access, and provider demands for
    informal payments, both of which were also project indicators.
·   Several indicators are not well linked to project activities. For example, indicators
    1.3 (health expenditures per capita by category of provider) and 2.2 (percent of
    population reporting that services were provided without coercion to provide extra
    payments or gifts) do not appear directly relevant to a project focused on the
    provision of an IT infrastructure to support health insurance, and equipment and
    training for providers.
·   The key indicator related to access, the percent of population who report that the
    basic package of services is available within one hour from home (2.1), suffers from



                                              10

    several problems: (i) the one-hour threshold is high (facility master planning often
    strives for 15 minutes), and indeed does not appear in project monitoring indicators;
    (ii) it is poorly linked to project activities (the project was not constructing new
    facilities); (iii) it seems to confuse access and quality (since the relevant activity
    would seem to be the equipment components; and (iv) again there is a targeted
    improvement (20-25%) without knowing a baseline value.
·   Certain indicators were too difficult and/or costly to measure, such as unit costs for
    (undefined) specific services (indicator 1.1.2) and medical audit results (2.2.2), and
    would ultimately be dropped.
·   The indicators related to the quality of health services (2.2) focused on inputs such as
    the provision of equipment without adequately identifying outputs or outcomes.
·   The four indicators related to ensuring a fully functioning health insurance system
    (1.3.1) are unclear and poorly justified. For three out of four, no targets are
    identified.
·   In March 2007, a review of implementation status by the ECA Quality unit identified
    numerous problems with the PDO indicators, largely reflecting shortcomings in the
    original design of the M&E framework that persisted throughout implementation.

Implementation

Although M&E was rated `Satisfactory' in the implementation status reports during
project effectiveness, this would appear to be inconsistent with other project-related
correspondence. For example, in August 2006, the task team leader wrote to the project
director and stated that drafting a progress report was difficult due to the incomplete and
out-of-date reporting on the project monitoring indicators. In recent health project
supervision missions it had been suggested that the PMU collect the available
information with its own resources or contract a local specialist to do this for the
Ministry, but there had been no reports on progress in this area.

Household surveys carried out in order to track project indicators were a good M&E tool
and collected some useful information on population experiences and attitudes related to
the health sector. However, these were not always consistent over time with respect to
questions asked or indicators collected. They were also insufficient for producing
reliable information "by region and socioeconomic status", as stipulated in the PAD for
several indicators.

Lastly, despite extensive re-orientation of project activities during the three
restructurings, only minor changes were made to the M&E framework during
implementation.

Utilization

In view of the shortcomings related to M&E design and implementation, there is little
evidence in project documentation that the M&E framework was actively used to guide
decision-making during project implementation.




                                                11

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The only applicable safeguard pertained to an environmental management plan prepared
by the Borrower as required by a Board condition. This ensured compliance with
Bulgaria's own laws regarding construction materials for civil works and the disposal of
waste. Safeguard compliance was rated Satisfactory throughout project life.

Procurement and financial management were rated Satisfactory for nearly the entire
project life.2 Nearly 200 contracts were signed in total. Key challenges included long
delays in the procurement of the NHIF IT system (for reasons cited in Section 2.2) and
delays in civil works contracts due to technical flaws in the original designs (also
discussed above). There was no evidence of major deviations from procurement
guideline requirements.

The World Bank's institutional integrity unit (INT) is investigating allegations of
corruption regarding the award of several contracts for the delivery of medical equipment
for an approximate amount of US$4 million as well as similar allegations regarding a
consulting contract for approximately US$400,000, all awarded during the period 2001-
2003. INT's investigation is nearly completed and it expects to provide its investigative
findings to both Bank officials and the respective governments in the near future.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The key requirement for post-completion continuation of the project's investments will
be recurrent budget funding for maintaining equipment and civil works, and ongoing
support for adjustments to the NHIF IT system. It is expected that these funds will be
committed. Specific issues related to sustainability are addressed in Section 4 below.

Many of the performance indicators monitored as part of the project will remain relevant
during the post-completion phase.

No follow-on investment operation is planned. However, the project's objectives remain
relevant to the policy issues being addressed in the Bank's ongoing DPL operation in
Bulgaria. This is an important vehicle for addressing the key challenges in Bulgaria's
health sector as it confronts the next generation of required reforms.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project development objectives (PDOs) were, and still are, highly relevant to
Bulgaria's health reforms. Despite the numerous changes to project activities as well as
changes in government, the objectives of improved access, quality and sustainability in
the health sector remain relevant today. Indeed, all three themes appear in the health
strategy adopted by Parliament at the end of 2008. In addition, balancing access, quality,
and sustainability of the health sector is a constant theme in health reform in almost all
EU countries, and in many ways Bulgaria has received a rapid introduction into that
reality during the project's lifetime. EU membership entails certain responsibilities with
regard to the quality of health services available, while the fiscal criteria for joining the
euro have indirect but clear implications for health sector spending efficiency. Thus, the
continued relevance of the project's objectives to Bulgaria is clear.

The project objectives also remain relevant to the continued dialogue between the Bank
and Government. Although engagement has shifted towards policy-based lending, the
issue of the sustainability of social sector spending remains a key priority, especially as
growth slows amidst significant economic uncertainty. The themes addressed by the
project also appear in the prevailing Country Partnership Strategy (2006-09).

Most aspects of project design and implementation also remain relevant. The broad
outlines of reform that were supported by the project ­ namely, the introduction of a
purchaser-provider split and the replacement of input-based budget funding with activity-
based funding, brought Bulgaria in line with most other European countries (reformers in
the east and more mature systems in the west). Thus, project activities such as IT system
development (hardware and software for purchaser and provider) to enable this reform
were and still remain essential components of a revamped health system. In view of the
significant investment needs in the sector, equipment purchases for primary and hospital
care, upgrading of the ambulance fleet, and hospital civil works also remain relevant.
Indeed, the substantial project restructurings, and in particular the shift in focus from
primary to hospital care, helped ensure project relevance over time and through changes
in government.

One aspect of the relevance of project design that remains an open question relates to the
possible adoption of a competitive insurance model to replace the single-payer NHIF
system currently in place. The project focused significant effort on NHIF institutional
capacity building, and the impact of these activities would be compromised if NHIF was
broken up. However, it is likely that even in a multiple insurance model, NHIF would
remain in tact as a key player, albeit increasingly in competition with other actors.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)




                                                13

The two major project objectives were (i) to improve access to quality health services;
and (ii) ensure financial and operational sustainability. These are very broad, and thus in
order to infer whether or not they have been achieved it is necessary to refer to the key
associated outcome targets.

As noted, the PAD identified specific performance indicators for each sub-objective as
follows. Under (a) access, indicators were specified for the following areas of activity:
increasing access to services, improving the quality of services, improving capacity of
providers, and improving communications with the public. Under b) ensuring financial
and operational sustainability, indicators or qualitative analyses were specified for:
ensuring financial sustainability through labor adjustment, improving information flows,
and ensuring a fully-functioning health insurance system.

There are two outcome targets related to improving access to quality health services. The
first is "percentage of population who report that basic health services are accessible".
The second is "percentage of population who report that health care services are provided
without coercion to provide extra payments or gifts". As noted in the M&E discussion
above, these indicators are poorly linked with project activities, and pre- and post-project
values of the first indicator cannot be directly compared due to changes in survey
questionnaires. Nevertheless, available data suggest that neither physical access nor
financial access has changed significantly over the project's life (see Table 2 below and
Data Sheet), and out-of-pocket payments remain significant (see WHO data cited below).
Similarly, neither perceptions of corruption (data not shown) nor the reported frequency
of making under-the-table payments (see table) have changed much over the years.

Although the selected indicators emphasized access, in view of project activities the
objective "to improve access to quality health services" is more appropriately viewed
through the lens of quality. The project made substantial investments in medical
equipment for both primary and hospital level care throughout the country, as well as
civil works for selected hospitals. Table 2 has further details. Although making a link
with improved health outcomes is not possible, these are key output indicators to which
the project made important contributions. Investment needs in the Bulgarian health
sector remain significant at present, and quality is a critical issue, but in the absence of
the project these gaps would likely have been even larger.

            hospitals received upgraded blood transfusion equipment
            - 259 ambulances purchased


The second major project objective, to ensure financial and operational sustainability, had
several associated outcome indicators. Data is shown in Table 3. Overall Bulgaria has
succeeded in keeping public health expenditures lower than in most EU countries (4.1%
of GDP compared to 6.7% in the EU), but with potential implications for overall quality
and financial protection (for example, out-of-pocket spending as a share of total health
expenditure in Bulgaria is estimated at 38%, compared to 25% in new EU member states
and 17% in the EU as a whole).3

The financial health of NHIF has been maintained over the course of the project, as
indicated by its administrative costs and operational surplus (see table). Some of the
success in ensuring NHIF's financial viability is due to hospital financing reforms
introduced in 2007-08, which imposed budget ceilings on hospitals in order to close an
open-ended fee-for-service reimbursement policy that led to rapidly increasing costs.
The project contributed technical assistance (consulting services) to further refine this
reform, which was also supported through the DPL policy matrix. This was one of
several helpful synergies between the HSRP and concurrent policy operations in
Bulgaria.

The introduction of an integrated IT system (launched January 1st 2009) will make a
strong contribution to the sustainability of NHIF's activities, both in terms of providing
an audit function (eliminating fraudulent claims) and as a policy instrument
(incentivizing cost-effective service delivery, deterring excessive hospital referrals, etc.).
Significant improvements in both these respects are already anticipated for 2009.
Overall, the development of NHIF's IT system in the face of the numerous obstacles
outlined above was one of the most important achievements of the HSRP project.

The share of health spending allocated to inpatient care has not declined, and indeed the
project itself shifted its focus in favor of hospital care as a result of the restructurings,
which in turn reflected the priorities of the new government that took office in 2001.

Overall, achievement of project objectives can be summarized as follows. The
improvement of access was an ill-conceived objective that was poorly linked to project
activities, and has not improved significantly during project implementation. The
improvement of quality is strongly suggested by the significant investments of the
project, although ultimately this is proof of outputs, not outcomes. The accomplishment
of financial and operational sustainability is the strongest achievement of the project.
Public spending on health is relatively low, NHIF is in good financial health, and with the
new IT system, it has the tools to exert considerable control over health spending in
Bulgaria. The transition to an output-based financing model and purchaser-provider split
­ the support of which represented the central purpose of the project ­ has been achieved.
But the next generation of reforms await implementation.




                                               16

A narrow focus on indicators can distract from the bigger picture of health system
performance in Bulgaria. But the broader trends also have parallels with the successes
and failures of the project. As of today, the sector has succeeded in maintaining a low
level of health spending and NHIF's institutional capacity and fiscal responsibility are
noteworthy. But out-of-pocket spending remains high, governance problems abound,
there are significant investment needs in order to improve quality, hospital rationalization
has been slow, and additional attention needs to be focused on the primary care level after
several years of emphasis on hospitals.


3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Many project activities made an important contribution to improving the efficiency of the
Bulgaria health sector. The new IT system for NHIF opens the door to very large
efficiency gains with respect to both its audit and policy functions (as noted above). It
also sharply reduced the need for NHIF staff as paper reporting has been eliminated
(there are now about 2000 employees, compared to 3000 at one time and 4500 as an
original estimate of needs). Technical assistance under the project proposes refinements
to a global budget mechanism for hospitals to restrain rapid and inefficient hospital
spending growth, and this was used to develop the 2009 budget. There are also examples
outside the NHIF sphere. A hospital master plan has been developed with project
funding, and although it has not yet been implemented, it points the way towards a more
efficient health sector. Civil works at municipal hospitals included steps to improve
energy efficiency. The hospital revolving fund allowed hospitals to obtain equipment at
substantially lower prices than otherwise due to centralized competitive purchasing by
the Ministry. Maintenance of the old, outdated ambulance fleet cost 2.1m leva annually
(about 1m euros), whereas the replacement fleet has a three-year unlimited miles
warranty. The project also introduced the concept of one-day surgeries to Bulgaria (three
such centers were established in Sofia, Plovdiv, and Varna), whereas previously the same
patients could be hospitalized for up to ten days.

On the other hand there were aspects of project implementation that fell short of
achieving maximum value for money. The project's duration of eight years imposed an
additional administrative burden on both the Borrower and the Bank, although actual
project management costs remained similar to PAD projections despite the longer
implementation period.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderate Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating for the HSRP project is Moderately Satisfactory. This is
based on a judgment that project relevance was and remains high, that there were



                                             17

moderate shortcomings in its achievement of objectives, and minor shortcomings in
project efficiency.

With respect to relevance, the objectives to balance financial sustainability with quality
and access have withstood the changes in government in Bulgaria (as shown by their
endorsement by the new health strategy adopted by Parliament in December 2008), and
they are an enduring characteristic of virtually all EU health systems. The project design
also remains highly relevant, as the various ingredients of an output-based financing
model and purchaser/provider split, as well as significant investment needs in all levels of
infrastructure, are still essential components of a modernized Bulgarian health sector.

With respect to the achievement of objectives, the project made several important
contributions to the financial and operational sustainability of the Bulgarian health sector,
as described in the earlier section. The project's contribution to improving access to
quality health services was comparatively weaker. The associated outcome indicators
emphasized access, but this is poorly linked to actual project activities. The project made
important contributions with respect to equipment and infrastructure that have likely had
a positive impact on the system's quality, but the evidence limits us to a discussion of
outputs rather than outcomes.

With respect to efficiency, the project made significant contributions across a number of
fronts to the value for money achieved by the Bulgarian health sector. However, the
project also took eight years to implement.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty and equity considerations were not central to the PDO statement nor to the key
outcome indicators that were monitored during implementation. This is not mandatory
under Bank operational policy, and the project was focused on system-wide and
institutional measures. No explicit analysis has been undertaken on this issue. The
baseline survey includes information on socio-economic status of respondents, but
follow-up surveys do not.

One intermediate outcome indicator monitored the satisfaction with the health system of
the Roma minority. A comparison of 2004 and 2008 shows little change (see data sheet).
This indicator appears poorly linked to actual project activities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The project made a significant impact on NHIF's institutional capacity. It was a very
new organization at the time the project started. Today it is a key player in the Bulgarian
health sector, managing the large majority of the country's health spending in a fiscally



                                               18

responsible way, and it has at its disposal in the form of the IT system a useful tool to
enhance the efficiency and quality of health care provision.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project has served as an example of best practices that have been used elsewhere in
the health sector. For example, the procurement of ambulances and hospital equipment
using the government's own resources outside the context of the project used the same
tendering procedures as those used under the HSRP. The hospital software purchased
under the project for public hospitals has also been bought by private hospitals and
facilitates the interface with NHIF. Also, the operational manual for the hospital
equipment revolving fund has also been used in the context of EU funds.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcomes achieved through the HSRP operation is rated as
Moderate. There are a number of possible sources of risk to the sustainability of
outcomes, but the probability and potential impact of such risks are deemed to warrant a
rating of moderate.

There are certain risks to the project's achievements with respect to financial and
operational sustainability. The NHIF IT system has a warranty period and there is
funding for recurrent costs at least over the short-term,4 but ownership rests with the
MoH and not with NHIF. The sustainability of this IT system ­ one of the project's
strongest achievements ­ would be significantly enhanced if NHIF was given full
responsibility for its use (for example, so that it can negotiate and ensure adequate
maintenance and support contracts). A disaster back-up facility for the IT system ­
originally part of the project but postponed in order to concentrate on the main system ­
will also need to be developed. In general, IT is a dynamic sector and staff turnover can
be high, requiring persistent effort to maintain an updated system. This applies equally to
NHIF as well as hospital software and hardware improvements implemented under the
project. Recurrent costs for provider (GP and hospital) hardware and software are not
estimated to be onerous.

The recent introduction of hospital budget ceilings is being done on a year-to-year basis
by the NHIF and has yet to become more firmly entrenched. More broadly, system
sustainability will require hospital rationalization and possibly the introduction of

4Recurrent budget needs are estimated to be 1m in 2009, 2m in 2010, and 3m in 2011 as the warranty
period winds down. These are manageable within the NHIF administrative budget.



                                                 19

selective contracting. Finally, there is also increasing policy discussion of a possible shift
to a model of private insurance competition, with uncertain implications for the future
role of the NHIF.

With respect to the future of the project's civil works and equipment investments, there
are also some uncertainties. The current round of the $10-12m revolving fund which
leases equipment to hospitals under favorable financial conditions will end in 2009/10,
and its renewal under the government budget is not yet assured. Civil works investments
at the two Sofia and five municipal hospitals will require recurrent funding to be
sustained, which is likely.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)


5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
main strengths in quality at entry as noted above were strong ownership by government,
considerable background work, a coherent reform vision, a clear rationale for Bank
involvement, and good prospects for success as indicated by previously successful
projects in the sector. There were two shortcomings of note. The first was an M&E
framework with numerous weaknesses, as described earlier. This plagued the project
throughout its duration. The second was the project's excessively wide-ranging and
ambitious agenda, parts of which ultimately proved to be obsolete or unachievable.5
However, this complexity reflected the strategy laid out by government in the late 1990s,
and did not necessarily originate in project design.


(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory. Supervision
faced numerous challenges beyond the project's control, including shifting priorities of
new governments following elections, frequent personnel changes at MoH and NHIF,
and the controversy involving the government's earlier efforts to develop NHIF's IT
system (on which the project was supposed to build). When these events threatened to
derail project implementation and undermine PDO achievement in 2002, the project was
appropriately rated Unsatisfactory.


5The Quality Assurance Group undertook an evaluation of the project's quality at entry in early 2001. It
noted the complexity of the reforms being launched, but contains very few references to M&E.



                                                   20

In large part due to these events, the major supervision challenge was project
restructuring. Although each restructuring entailed significant reallocations that meant
the project bore less and less resemblance to its original design, they also reflected a
realism and flexibility that changes were necessary if any progress was to be made. The
alternative would have been cancellation. New activities, although not part of a coherent
whole as in the original design, were nevertheless addressing important individual
investment needs. Continued engagement also allowed for continued policy dialogue and
ensured that the project's consistent core activity ­ NHIF's IT system ­ was eventually
completed, making possible substantial improvements to the health financing system.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the ratings for quality at entry and quality of supervision, overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government performance (MoH) is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The broad
objectives of the project remained a priority throughout project life, and the general
vision of creating a purchaser/provider split with a well-equipped payment agency
reimbursing care from autonomous providers has endured at least up until now. But
ownership of project activities was not consistent over time. Changes in government
proved to be very disruptive to project activities, as incoming governments challenged
project rationale and implementation for both technical and political reasons. At times
the resolution of implementation issues took much too long. For 18 months in 2001-
2003, very little was accomplished due to the absence of government support for project
activities. Full achievement of project objectives was also compromised by a slow-
moving policy environment, as progress on the implementation of hospital rationalization
and selective contracting by NHIF (both presumed as eventual policy steps under project
design) continue to remain elusive.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Implementing agency performance (the PMU) is rated Satisfactory. The PMU
(essentially a four-person office subordinated to the MoH) was generally well managed,
committed to the development objectives of the project, and carried out wide-ranging
activities for a complex and ever-changing project. This was done despite extensive
periods during which the PMU endured weak government support. The implementation
of M&E arrangements was not consistent, however, as indicated by communication from




                                             21

the Bank supervision team in 2006 that urged for greater effort to collect data on key
performance indicators.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the ratings for government and the implementing agency (and following ICR
rating guidelines), overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.



6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Several lessons emerge from the HSRP project in Bulgaria that are relevant to future
World Bank operations.

·   Health reform projects should be less complex and more targeted. The HSRP
    covered everything from IT system development to equipment procurement to labor
    retrenchment strategies to hospital civil works, and much more. When the political
    and policy environment did not keep pace, the project stalled. Health reform is an on-
    going process ­ "a journey not a destination". More attention should be given to
    sequencing issues and projects should be designed accordingly.

·   Monitoring and evaluation frameworks should be well developed at the time of
    project effectiveness. Several aspects of the HSRP M&E framework lacked a clear
    link to project activities, and it was made in the absence of good baseline data.
    Surveys undertaken during project effectiveness were not consistent, making it
    difficult to compare data over time. A simple insistence on using the same core
    questionnaire in each survey from start to finish would be a big step forward.

·   Repeated project restructurings dilute project coherence. Project preparation can and
    should be done in a holistic way. Adding new activities through restructuring may be
    justifiable under broad and/or vague PDOs, but this does not mean they will become a
    seamless part of the original project vision. The HSRP increasingly became a
    shopping list ­ even if a needed one ­ that was not always consistent with the "sector
    reform" title. However, restructuring may also be a necessary course of action in
    order to maintain flexibility.

·   Although Bank-financed projects can not always be coordinated with election cycles,
    starting an ambitious health reform project less than one year before an election is
    fraught with risk. To the extent possible, reform projects should be mindful of
    electoral considerations.

·   There are valuable synergies between investment operations and DPLs that should be
    exploited wherever feasible. Investment projects can open policy dialogue and build


                                              22

    trust as a precursor to policy-based lending, as well as finance TA that can inform
    DPL activities once they are operational. DPLs can help shape the policy
    environment to maximize the return to a traditional project's investments.

·   Several lessons emerge regarding health IT system activities, as follows:

    o Perseverance, flexibility, strong technical assistance, constructive working
        relationships with contractors, continuous communications with stakeholders, and
        close engagement by high-level officials (e.g., Minister) in order to ensure tight
        contract management ­ these are all key components of a successful IT
        development process.
    o The success of a payment agency's IT system depends critically on the
        information systems deployed by health service providers. The insurance
        agency's approach to claim reimbursement cannot be implemented in isolation
        from the broader information systems that prevail at the provider level.
    o In addressing the linkages with provider IT systems, the insurance agency has
        three broad options: (i) provide the IT for providers; (ii) define interface standards
        for provider software to comply with; (iii) supplement interface standards with an
        "homologation" service to software product vendors, to periodically review and
        certify product compliance with the insurer's interface needs. The experience of
        the HSRP IT activities suggests that the third option strikes a desirable and
        practical balance between the first, more burdensome option and the second, more
        passive one.
    o Sustainability of an integrated IT system for health financing requires that
        ownership of the system rests with the agency responsible for its implementation
        ­ in Bulgaria, the NHIF. At present this remains unresolved.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The original PAD undertook a cost-benefit analysis resulting in an estimated net benefit
of about US$207m and a net present value of US$40m. These calculations were made on
the basis of total project costs (including co-financing), and compared the "with" and
"without" project scenarios. The key benefits identified in the PAD were NHIF staff
reductions due to the creation of the IT system, the overall health system staff reductions
due to the labor adjustment program (which was not implemented for reasons described
in the main text), and the quality and re-investment gains associated with the investment
programs (revolving funds). Other benefits were identified but not quantified in the cost-
benefit analysis, including reductions in average length of stay from health reforms, and
more effective use of pharmaceuticals.

A similar approach is undertaken here, but with several differences with regard to the
project benefits included in the analysis, in order to reflect project restructuring and other
considerations. A summary of key benefits and assumptions is shown in the table below.

Benefit                                      Notes and assumptions
NHIF IT system audit benefits                Conservative interpretation of NHIF initial simulations;
(reduction of fraudulent claims)             assumed 3% of 2008 in-patient spending could be saved
                                             due to IT system
NHIF IT system policy benefits               Conservative estimate of 1% of 2008 non-drug NHIF
(use of IT to reduce over-referrals,         spending can be saved
over-prescription, etc.)
NHIF staff reductions                        Current NHIF staffing is about 2,000 employees,
                                             compared to alternative of 4,500 assumed in PAD if IT
                                             system had not been developed
Lower equipment costs in revolving           Conservative estimate that equipment would have cost
funds due to centralized competitive 15% more if procured independently by hospitals, based
purchasing                                   on PIU information
Lower ambulance maintenance costs PIU reports maintenance of old fleet was BGN 2m
due to replacement of fleet                  annually, while new fleet has three year warranty

Several other benefits are not quantified due to a lack of reliable data or other reasons.
These include the gains in energy efficiency achieved through the civil works activities
(excluded due to lack of data); the benefits to be accrued in coming years through
implementation of the hospital financing reforms and hospital master-plan that were
procured as TA by the project (excluded since implementation has not yet begun); the
introduction of one-day surgeries to Bulgaria, and the associated reduction in average
length of stay (excluded due to lack of data); and the benefits of better health (excluded
due to the difficulty of attributing improvements in health outcomes to project activities
such as clinical guidelines, TA for quality assurance, civil works, etc.).6


6An international literature identifies a very high monetary value of an additional year of life, such that
even a very minor attribution of improved health to project activities could yield a high rate of return.



                                                     27

          The table below shows estimated net benefits using an approach that is comparable to the
          PAD analysis. Net benefits are estimated to be higher than originally anticipated (about

[DESCRIPTION OF COMPONENTS AS IN LOAN AGREEMENT]

AMENDMENT TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT ­ APRIL 2004

Changes in the health sector situation have occurred in the process of implementing the Project
based on in 2002 which the PSC proposed its restructuring. Some of the initially estimated as
essential problems like management of and investments in primary health care are comparatively
sooner resolved, while the hospital sector reform falls behind and requires special attention. This
imposes reconsidering the Project tasks and actualizing the activities set forth in its initial design
without c ontradicting t o t he P roject m ajor a ims a nd objectives. In 2002 M OH de fines the
following basic priorities: (1) restructure hospital care sector; (2) develop a long-term scheme
for management and financing of hospitals; (3) strengthen the emergency care; (4) finance
and implement the National programs, adopted by MOH; (5) improve health of vulnerable
groups o f s ociety ­ minorities, di sabled, suffering f rom psychic di seases e tc.; ( 6) f ight
distribution of HIV/AIDS; (7) Labor Adjustment Strategy. These priorities are set forth in
the Hospital Sector Restructuring Strategy approved by the Government in November 2002.
Defined are the basic activities to be implemented in short terms. The PSC with its decision
of June 19, 2002 proposed to IBRD restructuring of the Project reallocating USD 6 635 100.00
to support Hospital Sector Restructuring Strategy. Reallocated are funds from the following
components and activities:
·    Component 1 "Primary and Ambulatory Care Reform" ­ planned for the supply of medical
     equipment from UNICEF and GP Management and Health Promotion Training;
·    Component 2 "Hospital Care R eform" ­ planned f or Hospital M anagement H ospital
     Accounting and System Administrators Training;
·    Component 3 "Health Care Financing/NHIF ­ Investment Costs" ­ planned for development
     of document workflow management and back-up power supply for NHIF building.

The Amendment from April 2004 to the Loan Agreement expands the scope of the health sector
restructuring Investment Program creating a new sub-component "Hospital Care Restructuring"
to Component 2 with the following activities:
·    Technical a ssistance to a nalyze t he ne eds a nd t he resources in the h ospital care for the
     country and development of long-term strategy of financing and investment in hospital sector.
·    Activities for r estructuring the hospitals on n ational a nd m unicipal level on the ba sis of
     reports evaluating their situation.
·    Training of medical specialists and hospital managers in skills relevant to the new realities in
     the municipal health care.

The basic goal of the proposed activities is to elaborate positive hospital restructuring models for
specific geographical regions and to support hospital system on na tional level being the most
highly specialized and the one that i n f uture remains at t he cares of State. Establishment of
alternative models for health services is proposed like One-day Surgery centers and Municipal
Nursing Units. The efforts r elated t o t he hospital care r estructuring a re directed to b etter
utilization of available resources and improved quality of services to obtain better clinical results.

AMENDMENT 2 TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT ­ APRIL 2005

In January 2005, following a decision of the PSC MOH sends to IBRD its proposal for a second
Amendment to the Loan Agreement. With this restructuring of the Loan the term for HSR Project
implementation is extended by e ighteen /18/ months - till March 31, 2007. Project financial

reports are updated a nd the f unds for activities r elated to ho spital sector restructuring a re
increased ­ the scope of civil works at the selected hospitals on national and regional level is
extended; funds for procurement of medical equipment, including through the Revolving Fund
are increased; sub-categories of Category 1 ­ Civil Works and Category 2 ­ Procurement of
Goods a re consolidated a iming at a more f lexible disbursement and reallocation of funds in
future.

Amendment 2 to the Loan Agreement comes into force on April 1, 2005. The Amendments to the
Loan Agreement increase the volume of the activities planned under this component and intensify
the responsibilities of Ministry of Health with respect to hospital sector reform. The restructuring
initiated on national and municipal level created the necessity of active expert on-site work.

AMENDMENT 3 TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT ­ MARCH 2007

At the beginning of 2007 the World Bank Team agrees to amend the terms and activities under
the P roject. The amended pl an provides for t he building of a I ntegrated National Health
Insurance Information S ystem; c ompletion o f a ll activities p lanned u nder Component 2 ­
Hospital Care Restructuring and reallocation of funds towards this component from Component 3
- Health Care Financing/NHIF ­ Investment Costs. The funds under Component 2 are increased
by EUR 8 932 000 from which EUR 7 390 000 are Loan funds. Following NHIF Management
proposal building of Disaster Back-up Center for the needs of NHIF and upgrading and extending
NHIF Server Infrastructure are dropped off. The basic arguments in favor of the reallocation
made are the continuous need of investments in the hospital sector and the fact that the planned
Disaster c enter a nd S ervers a re d irectly r elated to th e a vailability o f o perating N HIF IS.
Amendment 3 to the Loan Agreement is approved by the Council of Ministers and ratified by the
Parliament on March 15, 2007. Extension of P roject t erm b y eighteen /18/ m onths a nd
reallocation of funds under components give the possibility to:
(1) Achieve the major aims and objectives of the Project;
(2) Achieve an entire, prompt and effective disbursement of the Loan funds;
(3) Meet the immediate priorities in the health sector and namely the hospital reform;

Amendment 3 to the LA approves accomplishment of the following activities: Civil woks on the

2008 medical equipment /ICB 021 and ICB 022/ are signed in September and October 2008. The
Revolving Investment Fund establishes itself as a reliable financial instrument for procurement of
equipment as the hospital care facilities participate in the preparation of the procedures and the
elaboration of technical requirements f or the e quipment; due t o t he big quantities t he pr ices
quoted are lower than the market ones in the country. Through the Project Advisory Committee
MOH is able to conform the ordered types and quantities to the real needs of respective hospital.
Hospital care facilities show considerable interested in the Investment Program. The number of
hospitals applied for equipment procured under the second procedure increases. Sixty five /65/
are the applications submitted by different hospitals in the country for a total amount of BGN 120
million. All hospitals pay their installments in due time. Out of the experience gained and in view
of t he submitted a pplications, reflecting hospitals' needs a nd R IF c urrent possibilities, a

possibility to: automate the electronic reporting process between hospitals and NHIF; standardize
hospitals' e xpenditures r eports; un iform bot h the verification of ho spitals claims a nd t he
methodology for evaluating hospitals outputs and services; the possibility to automatically verify
hospitals claims unifies and multiplies the effectiveness of the initial hospital claims verification;

health s ector; a nalysis o f na tional he alth ne eds compared t o t he pr actices i n E C c ountries;
analysis o f a vailable training a nd q ualification programs f or health s ector human resource;
analysis and assessment of the acting legislative regulations for the health sector; work out draft
strategy. Findings: compared to EC member countries the ratio physicians per capita in Bulgaria
is 20/100 000, which in figures makes 1500 "excessive" physicians than the EC average, while
the nurses are two times less than in the EC countries; irregular distribution of medical specialists
by territory; necessity to take measures for: readjustment/re-qualification of physicians in another
specialty; redistribution of medical professionals by regions. Based on this and on t he natural
process of quitting the sector within 4-5% annually and the number of graduated specialists the
Consultant assumes that no large scale activities will be needed for readjustment of physicians
and other medical staff, dismissed from the health care system but rather specialization and/or re-
