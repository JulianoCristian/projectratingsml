      supports the Government of Bulgaria in implementing a\n            fundamental reform of its health sector that is designed to\n            improve access, especially for disadvantaged populations and\n            those in remote areas, to quality health services and to\n            ensure financial and operational sustainability,. Four of\n            the seven projects components are financed by the World\n            Bank. The first component facilitates the reform and\n            sustainability of the primary and ambulatory care sector. It\n            provides practice equipment for primary health care, funds\n            physician office information systems, provides training in\n            general practitioner (GP) practice management, funds an\n            information campaign, finances a health reform investment\n            program to provide low-interest loans to physicians, and\n            funds a labor adjustment strategy. The second component\n            helps implement reform of the hospital system, including\n            funding hospital information systems, financing a health\n            reform investment program, and funding a labor adjustment\n            strategy to transition surplus hospital staff. The third\n            component assists the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)\n            to establish the technological infrastructure to operate the\n            insurance system, including the hardware and software\n            systems needed as well as the training and technical\n            assistance required. The fourth component strengthens the\n            management and institutional capacity of the health\n            ministry, the NHIF, and the health system generally."}, "docdt": "2000-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
