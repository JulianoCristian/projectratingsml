Lessons are conveyed as\n            follows. Cultural Heritage preservation can be a viable\n            theme for urban physical revitalization, most importantly\n            for promoting reconciliation: had the Bridge and Towers not\n            been rehabilitated, they would have remained a constant\n            reminder of war and divisions among communities. As it is\n            now, the re-constructed Bridge is a symbol of re-established\n            ties, that better times are ahead, and that the shared\n            history will hopefully lead to a better future. However,\n            projects in cultural heritage require patience, and the\n            involvement of most stakeholders. Particularly, where the\n            structure to be renovated is internationally renowned,\n            UNESCO participation is essential to ensure technical and\n            aesthetic qualities. Given the Bank's limited\n            experience in participating in such partnerships, and the\n            partner's unfamiliarity with Bank procedures, more\n            explicit attention to creating this understanding, might\n            have expedited the process. While the impact of the Bridge\n            and Towers on the attitudes of the population is\n            undisputable, having included smaller components, especially\n            public restorations, added a particularly important\n            dimension to the project in reaching the communities, and\n            providing the citizens with opportunities for benefiting\n            immediately from restorations - such as those in the\n            neighborhood and monuments components, through the\n            renovation of specific smaller community structures and\n            public spaces."}, "docdt": "2005-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
