The bridge became a\n            symbol of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s tolerance in a region\n            known for its ethnic and religious diversity until war\n            overwhelmed the former Yugoslavia. Following the conclusion\n            of the war, the government tried for several years to\n            rebuild the bridge. However, due to lack of financing and\n            technical capacity, as well as political and ethnic\n            sensitivities, all efforts were unsuccessful. The\n            International Development Association (IDA) financed\n            cultural heritage pilot project launched in 1999. Because of\n            the symbolism inherent in the reconstruction of the Old\n            Bridge, the project was meant to promote a climate of\n            reconciliation, the main pre-requisite for economic\n            revitalization and social cohesion. The re-opening of the\n            Old Bridge has contributed to the reconciliation of\n            war-divided people living on the banks of the Neretva River.\n            In addition to rebuilding the graceful arch of the bridge\n            and its towers, the project restored other damaged\n            monuments, which helped preserve the character of Mostar\u2019s\n            historic cobble-stoned old town. Mostar residents from both\n            banks meet again in the old town to attend concerts,\n            exhibitions, and other cultural events. Tourism picked up,\n            boosting the local economy and triggered new construction,\n            the opening of new hotels, restaurants, and pubs, and other\n            businesses in Mostar and its surroundings. In July 2005,\n            Mostar\u2019s Old Bridge and surrounding old town were registered\n            on UNESCO\u2019s list of historic monuments."}, "docdt": "2009-08-29T07:41:00Z"}
