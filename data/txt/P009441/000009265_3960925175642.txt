PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION _PROJECT
(CB 1402 - 8D)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project (PEPP) in Bangladesh, for which Credit 1402-BD
in the amount of SDR 21.4 million (us$23 million equivalent at the time of
negotiation) was approved on July 12, 1983. The credit was closed on June 30,
1990. three years behind schedule. The last disbursement was made on October
10, 1990, and the undisbursed balance of SDR 7,854,834.22 was canceled.
The PCR was prepared jointly by the Energy Division of the Tec' iical
Department in the Asia Region (Preface, Evaluation Sumnary, Parts I and III)
and the Borrower (Part It).
Preparation of this PCR was started during IDA's supervision mission on
the project in March 1990 and is based, inter alia, on the President's Report,
Development Credit and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence
between IDA and the Borrower; and internal memoranda.

BANGLADESH
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1402-BD)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
(i)   The project's objectives were to support GOB's efforts to stimulate
interest and attract foreign investment in petroleum exploration in the
Borrower's territory, to assist in the acquisition of data needed to delineate
and develop existing gas fields, and to strengthen the technical, financial
and legal capabilities of GOB and Petrobangla through: (a) seismic surveys in
the existing gas fields and in the western delta area; (b) a study to assess
the petroleum prospects in Bangladesh, including the identification of areas
to be made available for exploration and (c) assistance in the financial,
technical and legal fields needed to carry through the promotion campaign.
(paras 1.01-1.04).
Implementation Experience
(ii)   Seismic surveys were planned to cover 1500 km of reconnaissance lines
on a wide grid in the SW delta area, and 900 km of production seismic surveys
on a narrow detail grid over selected gas fields in the eastern fold belt.
These surveys were carried out by two expatriate contractor crews and a
Petrobangla crew with expatriate advisoka. The quality of the results was
generally good, except for 275 km of line in the difficult terrain of the
Sundarbans in the SW delta which had to be abandoned. The attached map shows
the locations of the seismic surveys. All the seismic data was processed in
the processing laboratory established in Dhaka with funding under the project.
(paras 1.07, 1.14 and 2.01).
(iii) The study to assess the hydrocarbon prospects was called the
Hydrocarbon Habitat Study, (HHS). It formed the basis for the promotion
campaign, was completed on time in Dhaka by a team of expatriate specialists
assisted by Petrobangla counterpart staff. The final report was issued one
year late however due to problems in finalizing and reproducing the report in
Dhaka. The promotional meetings were held in London, Houston and Dhaka in
Junle/July 1989, 2 years l1-ter than planned due mainly to delays in obtaining
Government of Bangladesh (GOB) approval of the conditions of the offer. At
these meetings 14 acreage blocks covering the onshore area of Bangladesh were
offered to international oil companies (Iocs). (paras 1.06, 1.08 and 2.03).
(iv) The project's technical assistance (TA) components comprised on-the-job
training provided by contractors and consultants, which was highly successful
and much appreciated by the Borrower, together with overseas courses for
Petrobangla staff. The overseas courses were less successful. Petrobangla
management was reluctant to send junior staff overseas and felt that the
courses were too academic and not directly applicable to the operating
problems their staff face (paras 1.06 and 2.05). TA was also provided to the



- iiL -
Petrobangla crew during the seiamic field work, during the laboratory
establishment and upgrading, and on special seismic processing procedures for
use in gas field development (paras 1.10 and 2.09).
Results
(v)   The results of the field activities in support of the project were good.
The seismic reconnaissance surveys in the delta area showed that good results
could be obtained using standard techniques, but the specialized acquisition
system planned for the Sundarbans was unsuccessful in the difficult terrain
and that part of the survey was abandoned. The detailed production seismic
surveys in the eastern gas fields were highly successful in defining the gas
field structures. These surveys were later extended by the Petr_;"angla seismic
crew with some funding for consumables being supplied under the project. The
field structure maps were used to locate the appraisal wells in the Second Gas
Development Project (SGDP). As a result of the good structural control all the
wells were completed as gas producers, thereby introducing some 330 MMSCF/D
of new gas production capacity. The Petrobangla laboratories were upgraded,
new equipment was installed and Petrobangla staff trained to use the
equipment. The laboratories, staffed by Petrobangla personnel, are now
handling all of Petrobangla's routine testing (paras 1.07 and 2.01).
(vi) The Hydrocarbon Habitat Study (HHS) indicated that there were good
prospects of discovering oil and new gas in Bangladesh, and that the area
could be attractive to the ZOCs. The HHS report was used as the basis for the
promotion campaign. Data packages, and a brochure were prepared by the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) assisted by a consultant. The legal consultants
reviewed the enabling petroleum legislation and wrote a model production
sharing contract for use in the promotion campaign. To overcome the reluctance
of the IOCs to explore in possible gas prone areas the contract included a gas
clause designed to reward companies discovering and developing gas. The
promotion brochure which was distributed to the IOCs included an outline of
the oil and gas prospects in Bangladesh, the locations of the acreage blocks
being offered and the terms of the model production sharing agreement prepared
for the promotion by the legal consultants. During the promotion
representatives of some 70 companies attended the meetings, and 21 IOCs
purchased data packages (paras 1.09, 1.13 and 2.04).
(vii) In spite of the considerable interest shown by the IOCs during the
promotion campaign, the response to the offer was disappointing. However,
since the official closing of the offer on January 15, 1990 several companies
have approached Petrobangla seeking agreements on various terms different to
those originally offered. Although no new agreements have yet been reached,
mainly because of the political disturbances before the elections and the
change of personnel after the elections, contacts between Petrobangla and
several oil companies are continuing. The IOCs continue to show interest but
GOB is not yet prepared to begin serious negotiations. (paras 1.13 and 2.04).
(viii)Out of the SDR 21.4 million allocated to the project, only SDR 13.6
million was used. Disbursement was slower than planned due a delay of ten
months in establishing credit effectiveness and in implementing the promotion
campaign. At the closing date, SDR 7.9 million were left undisbursed and were
canceled. The savings were due mainly to a drop in world prices for
contractors and towards the end of the project there was a lack of counterpart



- iv -
financing by GOB needed to cover the costs of customs duties. This meant that
plans to use the the remaining funds to purchase extra training equipment had
to be abandoned. (paras 1.06 and 1.12).
Sustainabilitv
(ix) In the current economic situation it is essential that the IOCS with
their own financing and world-wide experience be induced to enter agreements
to explore for, and eventually produce, oil and gas in Bangladesh. Although
the initial response to the acreage offer was disappointing, Petrobangla staff
gained experience in collecting and organizing a data base relevant to the
promotion, in setting out acreage blocks to be offered, in handling production
sharing agreements, discussing possible production sharing agreement terms and
understanding the concerns of the IOCs. The PCU has formed the basis of a
group which is continuing the promotion activity on the basis of direct
contacts and negotiations with the oil companies. Although the first steps in
the reorganization of Petrobangla have been taken the organization is still
weak with regard to planning and implementing its own long term exploration
and development program. The situation is exacerbated by the uncertainty of
GOB funding which makes any kind of planning difficult. Further efforts will
be required to increase Petrobangla staff's managerial and technical
capabilities, and to ensure that sufficient local funding is made available to
implement planned programs.
Findings and Lessons Learned
(x)   The field work carried out during the project showed that current
exploration techniques can produce good results in Bangladesh. Local personnel
have been trained to use these techniques successfully. It is important that
these new skills should be used by giving staff the possibility to do hands on
responsible technical work. It should be an objective of future projects to
ensure that local staff are given an opportunity to carry out the exploration
and development work. The use of contractors should, as far as possible, be
limited to training and giving advice. It is still essential to attract the
IOCs with their own funding and expertise to work in Bangladesh. To do this,
the next offer of acreage blocks should allow time for detailed discussions
with individual companies, and for special agreements to cover individual
situations, especially in high risk areas. One factor in the promotion which
may have led to reduced interest from the IOCs was the award of the most
promising acreage block, which included the only oil discovery in Bangladesh,
to one of the IOCs under a production sharing agreement negotiated separately
by GOB while the production campaign was still being prepared. In future once
it has been decided to promote block sales using a bidding round then all the
acreage to be offered should be included in that round and opened to bidding
only on the appointed day, alternatively it should be made clear to all
parties that negotiations can be entered into at anytime. A second factor was
the promotion in neighboring Myanmar which because of the delays in the
Bangladesh promotion took place at almost the same time. Myanmar is a known
oil province which had been closed to the IOCs for forty years, its opening up
for bidding aroused great interest and distracted attention from Bangladesh.
The PCU was formed to facilitate project implementation by having a unit with
the authority to give rapid decisions on procurement and on promotion
implementation. During implementation it was found that the authority could



- v 
not be delegated and the isRues were handled by the standing committv'es in
Petrobangla and GOB. This resulted in considerable delays in procurement. In
future projects efforts should be made to ensure that sufficient authority and
the necessary staff are delegated to the implementing body to allow it to
operate efficiently, and separate from the GOB and Petrobangle committees
which are often difficult to assemble and slow in reaching decisions.

B. Baak%rgound
1.01        During the struggie for independence. which ended in 1971 with the
establishment of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, the whole infrastructure
of the country was devastated. By 1971 the IOCs who had discovered the main
gas fields in the 2astern part of the country during the 1960e had left the
country, and in 1972 the oil and gas sector was nationalized by the new
Government. The rise in oil prices in the early 1970s together with a series
of bad harvests and floods exacerbated an already desperate economic
situation. In their efforts to find oil GOB sought help from the USSR, and
several exploration wells were drilled with its assistance. These efforts at
exploration outside the relatively well defined structures of the gas fields
in the eastern fold belt were unsuccessful. The geological structures in the
west and in the main delta area are more complex than those of the eastern
fold belt. The terrain is difficult, and exploration operations are more
complex and expensive, this has led to sparse seismic coverage, few
exploration wells and a negative view of the petroleum prospects of the
western part of the country. In spite of considerable efforts throughout the
country during this period no significant oil or gas discoveries were made.
There was a further burst of exploration activity by the IOCe in 1974 when the
political situation had become more settled and the offshore area was opened
to bidding. However this round of activity was also unsuccessful, and by 1978
the IOCs had withdrawn from the offshore areas after making extensive seismic
surveys and drilling seven off-shore exploration wells. Although gas was found
in one of the offshore wells, Kutubdia, this potential gas field is located in
the mouth of the delta and would be difficult to develop. In 1981 activities
by the IOCe resumed when Shell took up an area in the Chittagong Hill Tracts,
but there was little other outside interest in the oil and gas sector.



2-
1.02         In 1982 all of the oil used in Bangladesh was imported at a cost
of US$543 million, which was 87% of the country's total foreign exchange
earnings.  Development of the gas fields close to the markets had begun with
help from various donors, and by the end of 1982 annual gas production had
reached 45 BCF. it was clear that a considerable exploration, appraisal and
development effort would be needed if gas production was to be increased to a
point where it could make a significant contribution to the energy
requirements, or if liquid hydrocarbons were to be discovered to relieve the
economic presure of importing oil. Local funds were not available for such
;ligh risk operations, and the obvious need was for a promotional campaign to
induce the IOCs to do the work using their own financial and technical
resources. It was against this background that the project was approved by the
Board on July 12, 1983.
C. Prolect Obiectives and DescriptLion
1.03        The project's main objective was to support GOB's efforts to
stimulate interest among foreign investors to resume petroleum exploration in
Bangladesh through a proper assessment of the petroleum prospects and a
promotion campaign comprising three promotion meetings to be held in London,
Houston and Dhaka at which acreage blocks in Bangladesh would ke offered for
bids by the IOCs. The project would also assist in the acquisition of
critical data needed to delineate and develop the existing gas fields, and
technical assistance was also included to strengthen Petrobangla's technical
capabilities.
1.04        The project cunprised: (a) seismic surveys covering around 2,400
line-km; (b) a Hydrocarbon Habitat Study (HHS) collating and reinterpreting
the existing data and integrating the newly acquired seismic, geological and
geochemical data; and (c) a program of technical, financial and legal
assistance to Petrobangla, including the review of the existing petroleum
legislation and the preparation of a model production sharing agreement for
use in the promotion campaign.
D. Rroiect Design and Organization
1.05        The project concept was discussed in detail and the objectives
were clearly understood and agreed by the Association and the Borrower. The
project's form was similar to that used successfully in promotional projects
in several developing countries. International consultants were hired to
conduct the studies, and to provide two seismic crews and technical advisors
for the Petrobangla seismic crew to carry out the reconnaissance and detailed
seismic surveys. Petrobangla formed a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) staffed
by Petrobangla professional and support staff to supervise project
implementation. A Chief Coordinator, reporting to Petrobangla, ran the PCU
with professional counterpart staff seconded from Petrobangla. The PCU
organization worked very well. PCU personnel became expert in IDA methods and
the liaison with the Association remained cordial and effective throughout the
project implementation. However responsibility for procurement, contract
bidding evaluation, and policy decisions remained in the various committees in
Petrobangla and GOB and decisions were often delayed. For example it took
almost a year to have the conditions of the promotion offer cleared by GOB
after they had been worked out and agreed with the PCU/Petrobangla.



-3-
E. pro2jet Im2lementtior.
1.06        Project implementation was delayed initially because of non-
compliance by the Borrower with the following conditions of effectiveness:
a) GOB approval of the Project Proforma; b) appointment of the consultants for
the HHS by Petrobangla; and c) increase in Petrobangla's authorized capital to
200 million Taka. The delays were due mainly to difficulties in obtaining
clearance from GOB and Petrobangla. The credit did not finally become
effective until June 25, 1984, nine months later than the estimated
effectiveness date of September 1983. Further delays occurred during
implementation due to di4ficulties over the appointment of the contra_tore for
the seismic field work ,A in obtaining c-OB approvals for the terms of the
proposed prom'3tional of. . The project was finally completed in June 1990
with a delay of three years in the closing date. The project costs were less
than appraisal estimates due to savings caused by a drop in world prices for
contract work, the appreciation of the SDR value, and the lack of counterpart
funding in the later stages of the project.
1.07        txcept for 275 km of seismic line in the difficult terrain of the
Sudarbans area of the Southwest Delta, where an attempt made to use a special
recording system did not produce the required quality results and that part of
the survey was abandoned, the seismic surveys were completed successfully by
two expatriate crews and a Petrobangla crew in the two field seasons of
1984/85 and 1985/86. The seismic data quality was generally good and showed
that seismic results could be obtained at reasonable cost. The seismic data
processing center was established in Dhaka in 1985 by contractor personnel and
counterpart Petrobangla staff. All the data from the seismic surveys was
processed in the center. The processing was up to industry standards, and
local personnel were trained to the point were they were able to run k e
center themselves. New equipment was provided to upgrade Petrobangla
petrophysical and geochemical laboratories, and Petrobangla personnel were
trained to use the new equipment. The consultant geochemist who worked with
the HHS team also advised on the installation of the equipment and management
of the laboratories.
1.08        The HHS, which was the main study in support of the promotion
campaign, was completed successfully on schedule by a team of consultants
assisted by Petrobangla staff working in Dhaka. However the final report's
release was delayed by one year due to difficulties producing copies of
acceptable quality in Dhaka. The final report was eventually produced at the
consultant's home office. The report indicated that there are good oil and gas
prospects in Bangladesh which warrant further investigation, and which could
interest the IOCs. Compiling the report brought together a comprehensive data
base which could form a useful basis for any future promotion efforts.
1.09        The promotion campaign was delayed two years due mainly to
difficulties in obtaining GOB approval for the terms of the model agreement
and the acreage blocks to be offered. When the campaign was about to begin in
1988, GOB decided that the already agreed conditions had to be reviewed again
due to changes in senior personnel in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources and in Petrobangla. The review was eventually taken to Cabinet
level and it took more than a year to obtain a final confirmation of the
terms. The promotional meetings were finally held in June and July 1989 in



- 4 -
London, Houston and Dhaka. The deadline for the receipt of the anticipated
offers was set at January 15, 1990. The credit closing date was extended for
a third year to June 30, 1990 so that IDA assistance could be available during
the evaluation of offers from the IOCs.
1.10        The TA and training elements were completed satisfactorily by the
end of 1987. The study of exploration accounting procedures and the legal
studies were completed in 1987 and accepted by Petrobangla. Additional TA was
provided for special studies in the application of seismic detail surveys to
gas field development. A total of 28 Petrobangla staff were trained abroad in
petroleum-related subjects on short courses lasting from 2 to 4 months.
1.11        Project financing waB carried out as planned. IDA also provided
additional assistance by furding the supply of consumables to the Petrobangla
seismic crew which completed 404 line-km of additional detail seismic survey
work in the eastern gas fields. This survey was carried out by Petrobangla
personnel and was highly successful. The processing and interpretation was
also done solely by Petrobangla. The results proved to be extremely useful in
locating appraisal wells on the gas fields.
1.12        Disbursement was slower than planned due initially _o delays in
making the credit effective and then later due to delays in obtaining GOB
approval for the terms of the offer to be made in the promotion campaign.
Finally, only 65% of the credit was disbursed even though all of the main
elements of the project were implemented. A comparison between the actual
disbursement and the appraisal estimate is given in Table 3 of Part III.
F. Proiect Results
1.13        Although the data gathering activities produced good results the
credit's main objective of attracting the IOCs back to Bangladesh has not yet
been achieved. The response to the promotion campaign was disappointing. Only
one definite offer to take up acreage was made prior to the January 15, 1991
deadline, and this offer was in a form unacceptable to Petrobangla. However
since the closing date there have been enquiries from several IOCs seeking to
obtain more flexible terms than those offered during the promotion. The
discussions with these companies has been held up for a year during the
preparations for the elections and by the subsequent change of Government and
changes in personnel in Petrobangla. However when the discussions are resumed
it seems likely that agreements will eventually be reached. Petrobangla has
formed a unit to carry on the discussions with IOCs and review the results of
the promotional campaign with a view to attracting further offers from the
IOCS.
1.14        The results of the detailed seismic surveys of the eastern gas
fields were good. They were very useful in planning the appraisal drilling
program of the gas fields carried out under the Second Gas Development Project
(Cr. 1586-BD). The improved structural interpretation helped to ensure that
all nine of the appraisal wells drilled were completed as gas producers each
with a capacity of around 30 MMSCF/D of gas. These nine wells together with
the two workovers, resulted in an increase off some 330 MMSCFD in overall gas
production capacity. The appraisal wells were also located to prove up new gas
reserves, and it is expected that when the current reservoir studies have been



completed in July 1991 the results will indicate an increase of about 3 TC' in
the gas reserves.
1.15        The Petrobangla seismic processing center was established in
Dhaka, and the Petrobangla laboratories were upgraded successfully.
Petrobangla personnel were trained to the point where they ran the seismic
processing center independently. The center has since fallen into disuse
because of a lack of local funds to buy consumables and spares, but efforts
are being made to find donor funding to reopen the center.
1.16        Out of a training allocation of SDR 740,000 (i.e. about US$
800,000 equivalent) around US$640,000 was spent. A total of 28 Petrobangla
personnel were sent on overseas short courses of 2 - 4 months duration on
subjects related to oil and gas exploration and production. The various
contractors and consultants provided on-the-job training and seminars for
Petrobangla personnel. The on-the-job training was of high quality and was
well received by Petrobangla management and the staff being trained because it
was directly related to the use of the new equipment and field techniques.
The more formal overseas training courses were less well received. Staff
considered them too academic and had difficulty in relating the subjects to
their everyday problems. Part of this may have been due to language
difficulties, and part may also have been due to courses not being
specifically arranged for the Bangladeshi students.
1.17        Other studies and TA included a study of accounting procedures to
be used by the operating companies in the reorganized Petrobangla, a study of
the legal requirements for the promotion, and the preparation of a draft model
production sharing agreement to be used in the promotion campaign. Although
these studies were accepted by Petrobangla, the results will only be effective
when the reorganization of Petrobangla has been fully achieved, and when there
are production sharing agreements with the IOCs.
G. Proiect Sustainabilitv
1.18        The project's sustainability depends on new production sharing
agreements being concluded with IOCs. The data packages prepared for the
promotion campaign could form the basis for further promotional activities.
The main problem in sustaining the advances made under the project is the
chronic lack of loca. funding which makes it difficult for Petrobangla to
maintain even a minimum planned exploration, appraisal and production effort.
Seismic field work which could form the basis for future exploration requires
minimal GOB funding for Petrobangla's own seismic crews. The seismic field
work was abandoned in 1988 due to a lack of local funding. The Seismic
Processing Center was closed in May 1990 due to lack of funding for spare
parts. Until some satisfactory method of funding the gas sub-sector is found,
and a rational long term program adopted, the basic continuity required in an
exploration, appraisal and development effort, including possible future
premotion activities, will be difficult to achieve.
H. IDA's Performance
1.19        The project was well prepared, and was implemented as described in
the President's report, although the implementation was delayed. During
implementation IDA adapted the project as far as possible to the needs and the



- 6 -
local financing difficulties of the Borrower. The closing date was extended
three timoo to accomnodate delays in implementation and ensure that IDA
assistance would be available if required. The supervision missions were well
organized, made at regular intervals, and included the specialists required to
ensure the technical level required was maintained. The supervision reports
give an adequate record of the progress of the project. A summary of the use
of Bank resources, staff inputs and missions is given in Table 3.8, p 15. A
total of 106.3 staff weeks were used in planning and supervising the project.
I.   rrower's Performance
1.20        The PCU was formed on time, worked well, and provided the
operational data required for the supervision missions in a timely manner.
The cooperation between the PCU and IDA staff was good and remained cordial
throughout the project. The PCU and counterpart staff worked well with the
consultants. The main cause of delays in implementation were due to the long
process of obtaining GOB approval for the terms and conditions of the
promotion offer. The submission of annual audit reports required under the
project was also delayed due to problems in obtaining Petrobangla and GOB
clearance.
J. Consultant Services
1.21        Consultants, contractors and equipment suppliers played a central
role in the project. They provided most of the technical expertise to help
carry out most of the preparatory work for the promotional campaign. The
promotion campaign itself was organized by a team made up of a consultant
geologist/promoter and Petrobangla technical staff. Individual consultants,
performance varied considerably depending on the individual personnel
involved, and particularly on the enthusiasm and competence of the team leader
and manager. There were some serious difficulties during implementation, as in
the HHS where critical parts of the study were being ignored, but in every
case the difficulties were rectified and the final results of their work were
accepted as satisfactory by Petrobangla.
K. pro1e .Documentation and Data
1.22        The President's Report and Credit documents were well prepared and
were followed throughout project implementation. Regular reports were
prepared by the PCU and these, together with the supervision reports, provide
an adequate record of the project. Adequate financial and audit reports were
provided, albeit late.

PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1402-BD)
PART-II     PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A. Petrobangla's Performance
Proiect Implementation
a. Seismic Surveys
2.01        The first season of field work started in January 1985 and lasted
5 months to May 1985. The second season started in November 1985 and was
completed in May 1986. The expatriate contractor crews with counterpart
Petrobangla staff completed 716 line-km of reconnaissance seismic in the
Delta, and 979 line-km production seismic in the eastern gas fields. The
Petrobangla seismic crew working with two contractor staff as advisors
completed 510 line-km in the Southwest Delta, and 249 line-km in the gas
fields. Petrobangla staff received on-the-job training, and assisted the
contractor crew with their local knowledge of fieldwork in Bangladesh. The
performance of the expatriate contractor seismic crew in carrying out the
survey in the difficult terrain in the Southwest Delta was not found to be
satisfactory. It resulted in poor data quality and the eventual abandoning of
part of the survey.
2.02        The seismic data was processed in the processing center
established in Dhaka with funds from the credit. The option to purchase the
processing equipment was exercised and the center was used very successfully
employing only Petrobangla staff, which was evidence of a successful transfer
of technology. An amount of US$8,618,125.09 equivalent in total was spent
from the allocated funds of SDR 11,030,000.
b. Hydrocarbon Habitat Study (HHS)
2.03        The contract for the HHS was awarded in June 1984.  The work began
in November 1984 with 10 expatriate consultants comprising geophysicists.
petroleum geologists, reservoir engineers and geochemists with Petrobangla
counterpart staff from the project coordination unit (PCU) working in the
PEPP office in Dhaka. The report was completed in December 1986, however
there were disagreements with the consultant over the submission of the final
report which initially did not comply with generally accepted standards of
reproduction. The report was finally reproduced satisfactorily by the end of
1987. A total of US$3,416,754.49 equivalent was spent for the HHS.



-8-
c. Promotion Campaign
2.04        A consultant petroleum geologist was engaged in July 1987 to
advise on the organization of the promotion campaign. A brochure, data
packages and promotion materials for use in the campaign were prepared by the
PCU with advice from the consultant. A team of senior staff from Petrobangla
together with the consultant made the presentations at the promotion seminars
in London, Houston and Dhaka in June and July 1989. These seminars were well
attended by officials from 70 IOCe. Following the seminars, 21 lOCs purchased
promotional data packages. Almost all of the companies visited the Dhaka data
center e tablished by PCU and, had private discussions with Petrobangla. An
amount of US$226,007.69 equivalent was spent for promotion campaign. A total
of us$3,642,762.18 equivalent was spent on the promotion as against SDR
3,800,000 allocated for this portion of the work program.
d. Training and Technical Assistance
2.05        A total of 28 officials from Petrobat,gla were trained abroad in
subjects related to petroleum exploration for periods extending from 2 to 5
months. An amount of US$640,109.68 equivalent was spent for this training
against an allocated sum of SDR 740,000.
2.06. Specialized equipment for upgrading Petrobangla's Analytical and
Research Laboratories, the seismic crews and processing laboratories were
procured for an amount of us$1,660,861.77 equivalent as against the allocated
sum of SDR 920,000. This equipment has enabled Petrobangla to undertake all
of its own data processing, sampling and testing, and to do work for lOCs
working in Bangladesh.
2.07        Legal consultants and a consultant petroleum economist were
appointed in August 1986. They reviewed the Petroleum Legislation and
prepared a Model Petroleum Production Sharing Contract, which after review was
approved by the Government for use in the promotion campaign. An amount of
US$170,091.12 equivalent was spent for the legal consultant services.
2.08        Financial consultants were appointed in 1986 to upgrade
Petrobangla's accounting system at a cost of US$159,913.69 equivalent. A
total of Us$371,334.60 equivalent was spent on legal and financial consultants
against allocated amount of SDR 370,000.
2.09        PEPP with IDA approval also financed certain special studies such
as the Titas Gas Field reserve study using the Seislog method and a gas price
study. These studies which were found to be very useful also provided
training for Petrobangla staff. An amount of US$106,862.79 equivalent was
spent in such miscellaneous purposes against an unallocated amount of SDR
4,540,000 in the credit. A detailed financial statement showing the various
allocations and expenditures is given in Annex 1.
B. IDA's Performance
2.10        Coordination with IDA was maintained at a high level throughout
the project. The working relationship between the PEPP staff and IDA
supervision staff was extremely cordial and very productive. In some cases
delays in receJving approval from IDA caused difficulties in dealing with the



contractors. However apart from these minor problems excellent relations
existed between IDA and Petrobangla.
C. Future Developments
2.11        Further efforts will be needed to attract IOCe to work in
Bangladesh for carrying out exploration in Bangladesh. Because of the poor
response in the first bidding round it will be necessary to find a new
approach to the oil companies, possibly by making a direct contact with them.
The data base and the promotion packages should also be made up to date so
that they are available to support the continued promotion.   To attain this
objective IDA should keep provisions under future projects to support this
effort, if necessary through assistance of foreign consultants. In view of
the poor response from IOCs, IDA should also consider possible ways to assist
Petrobangla to carry out their own exploration program.

Comments
The seismic reconnaissance survey was reduced due to difficult field
conditions. The detail survey was extended to provide extra data needed for
the appraisal drilling program. Extra equipment was provided for the chemical
laboratories to enable them to test the gas compositions. The Hydrocarbon
Habitat Study was updated to include newly available data prior to the
promotion meetings. The promotional meetings were delayed waiting for GOB
clearance.
