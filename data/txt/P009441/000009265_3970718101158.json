   efforts to stimulate interest among foreign investors to\n            resume petroleum exploration in Bangladesh through a proper\n            assessment of petroleum prospects, including an\n            identification of areas where immediate further exploration\n            is warranted, as part of a promotional package to be made\n            available to interested foreign investors.  It would also\n            assist in the acquisition of critical data that are\n            necessary for delineating and developing existing gas fields\n            as well as help improve and strengthen the exploration and\n            technical capabilities of Petrobangla.  The project will\n            comprise:  (a) seismic surveys of about 2,400 line km; (b) a\n            hydrocarbon habitat study which will collate, reinterpret\n            and integrate all available as well as newly acquired\n            seismic, geological and geochemical data; and (c) a program\n            of assistance to Petrobangla in the technical, financial and\n            legal fields."}, "docdt": "1983-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
