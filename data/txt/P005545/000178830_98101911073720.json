underground cutoff wall to increase the available flow and\n            structures to prevent pollution from surface water at Figeh\n            spring; (ii) test pumping at Figeh to determine the storage\n            characteristics of the aquifer and the maximum reliable\n            yield which can be developed by pumping from the aquifer;\n            (iii) a 15 km tunnel from Figeh to Damascus; (iv) reservoirs\n            with a total capacity of about 75,000 cubic meters; (v)\n            construction of a new pumping station and renovation of the\n            existing pumping stations, including equipment for pumping\n            control; (vi) installation of about 530 km of water mains in\n            the distribution system; (vii) meter testing equipment, flow\n            and pressure metering apparatus and other equipment to\n            assist in the operation and maintenance of the distribution\n            systems; (viii) training for EPEF staff in management and\n            engineering; (ix) engineering and management consulting\n            services; (x) studies of measures to reduce pollution in the\n            Barada and Orontes River basins, including the sewerage of\n            Damascus and engineering for treatment plants in the\n            Homs/Hama area; (xi) training for Syrian staff; (xii)\n            purchase of equipment for
