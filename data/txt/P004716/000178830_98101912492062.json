 particularly for farmers in rainfed areas. This would be\n            accomplished by: (a) a training program for an additional\n            580 scientific staff, as well as for upgrading existing\n            staff; (b) the physical development of 19 selected research\n            centers in the regions, through the provision of additional\n            scientific staff, research facilities, equipment, and\n            housing; (c) reorganization and strengthening of the DOA and\n            decentralization of research management and operations from\n            Bangkhen (Bangkok) to the regions; and (d) strengthening the\n            linkage between research and extension, so that research\n            findings are more sharply focused on the practical problems\n            that farmers face. Most of the approximately 5 million farm\n            families would ultimately benefit from this project;\n            however, major emphasis would be on upland crops and farming\n            systems for rainfed agriculture, thus focusing on the\n            poorest farmers in Thailand."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
