In addition,\n            performance grants will be provided for the improvement of\n            access to primary education, and promotion rates, while\n            supplementary grants would provide additional support to\n            marginal communities, and encourage innovative approaches,\n            such as bilingual education, and the employment of female\n            teachers, and teachers from disadvantaged communities; 2)\n            provide scholarships to out-of-school children in the first\n            year, and maintenance scholarships in the later years of\n            primary schools, provided to all children from poor\n            households, expected to transform the social focus of\n            communities, making the school a focal point for inclusion;\n            3) support capacity building to assist communities, through\n            non-governmental organizations and support organizations in\n            school management. Moreover, Training for teachers will be\n            provided in instructional planning and delivery, and in\n            improving public relations with the community.
