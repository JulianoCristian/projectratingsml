low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: strong political support is required to\n            carry out public sector reforms of any kind. When the\n            general public has lost confidence in the government's\n            ability to provide services, a dramatic change is required\n            because 'band aids' are insufficient to restore\n            public confidence. Implementation of a project from within\n            the established bureaucratic structure is more sustainable,\n            even if there is weak institutional capacity. A project\n            provides the opportunity to improve institutional capacity.\n            Community-Managed School (CMS) require continuous support\n            from government to sustain the reforms and to continue\n            improvements in the quality of instruction. Intensive and\n            hands-on approach is required for the long-term. School\n            reform is contextual and is an evolutionary process\n            requiring meaningful local participation and contribution.\n            Functional partnership among key community partners\n            (parents, influential persons, local Non-Governmental\n            Organization (NGO), and school personnel) may take school\n            reform to new heights and encompass new dimensions. The\n            sense of ownership and a new feeling of responsibility\n            generated by the transfer of school management to the\n            community can lead to the institutional strengthening of the\n            School Management Committee (SMC)."}, "docdt": "2009-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
