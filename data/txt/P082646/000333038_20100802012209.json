for Nepal were as follows: outcome was\n            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was significant;\n            Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include: community management of schools offers many\n            potential benefits, but it is important to understand what\n            communities of different educational and income levels are\n            likely to implement. The education of the poorest children\n            should not depend heavily on the means available to the very\n            poor communities. Before scaling up pilot activities, it is\n            important to evaluate those pilots using robust evaluation\n            designs. In particular, Learning and Innovation Loans (LILs)\n            should strive to create best practice in evaluation in order\n            to maximize learning. Major educational reforms should be\n            based on solid analytical work and take into account\n            relevant research and evaluation from similar experiences\n            elsewhere. There is little evidence that the design of the\n            CSSP drew on research and evaluation findings of experiences\n            with community management of schools, particularly as it\n            relates to learning quality and outcomes, further\n            compounding the lack of robust evaluation carried out under\n            the LIL itself."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
