EMERGENCY REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMEN", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Health Sector Emergency\n            Rehabilitation and Development Project for Afghanistan were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: this project\n            underlined the large benefits that can be had from\n            investment in a well-functioning monitoring and evaluation\n            strategy. Factors that were important to the success of the\n            monitoring and evaluation strategy included closely support\n            by the Bank team on technical issues, clarity of the tasks\n            described in the ToRs (i.e. specified number of health\n            facility and household surveys), the fact that the request\n            for proposals was attractive to well-qualified institutions,\n            and effective management of the contract by Ministry of\n            Public Health (MOPH). Comparison with experience in other\n            countries also suggests the importance of the fact that the\n            contracted organization was a university whose primary\n            motivation was not profit. High quality staff from the ranks\n            of graduate students were deployed, the organization had a\n            large reputational stake in ensuring high quality according\n            to international best practice, it went beyond its terms of\n            reference to pursue deeper analysis (often with the\n            self-interested aim of producing peer-reviewed\n            publications), and it established an excellent working\n            relationship with MOPH by being highly responsive to\n            pressing requests for data collection and analyses. The\n            investment project paradigm is poorly adapted to supporting\n            the delivery of basic social services in countries such as\n            Afghanistan that require ongoing financing of recurrent\n            costs. Investment projects are basically designed to make\n            one-off investments that are intended to produce returns\n            after the end of the project. A number of features of the\n            Bank's traditional investment project framework stem\n            from this, such as short project implementation periods and\n            the difficulties in financing of civil servant remuneration\n            (on the assumption that the government should be able to\n            handle such recurrent costs after the investment is completed)."}, "docdt": "2010-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
