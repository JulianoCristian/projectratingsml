1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of appraisal in 2003, with a population estimated at 24.4 million1 and GDP
per capita of US$ 186,2 Afghanistan was among the poorest countries in the world, emerging
from decades of conflict. Following the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, Afghanistan was in
the midst of post-conflict reconstruction and transition with substantial security and development
support from the international community. Insecurity was rising in parts of the country.
Consistent with its poverty and long experience of conflict, Afghanistan's health situation was
similarly among the poorest in the world. Under-five mortality was estimated at 257 per 1,000,3
while the maternal mortality ratio was estimated at 1,900 per 100,000 live births,4 both rates
among the highest in the world.

2.      At the time of appraisal of this project, health services were largely provided by non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) financed under humanitarian programs, while in many rural
areas there were no modern health services at all. There were large deficiencies and inequalities
in infrastructure and human resources, while NGO programs were uncoordinated, without any
common policy framework or technical standards. Along with daunting geographic barriers to
access, women's access to health care was restricted by cultural factors and a lack of female
health providers. During 2002-03, with the support of a series of joint donor missions, the
Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) under the new transitional government assessed needs,
established strategic directions and put in place the policy framework for development of health
services.

3.      A flurry of policy development during 2002-03 included the National Health Policy, the
Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS) and the National Salary Policy. Drawing on
experiences with NGO contracting in other countries (notably Cambodia), the World Bank took
the lead in advocating a strategy whereby the MOPH would concentrate on its stewardship role
while contracting out service delivery to NGOs. The development programs of the three major
donors in the sector ­ the World Bank, the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) and the European Union (EU) ­ were developed and implemented on that basis.5

4.       The rationale for Bank assistance was provided by the Bank's strong engagement in
reconstruction in Afghanistan and its support for the country's 2002 National Development
Framework, which includes health and nutrition programs supporting one of the framework's
three pillars. The Bank's 2003 Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) stated that the Bank would
assist the government in its broad priorities across sectors, including development of basic social
services. One of the five overall objectives of the Bank's 2003 TSS was to improve basic social
services to the population. However, the TSS lists the health sector as an area of consolidation
suggesting Bank disengagement once the health project then under preparation had successfully
established the performance-based contracting system. Nevertheless, the document stated that
this would be reviewed in light of implementation experience in the context of preparation of a
full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to: "(i) assist the MOH to achieve its
stated goals of reducing the rates of infant and child mortality, maternal mortality, child
malnutrition, and fertility through expanding delivery of the Basic Package of Health Services
(BPHS) and increasing equity in the delivery of services; (ii) strengthen the MOH's stewardship
over the sector including a greater role in health care financing, coordination of partners, and
overseeing the work of NGOs; and (iii) build the capacity of Afghan health workers to provide
and manage health services."6 Key indicators are provided above in the Datasheet.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.      The PDO was not changed. Key indicators were slightly modified and baseline estimates
were provided in the Additional Financing documents. Following are changes made to the PDO
indicators:
        ·   Health outcome indicators were either not included in ISRs (under-five and maternal
            mortality) or dropped from the Results Matrix in the Additional Financing documents
            (infant mortality and child malnutrition). This is due to difficulties in measurement
            and the fact that there is a well-established scientific basis for considering that
            utilization of relevant basic health services (which make up the bulk of project
            indicators) will result in improved health outcomes.
        ·   Full immunization coverage was replaced by DPT3 coverage as a PDO indicator
            (DPT3 coverage was previously an Intermediate Outcome indicator) due to the fact
            that they essentially reflect the same thing: access to routine immunization services.
        ·   An indicator of knowledge possessed by MOPH managers was replaced with an
            indicator of health provider knowledge as reflection of the capacity development
            aspect of the PDO.




6
 Note that the Ministry's name changed to Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) in 2004. This document uses MOPH
consistently for the sake of clarity.


                                                     2
       ·   The per capita annual consultation rate was upgraded to a PDO indicator from an
           Intermediate Outcome indicator because it is a key measurement of overall service
           delivery, reflecting the core objective of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      The primary target group was meant to be a rural population of approximately 6 million
(for details see Table 3 in Annex 2). In addition, the project provided support to national
immunization campaigns, benefiting the country's children, as well as monitoring and evaluation
of health services nationwide. The MOPH benefited from institutional development supported
by the project.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

8.     Components of the original project (total estimated grant financing of US$ 59.6 million
in 2003) were as follows.
   Component 1. Expand the delivery of the basic package of health services (US$ 46.5 million).
     This was to finance contracts (called Performance-based partnership agreements or
     PPAs) with NGOs to deliver the BPHS in seven provinces. A "Strengthening
     Mechanism" was to support delivery of the BPHS to a further three provinces by the
     MOPH.
   Component 2. Equipping the rural health infrastructure (US$ 3.7 million). Anticipating the
     planned construction of 500 primary health care facilities by USAID, this component was
     to support equipment and furniture for Comprehensive and Basic Health Centers (CHCs
     and BHCs). Also to be financed were basic surgical equipment for district and provincial
     hospitals.
   Component 3. Pilot tests of important innovations (US$ 1.0 million). This was to finance a
     pilot program to test the impact on diarrhea incidence of a household-level "safe water
     system" compared to improved water supply. Also to be supported was an evaluation of
     different health financing models, notably user fees and a community contribution
     scheme.
   Component 4. Capacity building and training (US$ 6.7 million). This component was to
     provide information and communications technology and transport to provincial health
     administrations in the provinces supported by the project. Technical assistance and
     training was to be provided to MOH at the central and provincial levels to strengthen
     management capacity. The component was to support baseline and follow-up household
     surveys and regular health facility assessments to be done by a contracted third party, as
     well as improved technical supervision of health facilities by provincial and central MOH
     staff.

1.6 Revised Components

9.     Project components were modified as follows by the first (US$ 30 million in 2006) and
second (US$ 20 million in 2008) Additional Financing.



                                               3
   Component 1. Expand the delivery of the basic package of health services (total US$ 82.2
     million). The first Additional Financing expanded support to delivery of the BPHS to
     fully cover an additional province as well as to eight new clusters of under-served
     populations. The second Additional Financing was to also experiment with pilot
     strategies to support services in insecure areas, particularly Helmand province. The first
     and second Additional Financing maintained support to the NGO contracts and MOPH
     Strengthening Mechanism until project closing in mid-2009. A total of 12 service
     delivery contracts with NGOs were in place by the end of the project.
   Component 2. Equipping the rural health infrastructure. (total US$ 1.1 million) Due to
     financing of medical equipment by another donor and the fact that necessary equipment
     in project areas was purchased by the NGOs and the Strengthening Mechanism under
     Component 1, the majority of the funding was reallocated to the NGO contracts under
     Component 1 and used for the establishment of sub-center health facilities and mobile
     outreach activities.
   Component 3. Pilot tests of important innovations (total US$ 1.0 million). There was no
     change to this component.
   Component 4. Capacity building and training (total US$ 10.2 million). The first Additional
     Financing included support to ongoing activities, notably monitoring and evaluation and
     technical assistance to MOPH management, and added support to a series of annual
     hospital performance assessments, an assessment of capacity needs of MOPH managers,
     and training of community midwives and community health workers (CHWs).
   Component 5. Polio Eradication and Measles/Neo-Natal Tetanus Control (total US$ 8.0
     million). The first Additional Financing added support for national immunization
     campaigns against polio, measles, and neo-natal tetanus, including Vitamin A distribution.

1.7 Other significant changes

10.    The project's implementation period was extended to a total of six years, from mid-2003
to mid-2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

11.   Preparation. A number of features of the preparation process positively affected project
outcomes.
       ·   Embedded in sector strategy development. Preparation of the project was intertwined
           with support and technical dialogue on the post-conflict reconstruction of Afghanistan
           during 2002-03, in particular through a series of joint donor missions co-led by the
           World Bank. The most important strategic choice was whether to pursue
           development of a largely government-run health system or to contract out service
           delivery to NGOs. The Bank emerged as the strongest champion of the latter option
           and this shaped the IDA-financed project as well as the development projects
           supported by other major donors, notably USAID and the EU.



                                                4
           ·   Drew on experience in other post-conflict situations. Experience with public-private
               partnerships for the delivery of health services, notably in Cambodia, was widely
               shared and discussed with partners and MOPH.
           ·   Strategy owned by government. The debate on implementation strategy was
               contentious and the Bank was accused by some partners of pushing the NGO
               contracting strategy too strongly. However, MOPH came down clearly for the option
               of contracting-out service delivery. "The MOH was effectively in the `driver's seat'
               from this moment onwards, pushing consistently for the implementation of the BPHS
               and subcontracting service delivery to NGOs."7
           ·   Based on sector policy framework. The technical content of the project was
               determined by parallel development of sector policies, in particular definition and
               costing of the BPHS and specification of a National Salary Policy.
           ·   Established implementation capacity. The importance of early support to
               development of MOPH implementation capacity, particularly establishment of the
               GCMU during project preparation, cannot be overstated in order to achieve rapid
               start-up in a low-capacity post-conflict setting.

12.     Design. The core design of the project was appropriate to the country and sector context
and essential to project outcomes. This was to contract NGOs to deliver a basic package of
health services in rural areas. At the same time, MOPH and the Bank team agreed to implement
a hybrid "Strengthening Mechanism" strategy, whereby services would be delivered directly by
the MOPH in three provinces using reformed public sector management procedures, supported
by technical assistance. This was appropriate in that it provided a necessary compromise
between the vision of a government-run health service and the contracting strategy as well as an
opportunity to compare results between government-run and contracted-out services.

13.        Risks. The project addressed a variety of risks which can be grouped into the following.
           ·   Overall security and political risks. Mitigation measures were (i) the NGO
               contracting strategy, (ii) community engagement in support to and supervision of
               health facilities, and (iii) additional support for interventions in highly insecure areas.
           ·   Socio-economic and cultural determinants of project outcomes. It was recognized
               that project outcomes are dependent on a range of socio-economic and cultural factors,
               notably poverty, education and gender. The main mitigation measures were to
               address gender barriers to access to care by focusing on increasing the number of
               women health providers and extending services geographically, as well as to monitor
               access to services by the poor through surveys of patients and households.
           ·   Opposition to the contracting strategy. Opposition to the contracting strategy is cited
               by project documents as an important risk and the response is to support the creation
               of an evidence base to inform the debate. More broadly, project support of the
               Strengthening Mechanism provided an alternative option both for purposes of



7
    Strong, Wali and Sondorp (2005).


                                                      5
           comparison as well as mitigation of the risk that no alternative strategy would be
           available to replace the NGO contracts should they be stopped.
       ·   Capacity constraints. A major mitigation measure was to strengthen the capacity of
           MOPH through support for the GCMU. Strong technical oversight of the NGOs by
           the GCMU in turn mitigated the risks of the capacity constraints on the NGO side.

14.    A 2003 Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review rated Quality at Entry as Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

15.    The following issues that arose during implementation negatively affected project
performance.
       ·   Delay in MOPH Strengthening Mechanism. Implementation of the Strengthening
           Mechanism was delayed as MOPH instead proceeded with a bidding process to
           contract NGOs like in the other provinces. Because the bid prices received were
           judged to be too high, MOPH returned to the Strengthening Mechanism strategy. The
           late start initially led to poorer performance in the Strengthening Mechanism
           provinces compared to the provinces supported by NGO contracts, but this difference
           in results on average disappeared as implementation proceeded.
       ·   Rising insecurity. Insecurity increased substantially during the course of project
           implementation, affecting operations, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation.
           NGOs adapted in various ways, including modifying movements of staff and supplies,
           stopping the use of easily-identifiable vehicles, obscuring their association with
           government, and strengthening relationships with local communities. The second
           Additional Financing includes support for innovative interventions in insecure areas
           such as conditional transfers to households (designed to bring people to health
           services to reduce the need for outreach to isolated areas).

16.   The following adaptations during implementation positively contributed to project
outcomes.
       ·   Increased emphasis on reaching communities with basic services. The results of
           monitoring and evaluation, particularly a 2006 household survey financed by the
           project, indicated that utilization of key services remained low, likely due to barriers
           to access (discussed in Section 3.2 below) to the facility-based services that had been
           much improved by the project. Project management and the Bank team increasingly
           emphasized the importance of getting services out to remote communities as well as
           improving demand for services. This led to the establishment of a new category of
           health facility (sub-centers) closer to communities, as well as the use of mobile teams
           to provide curative and preventive services. Additional financing also added support
           to mass immunization campaigns to improve coverage.
       ·   NGO innovations. Although the technical standards that the NGOs were required to
           meet were quite detailed, there was room for innovation to achieve progress on the
           key indicators. The main examples of such innovations introduced by the NGOs (and
           later encouraged by MOPH project-wide) were the use of sub-centers and mobile



                                                6
           teams to bring services closer to remote communities. Another example is the hiring
           by several NGOs of female health workers from Tajikistan in order to make progress
           towards targets for female staff of health facilities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

17.     Design. Effective monitoring and evaluation was essential to the overall strategy of the
project and substantial resources (approximately US$ 10 million, or about 10% of total funding)
were devoted to it. Data collection was not confined to the project areas but provided province-
level estimates nationwide to permit MOPH and donors to monitor progress in the sector as a
whole. A prominent US university, partnered with a research institute from the region, was
contracted to design and implement the monitoring and evaluation system.
       ·   High-quality annual facility surveys produced indices to measure various aspects of
           service provision and quality. An overall index (called the "Balanced Scorecard")
           was constructed in order to provide one measure to summarize each province's
           performance. This design turned out to be very useful by providing easy to compare
           (over time and between provinces) measures of performance in various areas based
           on more detailed data in specific areas.
       ·   A clearer strategy on household surveys should have been developed from the outset.
           For baseline data, the project intended to rely on a Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey
           (MICS) done in 2003, but this turned out to have problems with the sampling frame
           (requiring later re-analysis). For follow-up data, the project initially intended to rely
           on a multi-sectoral survey, the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA),
           but questions about the quality of the health module led it to finance a dedicated
           survey of rural areas in 2006. Despite this experience, MOPH decided to rely on a
           subsequent NRVA in 2007-08 to provide trend information on household level
           indicators. Final estimates from this survey became available in 2009 to allow
           assessment of key indicators that required household level survey data.
       ·   Despite the regular availability and quality of the facility surveys and the problems
           and delays associated with household surveys, key indicators for the project were
           largely service utilization indicators that required household surveys for reliable
           measurement. Targets were in many cases considered to be ambitious (for example,
           by a QAG Quality at Entry review in 2003) and in some cases were not met despite
           nevertheless impressive progress.
       ·   PDO indicators and Intermediate Outcome indicators reflected the main aspects of the
           PDO: (i) improvement in health outcomes; (ii) expansion of basic service delivery;
           and (iii) development of capacity. Most project indicators focused on the core
           objective of the project, to expand basic services. With regard to health outcomes,
           there were some relevant PDO indicators included, but well-known difficulties in
           measurement and attribution do not allow an assessment of trends, except in the case
           of child mortality. Rather than including health outcome indicators, it would have
           been better to rely on health service utilization indicators to reflect the health
           outcome-related PDO elements given the well-established scientific basis for
           assuming that higher utilization of these basic interventions will result in better health
           outcomes. With regard to the capacity-building aspect of the PDO, several relevant


                                                 7
             indicators, such as health care provider knowledge, were measured by the annual
             facility surveys.
        ·    At the same time, for regular monitoring, MOPH made effective use of the health
             management information system (HMIS) and a standardized supervision checklist.

18. Implementation. Overall, the various data sources for monitoring and evaluation were
effectively implemented. Five annual health facility surveys were done, which provided regular
and comparable data to monitor trends and compare provinces. The contracted university
applied its technical expertise to analyze and reanalyze the MICS and NRVA data, mitigating
their shortcomings, and providing estimates for key project indicators. The HMIS and
supervision systems improved over time with substantial support from USAID. The contracted
university has functioned as a genuine partner, responding to numerous impromptu requests (not
included in their terms of reference) such as analysis of community health worker effectiveness,
a study of hospital quality of care, a drug quality assessment, and development of a proposal for
a demographic surveillance system.

19. Utilization. The project support to monitoring and evaluation, particularly the nationwide
annual facility surveys, has contributed to development of a "data and results" management
culture at the different levels of the health system. This is discussed further in Section 3.1 below.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

20.      Safeguards. The project was prepared under OP 8.50 Emergency Recovery Assistance
and was classified as environmental category "B", and safeguards classification "S2". An
environmental and medical waste management plan was developed and disclosed. Annual
facility surveys provided regular data on medical waste management. In 2004, in the provinces
supported by the project, an average of 46% of health facilities were properly disposing of sharps
(ie. needles, lances, scalpels). By 2007, this had increased to 90%, although the proportion fell
back in 2008 to 79%, due to a dramatic drop in this indicator in Balkh province.8 Project
performance in this area exceeded the national average. Nationwide, in 2004 56% of facilities
were properly disposing of sharps, rising to 73% in 2008.

21.       Procurement and the NGO contracts. How procurement of the NGOs was handled was
a key factor in the performance of this project. These procurements were complex and could
therefore have entailed a lengthy procurement process, but in this case the first three NGO
contracts were signed quickly, by October 2003, only three months after grant effectiveness.
The remaining NGO contracts, as well as the contract for monitoring and evaluation (another
complex procurement), were signed early 2004. The structure of the contracts, focused on
results rather than inputs (discussed further below in Section 6), was a crucial factor in the
performance of the NGOs and the project as a whole.

 Data were collected in Helmand province only in 2004 due to insecurity in subsequent years. The 2008 estimate
did not include Farah province due to insecurity.


                                                       8
22.     Procurement and supply of inputs. An important feature of the design of the NGO
contracts was that resources and inputs were managed under the NGOs' own procedures. There
was neither centralized procurement of inputs nor any requirement that the NGOs follow Bank
procurement procedures. Between 2004 and 2008, a drug availability index (calculated from the
proportion of health facilities with stocks of five essential drugs at the time of the survey) rose
from 60 to 91 in provinces supported by the project. This was consistently better than the
national average, which rose from 68 to 84 (Figure 1). It may be noted that a significant
proportion of other provinces relied on centrally-procured inputs. A study that tested samples of
drugs from health facilities in 2007 concluded that there was no significant problem with drug
quality.

23.      In contrast to the smooth drug supply assured by the NGOs, the MOPH Strengthening
Mechanism, which was required to follow government procedures and Bank guidelines,
experienced significant delays in one procurement of pharmaceuticals (although other
procurements were completed satisfactorily). The Bank declared "misprocurement" because of
repeated extensions of the bid validity period, lack of clarity on the quantities of drugs to be
procured, and poor coordination between the different government entities involved in the
procurement process. It should be noted that no goods were procured and no amount of the grant
was cancelled. A 10-point action plan, including recruitment of a procurement consultant by
MOPH, was agreed to strengthen procurement management by the project. By project closing
this action plan had not yet been completely implemented. Overall, split responsibilities for
procurement within MOPH and between MOPH and a central agency for procurement
facilitation led to delays.

24.    Financial management and disbursement. Overall, considering that there were no
financial management systems in place when the project became effective, financial management
capacity has been built steadily over the period of implementation. The Ministry of Finance was
responsible for financial management and disbursement while MOPH also maintained


                                                               9
disbursement records. A manual system was used until 2005 by GCMU when a computerized
information system was adopted government-wide. Supporting documents were maintained
satisfactorily for all payments. Based on the final audit report, it appears that the difficulties the
MOPH experienced early during project implementation had a negative impact on the
management of the local project accounts. Financial reporting was poor initially but improved
considerably over time. Annual audited financial statements were submitted regularly, although
later than the mandated submission deadline. In 2009, a number of small transactions for
rehabilitation and remuneration of MOPH staff (totaling less than USD 70,000) were declared by
the Bank team to be "ineligible expenditures" because relevant categories were not included in
the grant agreement. (Even though such expenditures were done by the NGOs and
Strengthening Mechanism with no problems under Category 1). More importantly,
shortcomings in MOPH's project budgeting and monitoring led to an over-commitment to the
NGO contracts of over US$ 12 million that was eventually met by retroactive financing provided
under the successor project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

25.     A follow-up operation, the Strengthening Health Activities for the Rural Poor (SHARP)
project, was approved in 2009 with IDA financing of US$ 30 million and significant co-
financing from several trust funds. The new project replicates very closely the objectives and
implementation strategy of the preceding project and indeed provides significant retroactive
financing (over US$ 12 million) for previous extensions to the NGO and monitoring and
evaluation contracts. During preparation, there was some discussion of expanding the MOPH
Strengthening Mechanism but MOPH and the Bank team chose not to do so because of potential
capacity constraints and the challenges posed by rising insecurity.

26.     The large retroactive financing of the NGO contracts indicates that there was a significant
gap (of about 12 months) between the end of available financing under the first project and
effectiveness of the follow-up project. This was due to delays in advance procurement of the
new NGO contracts.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (Rating: Satisfactory)

27.      Alignment with development strategy (Rating: Highly Satisfactory). With its focus on
improving basic services for maternal and child health and nutrition, as well as control of
communicable diseases, the project directly supports Afghanistan's efforts to attain the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The 2008 Afghanistan National Development
Strategy (2008-13), prepared over a period of two years with extensive consultation, has three
pillars, including "Economic and Social Development," with the following objective: Reduce
poverty, ensure sustainable development through a private-sector-led market economy, improve
human development indicators, and make significant progress towards the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs)." The government's Health and Nutrition Sector Strategy is
centered on increasing access to basic services and specifies that MOPH will continue to
strengthen its stewardship, monitoring and evaluation and regulatory functions while "continuing
the effective partnership with non-governmental organizations."


                                                 10
28.     The Bank's 2009 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) (2009-11) supports the national
development strategy with a focus on three pillars. The first pillar is, "Building the capacity of
the state and its accountability to its citizens," including continued support to national programs
in education and health, with the objective of continuing to build the credibility of the state by
maintaining delivery of essential services to the population. The successor health project
(SHARP) is included in the ISN 2009 program. This close alignment with the Bank's current
country strategy can be contrasted with its 2003 strategy which envisioned withdrawal from the
health sector ­ contingent on a review of implementation experience. The success of the health
project has evidently contributed to maintaining the health sector as an area of focus of the
Bank's support.

29.     Objectives (Rating: Satisfactory). That the successor operation is almost identical to this
project is testament to the fact that it remains highly relevant to current priorities. Afghanistan's
epidemiological profile is one of a poor population with low life expectancy (estimated at 43
years), high fertility (total fertility rate of 6.27), and a morbidity and mortality burden dominated
by communicable diseases in conjunction with poor nutrition and poor maternal health outcomes.
Although the PDO could have perhaps been formulated to be more focused on expansion of
service delivery (ie. by not including health outcomes that are difficult to measure), the core
objective of expanding primary health care services to address the main burden of disease is
highly relevant. Other objectives relating to improving equity and developing capacity similarly
continue to be highly relevant.

30.     Design (Rating: Satisfactory). The core strategy of the project to achieve its objectives is
to expand access to basic health services that have been shown to be effective in addressing the
main causes of morbidity and mortality in low-income countries. The BPHS (Component 1)
includes immunization, antenatal, delivery and post-natal care, nutrition services and prevention
and treatment of communicable diseases, including acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, malaria
and TB. The project also supported immunization campaigns to rapidly increase coverage of
high-impact interventions (Component 5). These were interventions proven to contribute to
health outcomes.

31.     At the same time, there were questions raised since preparation about whether mental
health and disability services should be included in the BPHS and thus supported by the project.
On the one hand, there was evidence that these were significant health issues among the
population. On the other hand, other health problems had a more immediate impact on maternal
and child mortality, were more amenable to cost-effective interventions, and required immediate
attention in a highly-challenging context. A similar debate arose over support to hospital
services. In 2005, services addressing mental health and disability were included in the BPHS
and the successor project (SHARP) included support to an assessment of hospital requirements.
Given the still low coverage rates of key services such as qualified delivery care, the argument
for focusing support on proven high-impact interventions remains strong. Nevertheless, the
magnitude of the indirect impacts of psychological distress and physical disability on physical
health and poverty status may well be significant ­ but they are unknown.




                                                 11
32.    Support to strengthening core government stewardship and management capacity
(Component 4), with heavy investment in monitoring and evaluation, similarly remains highly
relevant in a situation where the core functions of the state continue to require development.
Operations research on technical and policy issues (Component 3) remains relevant to a situation
like Afghanistan, where government needs to take decisions on issues (like diarrhea prevention
and health financing strategies) that are highly dependent on contextual factors and for which
evidence is needed.

33.     Implementation (Rating: Highly Satisfactory). The implementation strategy remains
highly relevant to a situation where public-private partnership for service delivery allows limited
government capacity to be focused on stewardship functions. At the same time, the MOPH
Strengthening Mechanism allowed government to build capacity to directly manage service
delivery under reformed procedures, providing an alternative model. Rising insecurity is the
main contextual change over the project implementation period, and the NGO contracting
strategy remains adapted to the situation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (Rating: Satisfactory)

34.    Project development objectives. The PDO described in Section F of the Data Sheet
contains the following main elements.
      i.   Improve health outcomes (infant and child mortality, maternal mortality, child
           malnutrition, and fertility);
     ii.   Expand delivery of and access to a basic package of health services;
    iii.   Support national immunization campaigns;
     iv.   Focus on the under-served rural population and improve equity;
     v.    Develop the capacity of government for stewardship of the sector; and
     vi.   Develop the capacity of Afghan health workers to manage and deliver services.

35.     This section describes trends in selected PDO indicators that reflect the above elements
of the PDO. Additional PDO indicators and Intermediate Outcome indicators are described in
Annex 2.

i. Improve health outcomes (Rating: Satisfactory)

36.      Health outcomes. Under-five and maternal mortality were specified as PDO indicators
although not included in the ISRs. Such health outcome indicators are generally no longer used
as project key indicators due to widely-known difficulties in measurement and attribution. It is
better to rely on indicators of utilization of health services that are known to have an impact on
these outcomes. Measurement difficulties are evident here. A model-based estimate at baseline
(in 2000) for under-five mortality is widely-accepted ­ 257 per 1,000 live births. The 2006
Afghanistan Health Survey estimated under-five mortality in rural areas at 191 per 1,000 live
births, with a reference period of 2004. The 2007-08 NRVA estimated under-five mortality
nationwide at 161 per 1,000, with a reference period end-2004. Insofar as the baseline estimate
of 257 is valid, this would represent a substantial improvement (40% of baseline) over a period


                                                12
that overlaps with the first part of project implementation.9 Similarly, the model-based estimate
for infant mortality at baseline (in 2000) was 165 per 1,000 live births while the 2007-08 NRVA
estimated a rate of 111.

37.     With regard to the maternal mortality ratio, a model-based estimate for 2000 is 1,900 per
100,000 births. However, data for follow-up estimates are not available. The PDO also
mentions child malnutrition and fertility. There are no nationally-representative household
survey data on child malnutrition. The 2007-08 NRVA estimated a total fertility rate (TFR) of
6.3 nationally and 6.5 in rural areas, but no reliable baseline estimate is available.10 However,
analysis of data from that survey indicates a modest decline in fertility in Afghanistan in recent
years. Several project indicators measure service utilization and behaviors that are known to
have an impact these health outcomes. These indicators (ie. antenatal and delivery care, vitamin
A supplementation, breastfeeding behavior and contraceptive prevalence) are discussed below
and in Annex 2. The available data on health outcomes and for the most part large
improvements in coverage of services that are known to improve health outcomes justify a rating
of "Satisfactory" for this element of the PDO.

ii. Expand access to basic health services (Rating: Highly Satisfactory)

38.     Household surveys provide the "gold-standard" in developing countries for estimates of
service utilization indicators, while HMIS collects data from health facilities on service provision
that, combined with estimated catchment populations, provide regular reporting of service
coverage. The annual facility surveys supported by the project are considered to be of high
quality and provide data on service provision and quality. Combined, these sources of
information provide a comprehensive picture of how access to basic services changed during the
project implementation period, both nationwide and in the provinces supported by the project.
Details on survey methodologies are provided in Annex 2. It should be emphasized that when
assessing trends and comparing project areas to the country as a whole, the pattern of insecurity
that changed over time represented an important confounder.

39.     Child health care. The proportion of children aged 12-23 months who were fully
immunized was included as a PDO indicator but replaced in the 2006 Additional Financing
document with the proportion who had received DPT3 vaccination. Like the proportion of fully
immunized children, DPT3 coverage is considered an indicator of the performance of routine
immunization services, but can be more frequently estimated. Household survey data to measure
trends between 2003 and 2008 are available for these indicators. Full immunization coverage in
rural areas increased from 15.4% in 2003 to 33.2% in 2008 in the provinces supported by the
project. Nationally, in rural areas full immunization coverage increased from 11.2% to 33.3%,
representing an increase of 22 percentage points. With regard to DPT3 coverage, the baseline

  Detailed discussions of methodological issues behind estimation of child mortality from the available survey data
can be found in 2006 Afghanistan Health Survey report, the 2007-08 NRVA report, and UNICEF (2006) "Best
Estimates of Social Indicators for Children in Afghanistan, 1990-2005,"Kabul.
10
   The 2003 MICS provided a TFR estimate but there are questions about its sampling frame and the re-analysis of
the data done by the project (applying an updated sampling frame) did not include re-estimating the TFR.


                                                         13
was specified at 20%, which is the estimate for rural areas from the 2003 MICS data.11 The 2006
Afghanistan Health Survey found coverage of 34.6% in rural areas and the 2007-08 NRVA
found 39%, indicating significant improvement in comparison to 2003.

40.     Reproductive and maternal health care. The PDO indicators include the contraceptive
prevalence rate, specifically the proportion of women 15-49 years currently using a modern
family planning method. The project's baseline was 5.1%, which is the estimate for rural areas
from the 2003 MICS. Province-level household survey data are available to provide good
information on trends (Figure 2). In provinces supported by the project, the 2003 MICS found
that 7.8% of women of reproductive age were currently using a modern contraceptive method.
This increased to 9.9% in 2005 (NRVA) and 10.7% in 2008 (NRVA). Nationally, in rural areas,
the improvement was more dramatic, rising from 5.1% in 2003 to 15.5% in 2006 and then
leveling off at 13.0% in 2008.

41.     Although not included as a PDO indicator but as an Intermediate Outcome indicator, it is
important to examine trends in utilization of qualified delivery care as this is a core service
supported by the project and good household survey data are available to confidently assess
trends. The baseline for qualified delivery care coverage was 6% in rural areas (2003 MICS) and
the project fixed a target of 16%. Figure 2 illustrates significant improvement in coverage, as in
rural areas, by 2006, 18.9% of deliveries were by qualified personnel (Afghanistan Health
Survey), a proportion which leveled off to 15.0% in 2008 (NRVA). In provinces supported by

updated sampling frame and are the median value of the provincial-level estimates for rural areas.


                                                                  14
the project, qualified delivery care rose from 7.9% in 2003 (MICS) to 9.8% in 2005 (NRVA) and
15.6% in 2008 (NRVA). Even though utilization remains low by international standards,
coverage of qualified delivery care tripled since 2003.

42.    General curative care and disease control. The annual per capita number of outpatient
consultations is measured by the HMIS, based on reporting by public sector (ie. government and
NGO) facilities. The baseline fixed by the project was 0.23, with a target of 1.0. Nationally (ie.
including both urban and rural areas), this statistic rose to 0.6 in 2006, 0.7 in 2007 and 1.0 in
2008. In provinces supported by the project, the average reported outpatient consultation rate in
2008 was 1.2, ranging from 0.8 in Helmand to 1.7 in Kapisa.

43.     The project's support to improved tuberculosis control is important in that the disease
constitutes a very large burden in Afghanistan and control requires quality facility-based services.
Afghanistan is considered a "high-burden" country, with in 2007 an estimated 168 new cases per
100,000 population and 8,200 deaths (WHO, 2009). The treatment success rate rose from 80%
reported in 2003 to 89% reported in 2008, which prevented a substantial number of deaths. The
annual facility surveys also showed substantial improvements in indicators of TB services, as
described in Annex 2.

44.    Overall health service provision. Part of the project's success in improving health
coverage involved support for substantial physical expansion of health services. Nationally, in
2002, WHO estimated that 496 health facilities were delivering basic health services, while the
number in 2008 delivering the BPHS was 1,170. In the project provinces, these figures were 168
in 2003 and 385 in 2008. Survey data show that service utilization drops rapidly as travel time to
the nearest health facility increases.

45.     The synthesis index (on a scale of 0-100) of the results of the annual facility surveys,
called the "Balanced Scorecard," is specified as an Intermediate Outcome indicator, but should
be emphasized as an indicator of overall project performance. It is the core measure used by the
government and the NGOs to measure performance of the health system at the province level,
and it provides a measure from a reliable source of the effectiveness of project support to
provision of the BPHS. Nationally, from a baseline of 49.6 in 2004, this score increased to 71.7
by 2008. Provinces supported by the project showed similar improvement (Figure 3).

46.      Leveling-off in progress and the impact of insecurity. Along with general improvements
in the indicators, other patterns are evident. For many indicators, after rapid improvement
between 2003-04 and 2006, there seems to have been a leveling-off in 2007-08. While the
facility surveys often showed a continuing straight-line increase in indicators, the household
surveys suggested stabilization or some decline in utilization indicators between 2006 and 2008.
This is partly due to differences in the sampling frame between the 2006 and 2007-08 household
surveys.12 When this is accounted for, the declines observed since 2006 largely disappear ­ with
the exception of contraceptive prevalence. However, the rapid rate of increase observed 2003-06
does not reappear, indicating a leveling off in these indicators since 2006. Although this may
reflect the law of diminishing returns, likely more important is the increasing insecurity in many
parts of Afghanistan. For example, the correlation coefficient between a three-point provincial-
level scale of insecurity (with a higher score meaning higher insecurity) and percentage
improvement between 2004 and 2008 in full immunization coverage is quite significant at -0.41
(ie. increased insecurity is correlated with lower improvements in coverage). A similar pattern is
seen between the insecurity score and improvement in the "Balanced Scorecard" index, with a
correlation coefficient of -0.30 (source is author's estimates).

47.     Nevertheless, the project's support for innovative approaches in contexts of high
insecurity showed results, as for example, utilization of basic services rose substantially (see
graph in Annex 2) after the contracted NGO in Helmand province introduced: conditional cash
transfers, performance-based incentives for CHWs and health facility staff, establishment of
additional sub-centers and monitoring and supervision by local authorities and community
members.

48.     Despite improvements, still low coverage levels. At the same time, it should also be
noted that in many cases health service utilization started from a very low baseline and is still
very low by regional and international standards ­ an example is coverage of qualified delivery
care which despite a 150% increase since 2004, was still only 15% in 2008. This reflects
persistent and difficult-to-address geographical and cultural barriers that are difficult to address
by improved facility-based services.

49.    Overall, there was substantial expansion of basic health services due to the project, even
though some of the over-ambitious targets that it set for itself were not met.




12
  The 2007-08 NRVA covered several provinces that were not sampled by the 2006 Afghanistan Health Survey due
to insecurity, specifically Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul, Nuristan and Uruzgan.

iii. Support national immunization campaigns (Rating: Moderately Satisfactory)

50.     Immunization to prevent polio, measles and neonatal tetanus can be delivered by mass
campaigns, along with vitamin A supplementation. Figure 4 describes trends in coverage of
these interventions, showing high coverage in rural areas of measles immunization and vitamin
A supplementation due to recent national campaigns. By 2005, coverage levels had dropped,
and the 2006 Additional Financing included substantial support to national immunization
campaigns. Coverage levels then improved in 2006. An apparent decline between 2006 and
2007-08 for some of these indicators is largely due to different sampling frames (due to
insecurity) for the two household surveys. Overall, in 2007-08 coverage of polio and tetanus
toxoid vaccination was higher than the 2003 baseline, while coverage of measles vaccination and
vitamin A was lower. However, compared to 2005, coverage of measles vaccination and vitamin
A supplementation improved during the period that the project allocated substantial resources to
mass campaigns.

iv. Target under-served rural populations and improve equity (Rating: Satisfactory)

51.     An important element of the project objectives was to address two major barriers to
access to health care in the country: geographic and gender. The project targeted support
exclusively to rural areas. Table 1 provides household survey estimates of coverage of three key
health services in urban and rural areas in 2003 and 2007-08. It shows that although the absolute



                                                            17
percentage point gap between urban and rural areas remained similar over time, improvements in
rural areas occurred at a much faster rate relative to baseline.

52.    The project also focused on improving cultural accessibility of health services to women
by encouraging health facilities to have female staff and by training community midwives. The
proportion of health facilities with female staff was a PDO indicator, with a baseline of 24.8%
(from a 2002-03 assessment supported by USAID) and a target of 80%. In 2008, according to
the HMIS, 83% of facilities delivering the BPHS were staffed by at least one female health
worker. The annual facility surveys collected data on the gender distribution of new outpatients,
finding that overall, in 2004, 54.7% of new outpatients were female and this increased to 60.8%
in 2008. Project provinces showed similar improvement, increasing from 51.8% in 2004 to
59.5% in 2008. (Figure 5).

53.     Demand-side gender barriers remain significant. Household survey data provide some
insight into gender-related barriers to access. Perhaps unexpectedly, given the importance of
gender-related barriers, the 2006 Afghanistan Health Survey found that the reasons for not
seeking care ­ mostly cost and distance ­ did not differ between men and women. Similarly, the
2007-08 NRVA found that 49% of women and girls reported that cost was a reason for not
seeking care, and 47% reported distance. Only 6% cited a lack of female health personnel, 5%
cited a lack of someone to accompany them, and 5% mentioned traditional constraints such as
lack of permission from the husband or family. However, it is evident that gender barriers are
intertwined with cost and distance barriers in that women and girls are often required to be
accompanied by a male family member in order to access health care, thereby doubling travel,
food and lodging costs. Decision-making on these issues usually resides with the male head of
household. The 2007-08 NRVA found that in 80% of households the male head of household
was the decision-maker with regard to spending for health care for his spouse. This proportion
was 77% with regard to health spending for a child. The large progress in improving supply-side
factors (ie. female health workers) will need to be followed by strategies to address such
complex demand-side factors.

v. Develop capacity for stewardship of the sector (Rating: Highly Satisfactory)

54.     Development of core capacity for stewardship. Overall, the project supported the
effective implementation of national strategies and policies under the stewardship of the MOPH.
At project appraisal, most health services were provided by NGOs in an uncoordinated way, each
following their own technical strategies and standards. By the end of the project, the government
was clearly in charge of setting these strategies and standards and (in the case of the Bank-
financed project) directly managed service-delivery contracts with NGOs.

55.     Contract management capacity. The project supported the creation and development of
GCMU as a core capacity within MOPH to manage NGO contracts. The BPHS and National
Salary Policy in particular provided strong a technical framework to shape definition of the NGO
contracts, budgets and workplans (as well as those of the MOPH Strengthening Mechanism).
These were quite detailed and (along with monitoring of performance indicators) provided a
basis for supervision and management of the contracts by GCMU. During the course of
implementation, the capacity and track-record of the GCMU consultants led MOPH to make use
of them for tasks not directly related to project implementation. In particular, they were used to
provide just-in-time response (such as doing analyses or drafting policy documents) and for
continuous support to some departments of the Ministry. Similarly, the other main donors who
were financing NGO service delivery contracts came to support GCMU and closely involve it in
implementation of their projects. USAID is now also moving towards channeling its funding
through GCMU rather than managing NGO contracts directly.

56.      Role of provincial health administrations. In contrast to GCMU, the role of the
provincial health administrations was more ambiguous, and questions can be raised about
whether the project could have done more to support this level. The provincial health
administrations contributed to technical oversight of the NGO contracts but did not have
significant management responsibilities. To an extent, this situation reflected the centralization
vs. decentralization debate within government and among donors in Afghanistan. At the same



                                                19
time, project management (and the Bank team) wanted to avoid the risk of unproductive or
political interference in NGO operations by provincial authorities. The project supported the
creation of Provincial Coordination Committees and provided some material support (such as
communications equipment), but in contrast to other donor-funded programs, the project did not
provide technical assistance. Because project-supported provinces did as well or better than the
rest of the country with regard to service delivery and utilization indicators, it seems that this
made little difference to the core project objective, but it may have been a shortcoming with
regard to the capacity-building objective.

57.     Data and results management culture. The project's strong support to monitoring and
evaluation has been a crucial contribution to the development of a "data and results culture" of
focus on indicators, targets and results. Health facilities track monthly evolution in key coverage
indicators, comparing performance to targets, and the same is done at higher levels by NGOs,
provincial health directors, GCMU, MOPH Strengthening Mechanism, and indeed the Minister
of Health. The regular information available from the "Balanced Scorecard" facility survey and
the HMIS influences management and policy decisions; for example, identifying poorly-
performing provinces for increased scrutiny and support, or revealing the need to bring services
closer to communities through sub-centers. The NGO contracts emphasized key performance
indicators and targets which were regularly monitored by MOPH during implementation.
Poorly-performing provinces and NGOs were quickly identified. In one case (Nimroz province),
the NGO contract was terminated by GCMU and a replacement was contracted. In other cases
(Badghis and Farah provinces), GCMU successfully pushed the NGOs to improve performance
and intensified field supervision. In addition, on the basis of the results of regular facility
surveys, performance bonuses were paid to the best-performing NGOs (and also to high
performing MOPH Strengthening Mechanism provinces that were evaluated along with the
NGO-supported provinces).

58.      Innovations to influence policy. The project as a whole rapidly scaled-up a number of
innovations, most importantly the performance-based NGO contracting strategy and annual
facility surveys to measure results. At the same tijme, Component 3 supported large-scale pilot
programs and randomized impact evaluations to assess specific interventions and strategies. One
study randomly assigned villages (totaling 1,500 households) into groups receiving a point-of-
use safe-water product ("Clorin"), hygiene education, improved tubewells, a combination of all
three approaches, and a control group. Baseline and follow-up household surveys were done
over the one-year period of implementation. The 2007 analysis found that only the combination
of interventions led to a decline in diarrhea morbidity, as the relative risk of new cases during the
peak summer diarrhea season was decreased by 39%. The main point of the pilot was to test the
effectiveness of the point-of-use product and the study's policy impact was that the government
did not adopt this particular intervention as a priority.

59.     A pilot to test health financing approaches divided a total of 55 health facilities into a
group where a community-based health insurance strategy (community health fund) was
implemented, a group where user fees were introduced, a group where services were provided
free-of-charge, and a control group which continued with whatever cost-recovery mechanism
was in place at baseline. Baseline and follow-up facility and household surveys in the catchment
areas were done. In the group implementing the community health fund, an evaluation after one



                                                 20
year of implementation found that the median enrolment rate among catchment populations was
only 6% and that there was no measureable effect on household-out-of pocket payments for
health services, although utilization increased among enrolled households. The community
health funds were thus discontinued in due to low enrolment. In the group applying user fees,
the study found that user fees represented only 3.4% of total facility operating costs, and that
effects on changes in out-of-pocket expenditures and utilization were difficult to discern,
seeming to be largely dependent on the systems in place at baseline. With regard to policy
impact, the experience with the community health funds led to the removal of community
insurance mechanisms as a policy option. More importantly, the lack of clear benefits or costs of
user fees measured by this study contributed to the government's decision in 2008 to abolish user
fees entirely for BPHS services. Overall, the pilot programs provided a very strong evidence
based for policy decisions in the two areas of intervention.

vi. Develop capacity for managing and delivering services (Rating: Satisfactory)

60.     The project's support to the MOPH Strengthening Mechanism also represented a
significant contribution to building government capacity, focused on direct service delivery in
three provinces. MOPH at the central and provincial levels rapidly developed their capacity to
manage 1,200 health workers and necessary inputs, although as discussed above, there were
problems with drug procurement. After a late start, performance in the three provinces on
average became comparable to the NGO-assisted provinces as measured by the Balanced
Scorecard, although household survey data indicates that one of the three (Kapisa) has lagged in
recent years. The Strengthening Mechanism contributed to the government's broader public
sector reform agenda, making the MOPH the largest user of reformed personnel selection and
management procedures, called Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR). In the follow-up
operation, the government has chosen not to expand the Strengthening Mechanism, but it
remains an alternative model to the NGO contracting strategy. In fact, government officials
indicate that the element of competition with the other NGO-contracted provinces remains
important to continued performance and accountability of the Strengthening Mechanism.

61.     The NGO contracts and the MOPH Strengthening Mechanism included in-service
training of health workers as part of the program to improve delivery of the BPHS as well as a
focused effort to train community midwives. One of the PDO indicators is a score reflecting
provider knowledge which is measured by the annual facility surveys. The score is the
percentage of questions answered correctly by health workers, and the 2004 baseline is 53.5%,
with the target fixed at 70%.13 Figure 6 illustrates that overall, from a baseline of 53.5% in 2004,
the provider knowledge score rapidly increased to 68.4% in 2005 and stabilized to 68.7% in
2007. In project-supported provinces, starting from the same baseline, the score reached 74.2%
in 2007.14

3.3 Efficiency (Rating: Highly Satisfactory)

62.     Technical efficacy (Rating: Highly Satisfactory). In developing the BPHS, the MOPH
and partners applied what was called a "Public Health-Based Decision Framework," which for
each intervention assessed: (i) its impact on Afghanistan's disease burden; (ii) its proven
effectiveness; (iii) the extent to which it could be scaled-up; (iv) its affordability in the long
term; and (v) equity in access to the service. In other words, the BPHS was assessed on the
basis of proven efficacy and cost, but also context-specific factors relating to disease burden,
feasibility, resource constraints and equity. With regard to technical efficacy, the services
included in the BPHS are consistent with international best-practice based on available evidence.
As an example, Table 7 in Annex 3 shows that the BPHS delivers most of the interventions that
have been identified as the most effective in preventing child mortality in developing countries.

63.     Cost-effectiveness (Rating: Highly Satisfactory). Similarly, the cost-effectiveness of the
services that are delivered as part of the BPHS has been demonstrated by numerous studies,
reviewed for example by the 1993 World Development Report and Disease Control Priorities in
Developing Countries. Estimated cost-effectiveness ratios for the interventions supported by the
project cost under US$ 100 per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) and thus considered
bargains. For example, full immunization is estimated at US$ 15 per DALY, IMCI at US$ 40,
antenatal and delivery care at US$ 40, and family planning at US$ 25.15

64.    Actual cost and impact (Rating: Satisfactory). In the Afghanistan context, the project
demonstrated that large improvements in basic health service provision and utilization can be
achieved at an annual cost of on average US$ 3-4 per capita (see Table 3 in Annex 2), which can
be compared to estimates of US$ 5-1016 per capita annually required to provide a package of
services that will achieving significant progress towards the health-related MDGs. The 2002
estimate of US$ 4.50 required to deliver the BPHS17 turned out to be sufficient to achieve the

gains described in the previous section. Partly in an effort to refine these cost estimates on the
basis of actual experience, a study of the 2006-07 costs of 21 NGO contracts financed by
USAID18 found that that it was difficult to predict costs on the basis of security level, remoteness
or even service utilization rates. This meant that fixed costs represented a significant proportion
of total costs. One implication was that per capita budgeting remained a sensible approach for
planning and determining NGO contract amounts. Another implication was that province-level
contracts (as mostly done by the Bank-financed project) were likely more efficient than contracts
to support lower aggregates of population. A third implication was that the efficiency of these
fixed costs may be enhanced across the sector by reducing transaction costs through harmonized
strategies. This was also achieved to a great extent in Afghanistan through the strong policy
framework and the harmonized approach of the three major donors.

65.    Finally, it should be noted total public sector health spending (from international and
domestic sources), at around US$ 250 million annually, represents just 4% of total public
spending in Afghanistan,19 but the improvements in indicators described above suggest that it has
had a disproportionate impact.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (Rating: Satisfactory)

66.    Table 2 provides a summary of scores on different aspects of project outcomes, using a
four-point scale and weights assigned to reflect the relative importance of different factors. The
end result is an Outcome rating of Satisfactory.

67.     The project was found to be highly relevant in terms of its alignment with development
strategy. It was substantially relevant in terms of its objectives, which were well-suited to the
challenges faced by the country but sometimes over-ambitious. The project was found to be
substantially relevant in terms of its design, which focused on expanding delivery of basic
interventions that address the main burden of disease in the country, although there were
questions raised about whether there should have been support to mental health and disability
services. The project's implementation strategy, based performance-based contracting of NGOs
combined with strengthening of MOH capacity, was highly relevant to the situation.

68.     With regard to Efficacy, available data on health outcomes (specifically child mortality)
show substantial improvement, although data limitations prevent a definitive judgment. The
project set itself indicators and targets mostly relating to its core objective of expansion of
delivery and utilization of the BPHS in rural areas of Afghanistan. In some cases, project targets
were ambitious for the difficult context of Afghanistan. High quality data are available to assess
trends in service utilization during the project implementation period. With the exception of
several interventions amenable to delivery by mass campaigns, coverage indicators (including
PDO indicators) showed substantial improvement in both project areas (where the project

almost a third of the provinces in the country and substantially contributed to setting the
technical and implementation framework put in place by the government and the other major
donors country-wide. The project objective relating to equity was substantially achieved
although improvements in supply-side factors will need to be followed by strategies to address
complex demand-side barriers. The project was highly successful in achieving its objectives in
terms of system development and capacity building.

69.     In terms of Efficiency, the technical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the interventions
supported by the project are well-founded in the public health evidence base, while the actual
costs of delivery of these services were found to be low, with substantial impact in terms of rapid
expansion of coverage.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.     The project's impact on urban-rural and gender equity is discussed above. The project's
support for pilot programs in health financing contributed to a government policy decision to
remove user fees with the intention of increasing access by the poorest. The 2006 Afghanistan
Health Survey collected data on care-seeking and health expenditures by socio-economic status.
Details are provided in Annex 3. Overall, the poorer were more likely to seek care at a public



                                                        24
sector facility, and public sector facilities on average cost less. The project's support to public
sector provision of basic services was in this manner pro-poor.

71.    Civil society development. The project contributed to development of civil society in
Afghanistan in a general fashion by encouraging public-private partnerships for service delivery
that maintained the strong role of non-state actors in provision of a core public service.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

72.    As institutional strengthening was one of the elements of the PDO, the project's impact is
discussed above.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

73. No significant outcomes other than those discussed above have been identified.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

74.     The annual health facility surveys financed by the project collected data on patient
satisfaction. Overall, the patient satisfaction index remained stable at a high level (81.8 in 2004
and 80.7 in 2008). The 2007-08 NRVA found that in rural areas, improving health services was
the third and second highest priorities respectively for male and female shuras (representative
bodies). Similarly, a 2009 national opinion survey by the Asia Foundation found that healthcare
was ranked fourth among the most important development issues (behind roads, power and
water). This survey also found that a large proportion of the population seems to have a positive
perception of the government's provision of health services, as 63% said it was doing a very or
somewhat good job in this area. Further details are provided in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (Rating: Moderate)

75.     The main development outcome of the project is increased access by the rural population
to basic health services. The most important potential risks to this outcome were identified as:
(i) deterioration in the security situation; and (ii) insufficient financing to sustain service
delivery. Deterioration in the security situation is a largely exogenous risk unless government
success in delivering basic services to the population has an impact on the conflict. Although the
health services have been affected in the most insecure areas, the NGO contracting strategy has
shown its resilience to the deteriorating security situation. With regard to the risk of insufficient
financing to maintain services, the successor project has addressed this in the immediate term
and has also made progress in diversifying funding sources.

76.    Possible change in government commitment to the implementation strategy, specifically
NGO contracting, was a risk insofar as this strategy was instrumental in achieving project
outcomes. However, establishment and continued support for the MOPH Strengthening
Mechanism provides some mitigation to this risk, while the reality of capacity limitations will
continue to present a severe challenge to proposals for substantial expansion of direct
government provision of health services.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Rating: Highly Satisfactory)

77.     A 2003 QAG Quality at Entry review concluded with a Satisfactory rating. The review
found that the project had a sensible design to meet the needs of a difficult context. Its core
objective was to meet immediate needs but it also tried out approaches for longer-term
development of the system. It technical and implementation strategies were developed as part of
a joint approach with other donors. It was ready for implementation at Board approval,
including having technical guidelines in place, tender documents prepared, an environmental
framework in place and fiduciary management arrangements. However, the panel questioned
whether the project could be implemented in the three year timeframe and found that some
indicators were ambitious. It also suggested that the project could have included support to
mental health and disability on a pilot basis and could have elaborated more on medium-term
development of the health system.

78.     In retrospect, the positive assessments of the QAG review have been borne out, while the
questions raised have largely been answered, justifying an upgrading of the Quality at Entry
rating. The positive aspects of project preparation and design are discussed in Section 2.1 above.
With regard to the QAG panel's discussion of potential weaknesses, its prediction that the
implementation period of three years would be insufficient was belied by the need for Additional
Financing by end-2005. Targets set by the project were indeed ambitious, but most of them were
substantially met. The panel suggested that the project expand its focus to include other health
problems as well as further health systems development work. In practice, the tight focus on the
project on expanding delivery of a relatively limited package of high-impact interventions was
one of its major strengths. At the same time, it included substantial support to health systems
issues (ie. the health financing and water/hygiene pilots and the MOPH Strengthening
Mechanism). Further expansion of its scope would not have been advisable.

(b) Quality of Supervision (Rating: Satisfactory)

79.     There were only minor shortcomings in the proactive identification of opportunities and
resolution of threats by the Bank team during supervision. Following is a summary assessment
of the various aspects of quality of supervision.
       ·   Focus on Development Impact. After initial attention to process issues (ie.
           contracting of the NGOs) during project start-up, the Bank team quickly turned to a
           strong focus on project outcomes as measured by key indicators. Aides-memoire
           emphasize trends in key indicators and supervision missions focus on the latest
           available data from HMIS, the annual facility surveys, and household surveys.
           Adaptations during project implementation were founded on analysis of quantitative
           data on outcomes, leading for example to greater emphasis on community-based
           services. Very late in the project implementation period, this focus on project



                                                    26
           outcomes seems to have been diffused somewhat and aides-memoire came to be
           dominated by discussion of process and fiduciary issues.
       ·   Supervision of Fiduciary and Safeguard Aspects. Rapid start-up of the project was
           supported by effective and timely review and support to fiduciary and safeguards
           processes, notably the initial contracting of the NGOs and monitoring and evaluation
           organization. A key contribution to project performance was the innovative design of
           the NGO contracts. The Bank team enlisted the support of Bank management to
           intervene with MOPH and the Ministry of Finance effectively intervened with Bank
           management and the government to address periodic delays in disbursement to the
           NGOs.
       ·   Role in Ensuring Sustainable Financing. In communication to management, notably
           through ISRs, the team flagged early on the need to sustain and identify diversified
           sources of financing for the NGO contracts. The team was successful in preparing
           two Additional Financings and a successor project to achieve this that included
           alternative financing sources. Nevertheless, a gap between the first and second
           projects led to significant retroactive financing of the contracts by the successor
           project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

80.     Successful project implementation reflects Highly Satisfactory quality at entry, while
some shortcomings, particularly the fact that a long gap was allowed between the first and
second projects, indicate Satisfactory performance with regard to supervision. The combination
leads to an overall rating of Satisfactory for Bank performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

81.     Overall, when considering the baseline situation, where there was hardly a functioning
government, progress in establishing a health administration that provides effective oversight on
the sector is impressive. A minor shortcoming in government performance is related to the
effects of centralization of fiduciary functions in the Ministry of Finance, which led to
communication and coordination problems that contributed to disbursement and procurement
delays. There was strong government commitment to and ownership of project objectives (i.e.,
achieving progress towards the MDGs by expanding the BPHS) and a supportive policy
environment was put in place. This included a strong technical framework, and, very
importantly, the opening of space for innovations, notably the GCMU, NGO contracting strategy
and adaptations to administrative procedures required by the MOPH Strengthening Mechanism.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance (Rating: Highly Satisfactory)

82.     There were no substantial shortcomings in implementing agency performance. MOPH
showed strong commitment to the project objectives and implementation strategy and ensured
effective stakeholder consultation and coordination, such as in the development of key technical

management of the NGO contracts and Strengthening Mechanism, including strong use of data
on performance from the monitoring and evaluation system. It established effective and close
working relationships with project implementing partners. MOPH maintained the necessary
implementation capacity and structures to ensure continuity between the first and second projects.
Along with the involved NGOs, MOPH contributed to smooth transitions on the ground in cases
where the NGO changed following the second project's contracting process.
83.     As mentioned previously, during the last phase of the project implementation period,
MOPH overcommitted to NGO contracts, requiring significant retroactive financing from the
successor health project. From the point of view of fiduciary management, this can be
interpreted as a shortcoming in planning and budgeting. From the point of view of the
imperative to keep services running and achieve results on the ground, this can be seen as
(audacious) risk-taking ­ with the risk paying off, as the necessary financing ultimately became
available. (If the Bank financing had not become available, it is not inconceivable that funding
for these contracts could have been identified from other sources). From a point of view that
prioritizes results over process, in the end, this over-commitment does not detract from the
Highly Satisfactory evaluation of MOPH's performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

84.   The combination of Satisfactory government performance and Highly Satisfactory
implementing agency performance leads to an overall rating of Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

85.     Effectiveness of NGO contracting strategy in a difficult context. The project
demonstrated that contracting of NGOs to deliver basic health services can be successful in
improving service coverage in the most difficult of circumstances. The structure of the contracts
was an important factor. The NGO contracts were creative adaptations of the standard Bank
lump-sum contract, bringing them in practice very close to being output-based: the focus of
contract management was on outputs in terms of improved service delivery, even though
payments were not directly linked to such outputs. GCMU's supervision and control over the
NGOs was largely focused on technical outputs rather than on oversight or management of
inputs. The balance between providing autonomy to NGOs to achieve results in the way that
they see fit and maintaining effective supervision and control is very difficult to achieve. In this
case, a number of elements provided government with confidence that it could hold the NGOs
accountable for results without close control over resources and inputs. These were the emphasis
on performance indicators in the contracts, a strong technical and policy framework, strong
capacity in the GCMU, and regular availability of reliable data on service provision and quality
from the annual facility surveys. Further contributing to government's comfort level, GCMU
closely shaped and monitored NGO expenditures ­ but through a budget process rather than
through a reimbursement process that would entail administrative controls and delays. That is,
the NGOs were required to develop and follow a very detailed budget and report quarterly on
expenditures against that budget ­ but payments to the NGOs were not tied to these expenditures.

86.    Important to ensuring accountability was the province-level targeting of the NGO
contracts, whereby each NGO was held accountable for results that were measured on a


                                                28
province-wide basis by the annual facility survey. Further strengthening the NGOs'
accountability for results was the fact that health service personnel were employees of the NGOs
and not the government, enabling large NGO autonomy in their management (as long as
technical and remuneration standards set by the government were met). Similarly, NGO control
over procurement ensured that, being responsible for all inputs, they could be held accountable
for results. The usual arguments for centralized procurement are that it results in cost-savings
through economies of scale and ensures quality, particularly in the case of drugs. However,
centralized procurement carries great risk in that any delays in the process will affect the entire
project and entire beneficiary population, whereas delays experienced by one NGO only affect
part of the project beneficiaries. The economy of scale argument ignores the costs of this risk
and indeed the costs to the beneficiary population of unavailable or delayed inputs, particularly
drugs. Quantitative data on drug availability and quality described previously indicate that
assigning responsibility to the NGOs for procurement of necessary inputs was a successful
strategy.

87.      Government capacity and implementation mechanisms. An important contributor to the
success of the project was the early establishment of core management capacity within MOPH.
The GCMU was composed of competitively-selected Afghan consultants who were remunerated
at rates that were competitive with what was offered by NGOs, UN organizations and other
international organizations. This attracted highly-qualified professionals into government.
However, objections were raised based on: (i) a perception that the GCMU was equivalent to a
project implementation unit (PIU), operating parallel to or outside the Ministry; and (ii) the view
that remuneration levels were unsustainable. These considerations relate to the structure and
financing of the public sector, while the project adopted an implementation strategy that was
focused on the best way to achieve project outcomes. In this context, with massive international
aid coming into Afghanistan, much of it bypassing government and directly implemented by
international firms and organizations, it is difficult to rectify the challenge of seeming to
handicap the public sector by preventing it from paying competitive remuneration to attract the
best-skilled staff.

88.     Importance of monitoring and evaluation to a results-based implementation strategy.
This project underlined the large benefits that can be had from investment in a well-functioning
monitoring and evaluation strategy. Factors that were important to the success of the monitoring
and evaluation strategy included closely support by the Bank team on technical issues, clarity of
the tasks described in the ToRs (ie. specified number of health facility and household surveys),
the fact that the Request for Proposals was attractive to well-qualified institutions, and effective
management of the contract by MOPH. Comparison with experience in other countries also
suggests the importance of the fact that the contracted organization was a university whose
primary motivation was not profit. High quality staff from the ranks of graduate students were
deployed, the organization had a large reputational stake in ensuring high quality according to
international best practice, it went beyond its terms of reference to pursue deeper analysis (often
with the self-interested aim of producing peer-reviewed publications), and it established an
excellent working relationship with MOPH by being highly responsive to pressing requests for
data collection and analyses.

89.     Contracting vs. government-managed service delivery. Even though health services in
few upper-income countries are provided directly by government, the default position for health
sector development in lower-income countries is often a vision of expansion of government-run
health services. The alternative public-private partnership strategy adopted by this project met
substantial resistance from some partners, including some NGOs, and is often viewed as a
transitional measure until it is possible for government to take over management of the services.
Whether government will continue in the medium to long term to focus its capacity on acting as
the financer and steward of the sector rather than as direct service provider is an open question.
Further strengthening of the role of local NGOs in service delivery may be important to how this
question is resolved. Also important will be the extent to which improved basic health services
contributes to establishing the legitimacy of the state in the eyes of the population ­ regardless of
who provides the services.

90.     The need for predictable financing of basic service delivery. The investment project
paradigm is poorly adapted to supporting the delivery of basic social services in countries such
as Afghanistan that require ongoing financing of recurrent costs. Investment projects are
basically designed to make one-off investments that are intended to produce returns after the end
of the project. A number of features of the Bank's traditional investment project framework
stem from this, such as short project implementation periods and the difficulties in financing of
civil servant remuneration (on the assumption that the government should be able to handle such
recurrent costs after the investment is completed). In this case, the investment is in human
capital and the main strategy is not one-off capital investment in equipment or infrastructure but
financing of the recurrent costs of delivering basic health services, notably personnel and drugs.
The government and the Bank team must go through contortions to make the investment project
instrument meet this need. For example, the team processed several Additional Financing
proposals and a successor project in order to meet the needs over what can be considered a
relatively short period of around eight years. It is abundantly clear that continued international
support to financing basic services in Afghanistan will be needed for the foreseeable future and
predictable financing instruments are needed that are adapted to continuous support for the
recurrent costs of health service delivery.

91.    Representatives of donors and NGOs were interviewed for this evaluation. They
expressed strong support for a harmonized strategy of ensuring and expanding delivery of the
BPHS through NGO contracting paired with effective contract management by GCMU. Other
donors are supporting GCMU and moving towards more closely involving it in NGO contract


                                                 30
management under their programs. The Bank-financed project's support to monitoring and
evaluation has provided the government, donors and NGOs with an important tool ­ the
Balanced Scorecard ­ to supervise the sector. Donors contrasted the support of their programs to
the provincial health administrations to the more limited support of the Bank-financed project.
Although NGOs emphasized their close coordination with the provincial health administrations
they also described challenges of these relationships. The NGOs indicated that the flexibility of
their contracts under the Bank-financed project allowed them to introduce innovations and
confront the challenges of insecurity. Insecurity is a major challenge, and the NGOs also cited
disbursement delays as an important problem. It was suggested that there should be greater
focus on the community level, including developing strategies for more effective support to
community health workers and community health education. (See Annex 8)

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      This Annex provides details on Intermediate Outcome Indicators as well as some PDO
indicators that were not discussed in the main text.

2.       Data sources. Especially considering the context, the main data sources can be
considered of good to high quality. The design and instruments of the five annual facility
surveys financed by the project were based on international best practice. Each round sampled a
total of over 600 health facilities across the country, with over 20 sampled in most provinces,
providing sufficient statistical power for most estimates. The sample size for the 2003 MICS
was 20,806 households but there were questions raised about the sampling frame used, which
dated from 1979. The data were reanalyzed by the project's monitoring and evaluation
contractor applying an updated sampling frame. The estimates presented here are from this
reanalysis. The 2005 NRVA was a multi-sectoral survey that contained a health module. It used
the updated sampling frame and sampled 30,822 households. The 2006 Afghanistan Health
Survey, implemented by the project's monitoring and evaluation contractor, sampled 8,278
households in 29 of the 34 provinces. The provinces of Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul, Uruzgan
and Nuristan were excluded due to insecurity. The 2007-08 NRVA sampled 20,576 households
in all provinces. Four of the 396 selected districts were not visited due to insecurity.

Component 1. Expand the delivery of the basic package of health services (actual cost US$ 102.4
million)

3.     This Component was the core of the project, accounting for the bulk of financing and
focused on the basic objective of expanding provision of basic health services. Table 3 provides
population figures for the areas supported by the project under this Component as well as total
and annual per capita support.

4.      Health outcomes. Child and maternal mortality are PDO indicators but not included in
ISRs, likely because it is not possible to measure short-term trends. Child mortality is discussed
in the main text. The baseline for the maternal mortality ratio used by project documents is
1,600 per 100,000 births, citing World Development Indicators, and the project target is stated as
a 10% reduction. An inter-agency working group using available data and models of known
correlates of maternal mortality estimated a ratio of 1,900 for 2000, while a similar estimate for
2005 was 1,800. The range of uncertainty for such estimates is so large and the data on which
they are based so poor, that it is impossible to use the maternal mortality ratio as a project
indicator. A rigorous 2002 study by UNICEF and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
focused on four districts, estimating an overall ratio of 1,600. There are little or no data to
inform an assessment of trends subsequent to 2005. The government intends to implement a
large-scale survey in the near future to enable an estimate of maternal mortality.

5.      Child health care. Immunization and vitamin A coverage indicators are described in the
main text. Several Intermediate Outcome indicators relate to appropriate breastfeeding,
important to infant and child health and nutrition. Appropriate breastfeeding involves exclusive
breastfeeding from 0 to 6 months and the introduction of appropriate complementary foods after
6 months. One indicator is the proportion of children 0-6 months who were exclusively



                                               33
breastfed in the last 24 hours. The baseline from the 2003 MICS is 82% for rural areas, with the
project target fixed at 90%. The 2006 Afghanistan Health Survey found that 83% of children 0-5
months were exclusively breastfed, while the 2007-08 NRVA found a prevalence of 79% in rural
areas. However, the 2007-08 survey probed deeper on this issue and found that a significant
proportion of mothers were giving supplementary liquids to their infants. When this is taken in
account, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding drops to 35% in rural areas. The other indicator is
the proportion of children 6-18 months who received breast milk and appropriate complementary
food in the last 24 hours. This was measured by the 2003 MICS at 67.8% in rural areas, but was
not measured with the same denominator by subsequent surveys. The 2006 Afghanistan Health
Survey found that 28.4% of children aged 6-9 months in rural areas received complementary
foods, while the 2007-08 NRVA found a rate of 39% in rural areas.

In addition, antenatal care coverage was an Intermediate Outcome indicator, with the baseline
fixed at the 2003 MICS estimate for rural areas of 4.6% and the target at 35%. Figure 7
illustrates that in the provinces supported by the project, the proportion of pregnant women who
received antenatal care rose dramatically from 5.6% in 2003 (MICS) to 12.6% in 2005 (NRVA)
and 28.2% in 2008 (NRVA). In rural areas nationwide, the improvement was similar, as 4.6% of
pregnant women received antenatal care in 2003 (MICS), rising to 32.3% in 2006 (Afghanistan
Health Survey) and stabilizing or slightly declining to 30.0% in 2008 (NRVA).

8.      Disease control. Data collected by the annual facility surveys provide indicators of
provision of TB services (Figure 9). Nationally, the proportion of facilities that had a TB register
(indicating they are providing TB treatment) rose from 18.3% in 2004 to 65.0% in 2008. The
proportion of facilities that had clinical guidelines on TB diagnosis and treatment rose from
18.6% to 76.6%. The proportion of Comprehensive Health Centers (CHCs) and District
Hospitals (DHs) that had laboratory capacity to do TB smears for case detection rose from 20.5%
to 91.4%.

Component 2. Equipping the rural health infrastructure (actual cost US$ 0.1 million)

10.    Because the necessary equipment was financed by another donor and by the NGOs and
Strengthening Mechanism under Component 1, this component was dropped by the first
Additional Financing and the funds (US$ 2.6 million) reallocated to Component 1.

Component 3. Pilot tests of important innovations (actual cost US$ 1.0 million)

11.      The water/hygiene pilot randomly assigned villages (totaling 1,500 households) into
groups receiving a point-of-use safe-water product ("Clorin"), hygiene education, improved
tubewells, a combination of all three approaches, and a control group. Baseline and follow-up
household surveys were done over the one-year period of implementation. The 2007 analysis
found that only the combination of interventions led to a decline in diarrhea morbidity, as the
relative risk of new cases during the peak summer diarrhea season was decreased by 39%. As a
result, the government did not emphasize any single intervention as a priority.

12.     The health financing pilot divided a total of 55 health facilities in ten provinces into a
group where a community-based health insurance strategy (community health fund) was
implemented, a group where user fees were introduced, a group where services were provided
free-of-charge, and a control group which continued with whatever cost-recovery mechanism
was in place at baseline. Baseline and follow-up facility and household surveys in the catchment
areas were done, while the study also made use of HMIS, financing reports, qualitative

interviews, and other sources of information. Implementation started in 2005. In the group
implementing the community health fund, an evaluation after a year of implementation found
that the median enrolment rate among catchment populations was only 6% and that there was no
measureable effect on household-out-of pocket payments for health services, although utilization
increased among enrolled households. The intervention was discontinued in 2006 due to low
enrolment. In the group applying user fees, the 2007 evaluation found that user fees represented
only 3.4% of total facility operating costs, and that effects on changes in out-of-pocket
expenditures and utilization were difficult to discern, seeming to be largely dependent on the
systems in place at baseline. The lack of clear benefits or costs of user fees measured by this
study contributed to the government's decision in 2008 to abolish user fees entirely for BPHS
services.

Component 4. Capacity building and training (actual cost US$ 5.4 million)

13.     A relevant Intermediate Outcome indicator is the number of community health workers
(CHWs) per 1,500 population submitting monthly reports. A baseline was not specified but a
target of 0.7 was indicated in ISRs. HMIS data indicate that the rate was 0.97 in project-
supported provinces in 2008.

Component 5. Polio Eradication and Measles/Neo-Natal Tetanus Control (actual cost US$ 7.9
million)

14.     Component 5 of the project provided support to national immunization campaigns against
polio, measles, and neo-natal tetanus, including vitamin A distribution. Figure 4 in the main text
provides trends in coverage levels of these interventions.

1.       Efficacy. Table 5 describes a number of child health interventions and their efficacy
against common causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. It has been
estimated that if these interventions were universally available, 63% of child deaths would be
prevented in the 42 countries that account for 90% of deaths among under-five children. The
table indicates whether the interventions are included in the BPHS and at what level of health
facility. All except possibly a component of antenatal care (antenatal steroids)20 and prevention
of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS are included in the BPHS. Other components of
the BPHS, reproductive and maternal health services as well as disease control and general
curative services, are based on international evidence for efficacy.

  It is not clear from the available information whether this specific intervention is part of standard protocols for
delivery of the BPHS.

2.      Efficiency. A standard measure of efficiency in the health sector is the cost-effectiveness
ratio. The cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is commonly used, with DALYs defined
as the years of life saved by the intervention, accounting for disability level. Because of their
low cost and high efficacy in addressing the major causes of child mortality, the neonatal, child
and maternal health interventions included in the BPHS are very cost-effective. Table 4 provides
cost-effectiveness ratio estimates for components of the BPHS, indicating that the package is
highly cost-effective.

3.      Table 3 above provides the annual per capita costs of support to beneficiary populations.
On average, during their contract periods, the NGOs provided US$ 4.03 per capita support to
basic health services. This ranged from US$ 2.42 to 5.01. During the entire project period,
average annual per capita support was US$ 2.78, which by any measure is an extremely low
level of expenditure that has nevertheless led to substantial improvements in service coverage.
The comparison underlines the efficiency of the project, but also suggests that greater resource
levels may be needed to sustain the rate of improvement.

4.      Equity. The 2006 Afghanistan Health Survey collected data from households on health
care seeking and out-of-pocket expenditures by socio-economic status. The poorest quintile
were less likely to seek care when ill; 35% did not seek care, compared to 12% among the
highest quintile. Among the poorest quintile, the most common reasons for not seeking care
related to cost of transport or care (42%) or distance or lack of transport (41%). Of those who
sought care, the poorer were more likely to first go to a public sector facility. Among the poorest
quintile, 30% went to a public health clinic and 19% to a district or provincial hospital, compared
to 23% and 13% respectively in the highest quintile. The better-off were more likely to go to a
private provider. In total, 47% among the poorest quintile went to some kind of a private
provider, compared to 61% among the highest quintile. At the same time, the cost of private
primary health care providers was higher, as the median out-of-pocket cost (including fees, tests,
drugs, transport, food and lodging) for those who went to a public health clinic was 150 Afganis,
compared to 600 for a private doctor or clinic. The median cost for those who went to a district
or provincial hospital was 500 Afghanis. Overall, the data suggest that the poor use public sector
primary health care more than the better-off, thereby incurring lower costs than if they went to
private providers.

5.       Cost. As discussed in the main text, significant expansion of coverage of basic health
services has been achieved at an annual per capita cost of US$ 4 to 5. This can be compared to
estimates of the incremental cost for achieving high coverage of basic interventions low-income
countries that are provided in Table 6. The Afghanistan cost is comparable to the estimated cost
in the first years of expansion of coverage.21 This, along with the still low coverage levels of
many interventions in Afghanistan, suggests that spending will need to increase in future years in
order to further expand coverage.

6.      Fiscal space. Total public spending on health in 2008-09 is estimated at US$ 278
million, which represents 4% of total public spending. Only 27% of the national budget
comes from domestic revenue sources as the remainder is financed by donors. Figure 11
shows that spending on security represents over 40% of public spending. Overall, these
patterns suggest that further increases in public sector spending on health will need to
come from international sources, likely through reallocation from security expenditures
as security (hopefully) improves (even though most security spending is poorly fungible).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

1.      Household surveys find that improved health services remain a priority for the
population. The 2007-08 NRVA found that in rural areas, improving health services for
men and women was the third highest priority for male shuras (representative bodies)
(behind improved irrigation and drinking water supply), and the second highest priority
for female shuras (behind drinking water). In addition, for female shuras, an additional
category ­ improved health services for women ­ was specified as the fourth highest
priority. Similarly, a 2009 national opinion survey by the Asia Foundation found that
healthcare was ranked fourth among the most important development issues (behind
roads, power and water).

2.      However, the 2009 opinion survey found that expectations are high for health
services to improve, as 75% expected the availability of clinics and hospitals to be much
or somewhat better in the next year, and 74% expected the availability of medicines to
similarly improve. A large proportion of the population also seems to have a positive
perception of the government's provision of health services, as 63% said it was doing a
very or somewhat good job in this area. The comparison with other areas in Table 7
indicates that government performance in providing social services (health and
education) is perceived to be significantly better than in other areas, with perhaps
implications for broader discussions about the need for consolidating the legitimacy and
support for the Afghan state in a situation of civil conflict.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Following is the text of MOPH's evaluation of the project:

__________________________

Assessment of the project's rationale and objective

Afghanistan's health status after the Taliban was one of the worst among the poor
countries with alarming indicators as:
   · Under 5 mortality 257/1000 live births
   · Infant mortality 165/1000 live birth
   · Maternal mortality 1600/100,000 live births
   · Acute malnutrition 6-12%
   · Iron deficiency anemia 71% in pregnant women
   · TB 70,000 new cases/year
   · Life expectancy 42.6
(CDC/UNICEF/MOH 2002, MOH 2004, UNICEF MICS 2003)

The above stated health profile of Afghanistan after the Taliban's fall determined the
rationale for the project: Provision of an essential minimum primary health care package
was necessary to meet the basic health needs of the population, in particular mothers and
children.

Project objectives:
   a. Reducing infant and child mortality, maternal mortality, child malnutrition and
        increasing access to reproductive health through the expansion of basic health
        care services.
   b. Enhancing MOPH's institutional role in the health sector
   c. Building MOPH capacity to better provide and manage health services

The selected objectives and rationale were appropriate to the health situation of
Afghanistan:
   · The project objectives addressed the most important causes of maternal and child
       mortality and morbidity.
   · They focused on the problems of the most vulnerable groups such as children and
       women.
   · Priority was given to rural and remote areas
   · Equity considerations were important and the project focused on the needs of the
       poor.
   · Achievement of the objectives could contribute to solve other health-related
       problems.
   · The objectives were affordable, practical, acceptable and measurable.

Assessment of project design



                                           46
After the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan required rapid improvement of access through
expansion of basic health services, with special focus on vulnerable and high risk groups
(mothers and children), focus on communicable and vaccine-preventable diseases. The
program should have an affordable cost, and be manageable by a minimum number of
health workers. It should be community based and consider the lack of capacity in the
government. The design of the HSERDP project fully considered the socio-economic,
political, and cultural context and prioritized the health needs of the country. The project
was design was adapted to realities such as resource limitations, and scarcity of
professional and skilled health workers. The project design reflected the lack of capacity
in the government and the fact that about 80% of health services were delivered by NGOs.

To address the country's health problems and achieve the objectives, the Ministry of
Health with the technical support of stakeholders (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, WB, EC,
USAID, JICA and others) designed the basic package of health services as a national
strategy. The Basic Package of Health Services was completed in April 2003. The BPHS
consists of the following components: Maternal and new born health, Child health and
Immunization, Public Nutrition, Communicable diseases, Mental Health, Disability care,
Supply of essential drugs.

The important decision in the design of the project was the idea of contracting the health
services which was introduced by WB on the basis of findings from a pilot project from
Cambodia. The Performance based Partnership Agreement (PPA) implementation
strategy was accepted by MoPH. The provision of the basic package of health services to
all 8 provinces (Balkh, Samangan, Saripul, Wardak, Helmand, Farah, Badghis and
Nimroz) was contracted to NGOs, and the Ministry of Health focused on its stewardship
role. The provision of BPHS for 3 provinces (Panjsher, Kapisa and Parwan) was assured
by MoPH directly through the Strengthening Mechanism.

Bottlenecks and lessons learned during implementation

The Ministry of Public Health and different implementing NGOs have raised few issues
regarding the project. The most important are:
    · Delay in payments: the implementing agencies faced this problem often and
       especially in the last 2 years of the project. All parties were responsible for delays
       (NGO, MoPH, MOF and WB) but mostly it happened in the Ministry of Finance.
    · The project didn't have any budget for construction of health facilities which
       affecte the service quality and raised communities' complaints. In the WB-
       supported project in some provinces we have up to 60% health facilities located in
       private houses while the situation was much better in EC and USAID-supported
       provinces because of having standard buildings.
    · Delay in submission of third party evaluation report (Balanced Score Card, BSC).
       It was taking about one year to be released, while sooner release of BSC would
       allow for more timely changes.
    · Excessively complicated procurement processes with involvement of three parties
       (MoPH, WB and MoF).



                                             47
   ·   Division of procurement responsibilities within MOPH. While the procurement
       of services and contract management was the responsibility of GCMU, goods
       procurement was the responsibility of the Administration Directorate and
       recruitment of individual consultants was the responsibility of the Human
       Resources directorate. This fragmentation caused delays.
   ·   Ambiguity of Provincial Health Directors' role. In some provinces their
       interference was too high while in some others their contribution was low.
   ·   Interference of local authorities in project implementation.
   ·   Outdated government procedures.
   ·   Poor coordination among ministries and departments.
   ·   Monitoring difficulties especially in insecure areas.

The main lessons learned from the HSERDP are:
   · the most important reason for the success of the project is the contracting out
      approach with a performance based partnership and using a lump sum type of
      contract,
   · establishment of GCMU with qualified staff,
   · GCMU's technical support to other departments of MoPH,
   · monitoring and evaluation by a third party,
   · managerial and financial autonomy of implementing agencies.

Lack of budget for construction of health facilities and less focus on capacity-building of
Provincial Health Offices (PHOs) had some negative impacts and caused community
complaints.

Project outcomes:
The project has significantly improved the health status of the Afghan people. The
following table is a brief comparison of national health indicators between the start and
end of the project.

Evaluation of the Borrower's performance

Generally we can assess the government performance and contribution as satisfactory.
Despite of problems and difficulties, the government was committed to successfully
manage the project. The existing problems with government especially regarding
procurement and financial management, were mentioned above.

Evaluation of the performance of the Bank

The WB contribution in the preparation of the project was great. Actually the contracting
idea and performance based partnership was introduced and encouraged by WB experts.
The WB performance was high and WB colleagues and missions always were very
cooperative. Our only comment relates to training and capacity building ­ we think that
the WB could arrange more training to build the capacity for MoPH particularly in the
fields of finance and procurement. The MoPH requests that WB kindly consider this issue
in the future.

Sustainability of the program

We did our best to make the program sustainable through efficiency, effectiveness and
minimizing the basic package of health services. 4 USD per capita is very low and should
be affordable even for a poor government like Afghanistan. On the other hand, we
improved community awareness and convinced them regarding their basic need for the
BPHS. MoPH is also trying to attract the attention of the international donor community
to BPHS and is fund-raising through different forums.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

1.      Representatives of the other major donors in the sector, the EU and USAID, were
interviewed for this evaluation. The following points were made:
       ·   There is strong support for a harmonized strategy of ensuring and expanding
           delivery of the BPHS through an NGO contracting strategy. The Bank-
           financed project is recognized for its strong contribution to development and
           implementation of this strategy.
       ·   The Bank-financed project is also recognized for its support to the creation
           and development of GCMU. USAID has provided substantial support to
           GCMU in recent years and is moving towards channeling its funds through
           government so that GCMU manages the NGO contracts directly, as it does
           under the Bank-financed project. The EU program, which continues to
           directly contract NGOs, is also finding ways for MOPH to get more closely
           involved in their management.
       ·   The Bank-financed project's support to monitoring and evaluation has
           provided the government and donors with an important tool ­ the Balanced
           Scorecard ­ to supervise the sector. The EU's recent evaluation of its
           program made use of the Balanced Scorecard results in addition to other
           information. USAID emphasized its strong support to the HMIS and routine
           supervision as very important to MOPH's oversight.
       ·   Donors contrasted the support of their programs to the provincial health
           administrations to the more limited support of the Bank-financed project. The
           importance of the Provincial Health Directors (PHD) to management of the
           system was emphasized, as it was suggested that in some cases the NGOs may
           have too much autonomy for important decisions. There was also concern
           that the provincial health administrations do not have a clear institutional
           home within MOPH.
       ·   Insecurity is the main challenge facing the sector and there is a correlation
           between the most insecure areas and other socio-economic factors that affect
           health outcomes. The NGOs are adapted to dealing with insecurity with their
           flexibility and close ties to the community.

2.      A number of NGOs that were contracted under the Bank-financed project were
also interviewed and the following issues were discussed.
       ·   The importance of the BPHS as the "backbone" of the health system was
           emphasized. NGOs cited as important achievements the establishment of
           BPHS services, training of community midwives, and support to community
           health workers.
       ·   The flexibility of the NGO contracts under the Bank-financed project was
           emphasized, allowing them to confront the challenges of insecurity, for
           example by reallocating budget to hardship allowances, and to introduce


                                           50
    innovations, such as paying for the transport costs of patients' referrals rather
    than replacing ambulances that were destroyed in the conflict.
·   The strong role of the GCMU was cited as a success factor, as well as the
    Balanced Scorecard and HMIS system that supported a focus on results.
·   The NGOs also emphasized their coordination with the provincial health
    administration, including monthly meetings and joint supervision, but also
    cited their relationships with the provincial administrations as an important
    challenge. Personnel management issues as well as competing demands
    between the provincial and central levels were given as causes of friction.
·   Insecurity presented the most serious challenge, and the NGOs have
    developed a variety of strategies, most importantly strengthening links with
    community elders to prevent kidnappings and disruption of drug supply.
    Supervision by the NGO and MOPH is greatly curtailed by insecurity.
·   The NGOs also indicated that disbursement delays have presented a major
    challenge, related to the gap between the first and second Bank-financed
    projects.
·   The NGOs suggested that there should be greater focus on the community
    level, including developing strategies for more effective support to community
    health workers and community health education. They perceive as
    constraining current government rules on the required educational level of
    community midwives and remuneration of community health workers.
