I.INTRODUCTION

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval o f the Executive Directors to provide an
additional grant in an amount o f US$20 million to the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan
for the Health Sector Emergency Reconstruction and Development Project, Grant
NumbersIDA-H043 and H206. The additional grant will beprocessed under OP/BP 8.0,
RapidResponseto Crises andEmergencies.

2.      The proposed additional grant would help finance the costs associated with the
scaling up and enhancing the impact o f a well performing project. The focus o f the
additional financing i s to expand the basic package o f health services (BPHS) and related
activities that will directly affect child and maternal mortality, especially inhardto reach
and insecure areas.

3.      More specifically, the additional financing will be used to: (i)   extend the current
contracting with NGOs and the MOPH strengthening mechanism (MOPH-SM); (ii)
strengthen the delivery o f BPHS in insecure areas, particularly in Helmand; and (iii)
support polio eradication and measlesheo-natal tetanus control.

11. BACKGROUNDAND RATIONALEFORADDITIONAL FINANCING IN
    THE AMOUNT OF US$20MILLION

4.      Background and Objectives:         The original project (SDR 43.7 million) was
approved in June 2003 with a closing date o f March 31, 2007. An additional grant for
SDR 21 million was approved inFebruary2006 extending the closing date to September
30, 2008. The proposed additional grant (SDR 12.7 million) will further extend the
closing date to June 2009. This second additional grant i s expected to be followed by a
newhealthproject to be approved inFY09 (see Table 1). The development objectives o f
the original project and of the first additional grant will also guide this second additional
grant. The objectives are to assist Afghanistan in: (a) reducing infant and child mortality,
maternal mortality, child malnutrition and increasing access to reproductive health
through the expansion o f basic health care services; (b) increasing MOPH's stewardship
over the sector; and (c) build the capacity o f Afghanhealth workers to better provide and
manage health services.

5.      To accomplish these objectives the current project (including the first additional
financing) has the following components:

   (i)Expansion of Basic Health Care Services:                    The project supports the
        implementation o f the BPHS through Performance Partnership Agreements
        (PPAs) which are contracts that the MOPH signs with Non Governmental
        Organizations (NGOs).       These PPAs cover eight under-served provinces (and
        parts o f 8 other provinces to fill gaps left by other financiers) inthe north, north-
        west and south-west o f the country. The project also supports the government's
        own efforts at delivering the BPHS inthree provinces close to Kabul through the
        MOPH-SM;

   (ii)Pilot Tests: The project has supported randomized controlled trials on the
        incidence o f diarrheal diseases and on innovative health care financing
        mechanisms. One o f the studies has field tested the impact on diarrhea incidence
        o f tube wells, hygiene promotion, and point-of-use water treatment using dilute
        sodium hypochlorite. It found that only a combination o f these interventions had
        an impact on diarrhea incidence. The other study has looked at the impact on
        utilization, patient satisfaction, and community involvement resulting from free
        services, user charges set by the community, and pre-payment scheme known as
        the "community healthfund." The results ofthis study will be available shortly.

   (iii)Capacity Building and Training: The project has helped build capacity
        through: (a) training o f key managers and provincial health directors through
        courses (including the WBI flagship course on health sector reform) and on-going
        training provided by NGOs; (b) provision o f technical assistance for the MOPH,
        primarilyby local consultants, in a large number o f areas including contract and
        grant management, health care financing, monitoring and evaluation, and donor
        and NGO coordination; and (c) substantial monitoring and evaluation including
        nation-wide health facility surveys, a large household survey, and assessments o f
        the quality o f care inhospitals.

   (iv) Polio Eradication, Measles and Neo-Natal Tetanus Control: The first
        additional financing grant provided US$6 million to support polio eradication
        efforts and US$2 millionto support measles and neo-natal tetanus campaigns.

6.      ProjectImplementationExperience:The project is rated highly satisfactory for
achievement o f development objectives and satisfactory for overall implementation
progress. The MOPH and its implementing partners continue to make steady progress
and they appear to have both widely expanded service delivery while also improving the
quality o f those services. The progress against the development objectives indicators i s
reported in Table 2 which i s based on the results o f third party household and health
facility surveys and health management information system (HMIS) data. The overall
positive results reflect the more than doubling o f the number o f health facilities and the
increase in quality o f care. Payments to NGOs have been timely, disbursement o f the

have been complied with.

7.       Quality of Care: The project has supported a series o f third party assessment o f
health facilities nationwide that examines a wide variety o f indicators (29 intotal) related
to the quality o f care. The indicators include provider knowledge, patient-provider
interaction, patient satisfaction, availability of drugs and equipment, presence o f staff,
etc. Based on this extensive data set it appears that there has been a 22 percentage point
improvement (more than one baseline standard deviation) in the quality o f care from
2004 to 2007 in project provinces, somewhat higher than the countrywide results (see
Annex 4 for more details).

8.       Rationale: The Government has requested the additional financing to further
enhance the development impact o f the project, and to gain additional experience on
delivery mechanisms, especially inhard to reach areas. Additional data from the project,
along with the results o f an health sector review that the Bank i s currently conducting in
Afghanistan, will help the Government to definepolicy options for the nexthealthproject
to be approved in FY09. The rationale for the specific activities to be financed with the
additional grant is:




   Some o f the data presented were collected through household surveys in November 2006 (See Annex 2).
More recent data from HMIS system (e.g. DPT3 coverage) show further gains.

    (9     Extend the current contracting with PPAs and MOPH-SM:                 While the
           progress in PPA and MOPH-SM provinces has been remarkable in many
           areas (see Table l), coverage o f services is still low by international
                                    the
           standards.     The Government would like to extend the contract for an
           additional year to consolidate achievements and to further improve
           performance in specific areas such as immunization and attended deliveries.
           The Government would also like to accumulate more evidence on what the
           two delivery models o f service delivery (PPAs and MOPH-SM) can
           accomplishunder operational conditions, so as to define the best arrangements
           for future operations.

    (ii) StrengthenthedeliveryofBPHSininsecureareas, particularlyinHelmand:
           The provision o f services ininsecure areas is one o f the biggest challenges in
           Afghanistan: inHelmand province, almost 40% o f the original health facilities
           have been closed due to insecurity with 6 o f them having been destroyed;
           eleven health workers, out o f a staff o f 440 were killed in 2007 and only three
           o f the 27 functioning health centers have trained female staff. This desperate
           situation has resulted in the lowest results among the PPA provinces on out-
           patient visits, skilled birth attendance, TB case-detection rate, DPT3 coverage,
           antenatal care coverage, etc. (This i s according to HMIS data as it i s too
           dangerous to carry out household or health facility surveys in Helmand). The
           Government would like to experiment with different supply and demand-side
           interventions to increase the provision o f health services in Helmand. The
           successful elements o f the Helmandpilot could be replicated inother insecure
           areas under future operations.

    (iii) Supportpolioeradication andmeaslesheo-natal tetanus control:Afghanistan
           i s one o f the last nine countries in the world endemic for polio. Although the
           numbero f cases has beendrastically reduced inrecent years (from 31 in2006
           to 17 in 2007), polio cases are still being identifiedin the country (4 in 2008,
           as o f March 25). Measles and tetanus also remain major contributors to child
           mortality. Measles coverage has increased to 63%, a remarkable value, yet
           distant from an ideal coverage of 90%. Similarly DPT coverage remains low,
           especially considering the high drop out between D P T l (60%) and DPT3
           (34%). The MOPH sees polio eradication and immunization as key priorities
           for the health sector.

111. PROPOSEDCHANGES

9.     Extension of BPHS: The additional grant will finance the extension for an
additional year, up to June 2009, o f the existing 12 sub-grants provided by MOPH to
NGOs. The extension o f BPHS in PPA areas will guarantee continued provision o f basic
health services to approximately 6 million people inthe Project Area. The contract terms
will be modified to reflect population increase and inflation, but will remain identical
with regard to objectives and implementation arrangements. The additional grant will
also support the extension o f the MOPH-SM in three provinces near Kabul with an
estimated population o f 1.1 million.


                                               4

10.       StrengthenBPHS delivery in insecure areas, particularly in Helmand: The
additional grant will support the implementation o f BPHS in Helmand by Ibn Sina, a
local NGO with large experience in conflict affected areas. The key elements o f this
activity are: (i)conditional cash transfer schemes for well child visits and for mothers to
deliver in the facility; (ii) performance-based incentive scheme for CHWs; (iii)a
                              a
security allowance for skilled health workers on top o f the National Salary Policy to keep
insecure facilities appropriately staffed; (iv) the establishment o f 10 sub-centers on a pilot
basis; (v) the establishment o f a monitoring system by the provincial health office,
memberso fthe community, and IbnSina; and (vi) community midwifery education.

11.     Polio eradication and Measles/Neo Natal Tetanus Control: The additional
grant will provide financial support to polio eradication efforts as well as immunization
campaigns and routine vaccinations. The funding will be used to procure vaccines and
related goods, through UNICEF.

IV.CONSISTENCY WITH ISN

12.      The extension o f the BPHS is aligned with the 2006 Interim Strategy Note (ISN)
dual goal o f "providing tangible benefits to the population" and "developing the capacity
o f the state". The proposed activities will guarantee increased access to health services to
approximately 6 million people and will contribute to improved health indicators
particularly in under-served areas. The innovative approach proposed for Helmand i s in
line with the "flexibility" advocated in the I S N "to respond in real time to emerging
issues".

13.     On the capacity building side, the process o f contracting out services through
PPAs will be further institutionalized, thus strengthening the stewardship function o f
MOPH, e.g. its capacity to channel and manage funds from various donors (e.g. USAID,
EU), and its capacity to monitor and evaluate program performance through third party
assessments. At the same time, the provision o f services through the MOPH-SM will
continue to build the state capacity to directly deliver services that are affordable,
accessible and o f adequate quality.          Ultimately, this project aims to increase
Government's accountability for the delivery o f services to the Afghan people: this i s
fully consistent with the principles guiding the 2006 I S N and the Afghanistan National
Development Strategy.

V. APPRAISAL OF RESTRUCTUREDOR SCALED-UPPROJECT
     ACTIVITIES

14.     Technical Considerations: The PPAs have beenunder implementation for four
years and have achieved considerable improvements inboth the coverage o f services and
the quality o f care. The contracting model inAfghanistan has been extensively studied
by internationalpublic health experts and is beingtransferred and adapted to other fragile
states (e.g. Somalia, Democratic Republic o f the Congo, and South Sudan). The success
o f the model essentially depends on three factors: (i) the Government capacity to manage
NGOs contracts effectively and efficiently through pay for performance arrangements;


                                               5

(ii) NGOsflexibilitytoquickly andeffectivelyaddressimplementationchallenges;
    the
and (iii) presence o f a strong monitoring and evaluation system by a reliable third
         the
party to sustain the above. On the other hand, the MOPH-SM has been progressingwell
thanks to some distinctive advantages over normal government provision of services,
including: (i) wages for health workers are as high as what the NGOs are paying; (ii)
competition from the NGOs set the standard for what can be accomplished; (iii)    slightly
more financial resources than the NGOs; (iv) proximity to Kabul and stable security
conditions; (v) assistance from a procurement agent on procurement; and (vi) talented
managerial support (recruited from the NGO sector) for the provincial health directors.
From the technical viewpoint it is reasonable to maintain the two pronged approach to
service delivery based on NGOs and MOPH-SM.

15.     Economic Aspects: The BPHS that the MOPH has emphasized continues to
make economic sense inthe context of Afghanistan. It contains the most cost-effective
interventions that the Government will be able to afford in the long run. The focus on
reducing child mortality and fertility rates will facilitate long-term economic growth as
witnessed by the history o f the newly industrialized economies o f East Asia where
significant declines in both indicators preceded economic take-off.      Contracting with
NGOs appears to be an efficient use o f resources, at least partly because? it reduces
absorptive capacity constraints, improves focus on results and responsiveness,
strengthens management, and increases flexibility. The approach also appears to be
sustainable. The cost o f delivering the BPHS through PPAs i s about $4 per capita per
year, or roughly 1.6% o f the current per capita GDP. As the economy grows and
Government revenues expand, the cost o f the PPAs will be affordable by the Government
inthe long run, evenifexternal assistance were to bereduced.

16.     InstitutionalArrangements: The current project is beingmanagedby the grants
and contracts management unit (GCMU) o f the MOPH and the activities under the
additional grant will use the same approach. The role o f the G C M U was originally
envisaged to be coordination and oversight o f NGOs who are implementingthe BPHS
through out the country. It was also intended to manage the PPAs financed by the Bank,
however, it now manages funds coming from 16 different donors. In addition to its
original functions, the GCMU i s now also carrying out the following: (i)providing
technical assistance to many line departments in the MOPH; (ii)assisting in the
implementation o f Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI) and Global
Fund activities; (iii) coordination; (iv) chairing and carrying out the secretariat
                      donor
functions for the Consultative Group for Health and Nutrition and other partner
coordination efforts; and (v) a variety o f policy related activities such as guiding the
technical working groups on health care financing and human resource development.
The GCMU has performed very well since its inception four years ago, obtaining the
confidence o f the MOPH, and other donors. The European Union and USAID have
decided to course their funds through the MOPH, partly reflecting confidence in the
GCMU's ability to properly manage contracts and accounts.

17.     Procurement:Recruitment of NGOs (which accounts for the bulk of the project
financing), third party assessment firm, and individual consultants has been effectively
carried out by the G C M U using competitive processes. The G C M U has been assisted by


                                             6

ARDS in the procurement of goods such as radios and pharmaceuticals.                   The
procurement administration under the project has during the last year been less than
satisfactory, resulting ina mis-procurement, possibly without cancellation, o f drugs under
MOPH-SM. The mis-procurement was due to unacceptable delays in bid evaluation.
The MOPHhas taken a series o f actions to improve procurement management, including:
(i)establishing acompetent andpermanentevaluationcommittee to evaluate bidson
timely manner comprising MOPH staff and consultants with substantial procurement
knowledge and who work full-time on procurement; (ii)recruiting an international
auditing firm to carry out an independent audit o f NGOs with PPAs; (iii)       conducting
studies o f drug quality at health facility level using WHO accredited laboratories outside
the country; (iii). positive experience with the contracting process under the Bank
                     The
financed HIV/AIDS Prevention Project suggests that the overall procurement capacity in
the MOPH is adequate. Involvement of ARDS Procurement Unit for contracts above
$200,000 should further improve MOPH procurement capacity. Procurement under the
project will be done in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (dated May 2004; revised October 2006);
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"
(dated May 2004; revised October 2006); and the provisions stipulated in the Financing
Agreement. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, Requests for Proposals, and
Forms o f Consultant Contract will be used in case of conflict/contradiction between the
Bank's procurement procedures and any national rules and regulations, the Bank's
procurement procedures will take precedence.           A more detailed procurement plan
developed by the GCMU indicating description o f the packages, estimated prices, method
o f procurements, status o f bank review, expected bids/proposal opening, etc i s in Annex
3.

18.     Financial Management: Project financial management has been generally
satisfactory. The current financial management arrangements have been reassessed by
the Bank for the additional financing and found to be adequate. The FMassessment also
indicated that the overall FMrisk rating for the project remains substantial. There are no
over due audit reports for this project and for other projects being implemented by the
implementing line ministry (MoPH). Key issues raised in the latest audit report for the
project, March 20 1385 (2007), have just been communicated by the Bank and the
project's response will be sent in due course. The external audit reports submittedby the
PPA NGOs have beenacceptable and have not shown any serious problems. The MOPH
has agreed to further strengthen financial management by: (i)updating the fixed asset
register; (ii)recording cash receipts (i.e. replenishments into the special account); and
(iii) including expenditures by activity/component in the quarterly financial monitoring
report.

19.     Disbursement: The additional financing will make use o f the existing
disbursement management arrangements, including the designated account (US$6
million) already opened at the Central Bank (DAB) and managed by the Special
DisbursementUnit. Arrangements for reporting on expenditures are unchanged, allowing
for use o f Statements o f Expenditure for expenditures on goods contracts below US$
200,000; consulting firm contracts below US$lOO,OOO; individual consultants contracts
below US$50,000 and for all expenditures related to sub-grants, training and incremental


                                               7

operating costs. There is not retroactive financing under this additional financing and no
disbursement conditions

20.     Safeguards and BankPolicies: The original project triggered the Environmental
Assessment policy and was categorized as category B. An environmental assessment
was carried out in 2003 and the results were used by MOPH to formulate health care
waste management policies. The environmental policies implemented by the MOPH
under the original project appear to be having real and lasting benefits. The progress of
implementation o f the policies i s being tracked through annual health facility surveys
which show a significant improvement in waste management (e.g. proper disposal o f
health care waste in 2007 was identifiedin 84% o f health facilities versus 62% in 2004).
Activities to be financed under the additional grant do not trigger any additional
safeguard policies and no exceptions to Bank policies are required.

VI.EXPECTED OUTCOMES

21.     The activities under the additional grant are aimed at scaling up the project
impact. The additional financing sustains gains from previous years, but also aims to
expand the coverage and utilization o f services to population in remote and insecure
areas. Approximately six million people will have access to BPHS, thus reducing their
vulnerability to diseases and to the economic shocks linked to illnesses inthe household.
The project outcomes will not change although the development indicators will be
slightly modified to be consistent with the MOPH's recently approved Monitoring and
Evaluation Strategy. As has been the case previously, data on the indicators will be
collected through: (i) annual health facility assessments carried out by a third party to
review quality o f care indicators in BPHS; (ii)nationwide household surveys (the
National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment will be extensively analyzed); (iii) health
                                                                                  the
management information system; and (iv) a special study on maternal mortality (to be
conducted depending on the availability o f support from other donors). The additional
financing will also support an annual hospital assessment carried out by a third party to
reviewquality o f care indicators for the Essential Package o f Hospital Services.

VII. BENEFITS AND RISKS

22.     Benefits:The main benefits of the additional grant will be improved health for a
population o f nearly 6 million in various rural areas o f the country, including insecure
ones. The improved health services will likely reduce child and maternal mortality rates,
decrease fertility rates, and reduce health-induced financial shocks to poor families.
Better access to services is expected to have a particularly beneficial effect on women
who, as a result, may also have increased health and reproductive choices. The project
will also increase the number o f skilled health workers, particularly females, and
strengthen the managerial capacity o f the healthcare system.

23.     Security Risks: The security situation inAfghanistan remains precarious andthis
poses a risk to all development activities, particularly those that involve working in rural
areas and considerable movement (e.g. delivering drugs, conducting outreach activities,
and supervision). The effect of insecurity on the delivery of the BPHS is clear when one



                                             8

compares the progress in Helmand with Saripul. Inthe latter, the number o f out-patient
visits has increased dramatically (see Figure 1 in Annex 4). The additional grant will
specifically finance operations in Helmand, an area with a history o f insurgency and
attacks against public healthworkers. The risks o f an operation inHelmand are mitigated
by the presence o f a committed NGO like IbnSina, with a good track record indelivering
services in difficult locations. The involvement of community representatives and the
development o f a monitoring checklist for such community representatives will also help
mitigate this risk.

24.     Political Risks: There has been considerable political opposition to NGOs in
general, and this has also beenfelt inthe health sector. For a variety o f complex reasons,
there are strong feelings in some quarters that the Government should deliver the bulk o f
services. However, the MOPH has explicitly indicated its intent to contract with NGOs
for delivering the BPHS, at least for the next few years. The project will help mitigate
opposition to NGO provision o f services by ensuring that rigorous data i s collected so
that the debate can be evidence-based. Ifthe MOPH-SM performs well the approach can
be expanded to other areas. The MOPH and the Bank have also agreed that performance
bonuses will be provided to provincial health directors and their staff inprovinces where
the coverage and quality o f services has significantly improved. This will help align the
incentives o f the provincial MOPH staff with those o fthe NGOs.
