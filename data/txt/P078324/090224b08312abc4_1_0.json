By the time the\n            Taliban regime fell in 2001, Afghanistan had some of the\n            world\u2019s worst health indicators. Afghanistan needed to\n            improve its primary health care delivery to decrease its\n            child and maternal mortality rates, particularly in rural\n            areas. Without a viable primary care system, the country was\n            also vulnerable to emergent diseases such as HIV and AIDS\n            and avian influenza that threatened public health.\n            International Development Association (IDA) along with local\n            and international Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)\n            financed the Health Sector Emergency Reconstruction and\n            Development Project which provided the basic package of\n            health services to the rural people. It also supported the\n            community midwifery education program. In addition volunteer\n            community health workers were trained, new health centers\n            opened, and the quality of care improved. To meet emergent\n            public health risks, IDA also financed the Afghanistan HIV\n            and AIDS Preventive project. It also built national capacity\n            to inform the public at large about how to avoid HIV\n            infection, strengthened surveillance of HIV incidence,\n            mapped and estimated the size of groups engaged in high-risk\n            behavior, and supported information and advocacy campaigns\n            to reduce the social stigma associated with the disease. IDA\n            also financed the Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic\n            Preparedness and Response Project to keep bird flu from\n            spreading to humans by developing and implementing Highly\n            Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) prevention and eradication\n            activities. Millions of people in rural Afghanistan have\n            access to primary health care for the first time, as\n            national coverage rates rose from 9 percent of the general\n            population in 2003 to 85 percent in 2008."}, "docdt": "2009-09-03T02:50:01Z"}
