 Project (NEP) development objective is to improve the growth\n            of children under three in poor rural and urban areas. Phase\n            I, the first of three Phases of the NEP, is a preparatory\n            Phase that extends nutrition and growth promotion\n            interventions into rural areas. Also, Phase I aims to\n            consolidate and sustain the results gained with the earlier\n            project--Community Nutrition Project (rep. no. 14004)--which\n            contributed to reversing the negative trend in nutritional\n            status among children under three in the urban areas. The\n            project has three main components. The first consists of\n            five sub-components: 1) growth monitoring and promotion; 2)\n            nutrition and health group education; 3) integrated\n            management of childhood illnesses; 4) basic health services;\n            and 5) fighting the roots of malnutrition. The second\n            component, institutional and organizational capacity\n            building, is an overarching component that will be started\n            in Phase I of the NEP and continue throughout the three\n            Phases. This component has a monitoring and evaluation\n            aspect, which will include a strong emphasis on\n            \"learning by doing\" and the active participation\n            of all stakeholders in sharing information on strengths and\n            taking responsibility for improving weaknesses. The third\n            component comprises program management: The national\n            executive bureau (BEN) will be responsible for the daily\n            management of the NEP. It will ensure financial management,\n            the reporting and auditing systems, and procurement."}, "docdt": "2002-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
