Program Project in Senegal were as follows: outcomes were\n            highly satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included: 1) Learning by doing. The \"learning\n            by doing\" approach, together with the consultative\n            supervision style, encouraged stakeholders to learn skills\n            and develop capacities as the Project proceeded, and to come\n            up with innovative solutions to improve the Project itself;\n            2) Behavior change communication can bring about\n            improvements in nutritional conditions, without a reliance\n            on external food assistance. In addition, the Project has\n            demonstrated that dynamic community mobilization processes\n            can significantly enhance public service delivery systems;\n            3) The Project is in a unique position to make women's\n            voices heard by taking stock of issues affecting\n            children's growth, and bringing ongoing health-related\n            problems to the attention of community leaders; 4) Nutrition\n            has become visible at community, regional and national\n            level; 5) Local Government involvement increases a sense of\n            ownership and accountability among stakeholders; 6) A\n            well-designed monitoring and evaluation system, composed of\n            various data sources as well as supportive feedback, has\n            been critical to achieving this outcome; 7) The Project has\n            demonstrated that it is possible to built interest in the\n            fight against malnutrition by increasing awareness of the\n            magnitude of the problem as well as the scope for direct\n            intervention; 8) The Adaptable Program Lending instrument\n            with its ten-year timeframe, has contributed to the move\n            from a project-based to programmatic approach; and 9) The\n            Nutrition Enhancement Program has demonstrated that a supply\n            driven approach can generate awareness of critical problems\n            and thereby expand the scope for r development."}, "docdt": "2007-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
