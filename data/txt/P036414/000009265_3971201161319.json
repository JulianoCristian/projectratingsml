During\n            subproject construction, measures to prevent raised dust\n            include: encircling the construction site with braided\n            plastic fabrics; storing only earth needed to fill in the\n            site, sprinkling water during the dry season when earth is\n            stored, loaded and transported; closely covering vehicles\n            transporting construction materials like cement, lime, and\n            construction refuse; and removing the concrete mixer and\n            lathes far from inhabitants, institutions, or schools. To\n            prevent and reduce construction noise, workers will abide by\n            the city's rules and regulations; avoid using\n            noise-making machines at noon or during the night; adopt the\n            method of underground pipe-jacking and optimize machine use\n            time. Ecological damage to land and trees in the vicinity of\n            the construction can be alleviated by enclosing the sites,\n            and shortening the construction period. Greenbelts should be\n            planted along the open tunnels as soon as they are\n            completed. The flow of garbage can be checked by burying it\n            in enclosed places like mountain hollows. Dredging will be\n            used to counter the effects of heavy metals and other\n            pollutants in water bodies. Countermeasures to reduce\n            expected negative impacts during the dredging of water\n            bodies include: dredging only during the dry season to\n            reduce water contained in the sediment and shorten drying\n            time; transporting temporarily piled bottom clay to prevent\n            its being washed back into the river; building water\n            overflow tunnels when encircling banks of piled sediment;\n            spreading bactericides to prevent water quality\n            deterioration and the multiplication of flies and\n            mosquitoes; sprinkling a bleaching solution to destroy\n            noisome smells and kill noxious germs; protecting workers\n            with gas masks containing activated carbon fiber; and piling\n            and covering up sediment from solid wastes to prevent runoff\n            pollution and foul smells. During the operational phase,\n            sludge produced by the wastewater treatment plant will be\n            mitigated by clearing inorganic sand from the sedimentation\n            basin, and making mudcakes of the dehydrated sludge to be\n            used as fertilizer, if found to be safe, or in a sanitary\n            land fill, if proven harmful. Shock absorbers will be used\n            too alleviate the noise from the pumping station. To counter\n            wastewater pollution, rainwater amounts will be controlled;\n            wastewater interception, absorption, and clearing capacity\n            will be employed; and the flow of rainwater entering water\n            bodies will be controlled and increased to prevent\n            eutrophication or diverted into another water body."}, "docdt": "1997-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
