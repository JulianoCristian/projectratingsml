Project\n            helps improve the environment of Nanning and Guilin, in\n            support of sustainable economic growth and poverty\n            alleviation in the region. It improves water quality, and\n            institutional and financial capacity for environmental\n            protection, environmental services, and water resource\n            management. There are six components. The Sewerage and\n            Drainage component in Nanning cleans up the Chaoyang stream\n            and builds interceptors; builds and improves main and\n            secondary sewers and drains, associated pumping stations,\n            and a primary sewage treatment plant; improves equipment and\n            information systems; and enforces industry regulation. The\n            Sewerage and Solid Waste Management component in Guilin\n            builds primary and secondary sewers, builds pumping\n            stations, expands existing and builds primary sewage\n            treatment plants and oxidation pond, cleans up and\n            intercepts sewage from three lakes, builds a sanitary solid\n            waste landfill, and augments the fleet of solid waste\n            trucks. Component 3 builds or improves tertiary sewers,\n            drains, solid waste dumps, public toilets, and footpaths in\n            selected small areas. Component 4 lines and extends a canal\n            conveying water from a reservoir to the Lijiang, installing\n            a hydro-power generator, and building and repairing\n            embankment sections. Component 5 implments a pilot project\n            to fund sugar refinery pollution abatement. Component 6\n            supports institutional development, providing technical\n            assistance, training, and equipment."}, "docdt": "1998-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
