development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: when planning water transmission for city\n            uses through rural areas, engineers need to consider the\n            needs of local farmers and rural populations en route, to\n            provide some benefits to them also. The duplication of the\n            Lijiang water diversion canal, providing water for rural\n            populations and local farmers, was ultimately necessary\n            overcome their initial opposition. Water quality\n            improvements cannot succeed through collection and treatment\n            of domestic wastewater alone. Complementary industrial\n            pollution reduction programs are necessary to achieve water\n            quality objectives. Community participation in\n            infrastructure planning, implementation, and management is a\n            viable and socially acceptable alternative to redevelopment\n            even in rapidly growing cities. The small area improvement\n            (SAI) component demonstrated the feasibility of proactive\n            community participation, cost sharing, empowerment and\n            poverty alleviation. Introduction of new contracting\n            methods, such as turnkey contracting, should be done after\n            model bidding documents have been introduced, or after\n            standard documents have been thoroughly discussed and\n            understood during project preparation."}, "docdt": "2008-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
