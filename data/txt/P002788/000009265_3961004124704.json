to manage\n            the economy more effectively. Major areas of the program\n            include macroeconomic management, public sector management,\n            parastatal reform, private sector development,\n            rehabilitation of infrastructure, human resource\n            development, poverty alleviation, environmental management,\n            and a strategy for reducing Tanzania's heavy debt burden."}, "docdt": "1993-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
