Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory. Key\n            lessons learned include the following: A credible\n            privatization program requires a) a comprehensive\n            communications program designed to reach all stakeholdersand\n            to educate them on the policies, the program, and the use of\n            the proceeds, particularlyvery early in project\n            implementation and throughout project execution; b) a\n            retrenchment and public enterprise debt policy that is\n            carefully evaluated, planned, and implemented consistently;\n            and c) increased technical capacity by contracting out to\n            experienced consultants. The privatization strategy must be\n            defined upfront and include measurable targets, modalities,\n            and the roles of the various institutions and agencies\n            involved to ensure an efficient, transparent process.\n            Attracting sufficient high quality investors and operators\n            and ensuring effective competition in the privatization\n            process are possible only when a regulatory framework is in\n            place and clearly spells out fair treatment of investors,\n            reduces ability of the concerned parties to unilaterally\n            undo commitments, and protects consumers from misuse on\n            monopoly power. An effective civil service reform program\n            requires overt and widely held political sponsorship,\n            government commitment, sufficient capacity for change\n            management, strong monitoring and evaluation, clear\n            incentives, and sufficient funding for implementation."}, "docdt": "2001-05-28T00:00:00Z"}
