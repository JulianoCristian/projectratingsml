credit, extension services, social and economic\n            infrastructure, including feeder roads, housing, and health,\n            education and welfare facilities. The project will also\n            establish a Government-owned transport company to serve the\n            smallholders. Not included in the project but crucial to its\n            success, is the concurrent establishment of a nucleus estate\n            and factory to process both smallholders and estate\n            production. The nucleus estate/factory complex is being\n            financed by the Government and the Commonwealth Development\n            Corporation. The project also includes a technical\n            assistance component which provides funds for the employment\n            of key expatriate personnel (24 man-years in all) for the\n            smallholder project and for a consultant (2 man-years) to\n            establish training programs for DASF and PNGDB staff in\n            smallholder credit operations."}, "docdt": "1976-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
