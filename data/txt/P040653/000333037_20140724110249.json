          Development Project (PACR) for Mali were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: necessity for authorities to discuss and\n            decide early on Project hosting arrangements. Government\n            authorities need to be as proactive as possible on project\n            hosting arrangements so as to discuss and decide on this\n            critical aspect as soon as possible so that not only\n            possible delays in project preparation can be avoided or\n            significantly reduced but also ownership is fostered and\n            stronger commitment of authorities early on. It is important\n            to note that when a conflict situation does occur in any\n            country, central institutions can be severely weakened. In\n            this context, CDD approach and related projects are often\n            among the few interventions that may still function.\n            Experience has shown that CDD approach can play an important\n            role in the reconciliation process between communities\n            affected by the conflict. PACR approach and implementation\n            procedures of the local productive initiative fund (LPIF)\n            were critical to give more responsibility to the different\n            actors, those of government institutions, but particularly\n            at the community level. This allowed a better ownership of\n            local investments and an increase of awareness for\n            appropriate maintenance and sustainability."}, "docdt": "2014-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
