                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Before the suspension of the Bank intervention under OP 7.30, the project was making headway toward its PDO achievement. As of March 31, 2012, more than 383,000 people
                         benefited from the project (of which 43% percent are women) against 350,000 planned (of which 50% of women); 71% of the villages had adequate access to basic social services

                         against 80% set as target; and 55% of productive investments generated an average annual income per member above the daily poverty line, against a target of 60%. The
                         Disbursement rate under the original credit and the additional financing reached 82.5% and was expected to reach 90% in June 2012 and projected to reach 100% at project closing
                         date in June 2013.

                         However, following suspension of Bank's activities in Mali, the project implementation pace dramatically slowed to due to the suspension of disbursement. Except for few service
                         providers with a strong financial capabilities most of them suspended their activities. The regional unit in Timbuktu has been closed due to insecurity leading to suspension of project
                         activities and the redeployment of project staff. Two project vehicles were hijacked and have not been found yet. The pre-appraisal of the Additional Financing to PACR which was
                         being carried out was also suspended.

                         PACR implementation is gradually resuming following the re-engagement of Bank in Mali. A replenishment of the special account has been requested and a non-objection has been
                         provided so its expected that will start to be fully implemented. The work plan and the Procurement Plan has been updated taking into account the new context and sent to the Bank
                         which has provided its non-objection. Disbursement rate is currently about 84% with undisbursed amount of 9.5 million that the project team is committed to disburse by June 30,
                         2013 given the increasing populations' needs.

                         The Government has expressed his willingness to see the resumption of the preparation of the additional financing and intends to address a letter to the Bank to that end. The Bank's
                         response will depend on the improvement on the socio-political front. In the best case scenario the preparation of the additional financing could resume with the extension of the
                         current project for 3 more additional years until June 2016. In the worst case scenario, the project will close on June 30, 2013.
