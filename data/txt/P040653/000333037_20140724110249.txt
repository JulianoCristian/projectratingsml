1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      At the time of appraisal, Mali was growing at an annual rate of 2.4% with annual
real GDP growth rate accelerated to an average of 5% over the period 1994-2002, largely
driven by the private sector, which responded to a more liberalized regulatory
environment. Mali’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was completed in May
2002, endorsed by the Boards of the World Bank and IMF in March 2003 and supported
by the donor community. In 2002-2003, Mali made satisfactory progress towards
achieving PRSP objectives. The PRSP policy direction and quantitative objectives were
based on a vision of sustained growth and poverty reduction. The strategy laid out four
pillars: (i) creating a macroeconomic environment for accelerated and re-distributive
growth in a context of macroeconomic stability and openness, driven by the private
sector; (ii) promoting institutional development, governance and participation; (iii)
developing human resources and access to quality basic services; and (iv) building basic
infrastructure and developing productive economic activities.
2.      Mali adopted a basic legal framework for decentralization (Decentralization Law
of 1993) and put in place several institutional structures with the establishment of local
and regional authorities following local elections in 1999 to provide better, more
accountable services and increased local participation in the preparation and
implementation of development programs. The regulatory framework, further clarifying
the respective roles and mandates of the newly established local governments was well
developed. At the central government level, a special ministry was created in early 2000
(MATCL- Ministre de 1'Administration Territoriale et des Collectivités Locales) to
address the needs of the decentralized institutional levels more effectively. The devolved
administrative structure presented the Government of Mali (GoM) with significant
challenges from an institutional as well as personnel management point of view, at both
central and decentralized levels. With the decentralization process, 682 new communes
(groups of villages, mostly rural) were created. However, most of these new communes
lacked basic public infrastructure as well as technical/managerial capacity.
3.      A long-term Master Plan for Rural Development (Schéma Directeur du
Développement Rural) was developed in 1992 and updated in 2001. It included nine
priority action programs that have been integrated into the Poverty Reduction Strategy
(Cadre Stratégique de Lutte contre la Pauvreté - CSLP) and aimed to: (i) support to
agricultural services and producer organizations; (ii) development of rural infrastructure
and farming equipment; (iii) promotion and improvement of the competitiveness of
agricultural supply chains; (iv) stimulation of exports of agricultural, forestry, livestock
and fishery products; (v) intensification and diversification of agricultural production;
(vi) reinforcement of food security; (vii) promotion of financing of the rural sector and
rural credit; (viii) management of natural resources to sustain rural development; and (ix)
contribution to the finalization and execution of local development plans.
4.     Rationale for Bank Involvement. It was in this context that GoM requested the
Bank’s assistance to anchor innovative ideas to successfully tested development activities
in two preceding projects (NRM Project and the Grassroots Initiatives to Fight Hunger


                                             1
and Poverty Project - PAIB). The innovations included: (i) designing and honing the
interface between community development plans (at village-level) and communal
development plans (at the municipal level) for two types of sub-projects (a) with public
good characteristics at the communal level and (b) with private goods characteristics at
the local (CBO) level and (ii) addressing rural areas in their entirety and promoting
broad-based rural growth and service provision for both on- and off-farm activities by
addressing the lack of capacity of rural micro enterprises.
5.       The Bank specifically supported the Rural Community Development Project
(PACR) because: (i) GoM’s vision to combat poverty in the rural areas matched Bank’s
priorities; (ii) GoM had demonstrated a clear vision of coherent, complementary policies
and strategies and support decentralization; (iii) as lead donor of the Agricultural sector,
the Bank paid a crucial role in harmonizing development partners’ efforts; (iv) GoM
specifically requested continued Bank support to poverty alleviation in rural areas
through economic and social development, sustainable (agriculture and non-agriculture)
economic growth, employment and income generation, private sector development,
human capacity development and natural resources protection.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6.      The PDO aimed “to improve the living conditions of project-supported rural
communities in terms of (i) access to basic socio-economic services, and (ii) a sustainable
increase in incomes, while promoting improved natural resources management
practices”.
7.     The project was to achieve this objective through community empowerment,
capacity building (targeting rural communities, rural communes and suppliers of support
services to communities), and investments in social, socio-economic, environmental, and
economic sub-projects implemented by these communities.
8.     PACR was designed based on lessons learned 1 from several projects constituting
the Agriculture Bank Portfolio at the time: the PAIB, the National Rural Infrastructure
Project – PNIR; the Agriculture Service and Producer Organization Support Project –
PASAOP and the Agriculture Competitiveness and Diversification Project – PCDA.
9.           The following key PDO indicators were agreed:
      i.     By the end of the project, at least 75% of micro-projects implemented under the
             project for more than 3 years are still active;
    ii.      By the end of the project, at least 80% of beneficiaries perceive positive social or
             environmental impacts as a result of project intervention;
    iii.     By the end of the project, at least 80% of the stakeholders of the project perceive
             an improvement in their participation in the local and communal development
             process and activities;
    iv.      By the end of the project, 80% of targeted communities perceive significant
             improvement in access to basic services because of project interventions; and
     v.      By the end of the project, quantitative impact evaluation of project is positive.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
10.    No changes were made to the PDO: it was assessed during Mid-Term Review
(MTR) and during the Additional Financing (AF) preparation that PDO remained fully
relevant to rural community needs. However, PDO indicators were revised, for the
reasons indicated in Table 1 below.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.    The primary beneficiaries of the project were: (i) the rural populations living in
the 1,000 villages targeted under the project disseminated in the four targeted regions,
namely Mopti; Timbuktu; Segou; and Sikasso through their local community-based
organizations which received grants for any productive microprojects they deemed
important as long as they meet eligibility criteria; and (ii) rural communes which received
grants to co-finance social and socioeconomic infrastructure and natural resource
management and biodiversity conservation. Additional beneficiaries were private
advisory providers, regional and local public services and NGOs.




                                                             3
1.5 Original Components
12.      The project included four main components: Component A: Capacity Building;
Component B: Communal Initiatives Fund (CIF); Component C: Local Productive
Initiatives Fund (LPIF); and Component D: Project Management, Monitoring and
Evaluation, and Knowledge Management.
13.     Component A. Capacity Building (US$13.8 million) aimed at: (i) empowering
communities to help them increase their participation in the decentralization and 1ocal
communal development processes; and (ii) ensuring sustainability of investments by
strengthening communities’ capacities in programming, designing and properly
managing collective investments, as well as undertaking income generating and
productive activities. It included three sub-components: (i) Information and mobilization
of communities; (ii) Capacity building of grassroots communities and decentralization
stakeholders; (iii) Capacity strengthening of service providers for communities.
14.    Component B. Communal Initiatives Fund (CIF) (US$15.6 million) was to
provide financial and technical support services for investments with public-good
characteristics (social and environmental) within the Communal Development and
Investment Plans. It included two subcomponents: (i) Communal demand-driven
Investment Grants and (ii) Communal Technical Support Services.
15.    Component C. Local Productive Initiatives Fund (LPIF) (US$23.8 million)
was to provide financial and technical support services for local community-based
investments with private good characteristics. It included two sub-components: (i) Local
Productive Demand-driven Investment Grants and (ii) Local Technical Support Services.
16.      Component D. Project Implementation, Coordination, Monitoring &
Evaluation, and Knowledge Management (US$9.4 million) included: (i) at the national
level, support for project coordination and overall management, and (ii) at the regional
level, support for project execution. At the central level, a Project Implementation Unit
(PIU, referred later as BCG/PACR) was established under CSLP oversight, and
responsible for the execution of parts A and D of the project and for coordinating all
activities under the project, in particular for providing funds to the regional PIUs, overall
financial management and procurement, M&E, communication and knowledge
management, and a provision of studies and services as required. At the regional level,
the four Regional PIUs were responsible for the execution of Part C activities in the four
selected regions.

1.6 Revised Components
17.     Additional Financing approved on September 30, 2010 included another
component named Assistance to rural primary schools, health care associations and
community health centers aimed at providing social assistance to rural primary schools,
rural community health centers (CSCOM) and health care associations (“Mutuelles de
santé en milieu rural”). This new component (Component E) was created and
implemented by the BCG/PACR to help management committees of rural primary
schools and CSCOMs, as well as health care associations in the project area.




                                             4
1.7 Other significant changes
18.     Additional Financing (AF) approved on September 30, 2010. This AF was in
response to the effects of the global financial crisis in 2009/10. Significant changes were
implemented with the AF and led to: (i) increasing the Bank’s financial contribution to
existing project activities, with the exception of those under Component B (this
component received additional funding from previous unallocated resources); (ii) adding
a new component to provide social assistance to rural primary schools, rural community
health centers (CSCOM) and health care associations (“Mutuelles de santé en milieu
rural”); (iii) a reallocation of unallocated budget of the original Credit and among other
categories; (iv) a revision of the results framework; and (v) an extension of the closing
date from June 17, 2012 to June 17, 2013 so as to allow sufficient time to properly
deliver proposed additional activities and provide adequate support to rural community-
based organizations. As such, the AF complied with OP/BP13.20 as additional funds
were used within three years of the closing date of the original project. Some
modifications were agreed with respect to the results framework to ensure realism in the
targets, as well as consistency between the intermediate outcomes and the PDO outcomes
and their indicators, as well as to capture the additional outcomes and outputs that were
envisaged to be generated under the AF.
19.     Additional activities were aimed to support rural community-based organizations
affected by financial crisis and the lingering of the food and oil price crises. Since then,
international food prices dropped and weather conditions also improved. As a result, local
food prices dropped and available in higher quantities. The project was to help
community-based organizations restore and strengthen their capacities in managing and
delivering social and productive services.
20.     Refinement of the Results Framework. As part of the AF appraisal, it was
agreed with GoM, and in consultation with AFTRL, to reduce the number of indicators as
there were too many (12 in the legal agreement) and some of them not fully relevant,
focusing mainly on project activity, processing and outputs. The objective was to
simplify the results framework by keeping one or two indicators per component as per
current. Specific indicators were added to measure progress in implementing the
proposed AF and its impact on rural communities.
21.      AF budget allocations: Allocation of additional funds is shown in Table 2 below:
(i) Financial resources were channeled to community-based and producer organizations
through components E and C respectively; (ii) a large share of the AF was dedicated to
training (40%); and, (iii) 10% of the AF offered additional resources to field operators to
facilitate project implementation, along with additional resources for BCG/PACR
supervision and M&E.
22.     Based on MTR conclusions and recommendations, the Bank and the project team
took the opportunity of the AF appraisal to reallocate unallocated funds to mainly cover
overrun for certain categories of expenditures. The proposed budget reallocation aimed
also at strengthening training and advisory services to community-based and producer
organizations, especially for technical and management advice, along the lines as agreed
during the recent MTR of the original project.




                                             5
23.    Under Component D, some costs were underestimated at appraisal for the
coordinating activities at the national level supervising and investments at the regional
and local levels. Inflation and increasing fuel prices have also led to overrun of operating
costs. Additional staffs were recruited to strengthen the BCG/PACR, especially for
supervising a large number of small-scale investment projects. Along the same lines,
regional PIUs were strengthened with one assistant to the regional coordinator to ensure a
closer monitoring of field operators and a stronger dialogue with regional authorities,
decentralized public services and local governments. Some training and communication
costs were also supported by this component.

24.    Second Additional Financing. Under GOM’s request, in early 2012, a second
AF was under preparation. This AF, in a proposed amount of US$5 million (soon to be
increased to US$10 million), aimed at extending PACR activities in the north, covering
Kidal and Gao Regions. This second AF was to be prepared by the Bank under
emergency preparedness for emergency projects. However, due to the quick deterioration
of the security and war situation in northern Mali, and the Bank upholding its
engagement and operations under OP7.30; this AF had to be dropped while at appraisal
stage.
25.     Level 2 Restructuring. Due to crisis situation in northern Mali in early 2012, OP
7.30 was implemented and Bank activities in Mali were suspended for six months. About
a year later, a Level 2 Restructuring was prepared and processed end of May 2013, aimed
at extending PACR closing date from June 17, 2013 to December 31, 2013 so as to make
up for the implementation delays recorded following triggering of OP 7.30.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
26.    Soundness of Background analysis. The PAD adequately described the country
context and the fact that poverty reduction and growth in rural areas is severely
constrained by poor natural endowments (erratic rainfalls, fragile soils leading to short
seasonal agricultural activities), limited public infrastructure and social services (poor
water quality, poor sanitation, lack of roads and schools and inadequate health care,


                                                          6
limited and unevenly distributed rural infrastructure), weak programming and a lack of
access to financing for public and private investments. In this context, GoM requested the
Bank’s assistance to anchor innovative ideas to successfully tested development activities
in two preceding projects (NRM Project and the Grassroots Initiatives to Fight Hunger
and Poverty Project - PAIB) and the Bank responded positively because (i) GoM’s vision
to combat poverty in the rural areas matched Bank’s priorities; (ii) GoM had
demonstrated a clear vision of coherent, complementary policies and strategies and
support decentralization; (iii) as lead donor of the Agricultural sector, the Bank paid a
crucial role in harmonizing development partners’ efforts; (iv) GoM specifically
requested continued Bank support to poverty alleviation in rural areas through economic
and social development, sustainable (agriculture and non-agriculture) economic growth,
employment and income generation, private sector development, human capacity
development and natural resources protection.
27.     Assessment of Project Design. PACR design was sound with regards to Mali’s
overall context and CAS, showing that poverty remained mainly a rural phenomenon in
the country and project components clearly took this into account.
28.    Relevance of Strategy and Intervention. PACR objectives vis-à-vis the
approach and resources in place to reach them is considered relevant. The soundness of
the approach based on decentralized and participatory development of grassroots
communities, the implementation of project by communes in the context of
decentralization and monitoring - close support of beneficiaries of sub- projects by
Community Development Field Agents (Agent de Développement Communautaire -
ADC), private providers or agents contracted by GoM is established. Likewise, the
implementation agency (the Ministry of Social Development), while the coordination,
supervision and monitoring of PACR implementation was carried out by a national
committee and regional and local committees contributed much to PACR success and
expanded its positive effects and impacts as evidenced by performance indicators and
intermediate outcomes, which were all achieved.
29.     Alignment with CAS. Activities to be supported under PACR were fully aligned
with the CAS for 2004-2006, which specifically focused on poverty alleviation in rural
areas through social development, sustainable (agriculture and non-agriculture) economic
growth, employment and income generation, private sector development, human capacity
development and natural resources protection.
30.    Components. As indicated in section 1.5, Project components focused on the
main factors affecting poorest communities in rural areas with capacity building,
investments with public good characteristics and investments with private good
characteristics.
31.    Implementation Arrangements. Proposed arrangements were appropriate and
designed in line with decentralization framework defined in the 1993 decentralization
law, especially with regards to rural communes.
32.    Risks. Major risks were identified correctly during Project preparation. They
included PDO risks related to: (i) lack of political commitment to the implementation and
decentralization policy and for community development efforts; and (ii) inadequate
maintenance of public infrastructure. Risks related to results for Project components


                                            7
included: (i) lack of overall project implementation capacity; (ii) absence of coordination
with other programs and agencies; (iii) inefficient or inappropriate use of funds
transferred to beneficiaries; (iv) weak performance from public and private service
providers; (v) Inefficient and uneconomical use of funds for non-Project related purposes;
and (vi) difficulties in meeting fiduciary reporting requirements. The proposed measures
to mitigate these risks were generally appropriate and adequate.
33.     Project Preparation. Project preparation was well thought out, comprehensive
and responsive to the strategic context and led to effective implementation and
achievements of key outcomes. PACR preparation benefitted from updated national
policies, strategies (PRSP) and priorities as well as GoM‘s strong commitment to build
on previous project: The Grassroots Initiatives to Fight Hunger and Poverty Project
(PAIB), which brought an appropriate balance among investments and capacity building,
specific attention to participation, which were at the core of GoM’s decentralization
strategy, particularly in rural areas.
34.    The preparation of PACR started rapidly, while PAIB was still under
implementation. PACR largely capitalized PAIB experience poverty reduction and
sustainable development based on the realization of sub-projects initiated by grassroots
communities, in direct response to their requests. Satisfactory results from PAIB in the
Mopti region, particularly in terms of improving the living conditions of the most
disadvantaged rural communities to strengthen their capacity to participate in the project
and strengthening the partnership between grassroots actors (communities, NGOs,
technical services, private providers). Though not a second phase or an exact follow up,
PACR is a Community-Driven Development (CDD) Project and its design incorporated
lessons learned from PAIB, which only covered Mopti and possibly other regions
through pilot operations. However, PAIB pilot experience had demonstrated that the
responsibility for the execution of investment projects could be transferred to the
beneficiary communities and PACR fully took this major lesson into account. PACR
preparation involved a large number of stakeholders from different sectors and
organizations in the preparation process.
35.     The PCN review meeting was held as early as October 2002 with proposed Board
date in November 2003. However, it took almost three years to finalize the project design
and bring the project to the Board on September 15, 2005 due to: (i) a change of TTL in
early 2004 as well as (ii) the time needed for GoM to discuss and decide which Ministry
was to host the Project, which took almost a year.
36.    Appraisal, Negotiations and Project Launch. Appraisal was carried out in
February 2005 and Negotiations initially planned for April 2005 took place in June 2005.
The Project ratification process by the Malian parliament was lengthy and delayed
declaration of effectiveness and project launch, which took place respectively on March
24, 2006 and May 16, 2006.
37.    The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) did not assess Quality at Entry.

2.2 Implementation
38.     Component A: Capacity Building enabled 80% of communities that have
benefited from a socio-collective or productive investment through PACR to still have


                                            8
functioning management committees at Project closing. To achieve these results, the
project supported extensive capacity building program and no less than 251 private
service and training providers benefited from project support for capacity building for the
improvement of the quality of their services and the development of their activities. In
total, during the life of the Project, approximately 75,065 training sessions were held for
the benefit of 477,852 people (from an objective set for 350,000 direct beneficiaries),
among which 50.29% were women.
39.     Component B: Communal Initiatives Fund assisted communities in the design and
implementation of 501 socioeconomic investment micro-projects, with strong technical
and economic training sessions to communes and the CBO (from an objective set for 450
social, cultural and economic investments). The 501 socio-collective projects covered a
vast range of areas: investments in education are predominant with 43.82% followed by
those in health with 22.71%, hydraulic 16.93% and 15.54% for commercial facilities. As
regards attendance rate, 95% of social investments financed by the project have seen an
increase (from an objective of 90%).
40.     Component C: Local Productive Initiative Fund enabled 910 sub-projects to be
implemented through financing agreements signed with regional offices (from an
objective of 900). The CBOs were fully in charge of their micro-project management
with the power to hire and pay all service providers involved in their design and
implementation stages. In terms of coverage, the region that benefited the most is
Sikasso, with 32.63% of the sub-projects, followed by Mopti with 28.24% of the sub-
projects. Out of 910 sub-projects, infrastructure works and equipment purchase was
completed for 906 sub-projects, giving a completion rate of 99%. The rate of female
organizations that benefited from these sub-projects was 39%.
41.     Component D: Project Implementation, Coordination, Monitoring & Evaluation
and Knowledge Management supported the PIU (BCG/PACR) in managing and
implementing PACR as well as the four PIUs in the regions. The results set for this
component were all met with 14 multi-stakeholder workshops held (objective set at 14,
completion rate of 100%) and 12 activity reports produced and approved by both the
national steering committee and the Bank (objective set at 12, completion rate of 100%).
At central level, the coordination of activities was performed in a satisfactory manner by
the BCG/PACR, readily available to identify malfunctions and proposed measures to
correct weaknesses. At Regional level, the four regional PIUs generally played their roles
although they did not manage to consistently support field activities due to work
overload. However, they were able to establish good relations with administrative
authorities, technical services, apex organizations and especially with the Regional
Branches of ANICT and coordinators of ODC.
42.     Component E: Assistance to Rural Primary Schools, Health Care Associations
and Community Health Centers enabled 95% of the social associations that benefitted
from the project social assistance to function properly (from an objective of 90%). As
part of this component, micro-grants were signed on behalf of 541 members for a total of
XOF 1,014,552,187 for the management of schools, health centers and health mutual
funds and also in view to purchase equipment and personnel, maintain their infrastructure
and benefit from training.



                                            9
43.     Mid Term Review. The MTR, initially planned for early 2009, was conducted in
May-June 2010 so as to allow sufficient time for data collection. MTR Results showed
that project implementation was progressing satisfactorily towards PDO and key
monitoring indicator achievements. It also provided recommendations to improve
procurement procedures at the communal level and to strengthen the technical and
financial viability of productive investments carried out by rural producer organizations
so to ensure sustainability of the community-based initiatives and social and productive
investments.
44.     Additional Financing. Changes were required and implemented as part of the AF
approved on September 30, 2010; which was implemented in view of Mali’s situation
with the 2008 food price crisis and the 2009 economic and financial crisis as well as
some external shocks (insufficient rainfall and floods), lower remittances and tourism-
related incomes. At time of the AF, PACR implementation was moving at a very good
pace with disbursement already at 70% of the original credit and in view of the need for
GoM to allocate scarce resources to programs that were well targeted, cost-efficient and
promoted demand for health and education, PACR provided the adequate and one of the
few instruments readily available to address the various crises affecting poor populations
of Mali. Project was scaled up to provide direct assistance to rural communities and the
poorest groups of communities affected by the crisis. Changes related to the AF are
detailed in 1.7.
45.     Implementation difficulties. The main factors that impacted project
implementation were some procurement delays as well as Financial Management
difficulties that mainly affected Component B. An early audit showed that procurement
was not adequately performed at communal level: XOF 80 million were not disbursed
following procedures. The Bank requested reimbursement of these funds, which was
done by GoM. Thereafter, special procurement and financial management training was
organized by the Bank to help the project to adequately address fiduciary issues.
Technical audit was also carried to ensure that micro-projects were well designed and
adequately implemented. When problems surfaced, the implementation agency proceeded
with the recruitment of Engineers to closely supervise the micro-projects.
46.     Results Framework. Early during implementation, it appeared that there was an
issue with the Results Framework indicators: as early as October 2006 2 , following a
clinics organized by AFTKL, the Team was advised to switch one of the intermediate
outcome indicator to a PDO indicator in order to meet OPCS criteria on the availability
of outcome indicators and baseline data. This was further formally approved at time as
part of the AF appraisal. Following discussions, it was agreed with GoM, and in
consultation with AFTRL, to reduce the number of indicators as there were too many (12
in the legal agreement) and some of them not fully relevant, focusing mainly on project
activity, processing and outputs. The objective was to simplify the results framework by
keeping one or two indicators per component as per current. Specific indicators were
added to measure progress in implementing the proposed AF and its impact on rural
communities.

47.      Military coup d’Etat of March 22, 2012. The conflict in Northern Mali ensued to
a Military coup d’Etat and led to looting of equipment and vehicles and the closing of the
Regional PIU in Timbuktu; and the suspension of disbursement by the Bank for six
months resulting from OP 7.30 triggering. Crisis situation in Northern Mali from March
2012 onwards had an impact on implementation, which led to the suspension of PACR
activities in this region in view of security situation and closing of the Regional PIU. As a
result, implementation of 59 subprojects was stopped due to the displacement of
beneficiaries to the south or neighboring countries. After military intervention in January
2013, and general improvement in Timbuktu region, projects resumed and were
completed.
48.     Extension of Closing Date. The crisis situation from the war led to GoM
requesting an extension of the Project closing date. As a result, the original closing date
set to June 17, 2013 was extended until December 31, 2013 so as to make up for OP 7.30
suspension of disbursements and allow sufficient time to wrap up activities in view of
Project closing.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
49.     For effective M&E activities of its interventions and components, PACR had
adopted an M&E system at two levels: (i) the monitoring of the implementation carried
out by the various units involved in PACR; and (ii) the monitoring of the impact
conducted by consultants at mid-term and at final evaluation. Overall, the M&E system
performed adequately throughout project implementation. It remained fully operational
with a computerized database as well as data at the central level at BCG/PACR and at
regional level of each regional PIU. Information feedback from the field to the central
level took place electronically. The M&E system was even able to provide an initial
analysis of information and data available in the form of tables and charts, as well as
types of socio-collective and productive projects or geographical analyzes.
50.     Initially, the results framework approved in the PAD included a long list of
indicators at PDO level and outcome level. Quickly, there was a need to refine them 3 and
one outcome indicator was upgraded to a PDO indicator so as to meet criteria on the
availability of outcome indicators and baseline data. Preliminary baseline data from
village sample surveys also reinforced the need to reduce and update indicators as it
rapidly became clear that some proved difficult to measure or were no longer relevant. In
view of this, performance indicators had not only to be reformulated to have real impact
indicators but also to ensure consistency between the project document and the credit
agreement.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
51.    Safeguards. Compliance with environmental safeguard is rated Satisfactory by the
ICR. Two safeguard policies were triggered at appraisal: (i) environmental assessment
(OP 4.01) and (ii) pest management (OP 4.09). Compliance of the Environmental and

3
  The refinement of indicators (simplification and reformulation) initiated during MTR was deepened so as to allow a final review of
the results framework. The appraisal mission of the AF for PACR allowed an official validation of indicators in the credit agreement.
The AF approved on September 30, 2010 did streamline indicators (through dropping/rephrasing/upgrading) so as to keep 4 of them at
PDO level and 9 outcome indicators (2 for components A, B, C and D, and one for component E).



                                                                11
Social Management Framework appeared satisfactory. Good environmental practices at
the level of sanitation, waste management (solid and liquid) management of natural
resources and safety have been implemented and widely adopted by beneficiaries with
support of the different training provided by PACR. The MTR confirmed that elaboration
of community-based investments included a proper analysis and anticipations of their
potential adverse impacts on the environment. Relevant preventive measures were
provided to beneficiaries and included in the technical design and budget of micro-
projects. Additional training programs were recommended along with a closer
supervision of investment implementation by regional directorates in charge of
environment protection and found effective as final data collected demonstrated a
satisfactory implementation of Environmental Management Framework Plan level. No
social safeguard policy was triggered through the implementation of the project.
52.     Procurement. Procurement for the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory by the
ICR as it was most of the time during implementation. Non-compliance with Bidding
Code (Code des Marchés Publics) and IDA procedures by ANICT for component B led
to poor micro-project quality and sustainability issues of physical investments early on in
project implementation. However, corrective measures were introduced after an
implementation mission raised this issue through (i) comprehensive procurement review,
(ii) adoption of a manual of procedures for CIF (iii) suspension of additional ANICT’s
Special Drawing Right until implementation of (i) and (ii) for concerned communes (iv)
strengthen training programs for communes on procurement aspects (not only procedures
but also transparency, consultation of technical services, etc.).
53.    Financial Management. Financial Management is rated Satisfactory by the ICR
despite difficulties encountered particularly with ANICT in charge of management of
component B. The FM system took a long time to be established at ANICT for
accountability and IFR preparation and was only put in place in 2008. Further, at the
beginning, IFR timely submission proved difficult and delays were experienced (for
component A and C) or very late submission (for component B). In 2008, a technical
audit of ANICT was conducted and found ineligible expenditures of about XOF 70
million. Accountability was also dealt with in 2009 when Regional PIUs started using
adequate FM software (TOMPRO) to produce and feed financial data to BCG/PACR.
Despite issues raised, FM largely improved over time and was rated satisfactory in ISR
by mid-July 2010 after ineligible expenditures made by ANICT had been reimbursed and
the overall financial management of the project improved. Audit reports were delivered
on time and were not qualified.
54.     It is worth to note that project stakeholders and elected officials did benefit from
trainings in procurement and financial management which greatly helped them not only
to get a better understanding of these critical aspects but also to help PACR operate more
smoothly as well as improve governance.
55.     Project disbursement. Disbursement is rated Satisfactory by the ICR. Delays in
disbursement were occasioned due to contract delays and the suspension of disbursement
after the military coup d’Etat and triggering of OP 7.30. Disbursements accelerated
thereafter and reached 84% in September 2012. By closing date (December 31, 2013), the
project had disbursed 100% of the original credit IDA 41130 of US$60 million and
99.8% of the AF credit IDA 48230 of US$11.2 million.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
56.    The post project phase builds upon the recently-approved Reconstruction and
Economic Recovery Project (P144442), which was largely designed based on the PACR
approach as it includes activities aimed at: (i) supporting productive investments to
mitigate the impacts of the crisis on communities in northern Mali; (ii) strengthening
communities and communes’ capacities to plan, prioritize and implement local
development activities; and (iii) promoting local governance.
57.      The institutional challenges of the decentralization reforms and the necessarily
gradualist approach to capitalize on project implementation experience has lead GoM to:
(i) support the structuring, organization and implementation of local and regional services
resources for community support to productive and socio-collective investments; (ii)
continue strengthening the operational capacities of technical services for the monitoring,
supervision and advisor of community subprojects; (iii) consider synergies with current
programs and projects (PAPAM, accelerated Northern Development, etc.) to support the
needs of consolidation and sustainability of sub-projects supported by PACR; (iv) extend
the project interventions to other communities and communes; (v) put in place a post
project follow-up work to encourage and support beneficiaries in maintenance of their
equipment. GoM has been informed that sustainability of PACR and similar community-
based project will hinge, above all, on an enabling institutional and regulatory framework
and accountable community organizations. This aspect, according to Malian authorities,
is at the top of their agenda in the process of deepening the decentralization process.
58.     Other current Bank operations that have worked closely with PACR and play a
role in ensuring sustainability include: (i) the Agricultural Competitiveness and
Diversification Project (PCDA), (ii) the Agricultural Productivity Support Project
(PAPAM), and (iii) the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program / Mali Project
(WAAPP). In addition, the Technical Assistance Support to Rural Financial Institutions
Project will also strengthen their capacity to facilitate their interventions and resolution of
the crucial problem of rural finance. Projects executed by other technical and financial
partners could also contribute to the sustainability of PACR actions. In this perspective,
the government should play a key role in coordinating actions to ensure a convergence of
actions.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
59.     The Project objectives, design and implementation were entirely consistent with
GoM’s decentralization strategy and still remain relevant today. Poverty in rural areas
remains high despite the fact that the country has seen a decrease in its poverty rate from
55.6% to 43.6% between 2001 and 2010 4; the number of people considered poor has
risen from 6.1 to 6.6 million people over the same period. The poor still rely heavily on
agriculture for their income.

    World Bank (2012), Republic of Mali: Poverty and Gender Notes, December, Washington D.C.



                                                              13
60.      The project through its design effectively assisted GoM in setting up its
decentralized rural development mechanism at all levels (village, provincial and national
levels). Decentralization remains at the heart of Mali Economic and Social Development
Strategy, which was reaffirmed during the recent 3-day seminar on Decentralization held
in Bamako in October 2013, following the election of the new head of State. This
initiative was strongly supported by all Development Partners, especially as the country
is slowly recovering from crisis. In this perspective, PACR approach was of paramount
importance. The recently approved Reconstruction and Economic Recovery Project, with
focus on the development –security nexus in Northern Mali, was largely designed based
on the PACR approach, thereby supporting the notion that PACR’s design was highly
relevant.
61.      Component A objectives were directly supporting pillar 2 of PRSP aimed at
institutional development, while Component B and C objectives supported pillar 3 and 4
of PRSP directed respectively at (i) developing human resources and access to quality
basic services; and (ii) building basic infrastructure and developing productive economic
activities. Component E introduced as part of the AF also supported Pillar 3 of Mali
PRSP.
62.     Based on the above, the Relevance of Objectives and Relevance of Design are
both rated “High” by the ICR Team.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
63.    Overall, the PACR was successful in achieving its Development Objective, as
measured by indicators set for the Project. These achievements are significant
considering the difficult context experienced by the Project in 2012 and 2013 with the
war.
64.     The first part of the development objective (“to improve the living conditions of
project-supported rural communities in terms of access to basic socio-economic
services”) was measured through two PDO indicators – the number of direct project
beneficiaries (including women) and the percentage of villages supported by the project
have adequate access to basic social services (Clinics within 15 km, School within 5 km
and 1 water access for 400 people).
65.    The second part of the development objective (“to improve the living conditions
of project-supported rural communities in terms of a sustainable increase in incomes,
while promoting improved natural resources management practices”) was measured
through two PDO indicators – the percentage of productive projects having generated
average annual income per member superior to the daily poverty line and the percentage
of community-based organizations having implemented improved NRM practices.
66.     The PDO was not changed during Project lifetime. The PDO has been achieved
based on PDO indicators results as well as the ones for the intermediate outcome
indicators. DO rating in final Project ISR was satisfactory, in line with assessment. There
were four key performance outcome indicators for the achievement of the PDO following
adjustments made by the AF of September 2010. All four PDO indicators were fully
achieved and outpaced their targets.



                                            14
• Indicator 1: Number of direct project beneficiaries (including women). This
  indicator is fully achieved and largely above its target. In total, 477,852 beneficiaries,
  among which 50.29% were women; directly benefited from project assistance
  (against 350,000 targeted). Beneficiaries received a wide range of capacity building
  programs, which helped them design and implement socio-collective investments and
  productive investments effectively.
• Indicator 2: At the end of the project, at least 60% of the productive projects have
  generated average annual income per member superior to the daily poverty line 5.
  This indicator is fully achieved and above target. In total, 63% of productive projects
  have generated average annual income per member superior to the daily poverty line
  (target was set at 60%) thanks to the large array of support provided under PACR.
• Indicator 3: By end of the project, 80% of villages supported by the project have
  adequate access to basic social services (Clinic within 15km, School within 5km
  and 1 water access for 400 people). This indicator is fully achieved and largely above
  target. In total, 87% of villages supported by PACR have adequate access to basic
  social services, i.e. clinic within 15km, school within 5km and 1 water access point
  for 400 people. The target set for this indicator was 80%.
• Indicator 4: By the end of the project, at least 50% of community-based
  organizations have implemented improved natural resources management
  practices. This indicator is fully achieved and very significantly above target. In total,
  70% of community-based organizations have implemented improved natural
  resources management practices (target set for this indicator was 50%) thanks to the
  wide range of capacity building programs put in place under PACR.
67.     The Project’s Efficacy rating is considered Substantial by the ICR Team. This
rating is based on Projects results summarized in Section F of the Data Sheet looking at
PDO indicators from Appraisal (some of which were dropped in September 2010 at time
of AF) and the revised ones following the AF. As mentioned earlier, the following
indicators were dropped for the reasons indicated:
        (i) By the end of the project, at least 80% of beneficiaries perceive positive social or
             environmental impacts as a result of project intervention Perception indicators
             not sufficiently relevant to properly assess project impact; need to reduce the
             number of indicators
        (ii) By the end of the project, at least 80% of the stakeholders of the project perceive
             an improvement in their participation in the local and communal development
             process and activities Perception indicators not sufficiently relevant to properly
             assess project impact; need to reduce the number of indicators
        (iii)By the end of the project, quantitative impact evaluation of project is positive
             Vague and difficult to measure.
68.     The assessment of achievement of dropped PDO indicators is provided in the
table below.

                                                      employees and health centers, particularly in the
                                                      regions of Sikasso, Mopti and Segou. The majority of
                                                      the population (between 61% and 55%) that received
                                                      water access points provided by PACR is satisfied.

69.    In September 2010 6 and before processing of the AF which notably lead to the
above PDO indicators to be dropped, progress towards PDO and Project implementation
were both rated satisfactory and the original credit IDA 41130 of SDR40.4Million and
reached a disbursement rate of 70% or SDR 28.24 Million disbursed. At time of Project
closing, the project had disbursed 100% for IDA 41130 and 99.8% of IDA 48230 of
US$11.2 million. Table 4 below provides split rating of the Project comparing original
PDO indicators and revised PDO indicators versus ratings and disbursements. Results
show that the overall rating achieved by the Project is considered Satisfactory.

70.      The assessment for each intermediate outcome indicator is presented below (see
details in Annex 2).
71.     Intermediate Outcome indicator #1: “By the end of the project, at least 75% of
the communities that have benefited from a socio-collective or productive investment
under the project still have functioning management committees”. This first indicator
related to Component A and was fully achieved, and exceeded the target. In total, 80%
communities benefited from socio-collective or productive investments under the project
with functioning management communities, thus surpassing the set target of 75%.
72.     Intermediate Outcome indicator #2: “By the end of the project at least 200
private service and training providers have benefited from project support for capacity
building for the improvement of the quality of their services and the development of
their activities”. This second indicator was also linked to Component A and was fully
met: 251 private service and training providers did receive support from the project in
capacity building aimed at improving the quality of their services and development of
their activities. It exceeded the target, which was set at 200.
73.    Intermediate Outcome indicator #3: “At least 450 social, cultural and economic
investments have been implemented, together with corresponding training and
technical and economic support”. This third indicator related to Component B and was
largely achieved: 502 social, cultural and economic investments were actually

It exceeded the targeted indicator, set at 450.
74.     Intermediate Outcome indicator #4: “90% of social investments financed by the
project have increasing attendance rate”. This fourth indicator was introduced as part of
the AF approved in September 2010 and linked to Component B. The indicator has been
fully met, reaching 502 social, cultural and economic microprojects implemented,
together with corresponding training and technical and economic support; and exceeding
the target for this indicator, set at 450.
75.     Intermediate Outcome indicator #5: “By the end of the project: at least 900
productive investments have been implemented, together with the corresponding
technical support, assistance contract or training”. This fifth indicator related to
Component C and has also been reached: 906 productive investments have been
implemented, together with the corresponding technical support, assistance contract or
training; over the target for this indicator, set at 900.
76.     Intermediate Outcome indicator #6: “By the end of the project, 75% of the
socioprofessional groups that have benefited from a productive investment under the
project are still properly functioning and making profits”. This sixth indicator related to
Component C and was also fully achieved: 80% of socioprofessional groups that
benefited from a productive microproject are still properly functioning and making
profits; which exceeded the target for this indicator of 75%.
77.     Intermediate Outcome indicator #7: “Throughout the execution and at the end
of each year, the project holds a multi-stakeholder workshop for assessing annual
results and planning next year investments and activities”. This seventh indicator
related to Component D and was also fully met: 14 multi-stakeholder workshops for
assessing annual results and planning next year investments and activities were organized
throughout project life; in line with the target set at 14 for this indicator. It is reasonable
to assume that in view of the results obtained under the project, regular meetings held
were instrumental to achieve them, get adherence of key stakeholders to the project as
well as its ownership.
78.    Intermediate Outcome indicator #8: “Throughout the execution, all activity
reports have been validated by the national steering committee and the Bank”. This
eighth indicator also related to Component D and was achieved: 12 reports were
produced and validated by the Project national steering committee and the Bank; in line
with the target set at 12 for this indicator.
79.     Intermediate Outcome indicator #9: “By the end of the project, 90% of the
social associations that have benefitted from the project social assistance are
functioning properly”. This ninth and last indicator was introduced as part of the AF
approved in September 2010 and was linked to Component E, introduced during the AF
preparation. The sole indicator of Component E was largely met: 95% of social
associations that benefited from the project social assistance were functioning properly at
project closing against a target of 90%.

3.3 Efficiency
80.     Due to the demand-driven nature of the project, PACR did not include a very
detailed economic and financial analysis. Scenarios used the With Project (WP) and
Without Project (WOP) situation for 7 possible productive investments. In 2013, the
BCG/PACR commissioned an independent impact study. It was designed as a beneficiary
assessment regarding project approach and inputs, and perception by beneficiaries of
improvement in their livelihood.
81.     Conclusions of this study were extremely positive: PACR supports recorded high
rates of satisfaction: (i) on schools, more than 98% of surveyed parents of pupils were
satisfied; (ii) on health services, more than 89% of surveyed people were satisfied; (iii)
on water access points, more than 57% of surveyed people were satisfied.
82.     The study also showed that out the 109 micro-projects that were sampled and
surveyed, close to 9,300 jobs were created; half of it among women. By extrapolation to
all the financed micro-projects, it can be inferred that PACR contributed to the creation
of more than 77,000 jobs. Further impact was revealed both through knowledge of
communities, and in terms of reinforced infrastructure and skills of CBOs. As such, the
project may be considered as being efficient in supporting the PDO.
83.      As regards component C where efficiency can be assessed (unlike other
components were they are too difficult to measure in monetary or non-monetary terms as
stated in the PAD), actual expenditures spent on productive investments are lower than
estimated costs by about 10%. Based on actual figures, the project overall economic rate
of return (ERR) is estimated at 28.4% over a 15 year period using a sample of 27 micro-
projects covering five areas (village garden, dry crop, livestock, processing & trade and
crafts), above the overall project ERR computed at appraisal, i.e. 13%. If adding two
productive investments in bee keeping and aquaculture, the overall ERR found is 36.7%
(over a 15 year period) also above the overall ERR calculated at appraisal, i.e. 13%.
84.     Sensitivity analysis: For the 27 micro-projects covering five areas (village garden,
dry crop, livestock, processing & trade and crafts), an increase in costs of 10% would
reduce the overall ERR to 27.7%. A 10% cost increase coupled with a 5% decrease of
benefits would reduce the overall ERR to 27.2%. When looking at productive
investments in seven areas (the ones above plus bee keeping and aquaculture), an
increase in costs of 10% would reduce the overall ERR to 33.5%. A 10% cost increase
coupled with a 5% decrease of benefits would reduce the overall ERR to 32.1%.
85.     Past experience from PAIB and PACR shows that communities generally choose
investments with high rates of return that are sustainable. Through a decentralized
decision-making process, it has been proven that the investment costs are low compared
to similar micro-projects realized by different partners or government institutions.
Economic and financial analysis undertaken for the diverse types of investments,
although showing different rates of return, clearly demonstrate cost efficiency and high
responsiveness of service delivery, which are essential for poor communities. Under the
project’s community-based approach, the savings in infrastructure costs were significant.
This conclusion was echoed by local officials and community members. The quality of
infrastructure was also perceived as good. Some local officials and community members
estimated that the completed works were likely to have a longer lifespan than equivalent


                                            19
government-built works. Several of the project’s features contributed to these positive
findings on efficiency. Community-led investments to develop infrastructure and build
skills achieved cost efficiencies through cost savings. Community selection meant greater
ownership of works prioritized and supervised by communities themselves. Overall, strict
adherence to rules, accountability, and community decision making and inclusion
reduced delays and waste of money.
86.     In summary, efficiency is rated Substantial by the ICR Team: the project achieved
substantive outcomes and impacts while costs involved in achieving the objective of
PACR were reasonable in comparison with benefits, also taking into account that all its
objectives were fully met.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory.

87.     The overall outcome rating is satisfactory considering that relevance of
objectives, design and implementation was high and efficacy and efficiency both
substantial. The CDD approach remains highly relevant in the Mali context. The need to
provide adequate support to poor communities through strong capacity building, and
community-driven investments remains entirely consistent to Mali’s commitment to
decentralization and community empowerment. The PDO of PACR has been met and
included four PDO indicators which were fully met at closing and some of them were
outpaced. Despite successes, numerous constraints to community development still exist;
showing how critical the CDD approach remains to Mali.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
88.     Poverty Impacts. PACR significantly contributed to poverty reduction activities of
the Social and Safety Development Program (PRODESS) of Mali and of PRSP as
evidenced by the one of the key indicators of the project development objective. In fact,
by the end of the project 63% of productive investment had generated annual income per
member superior to the poverty line of XOF 172,000 in 2011 (i.e. US$ 360). Moreover,
the community-based organizations had benefited from capacity building, socio-, rural
primary schools, health care associations and community health centers reinforcement.
The PACR approach was based on a participatory approach at all levels, which was most
successful. Targeting of the poorest groups through the participatory process at the
community level also ensured appropriate representation of priorities of the poor in the
selection of activities to be funded and was key to the success of the project. PACR
interventions took place in rural areas where poverty is most prevalent, which implied
that activities benefited mostly the poor. The impact survey confirmed that beneficiaries
of productive investments have experienced a significant increase in their revenues above
poverty line. Finally, through the AF approved on September 30, 2010; PACR supported
the newly developed strategy of the line Ministry for the extension coverage of health
mutual funds via a 50% of membership fees of its members in the regions which will
contribute to alleviate poverty in the rural areas.


                                           20
89.      Gender Impacts. According to the beneficiary survey conducted, beneficiaries of
project activities perceived significant changes in gender-related issues. The situation of
women has considerably improved due to water and health infrastructures built, as well
as associated sensitization programs in hygiene and family planning. In addition, the
support for revenue generating activities have given women beneficiaries more
opportunities to some financial autonomy. At the same time, the implementation of the
program has opened the way for women to integrate village associations as equal partners
like men and so to share the decision-making process at the community level. Project
activities have also had positive effects on inter-communities and intergenerational
relationships. These consist of peaceful conflict management between social groups with
different interests and the promotion of youth involvement in decision making process,
both contributing to more social equity and inclusion. The project has contributed
significantly to the empowerment of women by (i) reducing the burden of chores with
access to facilities, equipment, food processing in particular, and (ii) significantly
increasing their employment, income and thus their participation in family expenses. In
fact, a large proportion of productive projects funded under PACR (about 40%) benefited
to women whose OSP constituted the vast majority (over 80%) of those who have
succeeded in some areas. Finally, through PACR, women did benefit of better access to
health related services through health centers.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
90.     Implementing agencies. PACR has built capacity of service providers to improve
or strengthen their own capacity. Overall, 126 ADC/ODC, 64 public service officers and
255 private providers have received technical training, exchange visits and advisory
services in poultry and artificial insemination, marketing and production techniques, food
hygiene and quality control of food, pest and pesticide management, costing and financial
analysis of productive investment projects, specific infrastructure management, contract
management, rural entrepreneurship and crafts. The results of the impact study indicated
an improvement in their performance, particularly in the areas of social mobilization,
advisory support and technical training for grassroots actors. Private and public providers
have particularly appreciated the impact of training on their performance in the areas of
poultry, artificial insemination techniques for agricultural production, costing and
financial analysis in productive projects, contract management and rural entrepreneurship
and crafts. Skills and capabilities of PACR staff were strengthened in the areas of
decentralized participatory development; procurement and utilization of various software
in management, M&E, etc. These trainings have helped to significantly improve the
performance of PACR staff.
91.    At the line Ministry. The capacity of local services of the Ministry of Social
Development were strengthened through training and / or workshops in the fields of
entrepreneurship and food hygiene, management and marketing, process of setting up
mutual health funds etc. Overall, PACR has contributed significantly to the
implementation of the fight against poverty Social and Health Development Program via
the provision of socio- component community infrastructure in communes and
communities, funding of productive investment projects that generate income, extension
of mutual health funds and technical, financial and material support to the management
bodies of these infrastructures.


                                            21
92.     On top of capacity building activities, in every major city of communes, ADC did
organize a workshop aimed at updating the Social, Economic and Cultural Development
Plan (PDSEC) with the participation of villages’ representatives, and “deconcentrated”
local technical services, CSOs and the private sector.
93.    Community level. PACR interventions have introduced significant changes for
the major players in grassroots development through improving: (i) access to basic social
services and the management capacity of community-based organizations and the local
Governments; (ii) income levels of rural producers and especially women producers who
became more independent; and (iii) the performance of public and private service
providers and NGOs involved in their advisory support and technical training of
grassroots communities.
94.     More specifically, PACR has helped to improve the conditions of access to basic
social services of village communities in its areas of intervention. Figures have increased
significantly in almost all project-supported schools, gross enrollment rates have
improved significantly (on average, 81.3% in schools supported by PACR against 62-79
% on average in regions covered by the project). Also, the number of medical
consultations has increased in community health centers, particularly antenatal medical
consultations (around 100% for centers supported by PACR vs. 71% in Mopti and 77%
in Segou) and assisted deliveries (around 97.5% of women gave birth at centers
supported by PACR and the remaining 2.5% gave birth with the assistance of an health
agent; vs. lowest rate of 33% in Timbuktu and the highest one of 63% in Sikasso)
significantly higher for centers supported by PACR compared to regional averages.
Finally, the coverage of drinking water needs of the people who benefited from the
support of the project in hydraulics is 60% against 40% who buy from traditional water
access points.
95.    For populations that benefited from productive investments, at least two thirds of
the projects socio-professional organizations have diversified their funding sources by
accessing to other credit windows. Moreover, these organizations have created more than
77,000 jobs, including 38,400 jobs for women.
96.     The project contributed to the introduction of major technical and technological
innovations in dairy farming, poultry farming, fattening, regeneration of bourgoutières,
fish packing, food processing products, organic manure production and carpentry. The
adoption of these techniques and technologies has led to a steady increase in revenues in
productive investments, especially for projects in livestock and agriculture. The lowest
increase in revenues was recorded for productive investments in processing and crafts.
The revenues from productive investments are mostly used to feed the family, buy inputs
and equipment and support the education of children. PACR has favored large
diversification of production activities especially in the areas of livestock and agriculture
and intensification of agricultural production with the doubling of yields of certain crops,
including rice and sesame.
97.     Governance. PACR has provided a significant channel for the poor to access
goods and for communities to exercise voice. PACR may enable the alignment of some
local development funds and transfers from central government institutions with priorities
set by communities, an improvement from previous conditions where the use of these


                                             22
funds was based largely on political discretion. Moreover, the use of social accountability
tools like participatory planning, budgeting, monitoring and project implementation
would help develop relevant skills in local governments, citizens and civil society. This
may encourage community volunteers to engage their elected local leaders. However, it
seems challenging that these innovations and reforms will be sustained or expand beyond
the PACR. PACR has given the communities their first taste of engaging local
government in exercising voice in the choice, implementation and monitoring of sub-
projects. But because of the absence of institutionalized processes for negotiation and
voice in budgeting and planning, this experience may remain in a project bubble.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

See Annexes.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
98.     Risks to development outcome and sustainability of project achievements are
assessed against institutional, economic/financial, environmental and social criteria and
takes into account the exceptional circumstances experienced by PACR in 2012 with the
military coup d’Etat. Overall, risk to development outcome is moderate considering the
following factor, including: (i) the 2012 war and its consequences on PACR; (ii) the high
ownership of project at all institutional levels (by GoM and beneficiaries through their
organizations), (iii) the moderate financial risks linked to sustainability of the different
investments, (iv) the relatively minor negative environmental impacts associated with the
kinds of micro-projects implemented and (v) the high social significance of project
activities (targeting poverty issues, inclusion of vulnerable groups, and balanced gender
equity).
99.     The unforeseen and unavoidable risk of the 2012 military coup d’Etat and
consequences on PACR activities was substantial. With the coup of March 2012 and the
security that quickly deteriorated in northern Mali, PACR activities were affected,
particularly in Timbuktu region: the regional PIU could not continue to provide support
to CBOs in the implementation of micro-projects because the regional PIU had to be
closed. Beneficiaries and project resources losses were estimated at around XOF 400
million. At the same time, these effects were mainly confined to the Timbuktu region,
while other regions covered by the project mainly suffered some delays in project
implementation due to the crisis.
100. The institutional risk to development outcome is low. The project was able to push
for institutional capacity building at governmental level to support the national program
for decentralized rural development. At the commune level, the strengthening of the
ADCs leading to the enhancement of provincial and local coordination among different
partners is another positive impact minimizing institutional risk to the development



                                            23
outcome. The new Reconstruction and Economic Recovery Project (P144442) includes
one component aimed at supporting productive investments to redress the impacts of the
crisis on communities and households in the north as well as one component aimed at
strengthening the engagement of communities and communes in the planning,
prioritization and oversight of local development activities, and to put in place elements
of local governance. Further, the Technical Assistance Support to Financial Institutions
Project in rural areas will strengthen capacities to ease interventions and the critical issue
of access to financing in rural areas.
101. The economic and financial risk to development outcome is moderate. At
appraisal, the major risk that could affect the project was inadequate maintenance of
public infrastructures. This risk did not materialize as beneficiaries from infrastructure
investments reflect their true priorities and did financially contribute to benefit from it.
They do make an income sufficient enough to pay for O&M costs and appropriate
management structures are in place, sufficiently skilled and able to set up and collect
fees. It is clear that all of this was made possible with GoM maintaining its commitment
for effective promotion of the decentralization process in line with decentralization laws
in place.
102. The environmental risk to development outcome is low. According to the
environmental and social assessment, the project was rated as a category ‘B’ project.
Although two safeguard policies were triggered (the environmental assessment [OP 4.01]
and pest management [OP 4.09]), project activities and selected types of sub-projects
have only negligible environmental impacts.
103. The social risk to development outcome is low. PACR has played a major role in
creating social capital in the concerned villages and has been instrumental to
mainstreaming gender and social equity in the local development agenda. However,
traditional social structures continue to hamper these positive developments, and
women’s participation in the decision-making process still has room for improvement.
The project’s contribution to revitalizing various community level organizations and
enabling full participation of all social groups in planning, implementation and control
processes have created a positive dynamic for good governance and social accountability
mechanisms in managing socio-collective and productive investments.
Based on these assessments, the overall risk to development outcome is rated as moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory

104. Although building on the experience and achievements of the successful PAIB,
preparation time for PACR spread over about three years from PCN meeting in October
2002 to Board Approval in September 2005. However, it has to be noted that it took
about a year for GoM to decide on which Ministry was to host the Project. Further,


                                                 24
preparation time did contribute to foster ownership, which in turn contributed to Project
achievements. PACR design and implementation arrangements demonstrated to be
flexible enough to sustain some difficulties as regards results framework indicators,
designed at the time when results framework was relatively recent. Other issues in
procurement and financial management did not hamper implementation and progress
towards PDO, identified quickly and ultimately resolved. The project had very strong
institutional impact, even though it first recorded implementation delays in the start-up of
project activities, basically the first year, dedicated to installation/hiring of teams and
providers. In preparing this operation, the Bank and the Government put in place two
PPFs totaling US$1.1 million and mobilized substantial qualified human resources to
cover all required technical and institutional fields of expertise. The Bank team reviewed
all existing national strategies and programs and designed the project to comply with
these strategies and government vision on decentralization.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory

105. Project supervision was carried out regularly during project lifetime with adequate
skills mix, except in 2013 with country situation resulting from crisis that started in
March 2012. All fiduciary and safeguard aspects were carefully monitored. The MTR
was effectively carried out and paved the way for the AF that followed in September
2010. Supervision was also adequately performed by TTLs throughout project
implementation being based at Bamako country office. This fostered contact on regular
basis with the BCG/PACR team to address any burning issues. Frequent knowledge
sharing with all stakeholders also took place on regular basis, particularly on
decentralization. While Implementation Progress was rated as Moderately Satisfactory
from end of 2007 until mid-2010 in view of difficulties as regards component B and
fiduciary issues, this did not hamper PACR implementation to maintain good pace
towards progress to its PDO. Issues were quickly identified and adequate remedial
measures were taken to improve project performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory

106. The overall rating for Bank performance can be rated Satisfactory. After
implementation start, the Bank team paid great attention to the quality of project
supervision and made each time appropriate recommendations to improve
implementation. The MTR was essential to take sound decisions on particular activities.
Supervision of the project from the field contributed to a hands-on approach and rapid
problem solving.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance



                                              25
Rating: Government performance is rated Satisfactory

107. There was a high level of ownership on part of GoM during the preparation phase
of the project. GoM was very active and committed during this critical stage and did
prepare the different components of the project. GoM did obtain project preparation
funds from the Bank so as to make available resources for the project teams to participate
actively in designing and preparing the project throughout the long preparation period.
All Government strategies (PRSP, Rural Development Strategy) important for the project
design were ready, and the authorities maintained the course on the decentralization
agenda all along project implementation. Key Government institutions responsible for the
Decentralization policy worked closely with the project to ensure sound implementation
of the project.
108. Despite effectiveness delays due to ratification process, GoM appreciated the
project and conducted it in a sound manner so that the PDO was met and all targets
achieved or even surpassed early. Disbursements also were very satisfactory, reaching
70% by end of May 2010. At the time, GoM demonstrated its commitment to the Project
by negotiating for more funding for an AF, which was approved in September 2010.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Implementing Agency performance is rated Satisfactory

109. The implementing agency was subdivided into one PIU at the central level
(BCG/PACR) and the four regional PIUs. The BCG/PACR was well staffed with
competent and dynamic experts with a minimal staff turnover, which was advantageous
for continuity. During the project implementation period, there were however issues
concerning financial management (resulting from component B essentially) and
procurement (mostly as regards component B and ANICT) but these were identified early
and ultimately resolved. The implementing agency was also able to establish a sound and
comprehensive M&E system to track project activities and progress against output and
outcome indicators. The implementing agency was able to disburse on time the entire
credit and to timely close the financial statement before the grace period. Without the
shortcomings experienced early, the overall performance the implementing agency
performance would be rated highly satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Overall Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory

110. The Borrower’s overall performance is rated satisfactory. GoM was totally
engaged in project preparation, following successful implementation of a community
based rural development approach under the PAIB project (P035617). It remained fully
committed with PACR’s objectives from preparation to completion, based on a deepened
community empowerment approach in line with Mali’s applicable decentralization
policy. Despite difficult times in early 2012 and onwards until Project closing and
consequences on its implementation; it can be inferred that Malian authorities played a
key role in ensuring Project to remain on track.


                                           26
6. Lessons Learned

111. The major lessons drawn from the implementation and outcome of this operation
can be summarized as follows:

112. Necessity for authorities to discuss and decide early on Project hosting
arrangements. Government authorities need to be as proactive as possible on Project
hosting arrangements so as to discuss and decide on this critical aspect as soon as
possible so that not only possible delays in project preparation can be avoided or
significantly reduced but also ownership is fostered and stronger commitment of
authorities early on.
113. Importance of CDD operations vis-à-vis war and crisis situation. It is important
to note that when a conflict situation does occur in any country, central institutions can be
severely weakened. In this context, CDD approach and related projects are often among
the few interventions that may still function. Experience has shown that CDD approach
can play an important role in the reconciliation process between communities affected by
the conflict.
114. Need for well-developed project management functions and appropriate means
of operations. The Project Preparation Advance instrument proved essential in jump
starting activities even before project effectiveness and allowed BCG/PACR to be set-up
rapidly at central and regional levels, all in turn allowing for a more efficient project
operation and surely help to solve issues more rapidly in an effective manner.
115. Need to ensure that all project stakeholders are fully in line with project
arrangements. PACR did encounter most of its difficulties with component B (credit
agreement compliance, procurement and financial management problems) as it appears
that implementation arrangements were insufficiently prepared. The need to revise the
manual of procedures appeared rapidly, which solved the problems. This could have been
avoided during preparation with deepened discussions with ANICT.
116. Some form of flexibility in project implementation arrangements is essential for
CDD projects. Execution of community based programs necessitates a good knowledge
of local conditions and the adoption of simple management procedures. Without a
minimum of flexibility regarding the direct transfer of funds to communities for example
and the confidence on self-control mechanisms on funds disbursement, it would not be
possible to execute a large number of micro-projects in a short term period.
117. Capacity building is critical at all levels and essential for community
empowerment. The implementation of PACR required the development of capacities of
all institutional and technical stakeholders on the field. This was essential to enable the
adherence of state decentralized structures, and beneficiary communities to the project
approach and enhance information and communication among stakeholders. PACR close
partnership with local municipalities, decentralized agencies, civil society has enabled the
program to transfer skills to established institutions. Providing training through local
expertise (civil society organizations) has also enabled capacity building to reach the
micro level (villages) throughout the country and this was critical for communities to
develop socio-collective and productive investments.


                                             27
118. Effective harmonization of approaches around government policies is critical.
The sustained success of the various CDD operations (PAIB, PACR) and one recently
approved project including CDD activities, the Reconstruction and Economic Recovery
Project, all come into play in the continuous efforts made to support the decentralization
process, which remains on top of the agenda of the Government.
119. High ownership of project activities. PACR approach and implementation
procedures of the local productive initiative fund (LPIF) were critical to give more
responsibility to the different actors, those of government institutions, but particularly at
the community level. This allowed a better ownership of local investments and an
increase of awareness for appropriate maintenance and sustainability. The approach has
proven that if local communities are given the opportunity, they are capable to manage
their own development and be at the center of the decision-making process. In addition,
the active involvement of the government institutions in the project implementation
contributed widely to their capacity development and helped ensuring the sustainability
of the results achieved.

The objectives of this component were to assist decentralization stakeholders, including
village communities and community socio-professional organizations to: (i) participate
more actively in the planning and implementation of local and community development,
(ii) be better and more empowered in the control and management of socio-collective and
productive investments. These objectives were aimed at improving governance and
managerial capacity of targeted communes and local communities.

Further, and at the time of the AF, additional training was provided and delivered through
existing network of project training resources and field agents. Strong management
capacities were seen as the critical element to ensure the viability of small-scale rural
investments and the sustainability of rural organizations and associations. As such and for
sustainability purposes, the project strengthened its training of management trainers and
advisers through a partnership with the “Start and Improve your Business” SIYB-
program from the International Labor Organization. The project information and
communication program also took this opportunity to reiterate and strengthen its
messages on education and other social and health messages, especially for young girls.

This component enabled 80% of communities that have benefited from a socio-collective
or productive investment through PACR to still have functioning management
committees at Project closing. To achieve these results, the project supported extensive
capacity building program and no less than 251 private service and training providers
benefited from project support for capacity building for the improvement of the quality of
their services and the development of their activities. In total, during the life of the
Project, approximately 75,065 training sessions were held for the benefit of 477,852
people, among which 50.29% were women.

Activities in information and rural promotion were mainly conducted by ADCs through
information-Education-Communication (IEC) and advisory support approaches. Quickly
after their hiring, ADCs were trained in IEC for them to sensitize on various areas. More

specifically, the breakdown of training sessions provided by them is as follows: 20,670 in
citizen education, 13,313 in hygiene and water sanitation, 8,945 in Environmental
management, 5,816 in School enrollment of young girls, 15,516 in health related areas
(family planning, malaria, HIV/AIDS, vaccination…); 3,905 in Gender and Development
and Gender and management of public affairs; 1,626 in Nutrition and 1,335 in Literacy
and school enrollment. After these first sessions, ADCs were deployed in the field, with
roughly one agent for about 10 villages, to alternate broadcasts messages on these themes
and objectives, approaches and procedures of PACR. These various information activities
were supported by awareness campaigns conducted by 13 local radio stations as part of
quarterly contracts which evolved over time to learn and adapt their information program
based on the context.

Other training sessions took place aimed at solving specific issues raised by beneficiaries
and 97,032 were organized. The theme of these training sessions was in mobilization and
social organization and covered among others: (i) information on PACR; (ii)
identification of the needs of communities; (iii) set up of institutional organs and
functioning; (iv) Implementation and Management; (v) Coordination of activities and
development; and (vi) others.

ADCs provided advisory services and TA to direct beneficiaries such as assistance in
creating/restructuring CBOs, support and follow up to beneficiaries of productive
investments, support to beneficiaries of socio-collective investments, support and follow
up to providers in the implementation of productive investments. Capacity Building and
Brainstorming Session of stakeholders was also held and moderated by providers in each
of key cities (chef-lieu) of the 18 circles with average participation of 25 local
administrative and technical authorities of beneficiary communities, producer
organizations, management bodies of socio-collective investments. Training was also
provided to elected officials in areas such as implementation support, procurement
procedures, community development planning, mobilization of resources and role of
stakeholders.

It is worth mentioning that beneficiaries of socio-collective investments or productive
investments that have also benefited from training sessions all expressed their satisfaction
for the training. The same sentiment is shared by local authorities and service providers
who were also supported from the project.

The objective of this component was to provide financial and technical support services
for investments with public-good characteristics (social and environmental) within
Communal Development and Investment Plans. These objectives were aimed to improve
access to and sustainability of basic socioeconomic services for the targeted communes.
This component was assigned and led by ANICT through a project agreement with IDA,
and a subsidiary agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Mali.

Immediately after project effectiveness, pursuant to the two agreements, ANICT
committed drawing rights for each of the 54 commune recipients for 2006, which funded
82 agreements with investment made during the same year. However, concerns were
raised early on about the quality of micro-projects during a joint Bank - GoM supervision
mission As a result, the mission recommended the suspension of micro-projects funding
pending the adoption of a revised manual of procedures with implementation
arrangements more suited to community development funds and the completion of a
technical audit of the investments.

Despite these difficulties encountered early on, ANICT managed the situation overall and
assisted communities in the design and implementation of 501 socioeconomic investment
micro-projects, with strong technical and economic training sessions to communes and
the CBO. The 501 socio-collective projects covered a vast range of areas: investments in
education are predominant with 43.82% followed by those in health with 22.71%,
hydraulic 16.93% and 15.54% for commercial facilities. As regards attendance rate, 95%
of social investments financed by the project have seen an increase (from an objective of
90%).

A training program to assist micro-project management committees was designed by the
BCG/PACR and funded by ANICT under the corresponding technical support rights.
This resulted in more than 452 management committees (177 in Sikasso, 107 in Ségou,
137 in Mopti and 31 in Timbuktu). The design of this program was guided by a strategy
of cascade training, with the development of standard modules by a firm which trained
trainers on these modules who, in turn, transferred the skills acquired to the management
committees.

The objective of this component was to provide financial and technical support services
for local community-based investments with private good characteristics.

The goal of 900 sub-projects was largely surpassed as 910 were implemented through
financing agreements signed with regional offices. The CBOs were fully in charge of
their micro-project management with the power to hire and pay all service providers
involved in their design and implementation stages. In terms of coverage, the region that
benefited the most is Sikasso, with 32.63% of the sub-projects, followed by Mopti with
28.24% of the sub-projects. Out of 910 sub-projects, infrastructure works and equipment
purchase was completed for 906 sub-projects, giving a completion rate of 99%. The rate
of female organizations that benefited from these sub-projects was 39%.

The average cost of a sub-project (with no capacity building activities), amounted to
12,85 million FCFA, with the highest amount recorded in Timbuktu with 16,3 million
FCFA due to its isolation compared to Segou with 12,13 million FCFA. While exceeding
the number of planned projects, costs remained under control overall with 9.5% lower
level spent than forecast as seen below.

Concerning areas of intervention, agricultural production sub-projects were predominant
with 49%, followed by livestock (29%) processing (13%) and craftsman (9%).

Commercially oriented sub-projects 13 were sought after following the first information
campaign. However, a need to better inform communities quickly emerged which led to
opportunities to direct their initiatives on diversification and processing of agro-sylvo
pastoral productions and craft work.

As described in the Project Implementation Manual, each sub-project submitted for
funding under the project was appraised by the Regional PIU in terms of social, technical
and environmental financial economic feasibility, using a multi-criteria grid for analysis
designed by BCG/PACR. This grid was then adapted to the specific context of each
region and gradually adjusted based on lessons learned.

The objective of this component was aimed to support project management at central and
regional level for coordination, M&E and knowledge management needs. This included
coordination and administrative, technical, and financial management of the project as
well as efforts to monitor and evaluate its performance, results, and impacts. Over the
years, the PIU at central level, i.e. the BCG/PACR, has demonstrated high ability and an
appropriate level of autonomy in managing and implementing PACR.

The results set for this component were all met with 14 multi-stakeholder workshops held
(objective set at 14, completion rate of 100%) and 12 activity reports produced and
approved by both the national steering committee and the Bank (objective set at 12,
completion rate of 100%).

At central level, the coordination of activities was performed in a satisfactory manner by
the BCG/PACR, readily available to identify malfunctions and proposed measures to
correct weaknesses. At Regional level, the four regional PIUs generally played their roles
although they did not manage to consistently support field activities due to work
overload. However, they were also able to establish good relations with administrative
authorities, technical services, apex organizations and especially with the Regional
Branches of ANICT and coordinators of ODC.
In terms of complementarities and synergies, many achievements can be mentioned at all
levels through:
- Numerous consultations with similar development projects such as the PCDA,
PASAOP, PNIR (the last two now closed). Other contacts with Projects included
FODESA, PADEC, the ADERE North, Lux- Development, the Millennium Villages
project PRODEVALAIT, FODESA, PAISA, etc.
- Involvement of the most relevant National Directorates (Agriculture, livestock,
fisheries, animal production and Industry, Social Development and Solidarity Economy)
in conducting essential activities such as the development of modules, organization of
study tours and testing of technological innovations , and sharing of annual reports.

Financial Management. The BCG/PACR did manage the project accounts according to
the two credit agreements, in a satisfactory manner since none of the annual audits led to
qualifications on overall management. In addition, the project team applied all


                                                     34
recommendations made to improve internal control. Funds were also disbursed at a very
satisfactory pace, and resources of the initial credit IDA 41130 were fully disbursed by
mid-May 2013, and the ones of the second credit IDA 48230 reached a 99.8%
disbursement rate at project closure.

Procurement. At central level, over 200 contracts were signed among which 52 of them
were for XOF 50 million each. Pursuant to the recommendations of their missions
reviewed by IDA, the General Control of Public Procurement and annual audits, several
measures had been taken to improve procurement procedures, including:
- The training of all officials involved in these procedures at BCG/PACR
- Close monitoring in procurement planning and archiving
- Managing of standard procurement using shopping method.
At local level, each of the 1,412 direct beneficiaries contracted an average of 2 bids to
recruit providers for studies and monitoring, training, work and acquisition of equipment
and materials. Procedures were reviewed by internal and external audits with findings
and recommendations that led to:
- provision for training to 162 people including 54 municipal councils and 136 project
staff , 124 ODC , 8 staff from regional PIUs and 4 staff from BCG/PACR
- elimination of conflict of interest issues.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E). A sound M&E system was put in place to ensure
regular monitoring of the project’s economic, environmental, and institutional impacts.
Supervision missions were organized with professionalism and aide-memoires were
issued on time. The M&E system remained operational throughout project
implementation, with a computerized database both at central level and at regional level
with each regional PIU and reporting of information performed electronically. The
system functioned satisfactorily overall to respond to the needs of the project steering
committee and overall project partners. The M&E system provided comprehensive data
for real-time which facilitated project monitoring overall.

Supervision. The World Bank has carried out a dozen supervision missions whose
recommendations were relevant and broadly implemented by the BCG/PACR. The
BCG/PACR conducted regular field missions with at least one field mission per quarter
to conduct awareness campaigns on the vision and strategies of the project, identify
weaknesses and recommend courses of substantial corrective measures. Regional PIUs
provided regular support to ADC in pre- appraising sub-projects and solving specific
problems.

Environmental and Social Management Impact. In implementation of the ESMF and the
PMP, CBOs were sensitized on environmental issues and challenges, and many of them
were supported by:
1) provision of mini -incinerators , monitoring notebooks of aquifers, improved stoves,
small pharmacies, support for reforestation, and latrines
2) completion of three training sessions including one on food sanitation and the other
two on pests and pesticides.

Impact of the project on the implementation of the national policy on social protection.
Through the AF, the project has strengthened the capacity of 28 health mutual funds
through:
- Contributions to working capital and revolving funds, for an average amount of XOF
3,000,000 by health mutual fund
- Training activities at a total cost of about XOF 63 million, which brought together 244
people of their Board Administration and Monitoring Commissions, and technical
officers of the Ministry in charge
- Support for equipment and logistics for a total of XOF 53,678,000.

In addition, the project supported the actions and processes of official recognition of
mutual funds in two communities found in Mopti (Dimbal and Bankass) that were
conducted by local departments in charge of social development.

The objective of this component aimed to mitigate effects of world crises (food price
crisis, oil crisis, financial crisis) that affected the most vulnerable populations of Mali via
assistance to management committees of rural primary schools and CSCOMs, as well as
health care associations, to temporarily support rural primary school and CSCOM staff
and restore stocks of school stationary and medicines, as well as renew obsolete or
damaged equipment.

The goal of having at least 90% of the social associations that benefitted from the project
social assistance to function properly was surpassed as the final figure is 95%. As part of
this component, micro-grants were signed on behalf of 541 members for a total of XOF
1,014,552,187 for the management of schools, health centers and health mutual funds and
also in view to purchase equipment and personnel, maintain their infrastructure and
benefit from training.

It is worth noting that despite difficulties faced early on such as (i) the selection of
eligible CSCOMs, schools as well as health care associations and (ii) delays in the
payment of public officials’ salaries (teachers and agents of health care centers) due to
the fact that the micro-grants took time to be signed and effective; this component was
successfully implemented.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

1.      At appraisal, no economic or financial analysis (or cost-benefit for the whole
project) was e conducted for the following reasons: (i) benefits of the capacity-building
component (community empowerment and local governance improvement) defy
quantification ; (ii) the investment components cannot be precisely known ex ante, since
it is demand-driven and to be defined in the course of the project ; (iii) many of the
benefits from anticipated investments (such as in natural resources management,
education, health, etc.) cannot be easily quantified in monetary terms.

2.    Consequently, only an illustrative cost-benefit analysis was undertaken for a
sample of possible income-generating activities and indicated strong potential for
economic and financial returns.

Assumptions made at Appraisal

3.      The project was expected to generate many benefits, some economic in nature and
others social and environmental in nature. A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) could not be
conducted for the whole project because of this mix, and more specifically for the
following reasons: (i) benefits of the capacity-building components (empowerment of
communities and support to local governance) defied quantification; (ii) socio-economic
and productive investments were on a demand-driven basis, it was difficult to predict
precisely the number of each possible investment; and (iii) benefits from investments in
natural resource management, education, health, similarly could not be easily quantified
in monetary terms.

4.      Economic Analysis. At appraisal, in economic terms, PACR total costs were
about US$64 million of which US$13.12 million for Capacity Building, US$16.7 million
for Communal Investments, US$24.5 million for Local Productive Investments, and
US$9.67 million for overall project management. The analysis attempted to identify
quantifiable benefits and costs that related directly to the activities undertaken following
the execution of project components, or that could be attributed to the project’s
implementation. The main quantifiable benefits arising from the project were income
generation through the financing of communal socio-economic and local productive
micro-projects (a labor remuneration WP/WOP increase of US$4.62 equivalent, and a
benefit/hectare WP/WOP increase of US$838.00 equivalent). Based on the above
benefits and costs, the overall economic rate of return (ERR) of the project was estimated
at 13% over a period of 15 years.

5.     Financial Analysis. The financial analysis was conducted by focusing on
beneficiary CBOs, rather than on macro considerations of national food security or export
earnings. Information on the production systems collected during the field visits provided
the key parameters for the various budgets and income analysis of the various possible
productive investments. Production models and financial budgets were defined for the
most critical interventions for income generating activities such as soil and water
conservation (dikes and thresholds), horticulture, bee-keeping, poultry, small livestock


                                            37
feeding, small fisheries, mill, village store, etc. Given the wide variations occurring
within the production systems, the models were indicative. The financial analysis was
prepared using relatively conservative parameters, but the main indicators for assessing
the financial results of the sub-projects were: gross margin, benefits, returns and
incremental returns to family labor and benefit/cost ratios.

7.      The table below summarizes the key results of the analysis, the financial returns
and ratios for various productive micro-projects. The financial attractiveness of these
micro-projects is highlighted by the sound internal rates of return (IRRs), positive net
present values and benefit/cost ratios, calculated under the WP/WOP financing scenarios.
Sufficient financial benefits are expected to accrue to CBOs receiving LPIF grants. These
estimates are in line with an experience of existing rural development programs.

8.      Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity analysis assessed the effect of variations in
benefits and costs. An increase in total project costs by 10% would reduce the ERR to
about 8%. A 10% cost increase coupled with a 5% benefit decrease would reduce the
ERR to 4%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the project is relatively robust and will
remain economically viable under most foreseeable adverse conditions.

9.      Other economic benefits expected from the Project interventions, but not readily
quantified, include social benefits i.e. social capital building (local governance,
communal and local technical and managerial capacity), access to social basic services
(potable water, health and education) and access to markets, as well as environmental
benefits.

As seen above, agriculture productive investments are dominant (49%), followed by
livestock (29%), processing & trade (13%) and crafts (9%). Financing also follows that
same order for total financing, PACR Grant and Contributions of beneficiaries.

Project costs under Component C remained under control with no overrun despite a
slightly higher number of productive investments completed (910) than originally
planned (900). As seen in table below 14, actual expenditures against budgeted / forecast
costs show that the project has made efficient use of resources as final figures indicate
that total costs were about 10% lower than forecast. This shows that not only PACR costs
were adequately estimated but also the efficiency of overall project management with the
ability for costs to remain under control and lower than planned.

Project costs included in the analysis comprised direct costs (i.e. initial cost of the
investment) and are based on actual figures. When relevant, Economic and financial rates
of return were computed for the sample of productive investments.

Assumptions
   (i)    for every productive investment, the full benefit is realized in year 1 and every
          year thereafter, throughout the life of the project;
   (ii)   a discount rate of 10% is used to compute Net Present Value (NPV) and
          Financial Internal Rate of Return (IRR) at 5 years and 15 years (with constant
          cash flows from year 6 to year 15);
   (iii) the expected benefit stream ceases immediately after the productive
          investment’s lifespan is complete;
   (iv)   an economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated whenever relevant;
   (v)    Sensitivity analysis was conducted with lower revenues (5% decrease), and
          higher costs (10% increase) coupled with lower revenues (5% decrease).

Average NPV and IRR were calculated for a sample of productive investments aimed to
be representative of region coverage and average costs. Twenty-seven productive
investments were sampled and included 5 productive investments in village gardens, 10
in dry crop, 5 in Livestock, 4 in Processing & Trade activities and 3 in crafts. The
analysis showed that productive investments yielded positive returns overall, as seen
below.

On average, NPVs were all positive (ranging from high to very high) and so were ERR
computed for village garden (44%), dry crop (89%), production and agro-processing
(127%) and crafts (186%). The weighted overall IRR for the five crops over a 15-year
period is estimated at 99% (non- weighted ERR amounts to 134%) while the overall ERR
is estimated at 28.4% or above the overall project ERR computed at appraisal, i.e. 13%.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to see the effects of higher costs and a combination
of both higher costs and lower revenues. With an increase in costs of 10%, the overall
ERR would be reduced to 27.7%. A 10% cost increase coupled with a 5% decrease of
benefits would reduce the overall ERR to 27.2%.

Analysis by categories of productive investments

Looking at seven typical productive investments (i.e. adding bee keeping and aquaculture
to the five ones mentioned earlier), further analysis was conducted with results below. A
sensitivity analysis was also conducted to see the effects of higher costs and a
combination of both higher costs and lower revenues. The overall IRR is estimated at
178% (over a period of 15 years). As regards the overall ERR, it is estimated at 36.7%
(over a period of 15 years) above the overall ERR calculated at appraisal, i.e. 13%. An
increase in costs of 10% would reduce the overall ERR to 33.5%. A 10% cost increase
coupled with a 5% decrease of benefits would reduce the overall ERR to 32.1%.

Other economic benefits resulting from PACR activities

Income generation. PACR has contributed in creating but also raising incomes as net
value of production compared to pre-project situation. Incomes have increased steadily
throughout implementation. Results are as follows:

A comparison of income per family member using poverty line of XOF 145,000 per year
per person has been conducted. It shows that PACR helped increase the number of
productive investments and in turn helped concerned members reaching incomes above
the poverty line: 50% in Sikasso, more than 42% in Segou, more than 57% in Mopti and
a little over 47% in Timbuktu. The number of productive investments assessed and
income data are presented by region in the following table:

Employment. The recent impact study conducted did show that PACR has contributed to
the creation of jobs through the productive investments financed. The proportion of jobs
created for women ranges from 45% for agriculture, 51% in livestock, 60% in production
and agro-processing and 35% for crafts.

Out of 109 micro-projects sampled, PACR has helped create 9,281 jobs for beneficiaries,
including 4,608 women, or 49.6%. In addition to self-employment, PACR helped create
161 permanent employee jobs, out of which 6 for women and 959 temporary employee
jobs, out of which 431 for women (44.94%). By extrapolation to all the financed micro-
projects, it can be inferred that PACR contributed to the creation of more than 77,000
jobs.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
(if any)

   SUMMARY OF PACR IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND AUTO
               EVALUATION OF PACR

The beneficiary assessment of the project was generally positive. The beneficiaries
demonstrated to have a good knowledge of the objectives and project activities and they
appreciated very well the positive changes occurred in their daily life due to project
activities. Beneficiary’s perceptions are summarized below.

IMPACT AT POPULATION LEVEL

Direct beneficiaries of socio-collective investments

Education: With the exception of the region of Timbuktu, the gross enrollment rate in
areas covered by PACR is everywhere higher than the average gross enrollment rate in
other regions. The particular situation of Timbuktu could be explained by the effects of
the security crisis in the North which would have resulted in an almost non- attendance in
the region during 2012.
However, overall it appears that the proportion of girls attending schools supported by the
PACR is almost the same compared to boys (49.7% for girls and 50.3% for boys in 2012
with the PACR and 50.3% against 49.2% without PACR). Possible reasons for these
figures may lie (in order of importance) age of the sample surveyed (too young or too old
for respectively 68.5% and 11.1%); distance between the school and the village (9.5%),
child labor (6.3%), drop out cases (3.2%). There is also a significant disparity between
regions, with a higher proportion of girls attending school in Sikasso and Timbuktu
regions compared to lower proportions in Mopti and Segou regions.

PACR support is perceived as satisfactory in almost all of the parents surveyed (98.7%).
The proportion of dissatisfied occurs in Timbuktu (7.7%) and Mopti (2.5%) for various
reasons, including insufficient number of teachers, the cost of their care by communities
and low level of training of some teachers. A management committee was set up at each
of the schools that have received support from the PACR for its efficient and sustainable
operation. The operation of these management committees is considered satisfactory to
very satisfactory for the vast majority (86.6%) of student parents against 11% who
consider it somewhat unsatisfactory or unsatisfactory.

Health: rates of antenatal care and assisted delivery are particularly high in the areas
covered by the health centers supported by the PACR. Attendance rates of these health
centers are higher because the diseases and causes of consultation in their services being
in order of frequency , malaria (78.9%), injuries , fractures or sprains (4.5 %), diarrhea
(3.8%), the tension and diabetes (3.0%), cough or pain in the back or limbs (2.8%).



                                            47
All women surveyed reported having given birth or in a health center (97.5%) or with the
assistance of a health worker (2.5%). The assisted delivery rate is well above the national
rate, which has declined, from 64% in 2009 to 57% in 2010. Reasons for low rates in
other regions between low geographical accessibility (isolation) and low cover assisted
delivery. Through the generalization of the delivery physician-assisted interventions
PACR have particularly contributed to closer geographically and sociologically health
services and certain categories of users, including pregnant women and children.

On 88% of respondents claiming to have been sick during the year, 77.4% consulted a
service or a health center, particularly community health centers (79.9% of visits), then
the CSREF for reference. Consultation with other stakeholders (medical office, healer or
marabout, etc.) Is relatively low (5.5%) in the surveyed areas.

The main reasons for non-medical consultation seems to be the assessment of the severity
of the disease by the parties ("it was not necessary" or "it did not matter"). This reason
concerns the vast majority (85%) of those who did not consult staff or a health center.
Other reasons are the cost of the consultation and or treatment considered high, the long
distance away from the health center or isolation. The vast majority of respondents in all
areas (89.1%) positively appreciated the services rendered by employees and health
centers, particularly in the regions of Sikasso, Mopti and Segou. The proportion of
unsatisfied people (10.9% overall) is particularly high in Timbuktu (67%) and to a lesser
extent in Segou (23.8%). Causes of dissatisfaction are in order of frequency: the waiting
time to be too long, lack of qualification of health personnel, ineffective treatments and
the high cost of prescriptions. A management committee was set up at each of the health
centers that have received support from the PACR. Operation management committees
are considered satisfactory to very satisfactory by the vast majority (91.4%) of
respondents against 8.6% who find it unsatisfactory especially in the Timbuktu region.

Water Access Points and Hydraulic at Village level: The majority of the population
(between 61% and 55%) that received water access points provided by PACR is satisfied
with its supply of drinking water against a large minority that is not satisfied. The latter is
mostly found in the Mopti region (45.2%) and Segou (41.9%).
The reasons for unsatisfied populations are in order of frequency:
- Water taste seems not suitable thus encouraging people to use their traditional sources
of drinking water;
- Waiting time around the water access point, especially for water systems;
- The early depletion of certain water access points;
- The frequency of failure of pumping equipment in particular;
- The perceived high cost of water, especially for water systems and pumps;
- Excessive distance between families and the water access point.

Although "only" 60% of village populations that have received support from PACR in
hydraulic at village level using modern water point for their supply of drinking water, the
results of the survey show that almost all of the surveyed population (95.2%) is very
satisfied to satisfied for this support. The proportion of unsatisfied is especially
significant in the Segou region where they represent more than one respondent out of ten



                                              48
(11.8%) and to a lesser extent in the Mopti region (4.6%), probably for the reasons cited
above (unsuitable taste of water, excessive waiting time, early depletion of wells).

More than half of the population (60%) that benefited from a water access point made
with PACR support get its drinking water through modern access points (cemented wells,
pumps and valve wells) against 40% from traditional water points ( traditional wells,
pumps, etc.).

Empowerment of women. Women play an important role in rural areas in different
segments of the production and marketing of agricultural products. However, they are
disadvantaged in access to resources and means of production, including access to land.
PACR had to face the challenge of empowering women. To measure the degree of
empowerment, a questionnaire was administered to managers in productive investments.
Investigations in areas gave the following results:
- The chores of women were reduced by using the following equipment: 26.67% for
hulling; 40% for equipment food processing; 26.67% for mills and 6.67% for other types
of equipment;
- 92.11 % of OCB / OSP said that women incomes have at least doubled; 7.89% of CBOs
/ OSP said that incomes have not increased;
- Women have participated in family expenses.

Data collected from PACR stakeholders in Bamako and regions show that over 80% of
successful projects in some regions are those of women and help confirm the survey data.
The collected data show that women were strongly empowered through the following
support:
- Out of the 910 productive investments funded under PACR, 358 (39.34%) benefited to
women;
- Out of the 2,787 participants in capacity building activities, 1,015 of the beneficiaries
are women (36.41%) through training and exchange visits, production or management
techniques, basic literacy and functional literacy, poultry, rain-fed farming, insemination
of cattle and processing of bourgou.

Functioning of management committees of collective investments

Management committees. Overall, almost all members of the management committees
seem to be able to carry out the functions in the committee. However, it appears that with
the exception of health associations, after the first year of operation, the vast majority no
longer holds general assembly meetings and management meetings of committees only
take place occasionally or around specific issues (opening of classrooms, technical
failures, maintenance or repair of infrastructure...). Supervisory boards are hardly
functional.

For schools, health centers and water access points, committees receive contributions
from the populations. Depending on localities, some of them provide paid for services for
users. For sub-projects such as rural roads and stockyards, these only mobilize initial
budget allocations.

Communal councils

   1. Exercising communal project management

PACR has helped improve the project owner of Technical Advisors (communes),
particularly through increasing the number of financing agreements signed between
ANICT and CT, and stimulating:
- Better monitoring of the technical design and execution of works
- Training and support of ODC in favor of Technical Advisors.

However, shortcomings were identified, including:

- Poor quality of certain works, largely due to poor governance, lack of follow-up work
by Technical Advisors who are the project owners;
- Maintenance fees (or repair fees) that are high as a result of the poor quality of works;
- Delays in the commissioning of certain infrastructures (schools, health centers) related
to malfunctions in the communal programming for the acquisition of materials and
equipment.

   2. Improving municipal management and maintenance of works

PACR has prompted authorities to sign with the management committees of all sub-
projects assistance agreements, except in Mopti where these signatures have been limited
to 58% of sub-projects.

IMPACT AT OCB/OSP LEVEL

   1. Job creation

PACR has helped to create, among the population sampled, 9,281 jobs for beneficiaries,
including 4,608 women, or 49.6%. In addition to self-employment, PACR helped create
161 permanent employee jobs, out of which 6 for women and 959 temporary employee
jobs, out of which 431 for women (44.94%).

   2. Technical and technological innovations

In its areas of intervention, PACR helped introduce many technical and technological
innovations, ranging from crop residues bundling equipment, which have revolutionized
the work of carpenters working on wood; time savings are realized and the product
quality is better.
   3. Increase of yields and incomes

    c) Increase in yields

    Yields have increased for many crops until 2011, with the intensification program and
    production processes supported under PACR.

    4. Functionality bodies OCB / OSP

Overall, the OCB / OSP worked well with the support of PACR, with clear improvement
in:
- The frequency of statutory meetings,
- The rate of renewals of the mandate of members of management bodies,
- Their number and having sufficient resources to be functional,
- Their integration into the formal financial system.

Conclusion

PACR has achieved all of its objectives. Indeed, his performance was good overall and
very good as regards the number of direct beneficiaries of the project (136 %) and the
percentage of productive investments that have generated an average annual income per
member above the daily poverty line (50% on a forecast of 50%). Other results were as
follows: 55% of productive projects have generated an average annual income above the
daily poverty line against a forecast of 60%; and 71% of supported villages under PACR
have an adequate access to basic social services against a forecast 80 %.

AUTO EVALUATION OF PACR
The project conducted in September 2012 an auto-evaluation of PACR focused on
components B and C, which served as the basis of the independent impact evaluation
conducted at the end of 2013. As regards productive investments, the assessment of the
functionality of management bodies in productive projects was conducted on a sample of
80 CBOs managing projects being in operation for at least two years. It was made based
on the following criteria:
 - The operation of the device and organizational management
 - The level of literacy / education of members of the governing body of the OCB / OSP
- The control of management tools

Results revealed that 82% of the management bodies meet at least two of the three
criteria combined. Among other factors to explain the rate of functionality to be quite
satisfactory, it is noteworthy the significant capacity building program implemented


                                                 51
under PACR especially for beneficiaries in productive investments. Moreover, the 82%
rate of proper functioning of the management bodies is much higher than was set as end
goal of the project is 75% for component C.

As with productive investments, an assessment of the functionality of the management
bodies in socio-collective investments was conducted on a sample of 313 social collective
investments. The survey revealed that 90% of the management bodies meet at least two
of the three criteria of functionality mentioned earlier.

Additional average income by member of OCB. Since management of sub-projects is not
the main activity of members of CBOs / OSP, the income they earn from this operation
can be considered as additional. The additional average income per member of OCB is
derived from operating account in productive investments. The operating account is
established by the OCB with support from the provider in advisory service on
management. The appreciation of the additional average income was made on a sample
of 195 productive investments under operation, which represents nearly 23% of all the
productive investments and 28% of sub-projects in operation. The 195 productive
investments are operated by 3,304 members of CBOs. They include 128 agricultural
projects, 20 livestock projects, 25 projects in food processing and 22 in craft projects.
This sample seems representative enough since the 904 in productive projects,
agricultural projects accounted for 49 %, livestock projects 29% transformation projects
14% and 8% Handicrafts. The assessment found that the average income in project area
is XOF 73,113 per OCB member. The average income varies depending on areas of
activity, but also by region. Thus, we see that the highest average income is observed in
crafts with XOF 81,645 and the lowest average income in livestock with XOF 58,870.
Also the highest average regional income is in Segou with XOF 88,710 and the lowest
average regional income is in Sikasso with 53183fcfa. Overall, revenues remain
dependent on the possibility of poor harvest years by location (agriculture sub-projects
represent 65 % of the sample of projects) and the relatively high number of members by
OCB (17 members on average).

Satisfaction of beneficiaries of productive and socio-collective investments. 267 members
of OCB were surveyed, and included 89 beneficiaries of productive investments, 48
beneficiaries of 12 socio-collective investments. As regards productive investments,
results show that (i) 255 people or 95% of respondents are satisfied with the process of
construction of infrastructure; (ii) 206 people or 77% of respondents feel that the quality
of the infrastructure created is good, and 55 people or 20% believe it is fair; (iii) 209
people or 78% of respondents have undertaken measures to mitigate the adverse
environmental impacts of their projects and (iv) 228 people or 85% have introduced
technical and technological innovations. As regards socio-collective investments, results
show that (i) 48 people representing 100% of respondents are satisfied with the process of
construction of infrastructure (ii) 37 people or 77% feel that the quality of the
infrastructure created is good, and 9 people or 19% believe it is fair and (iii) 46 people or
96% believe that there has been an increase in attendance of their infrastructure.
Regarding attendance, out of a sample of 358 social investments representing about 70%
of achievements in this area, results show that 329 social investments have experienced



                                             52
an increase in their attendance rate, or about 92%, slightly above the end target set by the
project.

As regards capacity building and various efforts conducted, results showed that 97,66%
surveyed are satisfied with the quality of IEC sessions while 2,34% are not. Satisfaction
includes utilization of simple and appropriate tools, clarity and content of themes, local
languages and complementarity with radio shows done through rural radios.

Animations made in the field at OCB / OSP level allowed a large majority of people to
understand better the importance of the topics discussed. Perceptible impacts can be
summarized as follows: (i) the introduction of cleanliness days in the villages; (ii) the set-
up of hygiene and sanitation committees in villages; (iii) the organization of dumps in the
villages; (iv) Change of behaviors of rural populations. The environment is clean, girls go
to school and women are more involved in the development of the village.

I.      DESCRIPTION ET DEMARRAGE DU PROJET

     a) Période de preparation de 2002 à 2006

L’idée du projet a été lancée en novembre 2002 à un moment où le revenu moyen annuel par tête
d’habitant du Mali était estimé à environ 300 U$, et sa population à environ 11,6 millions d’hts
avec un taux d’accroissement annuel de 2,4%. Au plan politique et institutionnel, le pays avait
enregistré certaines avancées dans les domaines de la décentralisation , avec la mise en place de
nouvelles autorités au niveau de ses 703 communes, 8 assemblées régionales et 49 conseils de
cercle, ainsi que l’opérationnalisation d’un dispositif d’appui technique et financier à la
décentralisation dont l’un des instruments majeurs est l’Agence Nationale des Collectivités
Territoriales (ANICT). Le pays commençait également à tirer les enseignements de la première
génération du Cadre Stratégique de Lutte contre la Pauvreté (CSLP 2002-2006) pour en préparer
une seconde génération qui a été effectivement adoptée le 20 décembre 2006 sous la
dénomination de Cadre Stratégique pour la Croissance et la Réduction de la Pauvreté
(CSCRP -2007-2011). Le PACR a été conçu dans ce contexte avec une visée de développement
décentralisé et participatif (DDP) guidée par une logique de complémentarité avec le PCDA et de
capitalisation des précédents projets de développement communautaire du pays, notamment du
PAIB et du PGRN.

     b) De la mise en vigueur en 2006 au 31/12/2011

De la mise en vigueur du projet le 24/03/2006 au 31/12/2011, les grandes tendances de la période
précédente se sont maintenues au plan politique et institutionnel. Au plan de l’accès aux services
sociaux de base, le contexte a été marqué par une évolution significative des indicateurs avec (i)
un taux brut de scolarisation qui est passé de 70.5% en 2004 à 78.3%, (ii) une augmentation de
plus de 25% du nombre de CSCOM, celui-ci étant en effet passé de 660 en 2003 à 826 en 2007,
et (iii) un taux d’accès à l’eau potable qui est passé de 60.1% à 76.2% sur la même période.

     c) Les périodes de crise 2012-2013

A partir du début de l’année 2012, les Régions du nord furent brutalement frappées par une crise
sécuritaire qui s’est traduite par un fort ralentissement de la vie économique, avec de surcroit, (i)
un déplacement massif de leurs populations vers plusieurs pays voisins, et les autres régions du
sud, notamment celles de Mopti, Ségou, Koulikoro et Kayes, et (ii) une destruction des capacités
d’exploitation et de fonctionnement d’une cinquantaine de sous-projets productifs, et de plus
d’une centaine de sous-projets socio-collectifs financés par le PACR dans les Régions de
Tombouctou et de Mopti. Les évènements intervenus le 22 mars 2012 ont encore aggravé cette
situation en raison de la suspension de coopération de la quasi-totalité des partenaires techniques
et financiers avec le pays.

1.1 Objectifs du projet
Le PACR a été mis en vigueur le 24/03/2006 avec un crédit initial de 60 millions U$ de la
Banque Mondiale, en visant les objectifs ci-dessous :

     a) Objectifs de développement




                                                 55
L’objectif de développement du PACR est la réduction de la pauvreté et l’amélioration des
conditions de vie des populations en zones rurales au Mali à travers (i) un renforcement des
capacités des communautés et des services leur venant en appui, et (ii) le financement au niveau
local, d’investissements à caractère économique, social et environnemental générateurs de
revenus et créateurs de bien-être.

    b) Objectifs spécifiques

De façon plus spécifique, le PACR vise 2 objectifs :
 Améliorer l’accès aux services sociaux de base par le financement de sous-projets socio-
    collectifs à maîtrise d’ouvrage communale (écoles, centre d’éducation pour le développement,
    centre d’alphabétisation, centre de santé, sources d’eau potable, etc.),
 Améliorer les revenus des populations par le financement des sous-projets directement
    productifs au profit des Organisations Communautaires et Socioprofessionnelles de Base
    (OCB, OSP) dans tous les domaines.
Pendant toute la durée d’exécution du projet, ses objectifs n’ont pas été changés.

1.2 Composantes du projet

Pour atteindre ces objectifs, les activités du PACR s’articulaient initialement autour de quatre
composantes : Une composante Renforcement de Capacités – Gouvernance et Développement
Local (Composante A) pour un montant d’environ 6,135 milliards FCFA ; Une Composante
Investissements d’Initiatives Communales (Composante B) pour un montant d’environ 5,580
milliards FCFA ; Une Composante Investissements d’Initiatives Productives des Communautés
Locales (Composante C) pour un montant d’environ 11,700 milliards FCFA ; Une Composante
Coordination et Gestion du projet, Suivi-évaluation, Gestion de la Connaissance pour un montant
d’environ 3,144 milliards FCFA. Au vu des résultats enregistrés par le projet PACR, la Banque
Mondiale lui a alloué un fonds additionnel de 11,2 U$ en vue d’atténuation des effets sur les
populations les plus défavorisées de sa zone d’intervention des crises énergétiques qui ont secoué
le monde à partir de 2007. Avec la signature de l’accord de ce financement additionnel, il a été
crée en plus de ces 4 composantes initiales une nouvelle composante dénommée Composante-E
visant à appuyer les organes de gestion d’écoles, de centres communautaires et mutuelles de santé.

Les principaux résultats initialement attendus du projet portent sur la réalisation de : 450
investissements socio collectifs ; 900 sous projets productifs ; d’activités de renforcement de
capacités des communautés rurales et de leurs partenaires (autorités administratives et techniques,
collectivités, société civile et secteur privé). Ceux du fonds additionnel sur :
    - L’allocation de 589 micro-dons aux promoteurs de sous-projets productifs pour
         l’acquisition d’intrants, la réhabilitation d’infrastructures, l’introduction d’innovation
         technique et l’adhésion à des réseaux de commercialisation
    - 742 écoles, centres et mutuelles de santé par la prise en charge de salaire d’agents, la
         dotation en médicaments et fournitures scolaires, l’entretien et la réhabilitation
         d’infrastructures.

1.3 Organisation et réalisation du projet au sein du Ministère de tutelle, et des
    autres Ministères et agences impliquées dans l’exécution du projet

Le projet a évolué pendant ses 7 années d’exécution sous la tutelle du Ministère chargé du
Développement Social et de l’Economie Solidaire, en raison de ses missions et de son rôle en
matière de promotion d’économie coopérative. Bien que ce Ministère ait connu 5 chefs de



                                               56
département pendant cette période, le personnel clef de son Cabinet qui a la charge du PACR est
resté stable avec le même Secrétaire Général pendant les 7 années, et le même Conseiller
Technique pendant 6 années. Cette stabilité a été également observée au niveau des responsables
de ses services centraux, et de leurs déconcentrations au niveau régional et local. La collaboration
entre le personnel clef du Cabinet et la Direction du projet n’a été affectée par aucun facteur
limitant, en raison d’une bonne circulation de l’information, d’une perception partagée et des
missions du Comité National de Pilotage du projet. La collaboration avec les services centraux,
l’ODHD et les autres projets de la tutelle a principalement consisté à les informer régulièrement
sur l’état d’avancement du projet, à charger l’Union Technique des Mutualités de la formation
d’une trentaine mutuelle, et à associer la Direction du Matériel et des Finances aux procédures de
passation des marchés les plus importants. La collaboration avec ses services déconcentrés au
niveau régional et local a été beaucoup opérationnelle, en raison de l’orientation du projet vers
l’impulsion de dynamiques locales. Une véritable dynamique partenariale a été également
développée avec plusieurs projets de développement local, notamment le Projet d’Appui au
Développement Communautaire (PADEC) financé grâce à la BAD, et le Projet de Compétitivité
et de Diversification Agricole (PCDA), financé grâce à la Banque Mondiale, et l’ADERE-Nord
financé grâce à l’Union Européenne. La cellule du CSCRP a été associée à toutes les sessions du
CNP du projet et enrichie par ses données/informations.

II.      CONCEPTION, EXECUTION, REALISATION ET IMPACT DU PROJET

2.1    CONCEPTION DU PROJET

       2.1.1 La philosophie d’intervention

La philosophie d’intervention du PACR repose sur cinq (5) piliers :
        -      le principe de la participation des bénéficiaires à toutes les actions qui le
               concernent ;
        -      la recherche d’une véritable auto – promotion des bénéficiaires ;
        -      l’impulsion d’une dynamique partenariale entre les différentes catégories
               d’acteurs du développement local ;
        -      le renforcement des capacités des bénéficiaires et de leurs partenaires, en vue
               d’un véritable changement de comportement et d’une pérennisation des
               différentes actions ;
        -      la consolidation des acquis et la capitalisation des expériences des projets de
               développement ayant opéré dans ses zones d’intervention.

      2.1.2   Le schéma d’intervention

Le dispositif opérationnel du PACR a été façonné pour atténuer simultanément la plupart des
effets des contraintes endogènes au développement socio-économique local, avec : Un Bureau
Central de Gestion du projet (BCG/PACR) basé au niveau central et une antenne au niveau
chacune de ses 4 régions d’intervention,; Un Groupement d’ONGs dénommé Opérateur de
Développement Communautaire (ODC) basé au niveau de chaque chef lieu de Région, pour
affecter à chacune des communes des Agents de Développement Communautaire (ADC) ; Un
Bureau ou Groupement de Bureau d’études dénommé Bureau d’Analyse (BA) ; Des
réseaux de prestataires privés appuyés par les services techniques ; L’ANICT pour canaliser
les fonds en direction des conseils communaux et la BNDA en direction des groupements de
producteurs et des promoteurs de micro-entreprises.



                                                57
Les modes opératoires

Pour atteindre les objectifs du projet, il a été assigné à chacun des acteurs du schéma
d’intervention une mission permettant de surmonter au moins une des 5 catégories de contraintes
auxquelles les initiatives de développement local sont généralement confrontées, à savoir :
        -        les faiblesses de capacités des bénéficiaires
        -        l’exiguïté des marchés locaux
        -        les difficultés d’accès au foncier
        -        les difficultés d’accès au financement
        -        les difficultés d’accès des services sociaux de base.

  2.2       EXECUTION –REALISATION DU PROJET

  2.2.1 COMPOSANTE A –Renforcement des Capacités – Responsabilisation et
  Participation Gouvernance locale
Cette composante a pour objectif d’aider les acteurs de la décentralisation, notamment les
communautés villageoises et les organisations socioprofessionnelles à la base à : (i) participer
plus activement à la planification et à la mise en œuvre du développement local et communal, (ii)
être mieux et plus responsabilisées dans la maîtrise et la gestion d’investissements collectifs et
productifs.

Pour atteindre ces objectifs, ses apports devaient être suscités à travers 3 sous- composantes, à
savoir :
         - l’information, l’animation et l’accompagnement des communautés, leurs OCB/OSP
            et conseils communaux
         - la formation des acteurs du développement local à travers des réflexions et débats
            inter-acteurs, ainsi que la préparation de modules pour des formations destinées aux
            organes de gestion des investissements aussi bien socio-collectifs que productifs
         - la professionnalisation de l’environnement de services et de l’offre de formation
            grâce notamment à l’exécution de modules spécifiques destinés au renforcement des
            capacités des prestataires de services et de formation, et des services techniques
            déconcentrés.

A la date du 30/11/2013, l’état d’avancement et les résultats d’exécution de chacune de ces sous-
composantes pouvait se résumer comme suit :

2.2.1.1          Information, animation et accompagnement
          De l’information et de l’animation

Les activités d’information et d’animation ont été essentiellement conduites par les Agents de
Développement Communautaires (ADC) à travers des approches d’IEC et d’appui-conseil.
Comme il ressort des tableaux en Annexe A, malgré les effets d’un exode rural de plus en plus
massif, des conditions de terrain extrêmement difficiles, et de l’augmentation des prix entrainée
par les crises alimentaires, énergétiques et financières, les actions entreprises par les ADC ont
permis de toucher à travers 75 065 séances environ 477 852 personnes dont 50,29% de femmes
contre 350 000 programmées soit un taux de réalisation de 136,52%.

De l’accompagnement des bénéficiaires



                                               58
L’accompagnement des bénéficiaires a été principalement conduit par les ADC, en appliquant des
démarches d’appui-conseil et d’assistance technique aux bénéficiaires directs, c'est-à-dire les
OCB/OSP et les conseils communaux. Sa modalité de mise en œuvre a essentiellement consisté à
organiser des séances d’informations et d’échanges à travers lesquelles les ADC ont tenu avec
les populations, les groupements et les conseils communaux 97 032 rencontres de mobilisation,
d’organisation et de sensibilisation (SMOS) soit plus de 100 rencontres par ADC et par an.

2.2.1.2 Formation des acteurs du développement local

Conformément aux prescriptions de la mission d’évaluation du PACR :

      a) Une session de formation et de réflexion inter-acteurs a été préparée et animée par 2
         groupements de prestataires au niveau du chef-lieu de chacun des 18 cercles avec une
         participation moyenne de 25 responsables des autorités administratives et techniques des
         communes bénéficiaires, des organisations faitières, des groupements de producteurs et
         des organes de gestion des investissements socio-collectifs , comme il ressort du tableau
         n°5 ci-dessous.

      b) Des sessions de formation au profit d’au moins 2 responsables des 54 conseils
         communaux ont été organisées en cohérence avec la stratégie nationale de formation en
         décentralisation, en les conduisant en 2 étapes ayant couvert chacune les thèmes :
         1)      de la planification du développement local
         2)      de la maîtrise d’ouvrage et la passation des marchés
         3)      du rôle des acteurs de la décentralisation
         4)      de la mobilisation des ressources.

2.2.1.3 Professionnalisation de l’environnement de service et de l’offre de formation

Des formations des organes de gestion des investissements financés ont été organisées selon une
visée de professionnalisation de l’environnement de service et de l’offre de formation, en
renforçant les capacités de l’ensemble des prestataires de services qui interviennent en appui aux
communautés rurales et aux organisations professionnelles à travers 5 catégories d’actions bien
distinctes :
     1) des activités de renforcement des capacités des services techniques et prestataires
         d’appui-conseil
     2) des concertations régulières entre prestataires de formation
     3) l’élaboration et la diffusion de supports didactiques
     4) des initiatives visant à créer des centres ressources


                                                         59

2.2.2 COMPOSANTE B – Investissements d’Initiatives Communales

      a) Aspects saillants du processus d’exécution

La charge d’exécution de cette composante a été confiée à l’ANICT à travers un accord de projet
avec l’IDA, et un accord subsidiaire avec le Ministère de l’Economie et des Finances du Mali.

      b) Bilan quantitatif

Conformément au programme d’exécution de la composante, le projet n’a financé des
investissements qu’au titre de 4 années d’exécution (2006-2007/2008-2009-2010) pour un coût
total de 5.231.763.053 FCFA, dont la répartition régionale figure sur le tableau n°3 ci-dessous.

En terme de nombre, ce sont 515 conventions qui avaient été signées, ce nombre ayant été réduit
par la suite à 501 à cause :
- de l’annulation de 8 conventions de la dotation de 2006 en raison de   défaillances dans les
procédures de passation des marchés
- du traitement en 2 conventions intercommunales seulement, des droits de tirage 2006 de 6
         communes de la Région de Sikasso
- l’annulation d’une convention relative à l’acquisition d’équipements solaires du CSCOM de
Kassorola (dotation 2010), en raison du non paiement de la contribution de la commune.



                                                        60

date du 31/11/2013, seulement 3 de leurs infrastructures n’étaient pas fonctionnelles, il s’agit
de trois puits encore exploités en raison soit de l’existence d’une roche qui n’a pas permis
d’atteindre la nappe, soit à cause de phénomènes d’éboulement.

Conformément aux prescriptions de l’accord de crédit, un programme de formation a été conçu
par le BCG/PACR et financé par l’ANICT sur les droits d’appui technique respectifs, dans le but
de former les comités de gestion de ces sous-projets dans le domaine de la gestion
communautaire en mode décentralisé, et de façon spécifique dans ceux de la gestion des écoles,
des points d’eau, des centres de santé et des équipements marchands. Comme il ressort du tableau
ci-dessous, le nombre total de responsables de comités de gestion ayant participé à ce programme
s’est chiffré à 1.387 participants dont 18% de femmes.

2.2.3 COMPOSANTE C : Initiatives Productives des Communautés Locales

         a) Crédit initial

         Aspects saillants du processus d’exécution

Conformément à la stratégie d’intervention, ce sont les ADC qui ont incité les exploitants
individuels à se regrouper pour identifier et formuler les avant-projets. De la mise en vigueur du
projet en 2006 à sa revue à mi-parcours en 2010, les exploitants se sont principalement regroupés
en associations à but non lucratif et de surcroit plus orientées sur des modes de production à
caractère collectif. Compte tenu des limites de ce type d’organisation en matière d’initiatives
productives et de l’inefficacité des modes collectifs de production, les équipes du projet se sont
activement investies pour leur mutation en coopératives de nombre de membres adéquat (15 à 20
personnes), privilégiant plutôt des modes d’exploitation qui mutualisent uniquement les services
en responsabilisant chacun des membres pour sa production. Le pourcentage d’associations
bénéficiaires a progressivement diminué en passant de 70% en 2008 à 3% en 2012, de telle sorte
que la quasi-totalité des groupements évoluent actuellement sous la forme de coopérative de
service.

         b) Bilan quantitatif

A la date du 30/11/2013, l’objectif de 900 sous-projets était dépassé puisque 910 groupements
avaient bénéficié des financements de la composante à travers des conventions de financement
signées avec les antennes régionales qui leur confèrent pleinement la maîtrise d’ouvrage de leur
investissement. Du point de vue répartition régionale, le tableau n°8 révèle que la Région qui en a
le plus bénéficié est celle de Sikasso, avec 32,63% des sous-projets, suivie de celle de Mopti avec
28,24 %des sous-projets. Du point de vue niveau d’achèvement, le tableau n°8 indique qu’à la
date du 30/11/2013, les travaux d’infrastructure et les acquisitions d’équipements de 906 sous-
projets avaient été réceptionnés, soit un taux de réception de 99%.

     c) Renforcement des capacités

A l’instar des comités de gestion des sous-projets socio-collectif, les organes de gestion des sous-
projets productifs devaient être formés en Entreprenariat rural et en technique de production, à
travers l’accompagnement pendant au moins 6 mois de chacun des organes de gestion par un
prestataire de conseil technique et d’au moins 12 mois par un prestataire de conseil en gestion. Il
est apparu à l’exécution une quasi-inexistence de prestataires privés au niveau local pour fournir
ces appuis, de telle sorte que le projet a dû recourir à des agents des services publics locaux pour
accompagner 652 des 910 groupements bénéficiaires (71,64%) dont 108 en gestion par les
services locaux du Ministère de tutelle, et 454 en technique de production par ceux de
l’urbanisme, de l’hydraulique, de l’agriculture, de l’élevage, de la pêche, de l’artisanat etc.

    Le dépassement du nombre d’OCB/OSP ayant participé aux formations (929) par rapport au
    nombre total de bénéficiaires (910), a résulté du fait que plusieurs d’entre elles ont été associées
    aussi bien aux ateliers qu’aux visites d’échanges. Du point de vue répartition sectorielle, le
    tableau en annexe révèle que ces activités de renforcement de capacités techniques ont couvert
    tous les domaines d’intervention des OCB/OSP.

      2.2.3.2 Fonds Additionnel de la Composante C :
Les appuis du fonds additionnel ont été apportés à 585OCB/OSP bénéficiaires en appliquant les mêmes
principes et procédures que ceux du crédit initial.


                                                                   64
Comme il ressort du tableau en annexe, le projet est parvenu, en visant cet objectif, à signer des accords
subsidiaires de financement avec 455 de ses groupements bénéficiaires, soit un taux de réalisation significatif
de 77% en terme de nombre.

     2.2.4 Assistance sociale

     Les activités d’assistance sociale ayant fait l’objet d’une nouvelle Composante (E), de nouvelles
     procédures ont été conçues pour pouvoir financer de façon efficiente 742 comités de gestion de
     sous-projets socio-collectifs. En appliquant rigoureusement ces procédures, le projet est parvenu
     à signer 541 accords de micro-dons soit un taux de réalisation de 72%, dont les détails
     estimatifs figurent en annexe E.

     2.2.5 Composante D : Gestion, coordination du projet, Suivi-évaluation et partage
           de Connaissance

     Les aspects les plus déterminants de l’exécution de cette composante furent :
         - La mise en place du dispositif opérationnel et de gestion ;
         - La coordination des activités ;
         - La passation des marchés ;
         - La gestion financière.

     2.2.5.1       Le dispositif opérationnel et de gestion
     a)      Le BCG/PACR, les Antennes et ODC

     Les personnels du BCG/PACR et des Antennes ont été recrutés par des appels à la concurrence à
     travers lesquels il est apparu que les salaires proposés aux postulants n’étaient pas aussi incitatifs
     de telle sorte que plusieurs candidats classés premiers ont plutôt désisté. De plus des agents de
     profil d’agroéconomiste pour le poste d’assistant principal aux Chefs d’antenne n’ont toujours pas
     pu toujours être recrutés en raison de leur rareté sur le marché du travail. L’ensemble du dispositif
     opérationnel et de gestion a relativement fonctionné malgré :
         - une surcharge excessive d’activités de gestion qui n’a pas permis d’être plus présent sur
              le terrain et plus pro-actif en matière de communication, de suivi-évaluation et de
              programmation des formations
         - le départ de 3 des 4 Directeurs pour des projets offrant de meilleures conditions de travail
         - les changements intervenus au niveau de tous les chefs d’antenne régionale pour diverses
              raisons.

         c) Le Comité National de Pilotage

     Par son Décret N° 504-PM du 14/11/2005, le Premier Ministre a fixé le cadre institutionnel et
     organisationnel du projet, en instituant un CNP comme l’organe d’orientation et de suivi de la
     mise en œuvre du projet et des organes similaires pour le niveau régional (CRSC) et pour le
     niveau cercle (CLSC). Avant la crise de 2012, le comité national de pilotage s’est réuni 2 fois par
     an comme prévu, et 1 fois en session extraordinaire. A travers ses sessions, il a relativement bien
     joué son rôle, en analysant de façon critique les projets de rapports d’activités, de budgets, des
     plans opérationnels et des aide-mémoires, des missions de supervision de la Banque mondiale et
     en formulant des recommandations pertinentes qui ont toutes été appliquées. Ces
     recommandations se sont révélées d’autant plus pertinentes qu’il a régulièrement associé à ses
     travaux des représentants du CSCRP, de l’ODHD et des projets de développement similaires,
     notamment de l’ADERE Nord, du PASAOP et du PCDA, le PAPAM et le FODESA.


                                                      65
2.2.5.2 La Coordination et la Complémentarité des activités

Au niveau central, la coordination des activités a été bien assurée par le BCGP dans une logique
de recherche permanente d’identification des dysfonctionnements et de propositions de mesures
susceptibles de corriger les faiblesses constatées.
Au niveau Régional, les antennes ont globalement joué leur rôle bien qu’elles ne soient pas
parvenues à appuyer de façon constante des activités de terrain en raison des surcharges de travail.
Elles ont pu par ailleurs établir des relations bien suivies avec les autorités administratives, les
services techniques, les organisations faitières et surtout avec les Antennes Régionales de
l’ANICT et les coordinateurs des ODC.
Au plan de la complémentarité et de la mise en synergie, d’importants acquis ont été enregistrés à
tous les niveaux, à travers :
    - des concertations quasi-permanentes avec les projets de développement similaires tels
         que le PCDA, le FODESA, le PADEC, le PASAOP, le PNIR, l’ADERE Nord, Lux-
         Développement, le projet des villages du millénaire PRODEVALAIT, FODESA, PAISA,
         etc.

    -   l’implication des Directions Nationales les plus concernées (Agriculture, élevage, pêche,
        production et Industrie animales, Développement social et Economie solidaire) dans la
        conduite d’activités essentielles telles que l’élaboration des modules, l’organisation des
        visites d’échanges et de découverte d’innovations technologiques, de partage sur les
        bilans annuels.

2.2.5.3 La Gestion Financière

Selon l’accord du crédit initial du PACR, les fonds doivent être retirés du compte du crédit tenu à
l’IDA au moyen des demandes de retrait de fonds, pour les composantes A, C, D et E, et de RSF
pour la composante B. A cet effet, 4 comptes ont été ouverts dans les livres de la BDM-SA
conformément aux procédures prescrites, et des comptes subsidiaires dans les livres de la BNDA-
SA pour mettre à la disposition des OCB/OSP bénéficiaires, les fonds nécessaires aux paiements
de leurs prestataires et à l’acquisition de leurs intrants. Ces comptes ont été annuellement audités
sans réserve par des cabinets d’experts indépendants, et le projet est en outre parvenu à contenir
les tensions de trésorerie ayant résulté de la suspension de la coopération entre le Mali et la
Banque mondiale suite aux crises.

2.2.5.4 La Passation des marchés

Au niveau central, plus de 200 marchés ont été conclus, dont 52 de plus de 50 millions FCFA
chacun. En application des recommandations de leurs revues par les missions de l’IDA, du
Contrôle Général des Marchés Publics et des audits annuels, plusieurs mesures ont été prises pour
améliorer les procédures de leur passation, notamment :
-      la formation de tous les agents du BCGP impliqués dans ces procédures
-      la non implication des responsables chargés de la gestion financière
-      un meilleur suivi de la planification des marchés et de leur archivage
-      la gestion des achats courants dans le cadre de marchés à clientèle.

Au niveau local, chacun des 1.412 bénéficiaires directs a conclu en moyenne 2 marchés pour
recruter ses prestataires d’études et de contrôle, de formation, de travaux et d’acquisition



                                                66
d’équipement et de matériels. Leurs procédures ont été revues par des missions d’audit interne et
externe dont les constats et recommandations ont conduit à :
-       former en passation des marchés 162 responsables des 54 conseils communaux et 136
        agents du projet, dont 124 des ODC, 8 des antennes régionales et 4 du BCG/PACR
-       relever de leurs fonctions pour des raisons de moralité, un Chef d’Antenne régional, un
        Assistant Principal, ainsi que des agents d’ODC dont un Coordinateur et plusieurs
        superviseurs et animateurs de terrain.
La conjonction de ces différentes mesures a fortement contribué à améliorer la qualité de la
passation des marchés à telle enseigne que ses risques ont été jugés modérés par les 2 missions de
supervision de l’année 2012 de la Banque.

2.2.5.5 La Supervision et le Suivi-évaluation

                La Supervision

La Banque mondiale a effectué une dizaine de missions de supervision dont les recommandations
furent pertinentes et globalement appliquées. Le Bureau Central de Gestion a conduit des
missions de terrain à un rythme minimum d’une mission de terrain par trimestre pour mener des
plaidoyers sur la vision et les stratégies du projet, identifier les faiblesses de parcours et
préconiser des mesures correctives conséquentes. Les antennes régionales ont combiné leurs
missions de supervisions avec celles visant à signer des conventions, à pré-évaluer des sous-
projets et à résoudre des problèmes ponctuels auxquels certains d’entre-deux étaient confrontés.
A la quasi-totalité des missions du BCG/PACR et des antennes, ont été associés les coordinateurs
des ODC, les représentants des Bureaux d’analyse et des Services techniques déconcentrés du
Ministère de Tutelle.

        Le Suivi-évaluation

Le système de suivi-évaluation est resté opérationnel pendant toute la durée d’exécution du projet,
avec une base de donnée informatisée aussi bien au niveau central, qu’au niveau de chaque
antenne régionale et une remontée des informations par voie électronique. Ce système a donné
globalement satisfaction aux besoins de pilotage du projet et d’information de ses partenaires.

2.2.6 Gestion d’impact environnemental et social
En exécution du Plan Cadre de Gestion Environnementale et Sociale (PCGES) et du Plan de
Gestion des Pestes et Pesticides (PGPP), les OCB ont été sensibilisées sur les enjeux et défis
environnementaux, et plusieurs d’entre elles ont été appuyées par :
       1) des dotations en mini-incinérateurs, des cahiers de suivi des nappes, des foyers
            améliorés, de petites pharmacies, des appuis pour le reboisement, et des latrines
       2) la réalisation de trois sessions de formation dont l’une sur l’hygiène alimentaire et
            les deux autres sur les pestes et pesticides.

2.2.7 Impact du projet dans la mise en œuvre de la politique nationale sur la
        protection sociale
Grâce au fonds additionnel, le projet a renforcé les capacités de 28 mutuelles de santé à travers :
    -    des contributions à leurs fonds de roulement et roulants, pour un montant moyen de 3000
        000fcfa par mutuelle
    - des activités de formation d’un coût total d’environ 63 millions qui ont regroupé deux
        cent quarante quatre (244) personnes de leurs Conseils d’Administration et Commissions
        de Contrôles), ainsi que des agents des services techniques du Ministère de tutelle


                                                67
    -   des appuis en équipements et en moyens logistiques pour un montant total de 53 678 000
        FCFA.

De plus, le projet a financé les actions et les processus de reconnaissance officielle des mutuelles
de 2 localités de Mopti (Dimbal et Bankass) qui ont été menées par les services locaux chargés du
développement social.

III. IMPACT DU PROJET
Le projet a généré de multiples impacts positifs dont les plus significatifs ont été soulignés par un
Bureau d’études indépendant comme suit :

Au niveau des populations : Selon l’étude, le PACR a contribué à améliorer les conditions
d’accès aux services sociaux de base des communautés villageoises dans ses zones d’intervention.
Ainsi les taux bruts de scolarisation se sont nettement améliorés (en moyenne 81,3 % dans les
écoles appuyées par les PACR contre 62-79% en moyenne dans les régions d’intervention du
projet) ; de même que les taux de fréquentation des centres de santé communautaires, des
consultations prénatales et des accouchements assistés nettement plus élevés au niveau des
centres appuyés par le PACR comparés aux moyennes régionales. Enfin le taux de couverture des
besoins en eau de boisson des populations ayant bénéficié de l’appui du projet en matière
d’hydraulique est de 60% contre 40% qui s’approvisionnent à partir de points d’eau traditionnels.

Pour les populations bénéficiaires des sous projets productifs, au moins deux tiers des
organisations socioprofessionnelles ont diversifié les sources de financement en accédant à
d’autres guichets de crédit. Par ailleurs ces organisations ont créé plus de 77 000 emplois dont
38 400 emplois féminins. Il s’agit essentiellement d’auto-emplois et dans une moindre mesure
d’emplois salariés temporaires et d’emplois salariés permanents. Le projet a particulièrement
contribué à l’autonomisation des femmes, (1) en allégeant leurs tâches grâce à leur accès aux
équipements, les équipements de transformation agro-alimentaire en particulier, et (2) en
augmentant considérablement leurs revenus et par conséquent leur participation aux dépenses de
la famille. En fait une forte proportion des projets productifs financés par le PACR (environ 40%)
a été destinée aux femmes dont les OSP constituent la grande majorité (plus de 80%) de celles qui
ont réussi dans certaines régions. Le projet a contribué à l’introduction d’innovations techniques
et technologiques majeures en matière d’élevage laitier, d’aviculture, d’embouche, de
régénération des bourgoutières, de conditionnement des poissons, de transformation des produits
agroalimentaire, de production de fumure organique et de la menuiserie. L’adoption de ces
techniques et technologies a permis une augmentation régulière des revenus tirés des sous projets
productifs, en particulier pour les sous projets d’élevage, puis de l’agriculture. Les résultats les
plus faibles ont été enregistrés au niveau des sous projets de transformation et d’artisanat. Les
revenus tirés des sous projets productifs sont surtout utilisés pour l’alimentation de la famille,
l’achat d’intrants et d’équipements et la prise en charge de la scolarité des enfants. Par ailleurs le
projet a permis une large diversification des activités de production en particulier dans les
domaines de l’élevage et de l’agriculture et une intensification des productions agricoles avec le
doublement des rendements de certaines cultures, riz et sésame notamment.

Au niveau de la gouvernance, l’approche PACR est basée sur la participation des acteurs à la
base, à travers les organes de gestion des sous projets et la maîtrise d’ouvrage des collectivités
territoriales. A travers les activités de renforcement des capacités des acteurs, l’accompagnement
et le suivi des ADC, les résultats de l’étude montrent:




                                                 68
-   une amélioration de l’exercice de la maitrise d’ouvrage communale par le nombre accru de
    sous projets financés (de 197 en 2007/2008 à 502 en fin 2012) et une meilleure qualité des
    ouvrages comparée à la qualité des ouvrages réalisés par d’autres partenaires ; toutefois des
    insuffisances demeurent comme la proportion relativement élevée des ouvrages de mauvaises
    qualité (évaluée à 28% en 2010) et par conséquent des charges de réparation ou d’entretien
    en perspective ;
-   la prise en charge de la gestion des ouvrages collectifs par les communautés à travers des
    conventions d’assistance mutuelle entre la CT et le comité de gestion de l’infrastructure ;
    l’application de conventions est jugée satisfaisante dans plus de trois quart des communes ;
    l’entretien des infrastructures est effectif malgré des faiblesses constatées notamment sur leur
    qualité ;
-   la fonctionnalité des organes de gestion des sous projets, malgré des insuffisances marquées
    par une chute des taux de recouvrement des recettes prévues, la non application des textes
    statutaires en particulier le renouvellement des instances, la régularité des réunions
    statutaires, le paiement des cotisations et les sanctions à infliger aux contrevenants;
-    la fonctionnalité des organes de gestion des sous projets productifs s’est aussi améliorée à
    travers l’accroissement du nombre OSP qui disposent de suffisamment de ressources pour
    faire face à leur fonctionnement, leur expérience d’utilisation des services des banques et des
    institutions de Micro-Finance, en particulier pour les OSP évoluant dans les domaines de la
    transformation et de l’artisanat

Au niveau des organes d’exécution, le projet a intégré le renforcement des capacités des
prestataires de services pour une amélioration ou un renforcement de leur propre capacité. A ce
titre 126 ADC/ODC, 64 agents des services publics et 255 prestataires privés ont bénéficié de
formations techniques, de visites d’échange et d’appuis conseil en aviculture et insémination
artificielle, marketing et techniques de production, hygiène alimentaire et contrôle de qualité des
aliments, gestion des pestes et pesticides, calcul des coûts et analyse financière des sous projets
productifs, gestion spécifique des infrastructures, Gestion des contrats, entrepreneuriat rural et
artisanat, etc. Les résultats de l’étude indiquent une amélioration de leurs prestations, en
particulier dans les domaines de la mobilisation sociale, de l’appui conseil et de la formation
technique des acteurs à la base. Les prestataires privés et publics ont particulièrement apprécié
l’impact des formations sur leur performance dans les domaines de l’aviculture, l’insémination
artificielle, les techniques de production agricole, le calcul des coûts et l’analyse financière des
sous projets productifs, la Gestion des contrats et l’entrepreneuriat rural et l’artisanat. Les
compétences et capacités du personnel du PACR ont été renforcées dans les domaines du
développement Décentralisé et Participatif (DDP) ; de la passation de marchés et de maitrise de
divers logiciel de gestion, de suivi-évaluation, etc. Ces formations ont contribué à améliorer
sensiblement le niveau de performance des agents.

Au niveau du Ministère de tutelle : les capacités des services déconcentrés du Ministère chargé
du développement social ont été renforcées à travers des formations et/ou ateliers dans les
domaines de l’entreprenariat et de l’hygiène alimentaire, la gestion et le marketing, le processus
de mise en place des mutuelles de santé etc. Dans l’ensemble le PACR a particulièrement
contribué à la mise en œuvre du volet lutte contre la pauvreté du Programme développement
Social et Sanitaire par la mise à disposition d’infrastructures socio-collectives au niveau des
communes et des communautés, le financement de sous projets productifs et générateurs de
revenus, l’extension des mutuelles de santé et l’appui technique, financier et matériel des organes
de gestion de ces infrastructures.

En matière environnementale, les données recueillies au cours la présente évaluation attestent
d’un niveau satisfaisant d’application du plan cadre de gestion environnementale ; il ressort que


                                                69
les bonnes pratiques environnementales au niveau de l’assainissement, de la gestion des déchets
(solides et liquide) de la gestion des ressources naturelles et de la sécurité au travail ont été
appliquées et adoptées largement par les bénéficiaires. Cela est imputable aux différentes
formations dispensées par le programme.

Sur la pertinence de la stratégie et du dispositif d’intervention, l’étude confirme l’adéquation
entre les objectifs du projet et les approches et moyens mis en œuvre pour les atteindre. La
pertinence de l’approche basée sur le développement décentralisé et participatif des communautés
à la base, l’exercice de la maitrise d’ouvrage par les communes dans le contexte de la
décentralisation et le suivi - accompagnement rapproché des porteurs de sous-projets par des
agents de développement communautaire, des prestataires privés ou des agents de l’Etat
contractualisés est avérée. De même la tutelle du projet assurée par le ministère chargé du
développement social, tandis que la coordination, la supervision et le suivi de sa mise en œuvre
réalisés par un comité national et des comités régionaux et locaux contribuent autant à sa réussite
et à multiplier ses effets et impacts comme l’atteste l’évaluation des indicateurs de performance et
des résultats intermédiaires qui sont bons dans l’ensemble.

En conclusion l’évaluation des interventions du projet a permis d’établir qu’il a introduit des
changements appréciables au niveau des principaux acteurs du développement à la base à travers
l’amélioration de:
        - l’accès aux services sociaux de base des communautés rurales dont les capacités de
            gestion des investissements socio-collectifs mis à leur disposition se sont aussi
            renforcées;
        - des niveaux de revenus des producteurs ruraux et surtout des femmes productrices
            devenues plus autonomes ;
        - des capacités de maitrise d’ouvrage des autorités communales ;
        - des performances des prestataires privés et publics et des ONG intervenant dans leur
            appui conseil et la formation techniques des communautés à la base.

Par ailleurs des mesures de sauvegarde environnementale et de protection sociale ont été mises en
œuvre au niveau des unités de production.
 Cependant d’importants défis demeurent pour la consolidation des acquis et la pérennisation des
 réalisations. Ainsi à la fin du projet :
         - quelques investissements socio-collectifs ne sont pas achevés ou ne sont pas
             exploités ;
         - des organes de gestion ont besoins de suivi-accompagnement dans le processus de
             leur autonomisation, l’amélioration de leur fonctionnalité et la gestion durable des
             infrastructures socio-collectives et des équipements productifs;
         - la nécessité d’une structuration des OCB/OSP en unions ou fédérations pour une
             dynamique de renforcement de leurs capacités n’est pas effective,
         - la nécessité de leur mise en relations avec les partenaires techniques (prestataires,
             fournisseurs, appui conseil) d’une part et avec d’autres organisations
             socioprofessionnelles d’autre part est quasi inexistante ou faible pour un soutien
             durable à la promotion de leurs activités;
         - les services d’appui conseils de proximité, de l’Etat ou les privés ont presque partout
             des capacités d’intervention limitées ou sont faiblement représentés au niveau local.

    Aussi l’étude recommande:
    - d’appuyer la structuration, l’organisation et l’implantation locale ou régionale de services
       de ressources pour les appuis communautaires aux microprojets productifs et socio-
       collectifs ;


                                                70
     -   de poursuivre le renforcement des capacités opérationnelles des services techniques pour
         le suivi, la supervision et l’appui conseil des sous projets communautaires ;
     -   d’envisager la synergie avec les programmes et projets qui sont en perspective (PAPAM,
         développement accéléré du Nord, etc.) pour la prise en charge des besoins de
         consolidation et de pérennisation des sous projets appuyés par le PACR;
     -   d’étendre les interventions du projet à d’autres communautés et Communes en cas de
         nouvelle phase ;
     -   de mettre en place un dispositif de suivi post projet qui œuvrera à encourager et appuyer
         les bénéficiaires dans l’entretien de leurs dispositifs.

V.       LES FACTEURS LIMITANTS

L’exécution du projet a été confrontée à de multiples contraintes dont les plus importantes furent :
       - une quasi-inexistence d’organismes privés d’appui-conseil au niveau local et des
           faiblesses de capacités de ceux qui sont basés au niveau régional
       - des faiblesses de capacités de toutes les catégories d’acteurs (organes des
           collectivités, des OCB/OSP et services techniques déconcentrés, toutes les catégories
           de prestataires
       - un fort taux d’analphabétisme de la plupart des membres des OCB/OSP qui a suscité
           l’introduction d’un important programme d’alphabétisation initiale.
       - une surcharge de travail pour les agents de développement communautaire (ADC)
       - une démarche d’exécution des modules de maîtrise d’investissement qui ne va pas

CONCLUSION GENERALE

Malgré l’éventail des facteurs limitants, le PACR a atteint la totalité de ses objectifs. Comme il
ressort du tableau d’évaluation de ses indicateurs de résultats intermédiaires en annexe, sa
performance a été en effet bonne dans l’ensemble et même très bonne en ce qui concerne le
nombre de bénéficiaires directs du projet (136%) et le pourcentage de projets productifs ayant
généré un revenu annuel moyen par membre supérieur au seuil journalier de pauvreté (63% sur
une prévision de 50%). S’agissant de l’amélioration des services sociaux, ce sont 87% des
villages appuyés par le Projet qui ont eu un accès adéquat aux services sociaux de base contre une
prévision de 80%.
La tangibilité de ces résultats est due à :
     - la pertinence des objectifs, des approches, méthodologies et schéma d’intervention
     - l’adéquation des stratégies de sensibilisation, de mobilisation et d’organisation sociale
     - l’adéquation du suivi et des orientations du Ministère de tutelle.
     - la pertinence des recommandations des missions de supervision et de revue de l’IDA
     - la capacité de l’équipe du projet en matière de recherche action, de suivi, d’orientation,
         de coordination et d’impulsion d’une véritable dynamique partenariale
     - l’engagement de tous les acteurs, notamment des autorités administratives et techniques,
         des élus et des bénéficiaires directs à la base.
C’est en raison de ces performances que tous les conseils régionaux et la quasi-totalité de ses
autres bénéficiaires directs et indirects ont formulé le vœu qu’il poursuive ses activités en
consolidant les acquis et en les étendant à d’autres communes.
