        Re:
State Highway Management II Project (Loan No. 3715-BR)
 
Dear Mr. Cabral:
Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated March 25, 1994 between the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the State of 
Maranhao for the above project.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees with the proposed 
restructuring of the project, which the recent Bank mission in Sao Luis discussed with 
you and Vice Governor Jose Reinaldo Tavares, including:
.
increases of disbursement percentages for civil works from 50% to 75% and 
for 
consultants' services and training from 50% to 100% of local 
expenditures; and
.
reduction of the road upgrading and paving, targets from 750 km to 605 
km, and 
modification of the annual implementation targets.
 
As a consequence of this restructuring and of the lower-than-expected bid 
prices, an amount of US$l8 million equivalent of the loan will not be required to 
finance project costs. Therefore, pursuant to Section 6.03 (b) of the General 
Conditions, the amount of US$18 million equivalent from the loan is hereby canceled as 
of the date of this letter, and the commitment charges on such amount cease to accrue 
from the date of this letter.
Therefore, we propose to amend the table set forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1, 
Part C of Schedule 2, and the table set forth in Part A of Schedule 6 to the Loan 
Agreement as shown on the attachment.  Schedule 3, the Amortization Schedule, is being 
revised by the Bank as a result of
the cancellation, and the revised figures will be sent to you shortly.
If you agree with the foregoing, please sign one of the two originals of this 
letter in the space provided below, and return it to us.  This amendment shall enter 
into effect on the date of receipt by the Bank of one original of this letter signed 
by the Borrower's authorized representative.
Sincerely,
Gobind T. Nankani
Director Department I
Latin America and the Caribbean Region
