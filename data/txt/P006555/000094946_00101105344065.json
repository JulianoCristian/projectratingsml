achieved.\n            Project sustainability is rated likely overall. However,\n            while it is likely in Tocantis and Piaui, it is uncertain in\n            Maranhao. World Bank performance was satisfactory on the\n            whole, albeit with some shortcomings in supervision.\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory overall. Lessons\n            learned were the following: Implementation of an optimized\n            network rehabilitation and maintenance strategy can\n            effectively bring an entire road network back into\n            satisfactory condition over a period of a few years and at a\n            reasonable cost. For networks or portions of networks with\n            low traffic, surface conditions could be set lower. The\n            results of the technical assistance components depend more\n            on the technical experience and inter-personal skills of the\n            specialists assigned to the specific tasks than on the\n            experience records of the contracted consulting firms, which\n            are at times deficient in controlling the quality of their\n            services. Other concerns include creating a comprehensive\n            atlas and geographic information system, providing proactive\n            supervision and project restructuring as soon as critical\n            assumptions have changed, increasing the Bank's share\n            for civil works to improve the attractiveness of loans, and\n            grouping two or more similar sub-projects under one umbrella\n            although treating them as one project."}, "docdt": "2000-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
