                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project had achieved the original key performance indicators by the end of 2009. The electricity component has been implemented with the exception of the SCADA and
                         Telecommunication contract, which is still experiencing delays. The installation works and pre-commissioning are expected to be completed by December 31, 2011. The Borrower
                         requested the extension of closing date of the project from December 31, 2011 until April 30, 2012.
