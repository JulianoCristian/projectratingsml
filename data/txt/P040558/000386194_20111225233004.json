This paper seeks your approval to\n            extend the closing date for the project. With the exception\n            of the System Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and\n            telecommunication contract (the largest under the project),\n            all contracts under the electricity component of the project\n            are completed and have contributed to significant\n            improvement of the power transmission network quality\n            indicators. Project completion is behind the implementation\n            schedule, in particular, due to delays in the: (i)\n            implementation of the telecommunication system; (ii) delays\n            in installation of work stations and rectification of relay\n            protection equipment (REF panels) to remove manufacturing\n            defects; and (iii) substation systems installation and\n            testing . The extension is necessary to allow the completion\n            of the final system testing and the operational acceptance\n            under the SCADA and Telecommunication contract. The\n            remaining critical activities, prior to commencing the final\n            system testing, are the completion of installation works and\n            pre-commissioning currently scheduled for December 20, 2011."}, "docdt": "2011-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
