                         the transmission system have been reduced by 59 percent, non technical losses have been reduced to almost 0 percent, Moldelectrica’s technical losses have been reduced by
                         about 5.65 percent, and unserved energy has been significantly reduced. The heating investments have improved the availability, quality and efficiency of heating in selected social
                         buildings, such as schools, kindergartens, hospitals, clinics and orphanages, making heat and hot water available at comfortable temperatures throughout the year. About 1.2 million
                         inpatients, outpatients and medical personnel have benefited from the improved heating and hot water in hospitals and clinics, and about 27,000 teachers and students have
