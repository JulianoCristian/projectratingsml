                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project had achieved the original key performance indicators by the end of 2009. The electrical component has been implemented with the exception of the Telecommunication
                         and SCADA contract. The original heating component was completed, and the implementationof the Additional Financing project is in an advanced stage. All contracts are close to
                         the end. The savings of the credit, including additional financing are around US$ 1.4 million.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Economy and Commerce has decided to strengthen the monitoring of the Telecomunication and SCADA contract implementation so that the contract can be
                         completed by May 31, 2011. A new master plan for the implementation of this contract was agreed between Moldelectrica and the Contractor on July 19, 2010.

                         The Steering Committee established to supervise the implementation of the heating component has proposed to the Bank to use the project's savings to partially rehabilitate the
                         heating systems of three additional hospitals (the Center of Mother and Child Chisinau, and two hospitals in Soldanesti and Cimislia). The Bank has alreadyagreedto finance the
                         partial rehabilitation of the Center for Mother and Child, and is analysing the recent request relating to thehospitals from Soldanesti and Cimislia.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
