           risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance\n            was satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the difficulty\n            of introducing modern System Control and Data Acquisition\n            (SCADA)/telecommunications systems should not be\n            underestimated with respect to complexity and time required\n            for implementation. Adequate time should be allowed for\n            development of technical specifications. Project Preparation\n            Facility (PPF) for projects combining investments with\n            sector policy reforms is a critical instrument to provide\n            positive demonstration effects and contribute to increased\n            confidence in success and higher commitment by end\n            beneficiaries. If the institutional framework to ensure the\n            viability of heating investments in the household sector is\n            weak due to ambiguous and often contradictory legal basis of\n            home owner associations, it is better to focus on public\n            buildings, as the social benefits accrue to all. Proper\n            sequencing of policy dialogue and investments provides for\n            better sustainability. Carefully and diligently prioritized\n            investments contribute to positive unintended outcomes."}, "docdt": "2012-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
