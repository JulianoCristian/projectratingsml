                              IDA CREDIT NO. 3833-MD

1.     This Paper seeks your approval to extend the closing date for Moldova, Energy 2
Project, Credit No. 3833-MD, P040558 from December 31, 2011 until April 30, 2012.
2.       With the exception of the SCADA and Telecommunication contract (the largest
under the Project), all contracts under the Electricity component of the Project are
completed and have contributed to significant improvement of the power transmission
network quality indicators. Project completion is behind the implementation schedule, in
particular, due to delays in the: (i) implementation of the telecommunication system; (ii)
delays in installation of work stations and rectification of relay protection equipment (REF
panels) to remove manufacturing defects; and (iii) substation systems installation and
testing.
3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow the completion of the final system
testing and the operational acceptance under the SCADA and Telecommunication contract.
The remaining critical activities, prior to commencing the final system testing, are the
completion of installation works and pre-commissioning currently scheduled for December
20, 2011. The final system testing will thereby commence in January 2012 and will be
completed by April 30, 2012.
4.      The contract requires a minimum of twelve (12) weeks for final testing of the
system. If successful, the Beneficiary (State Enterprise Moldelectrica, the National Power
Transmission and Dispatch Operator) could then sign the Operational Acceptance
Certificate and release the final 5% payment (the retention fee) to the contractor. It is
estimated that the execution of final system testing and operational acceptance of facilities
would require four months, following successful completion of installation works and pre-
commissioning of the system.
5.      All contracts under the Heating Component of the Project are expected to be
finalized by December 15, 2011.
6.      The project monitoring indicators have not changed and the project development
objectives are likely to be achieved with the proposed extension of the closing date.
7.     The project meets the Bank’s minimum requirements on financial management and
complies with legal provisions to this effect. Audit reports were submitted in due time and
found acceptable by the Bank. There are no overdue audits.
8.     The project team is satisfied with the revised detailed Master Time Schedule and
Action Plan of the Beneficiary (State Enterprise Moldelectrica, National Power
Transmission and Dispatch Operator - ME) for the successful completion of the project.
The project team will closely monitor the progress to ensure that the established time
schedule milestones will be met by the end of the extension period. Actions taken by the


                                             1
project team are duly reflected in the missions’ AMs and Management letters.




                                     2
9.      This will be the third (3rd) extension of the project and no more extensions will be
sought. The original closing date was April 30, 2008. The first extension to December 31,
2009 (18 months) was approved on October 8, 2007 to allow the completion of the
SCADA/EMS/MMS contract. The second extension to December 31, 2011 (24 months –
the current closing date) was approved on October 13, 2009 to allow the implementation of
the Additional Financing for the Heating Component (Credit No. 4541).
