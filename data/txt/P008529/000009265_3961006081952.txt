LATVIA
ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Republic of Latvia
Executing Agency:  Ministry of Finance (MOF)
Beneficiaries:    The Government of Latvia, Bank of Latvia, Latvian Privatization Agency, private
enterprises, and participating commercial banks
Amount:           Two loans, in the following amounts, aggregating about US$35 million equivalent:
(a) US$20 million equivalent
(b) US$10 million equivalent and DM8.5 million equivalent (about US$5.0
million)
Terms:            Two loans, each repayable over 17 years, including 5 years' grace:
(a) a US$20 million equivalent currency pool loan at the Bank's standard variable
rate;
(b) a single currency loan of two tranches: a US dollar tranche in an amount of
US$10 million equivalent at the Bank's standard US$ LIBOR-based rate; and a
deutsche mark tranche in an amount of DM8.5 million equivalent at the Bank's
standard DM LIBOR-based rate.
Onlending Tenrs:  From the Government to the financial intermediaries in Latvian lati, US dollars
and deutsche mark; from the financial intermediaries to individual borrowers in the
same currencies and maturities at freely determined interest margins. Depending
on the subproject requirements, the maturity for subloans granted to finance fixed
capital formation would vary from 1 to 12 years, with a maximum grace period
of 3 years. Associated permanent working capital subloans would be for a
maximum of 2 years, with a 6-month grace period.
Objective:        The principal objective of the project is to support the Government's reforms in
the enterprise and financial sectors, focussing, in particular, on enterprise
privatization and bank restructuring. An important aspect of the project is the
design and implementation of a coordinated strategy of reform for both sectors.
These reforms will pave the way for improved intermediation through the banking
sector.  The credit component of the loan will act as an incentive to the
development of intermediation at the medium- and long-term end of the maturity
spectrum.



_jj-
Description:        The project will have three components:  (i) a credit line component (US$29.6
million') that would provide resources for commercial banks to make medium- and
long-term loans to recently privatized and other private sector Latvian enterprises for
investment and related permanent working capital needs; this will be supplemented
by a US$10 million Capital Fund provided by the Government of Sweden that would
be dedicated to the capitalization of the banking sector; (ii) an institutional
development component (US$3.4 million) that would support the Latvian
Privatization Agency by financing, in part, an accelerated privatization track through
open auctions, and also support the development of a Project Management Unit and
a Technical Unit (for channeling the credit line component); (iii) a financial
infrastructure investment component (US$2 million) for computer hardware and
software for payments system development.
Project Benefits:    The project will assist the marshalling and efficient allocation of resources in Latvia
by enabling improved intermediation. The heavy emphasis in the project on the
restructuring of the banking system, coupled with the strengthening of the financial
infrastructure (through the upgrading of the payments system), will place the financial
system in a better position to support an enhanced level of activity in the real sector.
The project will also encourage new investment in the emerging enterprise sector
through the provision of medium- and long-term credit. By acting as a catalyst to the
privatization process, the project will improve the supply response in the economy and
quicken the transition to a market-based economic system. Undergirding all of the
loan components is a major effort to support the development of institutions--and the
associated skill transfers--that will be vital to the success of the transition. The choice
of single currency loan terms for a portion of the credit line will enable the onlending
of that currency which is best suited to the needs of the subborrowers without
requiring the government or the commercial banks to take the foreign exchange risk.
Project Risks:      The project is being developed against the backdrop of a fragile coalition government.
This increases the risk that project objectives could be undermined by a sudden change
in government. Another risk is the development of unacceptably high budgetary costs
associated with enterprise and financial restructuring that might act as a drag on the
reform process.  With regards to the channeling of the credit component, any
resurgence of inflation would curtail the trend towards lower nominal interest rates.
This could undermine the credit line by reducing the demand for credit by the private
sector. Similarly, there is some risk that the highly profitable trade transactions
(involving trading in Russian commodities and metals stimulated by Russian prices
below international levels), which have been financed at very high rates of interest,
will not run down quickly. This type of financing is dominating bank lending and
distorting the interest rate structure at present.  A  specific risk to the bank
restructuring effort is that a further deterioration in the economy will lead to a
significant future build-up in non-performing loans that would undermine the stability
of the banking system. The LIBOR basis of the single currency loan component may
create interest risk for those subborrowers whose revenues do not have the same
interest rate sensitivity: credit appraisals should take into account the capability of
subborrowers to manage this risk.
1.  This amount includes US$980,000 of unallocated funds under the currency pool loan that are expected to be deployed
in the credit line.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.1          The Republic of Latvia is one of the three newly-independent Baltic Republics. It shares
borders with Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus and Russia. Its territory covers 65,000 square kilometers and
has 2.6 million inhabitants. One third of the people live in the capital, Riga. Over 52% of the
population are of Latvian origin, with Russians accounting for 70% of the rest.
1.2          Latvia began to industrialize toward the end of the nineteenth century. In the rapid post
second world war industrialization, Latvia developed some of the most sophisticated industries in the
former Soviet Union and Baltics (FSUB), including machine building, chemicals, electronics, wood,
paper, food processing, and also light industries. The agricultural sector was also under intensive
production, and Latvia became an exporter of meat, dairy, and fish products to the rest of the FSUB.
The highly skilled labor force and general efficiency of the Latvian economy allowed it to enjoy one of
the highest living standards in the FSUB, with per capita income almost 30% greater than that of the
average for the FSUB.
1.3          Economic reform began before independence but the need for it became more acute
following independence in September 1991'. The first symptom of the economy's former economic
malaise was the emergence of a high rate of inflation which required strong measures to attain
stabilization. Moves to develop an open market economy in Latvia also revealed the structural
weaknesses in the prior system which would require a strong commitment to structural adjustment in the
economy.
B. Stabilization Program and Structural Reforms
1.4          Stabilization Program. In July 1992, the Government launched a one year stabilization
program supported by the IMF (SDR 54.9 million or 60% of quota). During the period of the Standby,
Latvia successfully implemented the policy measures under this program. It delinked its currency from
the Ruble zone and succeeded in reducing the rate of inflation from double digit monthly figures through
October 1992, to less than 0.5% a month in the third quarter of 1993. Contributing to this steady drop
was a tight monetary and fiscal policy, as well as supporting incomes policy measures which resulted in
a substantial decline in real wages. Inflation picked up slightly at the very end of 1993 reflecting an
increase in the rate of VAT, seasonal factors, and increases in pensions and public sector wages.
However, the inflation rate has subsided again during the first quarter of 1994.

1.5          The current account of the balance of payments has shown a strong performance recently,
allowing gross official reserves to rise from 1.5 months of imports at the end of 1992 to about 6 months
of imports to mid-1994. Economic activity, however, has remained depressed and unemployment has
been growing. Following a decline of 34% in 1992, real GDP is estimated to have declined by at least
10% in 1993 and the open unemployment rate more than doubled since end-1992 to about 6.0% of the
labor force by mid-1994.
1.6          Latvia has finalized a second Standby arrangement and two systemic transformation
facilities with the IMF for a 15 months period (October 1, 1993 to December 31, 1994). The Standby
amounts to SDR 22.9 million (equivalent to 25% of quota) and the two systemic transformation facilities
total SDR 45.7 million (equivalent to 50% of quota). The program supports a mix of stabilization and
structural reform policies. The objective of the stabilization program is to keep the monthly rate of
inflation below 0.5% through prudent monetary and fiscal policy measures. The objective of the
structural adjustment measures are to rationalize the trade regime, further liberalize prices, accelerate
privatization, restructure the banking system and the enterprise sector, improve the operations of the
social safety net system, and improve financial discipline in the economy.
1.7          Structural Reforms. The privatization process is well advanced in the agriculture
sector. By October 1993, the vast majority of agricultural land had been privatized and individual laws
governing privatization of agro-processing industries such as milk, meat, and grain had been passed.
Some small plants have already been privatized and the remaining small plants are expected to be
privatized in 1994. The process of land restitution and privatization has been divided into two phases:
the restoration of land user rights to former owners; and the restoration of ownership rights (including
the right to sell and to mortgage the property). Phase One of the reform has progressed quite rapidly and
close to one half of all arable land has been awarded to over 53,700 private farmers (average holding
16.7 hectares). However, progress has been slower for Phase Two of the reform which involves transfer
of ownership rights. The small-scale privatization program, which is implemented by the municipalities,
has also progressed well. By June 1994, 66% of small enterprises in the service and trade sectors had
been sold or leased with an option to buy.
1.8           There has been a significant delay in privatizing large enterprises in Latvia. This was
initially caused by the lack of important pieces of legislation such as the voucher and leasing laws, which
have now been approved. With the basic legislative framework in place, the main reason for the delay
has been the institutional procedure that required the intervention and involvement of several ministries
in privatization decisions, without a uniform approach. The case-by-case approach to large-scale
privatization proved to be extremely slow and failed to yield results even in the case of the pilot
privatization of 25 enterprises identified in 1992. The present government has already initiated actions
to streamline institutional mechanisms for privatization. An amended Privatization Law was enacted, for
instance, in March 1994 and a State Property Fund and Privatization Agency have been established.
1.9          Efforts at promoting private sector development have recently been accelerated. In mid-
1993 a business support center was opened in Riga, supported by EC PHARE, to train businessmen and
provide information on financing and marketing. A number of other centers are planned for other parts
of Latvia in the near future. The Government has also established the Latvian Development Agency as
a "one-stop-shop" for easy access to advisory services for foreign private investors on laws, regulations,
local business conditions, and investment opportunities in Latvia.



-3-
1.10         Similarly, progress in de-monopolization had stalled to a large extent. However, the law
on supervision of monopoly activities was amended in April 1993 and price and tariff boards have been
created to control natural monopolies, particularly in energy and telecommunications areas.
1.11         Financial sector reforms are--after a slow  start--now proceeding quite rapidly,
particularly in the sphere of bank restructuring. The privatization of the former commercial branches of
the Bank of Latvia--that had previously been the branches of the Soviet Specialized Banks-- is almost
completed. Of the 49 original branches, 19 have been amalgamated into the Universal Bank of Latvia
(Unibank) which will be privatized as one unit. The remaining branches have been sold to commercial
banks, transformed into small joint-stock companies or liquidated. Meanwhile, the Government has
decided to restructure and rehabilitate the Savings Bank (with a view to eventual privatization).
1.12         Progress has been made, with IMF and EC PHARE assistance, in establishing a
prudential regulation and supervision system for banks. The Banking Law has been amended and the
Bank of Latvia's supervisory capabilities--both on- and off-site--have been substantially expanded.
C. Project Background
1.13         The proposed project will support the Government of Latvia in implementing its
comprehensive program of structural reform aimed at establishing a market economy. The total amount
of the proposed loans is US$35 million, comprising a currency pool loan of US$20 million equivalent
and a single currency loan with tranches of US$10 million equivalent and DM8.5 million (about US$5
million) equivalent. The first Bank loan to Latvia, the Rehabilitation Loan (Ln 35250-LV), approved by
the Board on October 22, 1992, was to support importation of critically needed inputs. A second loan--
the Agricultural Development Project--was approved by the Board on January 6, 1993.
1.14         Enterprise and financial sector restructuring is at the heart of the Government's economic
strategy. Given the close linkages between the two sectors, a coordinated approach to reform is vital.
While the Government has a commitment to the restructuring of the enterprise and financial sectors, the
challenge it faces is significant. However, there is considerable international goodwill and tangible
support for Latvia's reform program. Against this background the World Bank was asked to assist in
coordinating the support for reform in both the enterprise and financial sectors. The proposed project
represents, therefore, the culmination of a significant technical assistance effort involving a wide range
of institutions and a multiplicity of funding sources.

II. ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ISSUES
A. Enterprise Sector Status
2.1           Enterprise Sector Structure. In 1992, the main components of GDP were agriculture
and forestry (24%), manufacturing (39%), construction (7%), energy sector (6%), and services (23%).
The existing structure of the enterprise sector results from forty years of economic development within
the confines of the FSUB. Raw materials, energy and labor were imported from other FSUB republics
and final products were sold within the FSUB and exported to other countries. Latvia's industrial
enterprises are typically large. Despite downsizing of employment in 1992 and 1993, enterprises have
an average of about 450 employees (a high average by international standards). The largest enterprises
are in light industry, machine building, electronics and chemicals.
2.2           Enterprises owned by the central government differ by size, profile of production and
legal organization. Enterprises that have been corporatized as joint-stock companies now account for
51% of total capacity in the enterprise sector (see table 2.1), with 32% remaining as "state-owned
enterprises." Limited liability companies comprise 6.7% of the total. A small number (less than 200)
were leased to management and employees with the option to buy the equity under the old Soviet law.

a/ In a state-owned enterprise the equivalent of equity is a basic fund which represents state investment in
the fixed capital of the enterprise.
2.3        Enterprise Sector Performance. Industrial enterprise sector output grew by 17% between
1985 and 1990, remained steady in 1991, and then declined by 36% in 1992. In 1993, the downward
trend continued with production decreasing by 38% as compared to the previous year. During the first
four months of 1994, the value of total industrial production (figures cover 23 industrial branches) was
87% of the corresponding period in 1993. However, as shown in table 2.2 there were significant
disparities between the performance of different branches. Five branches--mining and quarrying; wood
and wood products; rubber and plastics; medical precision and optical instruments; watches and clocks--
are exhibiting growth in 1994. However, in 11 branches the value of production is continuing to
decrease. Some branches--notably paper and paper products--have suffered particularly severe production
declines.

2.4          Progress with Enterprise Reforms. Latvia began its reform in the enterprise sector
earlier than other republics of the FSUB but a number of factors have contributed to a slower-than-desired
pace of reform. One of these was the occurrence of a temporary improvement of both the terms of trade
and the financial condition of state enterprises in 1991. Due to the inherited structure of production and
trade, and to the earlier liberalization of prices in Latvia than in the FSUB generally, Latvian enterprises
enjoyed a temporary terms of trade advantage and, hence, better financial performance. This created a
false impression that the Latvian economy could operate more effectively simply by dropping the Soviet
system of central planning and price control. In consequence there was no urgency to introduce radical
reforms quickly. On the contrary, popular belief that the value of enterprises was high led to demands
for "proper" valuation of state companies prior to privatization and very careful, cross-checked



-6-
privatization procedures. By way of example, the privatization of six enterprises in late 1991 was
branded as a "give away" of national wealth and the department responsible for these transactions was
dissolved in November 1991 after only six months of operation. Since then the privatization of medium-
and large-scale enterprises has been at a virtual standstill. This adverse experience has had a lasting
impact on the pace of privatization.
2.5            A second impediment to faster enterprise reform  relates to the use of privatization
certificates in the privatization process. The privatization program is now putting heavy emphasis on the
use of such certificates. The proposed scheme, unlike in some other countries, is being required to solve
many problems simultaneously: for instance, (i) compensation for hardship of the past and the
discrimination of past political activities; (ii) the creation of demand for a very wide set of assets: shares
of privatized companies, agricultural and real estate land, apartments; (iii) the establishment of a new
system of capitalized pension funds; and (iv) the settlement of restitution claims. The Government
proposes to make privatization certificates fully tradeable.
2.6            A further reason for the delay in enterprise reform concerns the restitution policy adopted
by the Latvian Government. A very broad and generous plan of restitution of nationalized property to
former proprietors and their heirs was adopted. Restitution claims for nationalized enterprises could be
presented until June 1994 and compensated in kind or in the form of privatization certificates and/or
shares. In Latvia, unlike in the majority of countries in the region, foreigners and citizens without
permanent residency in Latvia are also eligible for restitution of property.

2.7           As a result--as shown in Table 2.3--progress in the privatization of enterprises is very
slow and, hence, a major impediment to the structural transformation of the economy. The slow pace
of privatization in the industrial enterprise sector is partly balanced by a brisker privatization of retail
trade and services (Table 2.4 ).

B. Issues in the Enterprise Sector
2.8           Under existing political circumstances there are no fundamental ideological or social
limitations on radical market reform, including the privatization of the majority of state enterprises. The
main issues now confronting the Government in the enterprise sector are set out below. The proposed
project will seek to address these issues.
2.9           Implementing  the New  Legal, Regulatory and  Institutional Framework  for
Privatization. During the past few months significant progress has been made in developing a regulatory
and legal framework for privatization which, it is hoped, will remove the obstacles constraining
privatization. Parliament has approved amendments to the Privatization Law (March 1994) that introduce
new privatization rules and procedures. The amended law simplifies the previously cumbersome
ownership structure for state enterprises and the inefficient privatization process. It will grant the right
to take the privatization initiative to a broad spectrum of agents: the administrative agencies, employees
and managers of state enterprises, and local and foreign investors. The list of enterprises to be privatized
will initially be reviewed by the Latvian Privatization Agency (LPA) and submitted to the Council of
Ministers for endorsement. Once approved, enterprises will be passed from the authority of the State
Property Fund (SPF) to the LPA for privatization.
2.10          The Law on the LPA and the Law on the SPF regulate the scope and financing of the
activity of both entities. The LPA has been established as the key governmental agent in the area of
privatization and will be vested with all the technical responsibilities for the evaluation, preparation and
enactment of privatization transactions. The LPA is set up as a joint stock company owned by the
Government and supervised through a Supervisory Board, headed ex officio by the State Minister of
Privatization. The SPF is the owner of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and will be responsible for
their corporatization and management prior to privatization, or permanently if the enterprises are to
remain state-owned. In the case of public utilities and enterprises important to the public interest, the
SPF can initiate and supervise a restructuring process. The SPF is to be supervised by the Minister of



-8-
Finance. These two institutions will play the pivotal role in the privatization process. Both agencies
becarne operational in March 1994. The main issue now is how to begin the program of work that will
lead to expeditious decisions on corporatization, liquidation, and privatization. It is now critical that the
Latvian authorities move quickly from the institution-building phase to a transaction-oriented phase. An
important issue for the Government is how to staff the LPA and SPF quickly with skilled personnel, and
how to most effectively impart new skills on-the-job.
2.11           Pre-Privatization Restructuring. In a typical case, short-term measures are necessary,
to make an enterprise attractive to "cash" investors (especially foreign) and to permit it to survive during
the period immediately after privatization. Such measures would include: financial and legal due
diligence (including real estate and land property or leasing rights clarification, and the identification of
restitution claims); and the preparation of a privatization plan which would include the method of
privatization, budget and privatization agenda. There may also be a need for soft restructuring such as:
rescheduling and writing-off some bad debts; breaking-up enterprises into smaller units; cash flow
improvement by selling or leasing assets, the elimination of some costs, rescheduling accounts payable,
collecting accounts receivable; reducing employment; and contracting-out some production and social
functions. An enterprise will also need to develop a business plan and assess the need for post-
privatization restructuring, including an infusion of short-term and long-term financing through equity
and debt instruments. The amount of pre-privatization restructuring required will vary from enterprise
to enterprise depending on the scale, organizational complexity, financial and market situation, quality
of management and the method of privatization adopted. Extensive technical assistance is, therefore,
required to support enterprises in this phase. The main issue in this context is how, and in what form,
to obtain financing to provide the necessary assistance to enterprises in the pre-privatization phase.
Furthermore, it is vital that this be used not only to bring foreign consultants to Latvia but also to develop
indigenous skills in privatization and restructuring.
2.12           The Strategic Reorientation of Enterprises. A significant number of enterprises have
had to face radically new conditions as FSUB markets for their products ceased to exist, or as the
production of goods in which Latvian enterprises were only one of the elements of an "assembly line"
was abandoned (i.e., the defence industry). The development of new products and markets usually takes
three to five years and substantial investments in fixed capital and know-how. Thus, given the paucity
of domestic financial resources for investment the role of foreign investors will be crucial. However,
due to the small size of the Latvian market only products with good prospects of entering larger (external)
markets will be attractive to foreign investors.
2.13           Under present conditions in Latvia, viable enterprises are unable to access the banking
system to finance their working capital and fixed capital investment needs. This can be attributed to
several factors. The lack of a mechanism for establishing reliable collateral is a fundamental impediment
to the flow of financing, as are weaknesses in the legal framework for bankruptcy, property rights, etc.
There are also a number of specific reasons why banks have been slow to develop their domestic
commercial lending. Some banks have been attracted to the high profits available in lending for short-
term trading activities involving Russian commodities and metals (still priced at below international
levels). This has both distorted the interest rate structure in Latvia and created a disincentive to lend to
domestic enterprises for industrial or commercial purposes.  As these temporary trade financing
opportunities dissipate--i.e., when Russian commodity and metals prices rise to international levels--it will
be important to develop traditional lending skills in the banking system. Furthermore, given the likely
investment needs--particularly of those enterprises emerging from the privatization process that are
undertaking a major strategic reorientation--it will be important that longer-term financing options are



-9-
made available. Bank preparation missions, and an informal survey of enterprises and banks undertaken
in Latvia, also suggest a growing demand for longer-term credit in Latvia from the emerging private
sector. This has been reflected in part in a strong demand for credit from the G-24 loans and other
credits currently disbursing through the banking system. Given the lack of long-term funding sources
in Latvia at present, emphasis must be placed in the immediate future on the provision of longer-term
credit from external sources and the development of an indigenous securities market which can also--
through the impetus it would give to share trading--support the privatization process itself. A key issue,
therefore, is how to finance the strategic reorientation of enterprises through the provision of a sustainable
flow of credits of appropriate maturities, currencies and interest rates.
C. Financial Sector Status
Financial Sector Structure
2.14         Latvia began to restructure its financial system  immediately after it declared
independence.  In September 1991, the regional branches of the Soviet specialized banks were
"nationalized" and placed under the authority of the Bank of Latvia (BOL). In June 1992, however,
Parliament adopted legislation that allowed the BOL to separate its commercial banking functions. In
December 1992, the commercial branches of the BOL were transferred to the control of the Bank
Privatization Committee, a body formed from representatives of the BOL, the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
and Parliament as a prelude to privatization.
2.15         At the end of 1992, the Latvian Banking System comprised four main components: the
BOL, the former commercial branches of the BOL, the newly formed commercial banks and the Savings
Bank. An overview of the structure of the banking system is provided in Table 2.5 below.
2.16         Since the end of 1992, the Latvian banking system has changed significantly. Over half
of the former commercial branches of the BOL were either sold to the growing commercial banking
sector or privatized as individual banks. One branch was closed. The remaining nineteen have been
amalgamated together in the form of the Universal Bank of Latvia (Unibank). The intention is to
privatize this bank once it has established itself as a viable entity through a program of institutional
strengthening (supported by the World Bank, EC PHARE and the Government of Switzerland).
Privatization is expected towards the end of 1994.
2.17         A second major change has taken place in the commercial banking sector which has
grown significantly in the space of just three years. This sector is dominated by a few large banks that
are growing quickly and are seeking to develop branch networks. However, there are also a large
number of very small commercial banks, some of which were set up as captive funding devices for state
enterprises. The fast growth among the larger banks can be attributed, in part, to the profitability of
financing trade transactions involving Russian commodities and metals (as noted above). These profits
have undergirded the banking sector and generated some capital to help it grow quicker. Other structural
developments of note include the establishment of the Latvian Investment Bank and the Latvian Mortgage
and Land Bank.
2.18         The Government has recently decided to rehabilitate the Savings Bank. The bank
occupies a unique position in the Latvian banking system; it is the largest financial institution in Latvia
in terms of the number of branches and sub-branches (500). It holds the bulk of household deposits.



-10-
Given its extensive branch network, the bank is used by the state as a channel for disbursement of social
payments, etc. The financial equilibrium of this institution has been disturbed by the "missing assets"
on its balance sheet which are attributable to the transfer of assets to the now-liquidated Soviet Savings
Banks in Moscow that were not repatriated after independence. This continuing disequilibrium has caused
the bank to experience severe liquidity problems which it has sought to remedy by continuing to depress
the rate of interest paid to depositors and by developing a commercial lending portfolio of high yielding,
but potentially risky assets. The Savings Bank continues to hold the confidence of small savers however,
particularly in rural areas.

Latvia.
**      The Latvian Investment Bank, Latvian Mortgage and Land Bank are state-owned.
2.19            Financial Sector Infrastructure. The infrastructure for the financial system--i.e., the
legal, regulatory and supervisory framework, the payments system and the accounting, auditing and
financial training frameworks--are in need of either major overhaul or, in some instances, complete
development from  first principles.   In some of these areas work has begun to strengthen the
infrastructure.



-11-
2.20         A sound regulatory framework and strong mechanism for banking supervision are vital
prerequisites for a well functioning, solvent banking system. The prudential provisions that govern the
activity of Latvian commercial banks (and credit institutions) are largely contained in the Banking Law.
Enacted in May 1992 and subsequently amended in October 1992, this law vests the BOL with
responsibility for licensing, prudential regulation and banking supervision. The prudential provisions
contained in the current law cover most of the areas traditionally covered by a commercial banking law.
However, the present law has a number of shortcomings that need to be addressed in the near future in
order to bring bank regulations up to a level comparable to that of most market economies. The BOL
has begun to address these shortcomings and is committed to removing the main legal weaknesses during
1994.
2.21          The bank supervisory function in Latvia is in a rudimentary stage of development. The
Bank Supervision Department of the BOL has been in existence for only about two years. Since it
normally takes several years to develop an effective bank supervision capacity, much work needs to be
done to bring the department up to full effectiveness. Staff numbers are still too small to carry out its
extensive supervisory responsibilities effectively, particularly given the labor intensive nature of on-site
bank examinations. In addition, the supervisory staff is inexperienced in some of the major techniques
of bank supervision, and will require extensive training to bring it up to full effectiveness.
2.22          Until recently, the Bank Supervision Department largely confined its activities to two
functions: reviewing license applications submitted by proposed new banks, and checking financial
reports submitted by existing banks to determine if they conform to the BOL's prudential requirements.
The Department also has had a small staff group working on the development of BOL procedures for
handling future problem banks. Progress with on-site examinations of banks has been hampered by a lack
of staff and limited knowledge of the techniques needed to conduct such examinations. However, the
Department has recently been receiving technical assistance in bank supervision (from the IMF and EC
PHARE) that has emphasized the development of an on-site examination capacity.
2.23          The legalframework governing collateralfor bank lending is only now being developed
in Latvia. The main impediments have been deficiencies in the registration of titles or other rights to
property (company register and land register) and the enforcement of these rights due to the lack of a
developed court system. The company register is being transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the
MOF so that taxation and the registration of companies can be controlled by the same administration.
Moreover, the centralized computer network that will hold the register in the MOF will facilitate better
public access and improve the information flow to creditors. Currently the only forum to deal with cases
regarding claims of creditors or bankruptcies and liquidation of enterprises is the Commercial Court,
which dates back to the Soviet era. The Commercial Court is currently in a period of transition from
its role as a state arbitrator--involving many administrative functions--to its role as an arbitrator between
private parties in a market economy. But at present this Court only has a limited capacity to deal with
cases and there is, in any event, a lack of an effective legal execution system. This problem is being
addressed in part by the transfer of liquidation cases to district courts which have more capacity.
2.24          The domestic inter-bank payments system in Latvia meets the limited demands of the
enterprise sector at present. Within Riga and its suburban area (50 to 60 km from Riga), settlements are
achieved in two days and within the entire country in five days (107 banks and branches participate in
the clearing system). Currently, 70-80% of the payments are settled on the day of clearing (i.e.,
overnight settlement). However, the domestic payments system is substantially under-utilized. Currently,
only about 1,200 payment orders are cleared daily through the inter-bank payments system, and the



-12-
amount is only a fraction (less than 25%) of the total daily business transactions. However as the
economy recovers, and confidence in the banking system increases, there will be a need to upgrade the
payments system. Given that payments system development is, by nature, a gradual process, work should
begin now on the design and implementation of a new system.
2.25          Banks in Latvia currently operate within an accounting and auditing framework that is
still evolving from the former Soviet model to a Western one. Latvian accounting--as in other parts of
the FSUB--has until recently been directed towards ensuring that the state had full central control over
the enterprises' use of resources. In addition, the auditing function has only recently begun to develop.
The accounts that were prepared until recently did not present a full picture of the performance of banks,
their solvency, profitability, and liquidity positions to depositors and shareholders. An extensive program
of support is required to bring Latvian accounting standards up to internationally accepted standards. A
number of multilateral and bilateral donors have begun to provide technical assistance in this area.
2.26          The emergence of a sophisticated capital market--that is a market for equities and bonds
and their derivatives--in Latvia is, as yet, a long way off. However, there are a number of developments-
-and potential developments--in Latvia that suggest that an overall strategy for the capital markets should
be devised and a legal and regulatory framework put in place soon. Such developments include the
Government's decision to issue treasury bills for the first time, and the importance that will be placed on
vouchers as a key element in the Privatization Program. With regard to capital market infrastructure,
a number of so-called "stock exchanges" have evolved in Latvia in recent years. These exchanges trade
not only in securities (i.e., Russian and in some instances American and West European securities) but
also in commodities and other real goods. They are very small and do not facilitate trading activity in
the western sense, but rather seek to bring together individual buyers and sellers in an essentially ad hoc
way, A newly-formed stock exchange--the product of cooperation between the MOF and eight
commercial banks--is, however, being developed.
D. Issues in the Financial Sector
2.27          In order to support the development of the real sector of the economy it is important that
the financial sector be restructured so that financial intermediation is resumed. The volume of financial
intermediation in relation to the size of the Latvian economy is well below that in a western economy of
equivalent size. The Government is, moreover, faced with a number of immediate structural and
infrastructural issues in the financial sector.
2.28          The Future of the State Commercial Banks. There is an important issue regarding
what general role these banks should play in the financial system both in the short- and long-term. With
regard to the two major state commercial banks--Unibank and the Savings Bank--the most immediate issue
was how to stabilize the financial position of each bank. In the case of Unibank, its non-performing loans
(totalling about US$45 million) were removed from its balance sheet and exchanged for government
bonds yielding a rate of interest that will help ensure the financial stability of the bank. A range of other
remedial measures are also being taken. In the case of the Savings Bank the issue is how to stabilize the
bank given the existence of "missing assets" in Moscow (totalling about US$49 million equivalent) and
recently accumulated non-performing loans (US$9 million equivalent). In both banks there is now a need
to introduce institutional development programs to bring them to a point where they adequately manage
the risks they confront, and begin to lend safely on market-based principles. When and how both banks



-13-
should be privatized is also a key issue. Bank preparatory missions have been working with the
Government to develop a restructuring program for each institution.
2.29          Commercial Banking System. For the banking system as a whole, there is a marked
shortage of capital to support banking operations, particularly after allowance for specific loan loss
provisions. Until the capital devoted to the system is increased the banks are unlikely to play a more
important role in domestic intermediation. Furthermore, there is a need to equip banks with the skills
needed not only to begin normal commercial lending to private enterprises but also to play an active role
in the financial restructuring of enterprises. Moreover, financial restructuring (i.e., work-out) skills are
completely lacking in Latvia.
2.30          Credit Channeling Mechanism. There is a need to develop a robust mechanism in
Latvia for channeling longer-term credit from the international financial institutions--and bilateral lenders--
to private enterprise. Some existing credit facilities in Latvia have encountered significant problems due,
in large part, to deficiencies in the institutional mechanism for channeling them and also due to their weak
supervision. A strong mechanism, aimed at using the banks effectively as intermediaries for medium-
and long-term funds and aimed also at strengthening the capacities and capabilities of these banks, is also
needed. Bank preparatory missions have been working with the Government on the establishment of a
new credit channeling mechanism.
2.31          Infrastructural Development.  The infrastructure for the banking system requires
significant strengthening. A key component of this infrastructure, the payments system, needs to be
upgraded to prepare it for when banking intermediation reaches a volume commensurate with the expected
enhanced level of economic activity. The legal, regulatory, and supervisoryframework for banks will
also need to be bolstered substantially, as will other laws supportive of a market-oriented enterprise and
banking environment (law of bankruptcy, property rights, collateral, etc.). Finally, the accounting and
auditing framework must be considerably strengthened so as to increase the economic and financial
transparency of enterprises and banks.
2.32          Capital Market Development. Finally, as noted above, the legal framework for a
securities market should be developed. A transfer of skills from Western economies is needed to assist
in developing the institutions--i.e., stock exchange, investment funds, pension funds--that will stimulate
the growth of a securities market that will support the privatization process.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.1           The Bank has a firm commitment to assisting Latvia undertake the difficult transition from
a centrally-planned to a market economy. Structural reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors have,
until recently, proceeded slowly in Latvia, however. Given the central importance of these sectors to the
economy it is vital to reinvigorate the reform process in this area if the overall reform program is not to
stall.
3.2           The proposed project will support the restructuring of both the enterprise and banking
sectors. In the enterprise sector, the Bank has had a fruitful dialogue over a period of one year, focusing,
in particular, on reactivating the stalled privatization process. The new government wishes to accelerate
the pace of the privatization process and has been receptive to the Bank's proposals for a privatization
strategy.
3.3           Latvia's reform program to date merits support from the Bank. Latvia has successfully
stabilized its economy and currency, introduced hard budget constraints for the state enterprises, and has
now made significant headway in privatizing small enterprises, agriculture and the banking sector. A
significant proportion of enterprises--especially in comparison with other FSUB countries--have
marketable products and a well-trained work force. There is now no visible public disagreement on
privatization or a strong tendency on the part of managers and employees to take over the companies
unilaterally (spontaneous privatization). Under these circumstances, there is a good opportunity for a
successful transition of many state enterprises to private sector ownership. It is believed that the main
obstacles to privatization--mainly administrative in their nature--can be removed with the Bank's
assistance.
3.4          In the financial sector the Bank has also worked closely with successive governments on
the development of a bank restructuring strategy. The Bank and the Government, supported by a number
of multilateral and bilateral donors--including EC PHARE and the Swiss Government--have sought to
develop an integrated approach to the development of the Latvian banking system. The objective has
been to improve the incentives for the provision of mainstream banking services on sound risk
management principles, while providing support for the critical enterprise and bank restructuring
processes. The major components of the strategy have been the preparation of a program for the
institutional development and financial restructuring of Unibank and the Savings Bank. The strategy has
also included the creation of incentives for broadening intermediation activities and strengthening risk
management practices in the newly-formed commercial banks. Significant progress has already been
made in these areas during the loan preparation phase, and there is every prospect that this will continue
during the implementation stage of the proposed loan.
B. Objectives and Scope
3.5          The principal objective of the proposed project is to build on the work already undertaken
in support of the Government's reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors focussing in particular on
enterprise privatization and bank restructuring. An important aspect of the project is the design and
implementation of a coordinated strategy of reform for both sectors. The credit component of the loan



-15-
(US$29.58 million equivalent) will act as an incentive to the development of intermediation at the medium
and long-term end of the spectrum, as well as providing critical financing for newly-privatized and other
private enterprises. The institutional development component (US$3.42 million equivalent) would
support the LPA by financing an acceleration of the privatization transaction process. It will also
strengthen both the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the Technical Unit (TU) that will channel the
credit line. Finally, the fimancial infrastructure investment component (US$2 million equivalent) will
help prepare the banking system for its future, enhanced role in domestic intermediation.
3.6          The project is supporting the development of two approaches for dealing with the
privatization of state enterprises through the provision of technical assistance financed out of the loan and
other available grants. A first is a Pilot Privatization Program that will utilize a range of different
techniques in privatizing a small number of enterprises. This will lead to a second, mainstream approach
that will involve the financing of an accelerated privatization track through open auctions which will be
launched in the second half of 1994.
3.7          Those enterprises that are successfully privatized--as well as completely new enterprises--
will be eligible to secure financing through the proposed credit line. To strengthen the banking system
in general, and to provide a channel for the credit line in particular, the proposed project will assist in
the restructuring of the banking system. The focus of the assistance is the rehabilitation and privatization
of the former commercial branches of the BOL (i.e., former Soviet specialized banks). Some of these
have been restructured into one new multi-branch bank, the Universal Bank of Latvia (Unibank). The
project is also supporting the rehabilitation of the Savings Bank. In this context, it is expected that funds
from the Government of Sweden will be placed in a Swedish Capital Fund--SCF-- (see Annex 1) that will
be used to recapitalize Unibank and the Savings Bank as well as investing in selected commnercial banks.
3.8          The proposed project has been designed to deal with the problems of the enterprise and
financial sectors in a comprehensive manner. As a means of addressing the problems on the interface
of the two sectors--in particular the problem of the non-performing enterprise loans with the banks--the
project will support the development of work-out mechanisms and the transfer of appropriate skills.
3.9          As noted above the Government has already taken a wide range of measures to restructure
the banking sector and, most recently, the enterprise sector (through reforming the institutional
mechanism for privatization). These measures have been taken on the basis of advice and support
provided by Bank missions during the course of project preparation (see Annex 2). The project will also
support additional institutional and policy reforms during the project implementation period.
3.10         While the proposed project is small in size (two loans totalling US$35 million), it will
have a catalytic effect in attracting a broad range of other technical assistance funding. It will also create
a strong lending mechanism and a healthier lending environment that will facilitate the flow of credits
from other sources.



-16-
C. The Credit Component
3.11          The credit component will be dimensioned as a line of US$29.58 million2. It will be
financed by the single currency loan (US$10 million and DM8.5 million--approximately US$5 million)
and by an amount of US$14.58 from the currency pool loan. The objectives of this component are
fourfold. First, to provide medium and long-term financing for newly-privatized and other private sector
enterprises. To ensure that newly-privatized enterprises secure access to the credit line, US$10 million
will be reserved initially for such borrowers (but will be available to all private sector borrowers after
eighteen months if it does not disburse expeditiously). The Government views this "set aside" as an
important aspect of the loan which creates synergy with the technical assistance being provided to support
the privatization process. The second objective is to establish a well structured channeling mechanism
that could be used not only for this but for future credit lines also. The third objective is to provide an
incentive for participating banks to strengthen themselves to become core banks in the Latvian banking
system. This objective will be achieved in part through the operations of the SCF that has been
earmarked for the capitalization of banks in Latvia and the two other Baltic countries (see Annex 1).
US$10 million will be made available under the SCF. It is expected that US$5 million will be made
available for Unibank, US$3 million for the Savings Bank and US$2 million for private commercial
banks. Technical assistance will also be provided to help meet this objective.
3.12          The Swedish Capital Fund will provide incentives for positive institutional development
in a set of state and private commercial banks. Selected commercial banks eligible for participation in
the credit line will be given the option to draw upon additional financial resources, in the form of
subordinated debt (this would count as Tier 2 but not Tier 1 capital) or equity from the SCF. The
amount of capital received would be determined by the draw-down of the Bank's credit line--in the ratio
of one dollar of capital to one dollar of credit line--but would require the participating bank to sign a
capitalization agreement with the Capital Fund.
3.13          The mission's interviews with banks--at both preappraisal and appraisal--suggested that
there would be considerable interest in developing a medium- and long-term lending pipeline. The
appraisal mission undertook an analysis of the prospective demand for medium- and long-term financing
in Latvia over the period 1994-1997. Separate estimates were generated for newly-privatized enterprises
(their demand for medium- and long-term credit in the year they are privatized) and emerging private
enterprises. With regard to newly-privatized enterprises, demand was estimated on the basis of a range
of assumptions about the number of enterprises completing the privatization process, the number of
enterprises seeking bank financing, and the average project size.  Using the most feasible set of
assumptions3, a cumulative demand of between US$40 million and US$100 million for project financing
is expected. The more substantive component of demand is likely to be from the newly emerging private
sector. The significant disbursement of medium- and long-term credit in 1993 (from foreign credit lines)
to the newly-emerging private sector suggests an underlying demand of about US$50-100 million in that
year. Given a 3 % annual growth rate this would lead to a cumulative demand for medium- and long-term
2.   This amount includes US$980,000 of unallocated funds under the currency pool loan that are expected to
be deployed in the credit line.
3.    The privatization of 100 enterprises in 1994 and 200 per year in the following three years; an average
project size of US$300,000; between 20% and 50% of all privatized enterprises seeking medium- and long-
term bank financing.



-17-
funds of US$260-530 million over the period 1994-1997. Total demand over this period could, therefore,
be in the order of US$300-630 million. Foreign credits expected to disburse during 1994 and 1995
amount to US$160 million (see Annex 3). These credits (including the proposed Enterprise and Financial
Sector Restructuring Loan), coupled with reflows from existing credits, could satisfy demand at the low
end of the above range.
3.14         The World Bank credit line will be channeled through a Technical Unit (TU), that has
been established as an independent state entity related to the Government through the Ministry of
Finance, which will on-lend to participating banks and then on to final borrowers. The TU will draw
on the resources of the Banking Supervision Department in the Bank of Latvia for the determination of
which banks would be eligible for participating bank status. An initial review of the banking system
suggests that about nine private commercial banks (plus Unibank) may be eligible to participate in the
credit line.
3.15          The credit line would be channeled through Unibank in a way that would permit a subloan
to replace the government bonds that have been placed on its balance sheet. (These bonds have initially
replaced the non-performing loans on Unibank's balance sheet--see paras. 3.33-3.36). This will enable
Unibank to secure fresh resources for new lending and permit the Government to redeem its bonds and
incur a longer maturity World Bank liability instead.
3.16          Subloans under the credit line will be made available in US dollars, deutsche mark, and
Latvian lati. The currency composition of the proposed Bank loans reflects feedback from the commercial
banks as to the likely currency needs of their prospective clients. The US dollar and deutsche mark SCLs
are expected to be onlent to subborrowers that have revenues in these currencies; credit line
disbursements under the currency pool loan are expected to finance onlending in lati, but might also
finance foreign currency lending. Latvia will be an appropriate country to be treated as a regional pilot
for the onlending in domestic currency of a Bank credit line. The stability of the Lati against the
backdrop of relative price stability and full currency convertibility--makes it a special case in the FSUB.
The appraisal mission, as part of its review of the demand for term credit, determined that there exists
a set of borrowers (those oriented towards the domestic market) for which borrowing in Lati would better
match the currency of their income. A specific factor that also militates in favor of Lati-denominated
subloans is the specific requirements associated with the way in which Unibank participates in the credit
line. As subloans will gradually replace Lat-denominated government bonds on its balance sheet (see
para. 3.15) it is important that Unibank's new assets--the subloans--also be denominated in Lati so as to
avoid exposing the bank to undue exchange risk.
3.17          Eligibility for Single Currency Loans. A portion of the subloans under the credit line
meets the eligibility criteria for single currency loans. Eligible subborrowers all are private enterprises,
or are newly-privatized enterprises, and therefore are autonomous of the government. These enterprises
are responsible for managing their own foreign exchange risk. Moreover, participating banks will take the
full credit risk of the subloans, and will have full autonomy in selecting subprojects ex ante, subject to the
credit line guidelines (paras. 4.3 to 4.13). It is expected that funds available under the SCL component
will be onlent to borrowers which have a need for a foreign currency loan because they earn revenues in
foreign exchange. Surveys conducted by potential participating banks indicate that a substantial number
of existing borrowers generate revenues in foreign exchange, the majority being in US dollars, but with
a significant percentage in deutsche marks. As part of the eligibility criteria of subborrowers and projects,
PFI's will be expected to include in their credit appraisals a demonstration that the currency and terms of
the subloans are appropriate given the projected revenues of the subborrowers (para. 4.13). In light of the



-18-
survey results and further conversations with potential participating banks, the Government decided to
request US$10 million equivalent on US dollar SCL terms and DM8.5 million equivalent on deutsche mark
SCL terms with the remainder to be on currency pool terms, with onlending in lati for those subborrowers
whose revenues are predominantly in local currency. These amounts were confirmed at Negotiations.
3.18         Legal and Regulatory Environment: As a backdrop to the proposed credit line, Bank
preparation missions have discussed extensively with the Bank of Latvia the legal, regulatory and
supervisory environment for banks. The Bank of Latvia recently has made considerable efforts to
strengthen prudential supervision of banks. These efforts have been supported by a comprehensive
program of technical assistance from the IMF and EC PHARE. A uniform model for accounting returns
has now been introduced and the Banking Supervision Department of the Bank of Latvia expects to
complete the introduction of a complete set of prudential regulations--underpinned by a new Banking Law--
during 1994.
D. Institutional Development Component
3. 19        The technical assistance being provided to the Government comprises three subcomponents.
The first is technical assistance and computer equipment financing for the LPA (US$3 million), which will
be financed entirely under the currency pool loan. The groundwork for an accelerated privatization
program was established during the project preparation period through the initiation of a Pilot Privatization
Program (financed out of the PHRD Fund). The second subcomponent is technical assistance for the
restructuring of the banking sector. This is already underway and is being supported from a PHRD grant
and other donors. A third subcomponent will provide miscellaneous assistance to support a range of
project objectives, including US$0.42 million under the loan to strengthen the PMU and TU.
3.20         Technical Assistance for Privatization. During the preparation period for the loan, the
Bank (with the assistance of US$175,000 from a PHRD grant) assisted the Latvian Privatization Agency
(LPA) and the Government in streamlining the privatization process through a Pilot Privatization Program
(PPP). The main objectives of the PPP were:
*     to offer seminars on a range of issues, including voucher privatization and the development
of investment funds;
*     to accelerate the privatization process through the design and completion of privatization
transactions for several enterprises in a transparent and technically sound manner;
*     to train the core staff of the LPA and a core group of local consultants and trainers;
*     to disseminate privatization know-how to managers of state companies, local consultants
and the staff of other governmental agencies;
*     to document procedures and draft standardized documents for specific steps related to the
preparation and implementation processes for future use by the LPA, the SPF and local
consultants; and
*     to create a demonstration effect which will establish the credibility of the LPA and SPF
with the enterprises, the public at large, and the international community.
3.21         The PPP is providing a framework for additional fundraising and coordination of diverse
technical assistance provided by various multilateral and bilateral sources, thus promoting a demand-driven
approach to technical assistance. The PPP will also be a prelude to the Mass Privatization Program (MPP).



-19-
3.22          In March 1994, legislation providing for new privatization rules and responsibilities was
adopted by the Parliament. In particular, significant amendments to the Privatization Law established the
LPA as the main administrator of the privatization process. The Privatization Law envisions three
privatization tracks: tenders (including trade sales), auctions (including initial public offerings) and
liquidations. The new approach to privatization, as set by the amended Privatization Law, creates an
improved environment for effective and fast privatization.
3.23         The appraisal mission agreed with the Government on an accelerated privatization track
through open auctions which will be launched, with the support of the Bank (a US$3 million project
subcomponent) and other donors in the second half of 1994. The program will have the following
objectives: to complete the privatization of 300 medium- and large-scale enterprises within three years;
to encourage broader participation of new groups of owners in privatization by the utilization of
privatization certificates and easy access to shares of privatized companies; to increase transparency of
the process and, thus, to raise the level of public awareness and support for privatization and market
reforms.
3.24          According to the Government's agreed privatization procedure for open auctions, the LPA
will initiate privatization through auctions of consecutive groups of about 50 enterprises every 6 months.
The LPA will prepare the list of enterprises to be offered to the general public by an open auction
following approval by the Council of Ministers. The list will be prepared in coordination with the State
Property Fund (SPF). The first group of enterprises will include those with relatively good prospects
to survive after privatization and those not requiring more than basic pre-privatization financial and
organizational (soft) restructuring.  Potential claims of former owners and potential environmental
liabilities will be investigated and questionable cases excluded.
3.25          Approved enterprises will be transferred to the LPA from the respective government
institutions. These institutions will prepare the Minutes of Transfer according to a standardized format
set by the LPA. The preparation of the selected enterprises, as described by the Law, would be handled
solely by the LPA. The Government declared its intention to treat the privatization process not only as
a formal step in the transformation of ownership but also as an important step in the improvement of the
performance of privatized enterprises. At this stage the LPA will undertake measures to improve
enterprises transferred for privatization. To this end, about 10 advisory teams will be formed. The teams
will comprise local experts and foreign specialists with extensive privatization experience in Central and
Eastern Europe. The number of specialists in an individual team, and time spent in one enterprise, will
vary depending on the size of the enterprise and complexity of the case. The standard team will comprise
an LPA staff project manager, foreign restructuring/privatization specialists, and a group of Latvian
experts. In the case of more complex units this core group could be assisted by industry specialists and
a lawyer.
3.26          Each team will spend on average 10 days in one enterprise and will prepare: an analysis
of the present situation of the company specifying those "soft" restructuring measures which could be
implemented by the LPA prior to auctions; a business plan; and a short prospectus for auction
participants. Each team will be supervised by the LPA through its project managers. As a condition of
Board presentation, the LPA must prepare, in coordination with the State Property Fund (SPF), a
tentative list of enterprises to be privatized as the first batch (60 enterprises) through an open auction.
As a condition of disbursement under the Institutional Development component (to LPA), the LPA will
hire ten senior staffmembers as potential project managers of the proposed privatization teams. The LPA
will also prepare adequate support facilities for ten privatization teams.



-20-
3.27         Transactions (selling of shares) will be accomplished through an open, competitive and
transparent auction mechanism with easy access for all those willing to participate. A sufficient network
of points of sale (POS) will be established throughout the country to provide infornation about
companies offered for sale and accept bid proposals from individuals. These POS will be linked to the
central auctioning unit. All services necessary for the operation of the auction system will be contracted-
out to private agents, such as banks, brokers and other financial intermediaries.
3.28          An important impediment to faster privatization in Latvia is a shortage of local experts
needed for the preparation of enterprises for privatization and a lack of mechanisms for selling shares or
assets. The LPA is also in need of strengthening through building up its computing capabilities. At
Negotiations, a loan component of US$3 million was agreed to address these constraints. The proposed
World Bank technical assistance component of the loan would be deployed as illustrated in Table 3.1.
A full project cost and financing for this component is set out in Tables 3.2 and 3.3.
Table 3.1 Loan Assistance for Privatization,
Use of Loan Proceeds
Preparation of enterprises:
Ten teams of four specialists each                   US$2.0 million
(including travel/subsistence,
and auxiliary staff)
Public relations company (3 months)                  US$0.3 million
Building of necessary auction capacity:
Marketing & distribution system specialist           US$0.2 million
Institutional strengthening of LPA:
Computer Hardware and Software                       US$0.5 million
TOTAL:                                                      US$3.0 million
3.29         Due to the complexity of this component, the broad spectrum of expertise to be deployed
and the limited capacity of the LPA it is proposed that consultants be organized in the form of a
consortium. The consortium would comprise a consortium leader and subcontracted specialists in specific
areas of expertise. A full-time project manager will be needed (funding of US$500,000 is being sought
from the Government of Canada). In addition a public relations company will be contracted for three
months to promote the proposed privatization program. The draft terms of reference for the consortium
that would handle the preparation of enterprises for privatization and the auction mechanism is contained
in Annex 4.
3.30         The technical assistance component would  be supplemented by grant funds made
available from bilateral and multilateral donors. The Bank will continue to mobilize the grant funds
necessary for the implementation of the proposed program. Preliminary donor commitment to support
the auction track privatization, with grants of up to US$2.5 million, has been secured. The LPA would
not draw on the technical assistance component of the loan if sufficient additional grant funds are made
available. A review of the use of this component of the Bank's loan will take place 18 months after loan
effectiveness (at the mid-term review). If at that time it is mutually agreed between the Bank and the LPA



-21-
that all or part of this component of the loan will not be disbursed over the subsequent 18 months then
that portion unlikely to be used will be transferred for use in the credit line component of the currency
pool loan for onlending in lati, US dollars or deutsche marks.
3.31         During loan appraisal, the Government agreed that technical assistance should be sought
to help the authorities (Ministries of Economy, Justice, Environment and Regional Development, and the
LPA) to develop legislation that will address the issue of liability for past pollution in regard to
enterprises that are being privatized. A grant donor is being sought to finance this technical assistance.
Terms of reference for this technical assistance are set out in Annex 5.
3.32         The technical assistance provided by the Bank under the proposed loan is part of a larger
coordinated program of international support involving a range of donors. These donors, together with
the range of subprojects which they will finance, are set out in Annex 6.
3.33         Technical Assistance for Banking Sector Restructuring. Technical assistance has
already been provided during project preparation for bank restructuring, through the deployment of about
US$700,000 from the PHRD Fund (Japanese Grant). This is being supplemented during the project
implementation period by funding from the Government of Switzerland (about US$2 million) and EC
PHARE (about US$2.2 million). The financing plan for this component is contained in Table 3.3 There
are three subcomponents: (a) restructuring of Unibank; (b) restructuring of the Savings Bank; and (c) the
establishment of institutional arrangements for debt recovery and enterprise restructuring.
3.34         The program of institutional strengthening of the Unibank is critical as this bank holds
the accounts and the debt of a large proportion of Latvian state-owned enterprises which continue to
dominate the economic activity and employment in the country. The commitment to the rehabilitation
of the Unibank is considered to be justified by the Government despite the large proportion of problem
loans in its balance sheet (about 64% of its loans--or US$28 million--may be bad or doubtful4) in view
of: (a) the need to develop channels for investment and working capital finance to enterprises through
its extensive branch network; (b) the need to develop a focus for the essential development of enterprise
"work-out" skills in the Latvian economy; and (c) the need to develop a stable core in the commercial
banking system given the evident volatility in the financial condition of a number of the newly established
private banks. Given the fragile situation of Unibank, the Bank has worked closely with Latvian
authorities on, in particular, a program to stabilize Unibank's cashflow.
3.35         The first step in the financial restructuring of Unibank was a review of the portfolio of
the bank to international standards. The next step was to carve out the bulk of non-performing loans in
its balance sheet. The Ministry of Finance issued in April 1994 seven-year bonds worth Ls 25 million
(US$44.5 million) in exchange for principal and interest on the non-performing loans. Interest on the
governnent bonds will be about 20 percent per annum during the first year. The authorities will be able
to adopt a number of options in reducing the financial burden of its bond issue. As the non-performing
loan recovery program gathers momentum, collections could be used to redeem bonds. The World Bank
line of credit could--as noted above--also be distributed through Unibank in replacement of the bonds in
so far as this is consistent with prudent management of the foreign currency and maturity mismatch risk
of the bank. The way in which the replacement of bonds would take place and the conditions under
4.    This figure excludes grain and gas loans totalling US$22.4 million that were formally guaranteed by
the Government.



-22-
which it would be permitted will be governed by a Bond Redemption Agreement. The execution of the
Bond Redemption Agreement, satisfactory to the bank, will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
In addition to the measures aimed at stabilizing the bank's position, a comprehensive program of
institutional development will be pursued in preparation for the privatization of the bank by the beginning
of 1995 (see Annex 7). A meeting of all parties concerned with the capitalization and institutional
development of Unibank took place in Riga in late May 1994 to agree on a program of support and to
discuss conditions for the participation of the Swedish Capital Fund.
3.36         The Government is proposing to privatize Unibank as one of the first entities placed with
the new LPA. Unibank will be privatized as a complete unit. The privatization process itself will be
handled in a transparent way and will be based upon audits to international standards for both Unibank
and any strategic investor (domestic and foreign). It is expected that a US$5 million injection of capital
from the Swedish Capital Fund will take place at the point of privatization. As a condition of
effectiveness, a privatization program for Unibank, satisfactory to the Bank, should be prepared.
3.37         The restructuring and institutional strengthening of the Savings Bank is of particular
importance to the Latvian Authorities and will be supported under the proposed project. Bank preparation
missions--along with EC PHARE--have worked closely with the Government on this issue. The first step
in the process of rehabilitation of the Savings Bank will be the elimination of the gap on the assets side
of the balance sheet resulting from the missing assets in the former Moscow headquarters of the Savings
Bank (estimated at Ls 27.4 million or US$48.7 million). In addition the Savings Bank has recently
accumulated Ls 5.1 million (US$9 million) in non-performing loans. The Ministry of Finance has issued
non-tradeable government bonds to a value of Ls 32.5 million (US$57.7 million) to cover both the
missing assets and the non-performing loans.
3.38         A full institutional development program will be implemented in preparation of the bank
for privatization (supported by EC PHARE). The program will incorporate a plan for the progressive
development of the lending activities of the bank in line with its credit risk management capabilities e.g.,
through a phased relaxation of the requirement for holding assets in remunerated accounts at the Bank
of Latvia or in the form of additional government bonds. As in the case of the Unibank, it is expected
that additional capital resources (US$3 million) may be available from the Swedish Capital Fund once
a program of institutional development has been implemented.
3.39         As part of the Government's program for the restructuring of the banking and enterprise
sectors it is encouraging the development of institutional arrangements for debt recovery and enterprise
restructurini. The Government wants to utilize the process of debt recovery for those bad loans carved
out of the balance sheets of Unibank and the Savings Bank, as well as any remaining bad loans on the
balance sheets of the two banks, as a method of accelerating the process of restructuring and privatization
of the debtor enterprises. Work-out units will, therefore, be established in both the Unibank and the
Savings Bank to develop work-out proposals for those loss-making enterprises that are considered to be
viable. The involvement of the banks in the work-out process is an essential part of the first stage of
development of a decentralized work-out capability in Latvia. Unibank will continue to be accountable
for the recovery of both those bad loans carved out of its balance sheet--with a 15 % performance fee--and
those which remain on its books. Specialists financed by the US Treasury, the Swiss Government (in
the case of Unibank) and EC PHARE (in the case of the Savings Bank) will assist in developing work-out
skills.

3.40         For a successful restructuring of the banking sector to take place it will be important that
the leeal framework governing the security and collateral for bank lending should be strengthened and
that the accounting and auditing framework for both banks and enterprises should be firmly established
and implemented. With regard to the legal framework for security and collateral there are two projects
underway that will have an important impact on the soundness of bank loans. The first is the
development of an appropriate land register and the second is the drafting of a new set of laws. Both are
being prepared with the assistance of bilateral and multilateral donors (including the Bank). However,
additional grant funding (of US$100,000) is being sought to support the drafting of new legislation. As
a dated covenant, the Government shall present, for consideration by Parliament, legislation which in
the opinion of the Government and the Bank provides the necessary regulatory frameworkfor the adequate
functioning of the banks and other financial institutions, including legislation on secured transactions,
loans and collateral regulations, (by December 31, 1995). The Government shall also prepare (by March
31, 1995) a plan of action regarding the administration procedures for: (i) implementation of the
bankruptcy andforeclosure legislation; and (ii) public access to the registers of commercial entities, titles,
and rights, including the data and information that will be made available to the public. With respect
to the accounting and auditing framework, efforts are underway to introduce Western practices in both
enterprises and banks following the recent adoption of pertinent laws. The main constraint, however,
remains the lack of local skilled accountants. Four international accounting firms have set up offices in
Latvia over the past two years and an increasing number of local accountants are receiving licenses to
practice (from the Council of Accounting Methodology). Significant support for the development of the
accounting and auditing framework and its implementation has been provided from both bilateral and
multilateral sources.
3.41         The BOL has begun an intense effort to strengthen the legal regulatory and supervisory
framework for the banks. The supervision department of the BOL has been strengthened in recent
months. On-site supervision has intensified and a number of banks have had their licenses revoked.
Minimum capital requirements for banks have been increased. The BOL is pressing ahead to bring the
financial reporting and supervision of banks closer to international standards. The larger banks must now
be audited by international accounting firms and will be required to make adequate provisions for loan
losses. A measure has recently been enacted by Parliament to permit tax deductibility of specific loan
loss provisions made by banks.
3.42         Miscellaneous Technical Assistance. The proposed loan will contain a subcomponent
of US$420,000 to support the institutional development of the PMU (US$20,000--para 4.1) and TU
(US$400,000--para 4.29). Grant funding for this subcomponent will be sought, however, in which case
the relevant loan proceeds will be dedicated instead to the credit component (under the currency pool
loan). An environmental subcomponent of US$185,000 to support the establishment of an environmental
screening mechanism for the credit component (para 4.25) and to draft legislation that will address the
issue of liability for past pollution in regard to enterprises that are being privatized (para 3.30), has also
been developed. See also Annex 5. This has not been included as part of the proposed loan as a number
of donors have made expressions of interest to provide grant financing. Finally, a subcomponent of
US$100,000 will finance legal consultants to draft legislation to strengthen the legal framework to bank
lending (para. 3.40). Grant financing is expected to be found to cover this technical assistance and so
no loan financing has been allocated for this purpose.

E. Financial Infrastructure Investment Component
3.43         A Norwegian consulting company, working with the Bank of Latvia and financed by the
Norwegian Government, has completed a report on the Latvian payments system. The report sets out
the full rationale for strengthening the payments system at this time (this report is lodged in the Project
File). Based on this report, the Bank of Latvia has decided to take a phased approach to payments system
development. The four phases proposed are:
Phase 1:       Upgrade of the payment and clearing system
Phase 2:       Incorporation into the upgraded system of direct crediting and debiting of
salaries and repetitive payments (rents, taxes, etc.)
Phase 3:       Paper-based invoicing. The incorporation into the upgraded system of various
payment instruments to meet the need for paying invoices
Phase 4:       The incorporation into the upgraded system of facilities for the direct debit of
customer accounts at the point of sale
3.44         Phase 1 is expected to be implemented in the period up to mid-1996 and will be supported
under the proposed loan. This will involve: a general upgrade of facilities to Western operational
standards; an upgrade of the current systems with regard to security and control mechanisms and
performance requirements; centralization and simplification of document handling, input, control and
archiving; and implementation of modern backup and recovery procedures to ensure stable operations and
professional error handling. Phase 1 of the work will provide the basis for the subsequent three phases.
The Bank of Latvia does not propose to privatize the clearing house at this stage. This is contemplated
in 3-5 years time, once the clearing function has been well-established in the Bank of Latvia.
3.45          The appraisal mission agreed with the Bank of Latvia that a US$2 million component
would be included in the loan for the purchase of computer software and hardware in support of Phase
I of payments system development. Of this amount, US$0.8 million will be used for hardware
(minicomputer, personal computers, disks, printer, local area network, communications controller) and
US$1.2 million for systems and application software. EC PHARE, meanwhile, has indicated that it
would be prepared to cofinance this component of the loan in the order of US$0.56 million (for technical
assistance). Other bilateral donors are being sought to cover the remaining project costs of the first phase
of payments system development (expected total project costs are US$9.1 million--see Table 3.3). If
alternative grant funding is found to cover the costs of the computer hardware and software, then this
component of the loan will be rededicated to the credit line component (under the currency pool loan).
As conditions of disbursement of thefinancial infrastructure investment component: a fully-costed, time-
bound, implementation plan for upgrading the payments system, satisfactory to the Bank, must be
approved by the Bank of Latvia; and, a unit will have been established in the Bank of Latvia to manage
the implementation of the payments system development program and coordinate the financing of the
program with bilateral and multilateral donors.
F. Project Cost and Financing Plan
3.46         Project costs are estimated at US$114 million. The size of the IBRD project will be
approximately US$35 million equivalent. Loan preparation is being supported by a grant of about
US$1 million from the PHRD fund. The Government of Switzerland is assisting with the rehabilitation
of Unibank and the training of commercial banks (US$2 million) while the Government of Sweden is



-25-
proposing to establish a Capital Fund of US$10 million for recapitalizing banks together with supporting
technical assistance (U$600,000). EC PHARE is providing technical assistance across a range of
activities that support the objectives of the project (US$3.6 million). Participating banks are expected
to contribute US$6 million and credit line beneficiaries US$0.2 million. Project costs and the financing
plan are elaborated in Tables 3.2 and 3.3 attached.
3.47         The Bank has determined that the PFIs (Participating Financial Institutions) -- with the
exception of Unibank at present -- are eligible for single currency loan (SCL) terms for part of the credit
line component of this project because they have a need for a mix of US dollars and deutsche mark to
lend to their clients that have revenues in these currencies and are financially and managerially
autonomous of the Latvian government. (Unibank may qualify at a later date to access the SCL credit
line once it is sufficiently autonomous.) To determine what share of the Bank's loans could benefit from
SCL terms, a survey was conducted among a set of potential PFIs, which was later confirmed during
post-appraisal discussions. This survey, and subsequent discussions, demonstrated that 40% of the
clients' sales are for export. Of these, approximately 60-70% are priced and paid for in US dollars.
Most of the balance is priced and paid for in deutsche marks, and a very small portion is priced and paid
for in pounds sterling.
3.48         Based on this information and a discussion of the terms and risk management of Bank
loan alternatives, the Government has requested that about US$15 million equivalent--specifically, US$10
million and DM8.5 million--of the total loan amount be made on SCL terms to finance export activities.
Since the Pound sterling demand was small in relation to overall demand, and in order not to make the
financing package overly complex, the Government determined not to request a portion of the loan to be
denominated in Pounds sterling. The Government requested that US$20 million be made available on
currency pool loan terms to finance production for the local market (US$14.58 million), technical
assistance for privatization, the PMU and TU (US$3.42 million) and financial infrastructure investment
(US$2 million).

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ONLENDING ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Organization and Implementation
4.1          The Executing Agency for the Borrower would be the Ministry of Finance, where there
would be a Project Management Unit (PMU) responsible for overseeing and coordinating overall project
implementation. Besides keeping records and administering the two Bank loans, the PMU would
monitor the operations of the participating government agencies and facilitate coordination and problem
solving for the three components of the project. Also, the PMU would be the liaison office of the
Government with the Bank. The PMU would be headed by a director, who would have a full-time
deputy director to manage day-to-day affairs (see Annex 8). An agreement was reached during
Negotiations on the staffing requirements of the PMU, which would be integrated with the Department
of Foreign Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Finance. Also, the Government agreed to appoint the
Director and Deputy Director of the PMU, satisfactory to the Bank, as a condition of Board presentation.
Moreover, there would be a need for technical assistance to adequately develop the information and
communication capabilities of the PMU. The Bank is identifying sources of grant funding for the
purchase of the required equipment (budgeted at US$20,000).
B. The Credit Line Component
4.2          The Channeling Mechanism. The credit line would be channeled to participating banks
through a mechanism to be established by the Ministry of Finance. The credit line would be managed
by the TU which has been newly-created for this purpose. The Government would use the Bank of
Latvia, in its capacity as the financial agent of the Republic, for the actual transfer of funds to the
participating banks and, later on, for the collection of the debt service payments associated with the use
of the credit line. It is expected that the intermediation of the line to the final users would be performed
by Unibank and a qualified set of private commercial banks, all of which would have to first meet
stringent financial and management criteria. These first-tier participating financial institutions (PFIs)
would make the line available to the private sector through subloans designed to finance eligible private
investment projects. In addition to the Bank financed credit line offered through the TU, the Swedish
Government will create a Capital Fund which selected PFIs could access to bolster their capital bases and
co-finance subloans (see Annex 1). For this purpose US$2 million of the credit line would be "set aside"-
-for the first nine months after effectiveness--to be used as counterpart to the injection of capital provided
be the Swedish Capital Fund.
4.3          Institutional Arrangements. The Government has created the TU by a decree of the
Ministry of Finance. The agreed organizational chart for the TU is shown in Annex 8. The Statutes will
include a requirement that the TU adopt two basic documents: the Operating Procedures of the Technical
Unit (OPTU) and the Credit Line Regulation Manual (CLRM). During Negotiations, the guidelines for
these two documents were agreed. Decisions by the TU would be made following a two-step approach.
At the technical level the Executive Secretariat would process bank applications for eligibility as well as
credit line usage by PFIs, according to the CLRM. This would be followed by a formal recommendation
to the Credit Committee. The TU would have three main functions: (i) selection of PFIs and monitoring
of their continued eligibility for the intermediation of the credit line; (ii) implementation of the credit line
guidelines and supervision of their compliance by participating banks and final borrowers, and (iii)
authorization of the use of the credit line by PFIs for the financing of specific subprojects. As a condition



-30-
of effectiveness the CLRM and the Operating Procedures of the TU will have been agreed. Before Board
presentation the TU would have been established as an independent state entity, with termns of reference
satisfactory to the Bank and its Executive Secretary appointed --subject to the Bank's non-objection. As
a condition of effectiveness the TU must have been staffed in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. The TU
would have the independence to hire the necessary staff to carry out its functions in a proper and timely
fashion. This would be facilitated by the fact that the TU would be a separate state entity rather than a
department of the central government, so that it would have more flexibility for hiring and negotiating
staff compensation. To cover the costs of running the TU, there would be a fee added to the spread
charged on subsidiary loans to PFIs. Although this fee should be sufficient to cover costs over the life
of the project, initially there will be a need for additional funding to cover start-up costs and the cash
deficits expected in the first months of operation of the TU. Sources of grant financing to cover most
of the expenses of running the TU during its first two years of operation have been identified. Also,
provisions would be made so that part of the operating costs of the TU would be financed from the
proceeds of the Bank loan (US$400,000). The implementation plan for the credit line is described in
Annex 9.
4.4          The role of the Bank of Latvia as the financial agent of the Republic. The BOL, as
established in its organic law, would act as the financial agent of the Government and provide the banking
services required to operate the credit line. For the purpose of managing the credit line funds, the BOL
would open an account--the Separate Project Account (SPA)--on behalf of the Republic that would be
maintained for the life of the credit line. The opening of an SPA at the BOL on behalf of the Republic
is a condition of loan effectiveness. The SPA would comprise three sub-accounts: one for the currency
pool loan in US dollars; one for the US dollar tranche of the single currency loan, and; one for the
deutsche mark tranche of the single currency loan. The SPA would have the double purpose of receiving
deposits--originating in withdrawals from the Bank loan and the servicing of subsidiary loans by PFIs--
and making disbursements--that would go to either the servicing of the Bank loan by the Republic or the
granting of subsidiary loans to PFIs. Besides being a depositary account for liquid balances, the SPA
would serve the purpose of keeping full and detailed accounting of the transactions being financed out
of the proceeds of the credit line.  Furthermore, any foreign exchange risk associated with the
intermediation of the Bank funds to PFIs would also remain with the Republic, which is the Bank
borrower. In order to formalize the role of the BOL in the intermediation of the credit line, the BOL
would enter into a Financial Agency Agreement with the Ministry of Finance. The signing of such an
agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, is a condition for effectiveness.
4.5          The credit line guidelines. The CLRM would contain the norms and procedures that
the TU would apply to all lending done in the context of the credit line. The regulations would cover,
inter alia, the following main points:
* eligibility criteria and procedures to select PFIs
* eligibility criteria of subborrowers and investment projects
* terms and conditions of subsidiary loans to PFIs and subloans to final users.
* use of Bank funding and procurement procedures
* environmental requirements
* maximum subloan amount
* free limits
* minimum co-financing by PFIs and/or subborrowers
* disbursement procedures
* subproject documentation requirements



-31-
* reporting requirements for PFIs and subborrowers
* criteria for assessing subborrower capability for managing currency and interest rate risk.
4.6           The eligibility criteria for PFIs. In order to be a PFI, private commercial banks would
have to meet at all times a set of stringent financial and management criteria and have signed a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with the TU. A model of such agreement would be annexed to the CLRM. It would
be the responsibility of the Executive Secretariat of the TU to analyze potential candidates and propose
to the Credit Committee those banks that are being recommended to become PFIs. Moreover, it would
be its job to monitor that each PFI remains eligible at all times in accordance with the pre-established
criteria. Also, it would have responsibility to recommend the suspension of those that have become
ineligible. Potential PFIs would be individually appraised, with particular attention being given to their
overall lending capabilities and financial and portfolio performance. The evaluation would focus on (i)
capital adequacy; (ii) asset quality; (iii) management effectiveness; (iv) earnings performance; and (v)
liquidity. A list of the criteria is included in Annex 10. The list of eligibility criteria would be
incorporated into the CLRM. Furthermore, the consent of the Bank would be required before Unibank
and the first five private banks are declared eligible. Subsidiary Loan Agreements between at least two
PFIs and the TU tnust have been signed as a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.7           A pre-condition for any bank to become a PFI is that their financial statements be audited
by external auditors acceptable to the Bank and the TU. For this purpose, the TU is expected to keep
a list of eligible external auditors. Such auditors should apply internationally accepted auditing principles.
Moreover, the TU would make sure that the mandate given to the external auditors by each PFI requests
the inclusion in the management letter to be written by the auditors of specific comments on the adequacy
of provisions, income accrual policies, overall portfolio quality, and the integrity of accounting policies
and systems.
4.8           Each subloan would have to be documented by a Subloan Agreement to be entered into
between a PFI and its client. This agreement would include the tentative disbursement schedule for the
subloan and the conditions agreed for disbursement. A model of such agreement would be annexed to
the CLRM.
4.9           The Special Performance and Monitoring Program. The banking system in Latvia is
going through a period of rapid evolution. In this type of market, where the legal and regulatory
environment is still is a process of adaptation, it is likely that very few banks would be able to meet the
financial and management criteria that normally are required to intermediate credit lines financed by Bank
loans. Moreover, the accuracy of the assessment of banks under these conditions is subject to a high
degree of uncertainty, so that even an acceptable current performance by a given bank might not
necessarily be a good guide for its future performance.
4.10          In these circumstances it will be necessary to maintain a close monitoring of PFIs and
other potential candidates for the intermediation of the proposed credit line. This would be one of the
central functions of the TU, which will closely liaise with the Bank of Latvia's Bank Supervision
Department. Also, the proposed project would provide technical assistance geared to strengthening term
lending skills of commercial banks.
4.11          Given that during the next three years--as a minimum--the Latvian economy in general,
and its banking system in particular, is expected to remain in a state of transition and consolidation, it
would be appropriate to relax the eligibility criteria initially for those banks that show potential and that



-32-
are willing to enter into a special performance and monitoring agreement with the TU. The agreed
program with each bank would set specific targets to be achieved over time, making its continued
participation in the intermediation of the credit line conditional on its timely compliance with the
programmed improvements in its performance. At the end of the transition period these special cases are
expected to comply fully with the PFI eligibility criteria. As pre-conditions to participate in this special
program, banks would have to (i) be in compliance at all times with the standard prudential regulations
applied to all banks by the Bank Supervision Department at the Bank of Latvia, and (ii) have an ongoing
agreement with acceptable external auditors. For each bank, the agreed adjustment program and its
timetable for implementation would be annexed to the Subsidiary Loan Agreement that would be signed
with the TU. The minimum requirements for a potential PFI to enter into such special side agreements
were agreed with the Government and the BOL at Negotiations.
4.12          The Credit Authorization Process. The credit risk associated with a specific subloan
will be entirely the responsibility of the PFI granting the credit.' Thus, neither the Bank nor the TU are
expected to duplicate the credit or project analysis done by the PFIs. The TU would concentrate on
performing ex-post quality controls to determine whether the credit regulations for subprojects and
subborrowers are being met. This should not only expedite the onlending process by the TU, but also
leave it more time for monitoring the soundness of PFIs, which is where the real threat of loan losses for
the Govermnent would lay. The PFI will have full autonomy on ex-ante credit decisions and selection
of subprojects under the credit line, subject to requirements defined in the CLRM. This notwithstanding,
subloan granting by a specific PFI could be subject to ex-ante reviews--to confirm that the PFI is adhering
to the CLRM--once a record of non-compliance or deficiencies are detected in the operation of a
particular PFI. Also, there would be an ex-ante subproject review and special subloan authorization
procedures for subloans above the free-limit threshold for each PFI, which would be set not higher than
US$600,000--e.g., for PFIs not subject to a special performance and monitoring program. In any event,
the authorization of the first two subsidiary loans for each PFI would require prior clearance from the
Bank, which would have to receive full documentation on these transactions. Such documentation should
also include all environmental requirements as specified in paragraph 4.25.
4.13          Eligible Subprojects and Subborrowers. The proposed credit line is geared to offer
medium and long-term credit support--one year maturity or more--for a wide range of private investment
activities in the country. A corporate borrower is understood to belong to the private sector if more than
50% of the ownership is in private hands and the controlling interest is also private. Newly privatized
and other emerging private sector enterprises would be able to obtain subloans from PFIs to finance their
fixed capital needs and associated permanent working capital requirements. Since the credit line would
be non-sector specific, subproject eligibility would be based entirely on its technical, financial, economic
and environmental soundness. Minimum eligibility requirements for subloans, based on subprojects and
subborrowers eligibility, would be defined in the CLRM. These will include minimum standards for
appraisal methodologies and risk assessments. Among other things, these assessments will include a
demonstration that the currency and interest rate basis of onlending is appropriate for the subborrower.
However, it would be the job of PFIs to decide the credit risks they would like to take and the subloans
they would grant, following their own credit screening criteria. The minimum subloan size would be the
equivalent of US$30,000 and the accumulated maximum subloans to any individual subborrower would
be the equivalent of US$3 million--whether they are granted by one or more PFIs. In order to give an
7.  The TU must be assured that a PFI has the capability of assessing credit risks, including lending in an
environment where price distortions (i.e., high tariff barriers) may persist in some subsectors.



-33-
additional incentive to the privatization process of state enterprises, it was agreed at Negotiations that
there would be a "set aside" of US$10 million equivalent of loan funds (US$5 million from the CPL,
US$3 million from the SCL and DM3.5 million from the SCL) for newly-privatized enterprises that become
eligible for subloans. This set aside would be in effect for the first eighteen months following loan
effectiveness. As an additional incentive, enterprises advanced in the privatization process would be able
to obtain commitments for subloans from PFIs for their subprojects, for disbursements once their
controlling interest and management were in private hands.
4.14          In order to encourage cofinancing from other sources, Bank resources would be able to
finance a portion of the overall term financing requirements of any given subproject, starting at 100%
of the needs of those subprojects authorized for financing during the first year following loan
effectiveness, declining to 85 % of total requirements in the second year and 70% from the third year on.
Bank financing of specific subprojects in the first year--taking account of the likely local cost element--is
expected to be no more than 90% of subproject cost. Starting in the third year following the Bank loan
effectiveness, each subproject should have at least a minimum of 15% of its total cost financed either by
new equity or directly by the subborrower's own resources. It would be the responsibility of the TU--
following the guidelines in the CLRM--to monitor that these maximum financing requirements of
subprojects are met by PFIs. For this purpose, the TU would have to make sure that all subloan
applications submitted to PFIs include information on the subproject's overall financing requirements and
their identified sources of funding. Other term financing, such as equity and debt, to be used in the
cofinancing of the subproject would be clearly identified in the subloan application. Standard working
capital loans, with a minimum maturity of six months, being granted to a subproject by a PFI could also
be considered as part of the required term cofinancing.8
4.15          Eligible Expenditures. In addition to financing investments in plant and equipment and
permanent working capital, the PFIs would be able to finance the following expenditures important for
adapting local production to greater competition: (i) workers' training required by the subproject; (ii)
consulting services to improve the subborrower's productivity or to prevent or reduce environmental
damage associated with the subproject; (iii) the cost of patents, licenses, and franchises needed for the
subproject's production process. Permanent working capital could not account for more than 20% of the
total subloan amount. Bank funds could not be used to refinance already existing subborrowers'
liabilities.
4.16          Relending Mechanism. PFIs would access the credit line by receiving subsidiary loans
which match subloans to their clients with respect to their amount, currency of denomination and maturity
profile. At the choice of PFIs, and as appropriate to match the revenue currencies of the subborrowers,
the TU would be ready to authorize subsidiary loans either in US dollars, deutsche marks or Latvian lati,
for onlending in the same currency to eligible subborrowers. The US dollar and deutsche mark subloans
will, in the first instance, be financed out of the two tranches of the single currency loan denominated
in these currencies, and neither the government nor the PFIs will retain any of the foreign exchange risk.
Onlending in lati will be financed out of the currency pool loan, and the govermnent will retain the
foreign exchange risk. In the case of the single currency loan, which will have tranches of US dollars
(US$10 million) and deutsche mark (US$5 million equivalent), loan proceeds will be onlent in the two
currencies. In the case of the currency pool loan, where US$14.58 million will be available for
8.  Items to be financed out of the proceeds of the Bank loan would also have to meet disbursement
requirements as stated in paragraphs 4.41.



-34-
disbursement (together with any funds subsequently reallocated from the other two components) the bulk--
but not necessarily all--of loan proceeds will be denominated in lati. Debt servicing by PFIs and
subborrowers would always be in the same currency in which the loan was originally denominated.
Disbursements would be made out of the Separate Project Account at the Bank of Latvia. For accounting
purposes, and for recording in the Separate Project Account, all transactions in currencies different from
US dollars or deutsche marks would be converted at the prevailing market exchange rate on the day such
transactions take place. When necessary, the Bank of Latvia would be ready to carry out the necessary
foreign exchange conversions. All this notwithstanding, subloans in foreign currencies would be granted
only so long as the Government maintains a free exchange regime.
4.17          The Republic would be exposed to some foreign exchange risk in connection with the
proposed relending mechanism for the currency pool loan. Indeed, it is likely that there would be a
mismatch between the pool of currencies in which that Bank loan would be made to the Republic and
the currencies in which the credit line could be intermediated in the local market, so that future
movements in exchange rates could cause exchange losses to the Republic. In order to cover these risks,
the interest rate charged on subsidiary loans to PFIs under the pool loan would include a fee in the form
of a spread above the Bank loan rate in order to insure the Republic against these potential exchange
losses.
4.18          Interest Rates on Subsidiary Loans. The aim of the Government would be to try to
onlend Bank funds to PFIs at interest rates as close to market rates as possible. However, at present there
is an absence of medium- and long-term market funding for banks in the domestic market, given that time
deposits are virtually all short term. Thus, there are no useful market indicators that could be used for
guidance when trying to determine a rate at which Bank resources could be onlent to PFIs. On the
contrary, the G-24 term funding that the government has been offering to commercial banks through the
BOL, and that so far has been their main source of project financing, has been supplied at subsidized
rates (currently at a fixed annual rate of 15.25%). This has led to significant credit rationing to
accommodate excess demand as well as to the allocation of funds--by the Credit Committee--among
competing projects according to political criteria. On the other hand, given their high level and volatility,
market-determined short-term interest rates are of little help when trying to determine an appropriate level
for a sustainable long-term rate for investment project financing.
4.19          The Government has agreed on the need to move towards market-determined interest rates
for the proposed Bank financed credit line and other term resources that the government projects to make
available to the private sector through the banking system. In order to avoid arbitrary credit allocations
and rationing the new mechanism would require that PFIs propose the rate they are willing to pay for
state funds--the Bank financed credit line included. This way a ranking would be made--from the highest
to the lowest rate--of those requests for subsidiary loans received by the TU (one for each specific
investment project PFIs wish to finance). Preference would be given to those requests with a higher rate.
Funds would be allocated according to this criteria until the pre-set volume of resources is exhausted,
provided that the lowest rate to which resources are allocated is no lower than the floor rate (defined
below). This method of credit allocation, therefore, constitutes a simple auction mechanism. The
government would retain any margin between the PFI offered rate and the floor rate. Once a subsidiary
loan has been committed, the resulting spread over the WB rate would be fixed until its final maturity.
4.20          The floor interest rate for subsidiary loans tries to capture the cost of funds for the
government. In the case of the Bank resources, it has been agreed that the cost of funds includes the
following components in addition to the IBRD rate: (i) the cost of setting up and operating the TU; (ii)



-35-
a premium to cover the exchange risks to the Republic implicit in the onlending mechanism (only in the
case of the currency pool loan); (iii) the fee charged by the BOL to act as the financial agent of the
Republic, and (iv) the cost of establishing a credit risk fund to insure the Republic against potential losses
that could result from poor servicing of the credit line by some PFIs. These four costs would be
incorporated as a spread over the Bank rate and it would be fixed once a subsidiary loan has been
granted. However, in order to reflect changes in the relevant Bank lending rates, the interest rates
charged on subsidiary loans would be reviewed semi-annually. Changes in the value of any of the
components of the spread would require the consent of the Bank. The detailed formula to determine the
floor interest rate would be included in the CLRM.
4.21         Unibank's use of the credit line. Unibank represents a special case in the use of the
Bank financed credit line. This state commercial bank is in the process of recapitalization and
restructuring prior to its privatization. It is expected that once Unibank's capitalization plan has been
implemented it would become eligible to intermediate the Bank financed credit line as a first-tier bank.
As part of the capitalization plan, the government has already replaced the bank's bad loans with non-
negotiable government bonds. The Government has requested that once Unibank becomes eligible to
intermediate the credit line, subloans that comply with the CLRM be used to replace an equivalent
amount of these government bonds. This process would--as noted in para 3.36--be governed by a Bond
Redemption Agreement. Subloans are expected to be more attractive to Unibank than government bonds,
since they would have shorter maturities and higher returns. In essence, the Bank's loan would be used
to redeem the bonds for cash, which would be simultaneously used to disburse an already approved
subloan. Because of this, subloans generated by Unibank would not be backed by a subsidiary loan on
the liability side--as would be the case for other PFIs--which would preclude its participation in the
general bidding process with other PFIs described in paragraph 4.19. Given that government bonds are
being issued and denominated in lati, the subloans granted by Unibank should also be expressed in lati.
Otherwise, there would be a currency mismatch with the liabilities on the balance sheet supporting these
subloans. During Negotiations it was confirmed that Unibank would be able to apply directly to the TU
for the use of the credit line, but it would have to qualify as a PFI and its subloans comply with the
CLRM. Furthermore, as a condition of loan effectiveness, a Bond Redemption Agreement, satisfactory
to the Bank, must have been executed by the relevant parties. Once subborrowers repay their subloans,
the funds would become available for general asset use by Unibank.
4.22         Interest Rates on Subloans. The interest on subloans would be negotiated freely
between each PFI and its client, taking into consideration market conditions and the risks involved.
Every effort will be made to create transparency in the rate setting process. The formula used to
calculate the rate would be incorporated into each Subloan Agreement and it would include a mechanism
to adjust it semi-annually to reflect changes in the PFI's subsidiary loan rate.
4.23         Maturities and Grace Periods. Depending on the subproject requirements, the maturity
for subloans granted to finance fixed capital formation, such as investments in plant and equipment,
would vary from 1 to 12 years with a maximum grace period for repayment of principal of 3 years.
Associated permanent working capital subloans would be for a maximum of 2 years with a 6 month grace
period.
4.24         Leasing financing. Leasing is just starting to be developed in Latvia. Special legislation
to properly regulate and support this financing technique is required before it becomes more widely used
as a way to finance new investment. Efforts are being made in the context of the project to identify
potential sources of funding to support technical assistance in this area. Once a legal and regulatory



-36-
framework satisfactory to the Bank is in place, the credit line would be made available for lease financing
through eligible leasing companies. Commercial banks would be able to intermediate the credit line as
lessors, as long as they establish leasing-dedicated subsidiaries that qualify for the intermediation of the
credit line on their own merits.
4.25          Enviromnental Requirements.  It would be necessary to establish an expedient
environmental screening mechanism for subprojects being financed by the proposed credit line. Since
the environmental legislation and regulations in Latvia are adequate, the main task would reside in making
sure that they are properly followed in the case of specific subprojects. As part of the technical assistance
supporting this component of the project, a Latvian/English manual would be produced containing the
Latvian environmental assessment requirements, so as to cover the information needs of PFIs and their
clients. This manual would also include a self-classification form to be used by subborrowers in
connection with those investment projects for which credit line financing is being requested. The manual
would be part of, and annexed to the CLRM. The self-evaluation form would have to be attached to
every subloan application and would be reviewed by the PFI recommending the operation. For this
purpose, technical assistance would be provided that would include a training session introducing the
environmental manual to lending officers in the PFIs (see Annex 5).  Furthermore, complete
environmental documentation would be required before authorization is granted by the TU for subsidiary
loans financing subloans above the free limit and for those going to subprojects that the self-evaluation
form determines to be in Categories "A" or "B" according to the Bank's Environmental Operational
Directives. Investment projects for which a subloan of over US$2 million equivalent is requested and
for which, according to Latvian law, an environmental assessment study is required must first present a
report satisfactory to the Bank before the respective subsidiary loan is authorized by the TU. PFIs would
be able to include in the subloan to their client the cost involved in the preparation of environmental
assessment studies. Technical assistance, valued at the equivalent of US$185,000, will be required for
the development and operation of an efficient environmental screening mechanism and for technical
assistance on the definition of environmental liability associated with past pollution of participating
subborrowers. As a condition of effectiveness, an environmental screening procedure for subproject
financing, satisfactory to the Bank, should be established (including an environmental assessment
manual).
4.26          Documentation Requirements. Before final approval, the first two subsidiary loan
requests submitted by any given PFI would have to be reviewed and authorized by the Bank. Full
documentation would be required for these two subsidiary loans. The Bank would make periodic sample
analyses of individual subproject appraisals during supervision missions. There would be a free limit of
no more than US$600,000 equivalent for PFIs, with the exception of those PFIs with an ongoing
performance and monitoring program which would have a free limit of half that amount. The Bank
would reserve its right to increase or decrease at any time the free limit level of any PFI. If the subloan
is above the free limit, the TU would review the basis used by the PFI in approving the subproject before
granting its approval. Besides the standard information required for subloans above the free limit, the
subproject documentation would have to include a supporting feasibility study of the investment project
and a thorough analysis of the operational and financial situation of the company.
4.27          In all cases, the TU would keep copies of the subloan application (submitted by the
subborrower to the PFI), the PFI's credit evaluation report and the Subloan Agreement. The TU would
not authorize the transfer of a subsidiary loan's proceeds except for reimbursement of actual payments
by the PFI for eligible expenditures specified in the Subloan Agreement.



-37-
4.28         To give fluency to the disbursement mechanism for subloans below each PFI free limit,
the TU would use an immediate disbursement system whereby: (i) the PFI would present the required
documentation to the TU together with a sworn statement indicating that the operation (subloan and
subborrower) and the associated requested disbursements comply with all the requirements under the
credit line; (ii) the TU would immediately authorize the disbursements by the Bank of Latvia, directly
to the PFI or to suppliers or contractors at the request of the PFI. After a disbursement has been made,
the TU would review the documentation presented by the PFI. If the ex-post analysis demonstrates non-
compliance by the PFI with the CLRM, penalties would be applied ranging from loss of the immediate
reimbursement option for subsequent subloans and disbursements, to loss of accreditation under the line,
to acceleration of outstanding balances.
4.29         Assistance for the Technical Unit. Key to a successful implementation of the proposed
project is an adequate performance by the TU, not only in the selection of PFIs, but also in the
overseeing of an appropriate application of the credit guidelines. Also crucial to the success of the
proposed operation is the existence of a number of well qualified lending officers in the emerging
domestic banking sector. Their absence would result in higher credit risks, probably in higher lending
spreads and in poor resource allocation. US$400,000 of the currency pool loan would be available to
finance a basic program of technical assistance to support the operation of the TU as well as for its
additional and recurring operating costs. In addition, basic training in the area of investment project
lending, project formulation and other related matters would be needed for a sound development of term
lending as a new line of business by the local banking industry. Also, technical assistance would be
necessary for an adequate promotion of the credit facility among the banks and their borrowers.
Although proceeds from the loan would be available to finance these activities, an effort will be made
prior to loan effectiveness to identify sources of grant funding for these technical assistance needs. EC
PHARE, the Danish Government and the Swedish Government are proposing to contribute to the
financing of the technical assistance required by the TU and the Project Management Unit.
4.30         The Swedish Capital Fund. The Swedish Capital Fund (SCF) would provide long-term
or permanent funding (e.g., through the purchase of subordinated bonds, preferred or common equity,
or other securities to be defined) to selected PFIs, which would then be used by a PFI to provide
cofinancing for subprojects also receiving funding from the Bank's credit line (Annex 1). US$2 million
is expected to be made available for selected commercial banks through the SCF. It is proposed that
capital be invested into a commercial bank in the ratio of US$1 of capital per US$1 of credit line.
During Negotiations agreement was reached on a "set aside" of US$2 million for the SCFfor eligible
PFIs. This "set aside " would be in effect for thefirst nine months following loan effectiveness. The funds
from the set aside will be disbursed to specific PFIs eligible for participation in the SCF established under
an Agreement, acceptable to the Bank, between the Borrower and the Government of Sweden. Given the
subordinated nature of the obligations financed by the SCF--as opposed to the more senior nature of the
Bank financed credit line--the risk associated with this financing is intrinsically higher than that associated
with senior lending. That is why the conditions under which the SCF would extend financing to PFIs
could be more stringent than those associated with the Bank financed credit line.
4.31         The SCF is expected to set apart funds to help the Government in the capitalization of
the state-owned Unibank (US$5 million) and Savings Bank (US$3 million), which currently are going
through a process of restructuring and rehabilitation leading to privatization. A decision on the modalities
of the Swedish Capital Fund in Latvia is expected in September 1994.



-38-
C. Institutional Development Component
4.32         The institutional development component would be channeled through the PMU and on
to the agencies executing each subcomponent. Funds from the currency pool loan would be deployed for
this component. In the case of technical assistance for privatization transactions, the executing body will
be the Privatization Agency. The implementation plan for this component is described in Annex 9. The
newly created TU will also deploy technical assistance funding to establish the Unit and finance additional
and recurring operating costs as well as the training of participating banks and promotional activities in
association with the establishment of the credit line. Resources from the loan to support this component
will also be channeled from the PMU to the LPA. As a condition for disbursement under this component
to LPA, a "Funds Transfer Agreement' between the Ministry of Finance and LPA, satisfactory to the
Bank, mustfirst be signed.
D. Financial Infrastructure Investment Component
4.33         The Bank of Latvia is responsible for the development of the payments system. The
funding for the computer hardware and software will be channeled through the PMU to the Bank of
Latvia. Funds from the currency pool loan would be deployed for this component. As a condition of
disbursement under this component to the BOL, a "Funds Transfer Agreement" between the Ministry of
Finance and the BOL, satisfactory to the Bank, must be signed. This component will be cofinanced with
EC PHARE and other grant donors that are being identified. The implementation plan for this component
is described in Annex 9.
E. Procurement
4.34         Procurement will be done in accordance with World Bank Guidelines for Procurement
dated May 1992. In the procurement of goods domestic manufactured goods may be awarded preference
in accordance with Bank Guidelines. For subprojects financed under the credit line component and
executed by subborrowers, procurement would take place in accordance with World Bank guidelines
according to the following thresholds: (i) contracts valued up to US$100,000 equivalent in the case of
goods, works and services would be procured using local commercial practices (as Latvia is a small, open
trading economy companies typically procure on the basis of multiple bids from a range of countries);
(ii) contracts valued between US$100,000 and US$500,000 equivalent in the case of goods and services
would be procured through International Shopping on the basis of at least three quotations from three
different countries and, in the case of works, would be procured through local competitive bidding; (iii)
all contracts above US$500,000 would be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
procedures. For ICB contracts, the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Goods (May 1994) would
be used. In some special cases, Direct Contracting might be used, but only if it meets standards and
procedures acceptable to the Bank, following the directives contained in paragraph 3.5 of the Procurement
Guidelines (May 1992). For easy reference the Procurement and the Consultant Guidelines and relevant
provisions in the Loan Agreement, concerning procurement, consultant selection and contracts, will be
annexed to the CLRM. Technical assistance will be given to PFIs to strengthen their capabilities in
procurement.



-39-
4.35           The institutional development component comprises a US$3 million subcomponent in
support of privatization (for the LPA)--US$2.5 million for technical assistance and US$0.5 million for
computer hardware and software--and a US$0.42 million subcomponent to finance office equipment for
the PMU and the TU, as well as technical assistance support and recurrent costs required for the
operation of the TU. The financing and procurement for this subcomponent would follow a program
previously agreed with the Bank. Any equipment contracts being financed for the PMU and TU--and
each below US$100,000-- would be procured using local commercial practices. Technical assistance for
the PMU and TU is expected to require a number of small consulting contracts. Contracts for individuals
of less than US$50,000 and companies for less than US$100,000 will require a review of the terms of
reference only. The Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (August 1981) will be applied for the
hiring of consultants. It is expected that to implement the technical assistance for the LPA, financed by
the Bank, there will be one large contract of US$2.5 million. Computer hardware and software for the
LPA is expected to be provided under at least two contracts and will require International Shopping.
4.36           Under the Financial Infrastructure Investment Component (US$2 million) the computer
software and hardware if packaged in contracts of more than US$500,000 would be procured under ICB.
Contracts under US$500,000 would be procured using International Shopping on the basis of at least three
quotations from three different countries.

Bank in replacement of non-performing loans.

4 For technical assistance, services will be procured according to the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of
Consultants (1981). Procurement of recurrent costs required for the operation of the TU will follow a program
previously agreed with the Bank. Office equipment would be procured through local shopping.
5/ This is expected to be procured through International Shopping. However, because of the size of the
equipment, there might eventually be a need to procure some of it through ICB.



-40-
4.37         In accordance with Articles 2.55 and 2.56 of the World Bank Guidelines for Procurement
dated May 1992, preference may be granted to local producers for ICB contracts for goods. All subloan
applications would include a discussion of procurement procedures used and criteria for selection of
suppliers of goods and services, and ensure that these conform with the Bank's Guidelines. PFIs and sub-
borrowers are expected to keep records on quotations requested. Evidence of those quotations would be
required for ex-post review during project supervision. The TU (in the case of the credit line component)
and the PMU will monitor adherence to the Procurement Guidelines and furnish appropriate reports to
the Bank.
4.38         The different procurement methods and the associated thresholds were confirmed with
the Governmnent at Negotiations. Prior review by the World Bank of procurement documentation would
be carried out for: (i) all contracts procured through ICB, (ii) the first contract for each of goods and
works, procured under local shopping, IS and LCB submitted by each PFI and; (iii) the first contract
under both the institutional development and financial infrastructure components.  Procurement
procedures and documents for other contracts would be subject to random review by the Bank during
project supervision. Contracts for consulting services of more than US$50,000 in the case of individuals
and more than US$100,000 in the case of companies will be subject to full review by the Bank.
F. Disbursements
4.39         To facilitate project execution, three Special Accounts, two in US dollars and one in
deutsche mark, will be established. One of the dollar Special Accounts would be used for the currency
pool loan and the other for the dollar tranche of the single currency loan. The deutsche mark Special
Account would be used for the deutsche mark tranche of the single currency loan. The Special Accounts
would be maintained in a major foreign commercial bank selected by the Government and acceptable to
the World Bank. The Bank would make initial deposits of US$1 million into each of the two US dollar
Special Accounts and DM850,000 into the deutsche mark Special Account.
4.40         Under the credit line component, the Bank would finance up to 100% of foreign
expenditures (C.I.F.), 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory costs) and 80% of local expenditures for
other items procured locally. In all cases, Bank reimbursements would be related to eligible expenditures
made not more than 120 days prior to submission of the application by the PFI to the TU. Expenditures
for individual contracts valued at under US$100,000 equivalent financed by subloans would be disbursed
against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) certified by the TU. The TU would ensure that all supporting
documentation is being adequately maintained and that it would be available for review at the Bank's
request. Disbursements for all contracts valued at or above US$100,000 would be made against fully
documented withdrawal applications. These disbursement arrangements would be incorporated in the
CLRM.
4.41         Disbursements in connection with the subcomponent to finance technical assistance for
the PMU and the TU and incremental recurrent costs required for the operation of the TU would be
disbursed against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Also SOEs would be used for disbursements on
contracts below US$100,000 for equipment in connection with the Institutional Development Component.
All other disbursements of the Institutional Development Component above a threshold of $100,000
would be made against fully documented withdrawal applications. The same threshold of $100,000 will
apply to disbursements under SOE procedures related to the Financial Infrastructure Investment
Component.



-41-
4.42          During Negotiations, it was agreed that an amount of US$1 million in eligible
expenditures, under the institutional development and financial infrastructure components of the currency
pool loan, would be financed retroactively to June 30th, 1994. A schedule of the estimated disbursements
under the two Bank loans taken together is shown in Annex 12. The loans are expected to take three
years to commit and four years to disburse.
G. Project Accounting, Financial Reporting, Auditing and Supervision
4.43          Accounting. The Borrower will have the responsibility for the appropriate accounting
for the funds provided by the Bank under the Loan, for reporting on the use of these funds, and for
ensuring that audits of the financial statements or reports are submitted to the Bank. The PMU, on behalf
of the Borrower, will establish an appropriate accounting system to provide information on the proper
receipt and use of funds in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The system should ensure timely and
accurate accounting of all transactions under the Loan and clear presentation of the financial information.
4.44          Financial Reporting. Financial reporting, to be carried out by the PMU, would closely
reflect the specific requirements of the Loan. It would comprise a statement of receipts and payments
for the reporting period since the beginning of the program. The reporting would be in accordance with
the disbursements classified and reported by the expenditure categories agreed with the Borrower and
spelled out in the legal documents. Quarterly progress reports would be submitted, including a separate
report with respect to the Special Account. A Project Completion Report will be submitted to the Bank
by the PMU promptly after the completion of the program, not later than six months after the loan
closing date.
4.45          Auditing. Financial statements and reports on the Loan (including the Special Account)
would be audited by an auditor acceptable to the Bank and the audit reports would be submitted to the
Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. Selected auditors must be: (i) impartial and
independent from the entity to be audited; (ii) well-established and reputable; (iii) experienced in type of
assignment to be undertaken; and (iv) able to fulfill the terms of reference required within the specific
timetable.
4.46          Project Supervision. The proposed project is complex in nature given that it straddles
two sectors (the enterprise and financial sectors). Furthermore with limited human resources in the public
sector in Latvia there will need to be a strong emphasis on supervision. Program supervision input by
Bank staff is therefore expected to be above average, particularly at the early stage of project
implementation. The establishment of a PMU will help facilitate smooth project implementation and
supervision. A project supervision plan was agreed with the Government during Negotiations (see Annex
11).



-42-
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits
5.1           The project will improve the marshalling and efficient allocation of resources in Latvia
by enabling improved intermediation. The heavy emphasis in the project on the restructuring of the
banking system, coupled with the strengthening of the financial infrastructure (through the upgrading of
the payments system), will place the financial system in a better position to support an enhanced level
of activity in the real sector. The project will also encourage new investment in the emerging enterprise
sector through the provision of medium- and long-term credit. By acting as a catalyst to the privatization
process the project will improve the supply response in the economy and quicken the transition to a
market-based economic system. Undergirding all of the loan components is a major effort to support the
development of institutions--and the associated skill transfers--that will be vital to the success of the
transition. The selection of SCL terms for a portion of the credit line will benefit subborrowers by
enabling them to select the currency of their loans to match their revenue streams and thereby helping
these enterprises manage their foreign exchange exposure. It also benefits the participating banks and
the government, as they can then onlend in the currency appropriate for the subborrowers without having
to assume the foreign exchange risk themselves. This should reduce the cost of intermediation and the
interest rate charged to final users.
B. Project Risks
5.2           The project is being developed against the backdrop of a fragile coalition government.
This increases the risk that the project objectives could be undermined by a sudden change in government.
Another risk is the development of unacceptably high budgetary costs associated with enterprise and
financial restructuring that might act as a drag on the reform process. With regards to the channeling
of the credit component any resurgence of inflation would curtail the trend towards lower nominal interest
rates. This could undermine the credit line by reducing the demand for credit by the private sector.
Similarly, there is some possibility that the highly profitable trade transactions (involving Russian
commodities and metals, and stimulated by Russian prices below international levels), which have been
financed at very high rates of interest, will not run down quickly. This type of financing is dominating
bank lending at present and distorting the interest rate structure. A specific risk to the bank restructuring
effort is that a further deterioration in the economy will lead to a significant future build-up of non-
performing loans that would undermine the stability of the banking system. The LIBOR basis of the
SCLs will add some interest rate sensitivity to the debt service of subborrowers on this subcomponent
of the credit line. Care should be exercised by PFIs in appraising projects to ensure that subborrowers
are capable of bearing this risk. Given the likely unfamiliarity of many subborrowers with the historical
volatility of LIBOR, PFIs also should be sure to inform them of these risks.

to the Bank, must have been signed (para 4.33).
B. Recommendation
6.3          The proposed Enterprise and Financial Sector Restructuring Project constitutes a suitable
basis for two IBRD loans, aggregating US$35 million equivalent and each repayable over 17 years
including 5 years' grace. One would be a US$20 million equivalent currency pool loan at the Bank's
standard variable rate. The second would be a single currency loan of two tranches: as US dollar tranche
in an anount of US$10 million equivale!nt at the Bank's standard US$ LIBOR-based rate; and a deutsche
mark tranche in an amount of DM8.5 million equivalent at the Bank's standard DM LIBOR-based rate.

ANNEX 1
Page 1 of 3
THE SWEDISH CAPITAL FUND
I. OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM
1.          The proposal outlined below has been developed in response to a number of factors
affecting the financial sectors of the three Baltic countries. First, there are new banks with small capital
bases in all three countries, implying a strong need for additional bank capital, as well as technical
assistance to bolster local banking skills. Second, there is a critical shortage of lending to enterprises--
particularly medium- and long-term lending (i.e., longer than one year)--because of a lack of domestic
term funding and the fact that commercial banks perceive the credit risks of such lending to be too high.
Third, the G-24 financing operations have made significant volumes of medium- and long-term funds
potentially available to the banking system; the volume of this funding is far in excess of lending volumes
which can be supported by existing bank capital and banking skills. While these G-24 funds are
potentially an extremely valuable resource for both the financial and enterprise sectors, the governments
are concerned that these funds might not be used in a prudent way. They are particularly concerned that
they be used in a manner which does not expose the Government to excessive risk of nonpayment when
the funds are channeled through the banking system for onlending to the industrial and agricultural
sectors.
2.          The Government of Sweden has indicated that it may be willing to make available as much
as SKr 300 million (approximately US$35 million) to restructure and recapitalize the banking sectors in
the Baltics. The proposed Government of Sweden project has, therefore, been structured to use these
funds to create a set of incentives which will encourage the local banks to undertake institutional
strengthening measures, including grant-financed technical assistance, in exchange for an injection of
capital which will expand their lending capacity and thus their profit opportunities. It assumes the
Swedish funds are part of a comprehensive package comprising Swedish capital funding, a Bank line of
credit, and a package of technical assistance. Although the Capital Fund would be managed under a
separate structure to the Bank credit line, selected banks eligible to receive additional capital from the
Fund would have to also be eligible at all times for participation in the Bank credit line. The qualification
criteria and conditions designed for the Bank credit line would be applied to disbursements under the
Capital Fund, which would cofinance investment projects utilizing the Bank credit line. This will ensure
that the banks undertake the technical assistance necessary to develop proper lending practices, and will
simplify bank and project screening. Thus procedures will be in place to ensure that banks will not
receive additional capital until their own banking operations, procedures and skills are developed enough
to support the risk of the additional lending that the new capital will permit.

II. STRUCTURE
3.          The details of this proposal are as follows:
(a)     The Swedish Government would make a contribution, to a special fund (the
Capital Fund). The fund may be linked to an existing Swedish aid agency, but
would have independent management. An initial allocation of 100 million
Kroner will be set aside for each of the three Baltic countries. If events indicate
that funds can be used more effectively in one country or another, reallocation
of funds will be considered.
(b)     Two primary uses of the Swedish capital funds are envisaged. The first would
be to expand the capital base of commercial banks that undergo institutional
strengthening (through technical assistance), and that provide long-term credit for
qualified projects. The second would be to provide equity injections into state-
owned banks as part of an overall restructuring plan or in the context of the
privatization of those banks.
4.          The expansion of the capital of private commercial banks:
(a)     The Bank would establish a Line of Credit (US$29.58 million in the case of
Latvia) in each of the Baltic countries, which would incorporate the standard
conditions of eligibility for participating financial institutions (e.g. financial
audits, financial ratios, loan loss experience, credit appraisal capacity, adequate
accounting and financial controls, etc.). Those banks that also participate in the
Capitalization Program of the Capital Fund would also be subject to specialized
conditions reflecting the need to protect the interests of the capital provider.
(b)     Technical assistance would be made available in conjunction with the Bank
project to assist banks which desired to participate in the Line of Credit/Capital
Fund, to meet the eligibility conditions. This technical assistance will be
financed primarily with bilateral grants.
(c)     When a commercial bank presents a project that qualifies for financing under the
Bank's Line of Credit, that commercial bank would also receive a contribution
to its capital from the Capital Fund. The capital would be provided on strictly
commercial terms to avoid any subsidy element in pricing. This additional
capital would increase the ability of the commercial bank to make loans, from the
Line of Credit, from G-24 sources or from other sources, under the Bank of
Latvia's risk capital regulations. This ability to increase its lending--and thus its
revenues--would be the main economic incentive for the conmmercial bank to
participate in the program. It is expected that US$2 million from the Capital
Fund will be allocated to selected commercial banks and US$2 million of the
credit line would be "set aside" for this purpose for a period of 9 months after
loan effectiveness.

5.         Restructuring State Banks. An injection of capital into state banks -- in Latvia Unibank
and the Savings Bank -- will only take place as part of a comprehensive restructuring and privatization
plan.
6.         In the case of the state banks, the plan would include the following:
(a)     A clear commitment to privatization of the state-owned bank would be announced
by the authorities, together with an endorsement of a restructuring program
leading to privatization over a specified target period.
(b)     Strong technical support will be given to: (i) develop an overall bank strategy;
(ii) strengthen credit management and other operating procedures; (iii) develop
and implement a troubled loan workout program; and (iv) develop an action plan
for privatization.
(c)     After new credit policies are in place and a workout strategy has been agreed
upon, a recapitalization would take place to the extent determined by a full audit
of the bank according to international accounting and auditing standards.
However, this recapitalization by the Capital Fund would only be implemented
if a credible institutional development program is in place, a full audit to
international standards has been completed, and a firm timetable leading to
privatization had been established. The injection of capital would be made prior
to, or at the point of, privatization.
7.         The Capital Fund has indicated that US$5 million would be made available to capitalize
Unibank, with US$3 million earmarked for the Savings Bank.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ASSISTANCE
IN ACCELERATED PRIVATIZATION THROUGH OPEN AUCTIONS
1.        Introduction: Latvia has embarked on a wide range of enterprise sector reforms. The
reforms require fast and effective ownership changes with privatization of state-owned enterprises as the
main component. These terms of reference outline a comprehensive program for the technical assistance
necessary to hasten the transition to a market economy dominated by private companies. Due to the
complexity of the project, the broad spectrum of expertise to be brought in, and the limited capacity of
the Latvian Privatization Agency (LPA), it is proposed that the consultants be organized in a consortium.
The consortium would consist of a consortium leader and subcontracted specialists in specific areas of
expertise. A full-time chief project manager will be hired separately to coordinate between consultants
and the LPA. An integral part of this program would be on-the-job training of local specialists. As the
primary supervisor of privatization process, the LPA wishes to engage the services of a consulting
consortium to implement the program of accelerated privatization through open auctions. The program
will be primarily financed from the World Bank loan.
2.        Background: The new institutional and regulatory arrangements for privatization are now
operational. This includes the establishment of the Latvian Privatization Agency with a broad range of
responsibilities. The Government's privatization targets--of privatizing over 100 enterprises in 1994 and
up to 200 enterprises annually over the next three years--can be achieved by the utilization of variety of
methods. The newly-adopted Privatization Law (the Law) envisions three privatization tracks: tenders
(including trade sales), auctions (including initial public offerings) and liquidation. Support for the
offering of shares to the general public in exchange for cash and privatization certificates on an open
auction basis will be supported by the technical assistance component of the World Bank loan.
3.        The Government declared its intention to treat the privatization process not only as a formal
step of transformation of the ownership but also as an important step for the improvement of the
performance of privatized companies. An important impediment to faster privatization in Latvia is a
shortage of experts needed for preparation of the enterprises for privatization and the lack of mechanisms
for selling shares/assets.
4.        The LPA will initiate privatization through auctions of consecutive groups of about 50
companies every six months. The first group of companies will include those with relatively good
prospects to survive after privatization and those not requiring major restructuring at the privatization
preparation stage. Potential claims of former owners and potential environmental liabilities will be
examined and questionable cases excluded. The preparation of selected companies, as described by the
Law, will be solely handled by the LPA. At this stage, the LPA will take measures leading to the
preparation and possible improvement of the companies transferred for privatization. Transactions
(selling of shares) will be accomplished through an open, competitive and transparent auction mechanism
with easy access for all willing to participate. A network of a sufficient number of points of sale (POS)
will be established to accept bid proposals of individuals to inform the public about companies offered
for sale. Bids will be processed by the Auction Center. All services necessary for an operation of the
auction system would be contracted-out to private agents, such as banks, brokers and other financial
intermediaries.



-55-
ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 4
The bidding mechanism should be later utilized for the secondary trade of shares, clearing and settlement,
depositary of shares and registrar of companies' shareholders.
5.        Proposed Activities: The following activities will be carried out by contracted consultant
teams in collaboration with the LPA:
(a)   preparation of companies for privatization
(b)   preparation of auctioning system
(c)   public relations campaign
6.        The acceleration of privatization requires a replicable and standardized method of preparation
of selected companies for privatization through open auctions. To this end about 10 advisory teams
should be formed. The teams would comprise local experts and foreign specialist with extensive
privatization experience in Central and Eastern Europe. The number of specialists in an individual team,
and time spent in one company, would vary depending on the size of the company and the complexity
of the case. A standard team would comprise: (a) an accountant/corporate finance specialist; (b) business
planning specialist; (c) market analyst; (d) local lawyer; (e) general privatization specialist who will also
serve as the LPA staff project manager. Each team would spend on average 10 working days in one
company and would prepare: an analysis of the present situation of the company with recommended
"soft" restructuring to be implemented by the LPA, a business plan, and a short prospectus for auction
participants. Business plans should meet the standards required for seeking financing available from the
World Bank line of credit after privatization. Also an evaluation of the privatized assets, as required by
the Law, would take place, however, in a standardized and simplified form.
7.        The building of the necessary capacity for an open auction mechanism will require support
in designing the system and training for POS staff.
8.        A public relations firm should be contracted to promote the proposed privatization program.
9.        Latvian Counterpart: A committee will manage the LPA participation in this comprehensive
program of technical assistance and will serve as the principal counterpart to the consultant consortium.
The committee will include the director of the LPA, his/her deputy responsible for the project, a chief
project manager, as well as local and foreign experts. The committee, or its subgroups, will collaborate
closely with the consultants in the performance of the various tasks under the program. The LPA is
expected to perform much of the actual work of hiring and designating managers of particular
privatization teams.
10.       Expected output:  Activity I - Preparation of companies for privatization. Standard
documentation and recommendation will be prepared for each company. The format of documentation
should be proposed by the consultant, taking into account the guidance set out below, international
standards and recommendations of the LPA. It would be also agreed with the LPA and the World Bank.
A.   The examination report should provide a comprehensive view of a company's
financial, employment and market condition; its performance; and future prospects.
It is important that the report clearly state its conclusions concerning the company's
overall condition in each of the following areas:
1) Balance sheet, income and cash flow analysis
2) Products and market analysis
3) Employment analysis



-56-
ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 4
4) Management qualifications
The report should give specific recommendations for action to the LPA.
B.   The business plan should comprise pro forma financial statements in a format
acceptable for a loan application to Latvian banks (in particular, the World Bank line
of credit).
C.   A short (three page) prospectus should be made available to participants of the
auctions. These should present the findings of the report and the recommendations
for improving the company viability.
11.       Activity 2 - Preparation of the auction system. The consultant will propose a simple, but
robust, system of accepting bids and allocation of shares taking into consideration local conditions. The
project would include:
1)  document formats and flows;
2)  recommendation of necessary staff, software and hardware for each individual
POS and Auction Center;
3)  budget for implementation and operation of the system.
4)  monitoring system.
The consultant will train staff of the Auction Center and POS to operate the system in an appropriate
way.
12.       Activity 3 - Public Relation Campaign. A detailed action plan will be proposed to the LPA,
including: the main messages promoting the program, media to be utilized, budget and time schedule
for implementation.
13.       Interim Reporting: The consortium leader will be required to report in writing to the LPA
and the World Bank on the status of the work program and provide preliminary results on a bimonthly
basis.
14.       Comprehensive reports should be prepared after the completion of privatization of
consecutive group of companies. The report should be completed in final form one month after
concluding the auction process (allocation of shares). The report on the first group of companies should
include recommendation for improvement of consecutive privatization. The reports should be presented
to, and discussed with, the LPA and the World Bank. All reports should be prepared in Latvian and
English.
15.       Qualifications of Consultants: Curriculum vitae (CV) should be provided by the consultants
to be employed in the actual performance of the various tasks. The allocation of time spent by particular
consultants on the implementation of the project should be presented. Significant proven experience in
privatization in Eastern/Central Europe and FSU is essential. In addition, it is highly desirable that some
members of the consulting teams are fluent in written and spoken Latvian. Knowledge of Russian is also
valuable.

ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE UNDER
TBE ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING LOAN
Terms of Reference
1.        Introduction.  Latvia is developing a program of Enterprise and Financial Sector
Restructuring for which it anticipates receiving financial support from the World Bank. One component
of this loan will be a Credit Line (US$29.58 million) which will incorporate the standard conditions of
eligibility for participating financial institutions (e.g. financial audits, financial ratios, loan loss
experience, credit appraisal capacity, adequate accounting and financial controls, etc.). A second
component (of US$3 million) will provide institutional development support primarily for privatization
through an auction process.
2.         One of the conditions of the credit line component is that the financial institutions processing
the loans take into account the environmental legislation of Latvia and the policy of the World Bank on
environmental assessment (Operational Directive 4.01). Screening of individual sub-projects by the
commercial banks (project implementing institutions) will be required and those projects which require
environmental impact assessment under Latvian law must receive project approval prior to finalization
of lending. These approvals are issued by either the Environmental Impact Assessment Board of Latvia's
Ministry of Environment and Regional Development or by the Ministry's Regional Environmental
Protection Committees, depending on the classification of the proposed project under Latvia's
environmental assessment guidelines.
3.         Scope of Work. The Consultants would prepare relevant written information on the
environmental assessment (EA) of investment projects as well as undertake a program to develop the
ability of the PFIs to screen the individual sub-projects. The publication of EA guidelines and a self-
classification form for investment projects in Latvian and English would benefit the PFIs, the Latvian EA
Board and potential investors. The local consultant group undertaking this work is expected to be familiar
with the EA process in Latvia and in Western Europe.
4.         Support for the Banldng Sector. The following major tasks would be conducted by the
local consultants.
(a) Consultation. The local consultants would consult with both the Environmental Impact
Assessment Board, the participating commercial banks, and the Technical Unit in order to
understand their views and concerns in regard to the substance of the training program
proposed for commercial bank personnel. The consultants would take into account the
World Bank loan documentation, including the Operating Procedures of the Technical Unit
and the Credit Line Regulation Manual. The Latvian Chamber of Commerce and the
Latvian Privatization Agency would also be contacted and their views solicited.

ANNEX 5

(b) Review of Current Environmental Assessment Procedures. The local consultants
would review the current, legislation and regulations that are in force in the Republic of
Latvia concentrating on "Environmental Impact Assessment."
(c) Preparation of Environmental Assessment Manual. The local consultants would
prepare for publication a manual of no more than 25 pages on environmental assessment
procedures in Latvia directed to the needs of the banking community in reviewing potential
loans. The manual would be prepared in both the Latvian and English languages. The
manual would be suitable for use both during the training process and in everyday banking
business. The manual would provide a review of the applicable environmental procedures
and include concise overview of the types of environmental issues commonly encountered
in commercial bank lending operations in Latvia. It would include, but not be limited to,
the following items:
(i)    An annotated list of Latvian environmental laws, regulations and
procedures which are related to the development of economic activities
(such as those on environmental assessment, natural resource charges,
coastal zones, emissions limits for pollution, and endangered species, for
example);
(ii)    A list and short descriptions of environmental permits necessary to
initiate economic activities;
(iii)   More detailed summaries of the regulations most directly concerning
investment activities (such as the Law  on Environmental impact
Assessment); and
(iv)   A list of contact institutions in the Latvian government for inquiries
regarding specific environmental and permitting issues.
(d) Self-Classification Form. The manual would also include a Self-Classification Form
to be used by subborrowers in connection with those projects for which credit line financing
is being requested. This Self-Classification Form would have to be attached to every
subloan application. It is foreseen that after reviewing the manual, subborrowers would fill
in the form listing the potential environmental impact of the proposed project and the status
of environmental permits necessary for the project's realization. The Self-Classification
Form will be used by credit officers in the PFIs for credit approval.

(e) Traidng Program. The local consultants,in consultation with the rest of the TA
program, would design and implement a training program directed chiefly at the employees
of commercial banks dealing with loan evaluation. The program would include "training
of trainers." Participants in the training program should also include representatives- of the
following:
the Environmental Impact Assessment Board;
the Regional Environmental Protection Committee Environmental
Boards;
the Latvian Privatization Agency; and
the Latvian Chamber of Commerce.
The training session would be conducted by the local consultants in Riga primarily in the
Latvian language. The course would introduce the key written materials including the
Environmental Assessment Manual to the participants. A case-study approach, utilizing
case-studies of environmental assessments prepared in Latvia, would be used to familiarize
the participants with the practical application of environmental assessment requirements.
The training sessions be scheduled to take place on a half day basis (mornings or
afternoons) for one working week.
(f) Translation of the World Bank Envirommental Assessment Sourcebook. The local
consultants would translate relevant sections of the World Bank's Environmental Assessment
Sourcebook into Latvian for the use of the Board. The choice of sections for translation
would be determined in coordination with the World Bank Regional Environmental
Specialist in Riga.
5.         Inception Report. The consultants would submit a draft version of the manual within 45
days of start-up. The final draft of the manual would be submitted 40 days later.
6.         Proposed Cost Schedule. The total cost of the consulting work is US$ $7,500, including
honorary and office expenses. The World Bank Regional Office will provide international telephone and
fax services. This sum will be payable as a fixed sum as follows:
25 percent at the initiation of work
40 percent upon delivery of the first draft
35 percent upon delivery of the final draft and completion of the training program
7.         Support for Environmental Management Institutions. The following major tasks would
be conducted under the element of activity directed towards strengthening the government institutions
responsible for supervision and management of the environmental assessment process - the Environmental
hnpact Assessment Board and the Regional Environmental Protection Committees:

the Board would attend 1-2 month courses in environmental impact assessment. This
training would be followed by an internship in a national environmental institutions dealing
with environmental assessment for one employee and an internship in a private consulting
firm which regularly prepared environmental assessments for the other employee.
(e)     Environmental Audits. The foreign consultants would provide assistance for
the development of proposed procedures for the use of environmental audits as an
alternative to the preparation of environmental assessments. Efforts would focus on the use
of environmental audits in the evaluation of proposed investments for the rehabilitation
and/or upgrading of industrial and energy facilities. Board staff would be provided with
a short-course in environmental audits which would include a practical exercise to be
conducted at an industrial facility in Latvia. This work would be coordinated with the
program for industrial auditing and waste-minimization being conducted in Latvia by the
World Environment Center with support for the United States Agency for International
Development.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
A.    Institutional Development Component
1.    The complete implementation of the privatization subcomponent of the project will take 18 months
(Chart IA). This privatization will take place in replicable seven months cycles. The time profile of an
individual cycle is presented in Chart 1B. The length of each cycle is dictated by the requirements of
the privatization law, and the availability of staff resources.
2.    Prior to the first cycle, three groups of personnel will be selected: a) a general project manager
coordinating the work of consultants and the LPA, b) the Latvian managers of particular consultants'
teams, c) the consortium of consultants implementing the project. The tendering process and installation
of all the above personnel will take three months.
3.    An adequate network of points of sale (POS) will be established throughout the country to provide
information about companies offered for sale and to accept bid proposals. These POS will be linked to
a central auctioning unit.  All services necessary for the operation of the auction system will be
contracted-out to private agents, such as banks, and their personnel trained in necessary procedures. This
phase will last 4 months.
4.     Latvian Privatization Agency will initiate privatization through auctions of consecutive groups of
about 50 companies every 6 months (a cycle). The LPA will prepare the list of companies to be offered
to the general public by an open auction once approval by the Council of Ministers has been obtained.
Approved companies will be transferred to the LPA from the respective government institutions. This
will require two months. Preparation of the selected companies, as described by the Privatization Law,
will be solely handled by the LPA. At this stage the LPA is obliged to notify its intention to privatize
selected companies, to investigate potential claims of former owners, and announce the adopted
privatization plan for particular companies. At this stage the LPA will also undertake measures to
prepare companies selected for privatization. The time spent in any one company will vary depending
on the size of the company and complexity of a case; on average it will be 2 weeks per company. This
phase will last two months. Transactions (selling of shares) will be accomplished through an open,
competitive and transparent auction mechanism with easy access for all those willing to participate. The
collection of bids and allocation of shares will last two months.
5.     A public relations campaign will be developed simultaneously with the preparation of companies
and auctioning of shares.
6.     Progress in privatization will be reviewed at the end of the second cycle. The complexity of the
project requires that the Bank staff will make short (3-5 days) visits every 2 months to supervise the
progress of the project.

B.    Credit Line Component
7.    The Government agreed during Negotiations on an implementation program for the Credit Line
Component. The main implementation steps are summarized in Chart 2 attached.
(a)   It has been agreed that the Technical Unit (TU) for channeling this credit will be
established as an Agency attached to the Ministry of Finance.  To facilitate the
establishment of this Agency, a decree was issued in June 1994.
(b)    The Government also identified a person to head the TU in June. Meanwhile, the main
financing arrangements for the TU are being put in place. Four of the key foreign
advisors are being financed by the Government of Sweden (2 positions), Government of
Denmark (1 position), and EC PHARE (1 position). Candidates for these positions, as
well as the other local staff, will be recruited over the period July-September 1994. The
TU structure and staffing requirement is set out in Annex 7.
(c)    Consultants have been engaged-with considerable experience in establishing TUs in other
parts of the world-to work closely with the Latvian TU between August and November
1994. These consultants will assist in training the TU staff and preparing the manuals
and files required to develop the onlending function.
(d)    The banks that seek participating status-from the set reviewed by the Appraisal mission-
will be closely examined by the staff of the TU, drawing on the international audits that
will be made available over the next 3-6 months. The first five banks are expected to be
declared eligible during October and November 1994.
(e)    The first disbursements under the credit line are expected to take place in Novemiber
1994.

C. Financial Infrastructure Investment Component
The Bank of Latvia agreed during Negotiations on an implementation plan for the development
of the Latvian payments system. The following steps have been incorporated into the implementation
plan:
-      By September 1994, the Bank of Latvia will have formally approved the feasibility study
on payments system development prepared by a consulting team in Norway.
-       By the end of November 1994, the Bank of Latvia will have identified, with the World
Bank's assistance, all funding sources needed to complete the financing of Phase 1 of the
project.
-       By December 1994, standards will have been developed for payments orders, accounting,
control, and information technology, as well as for service and stability standards.
-       By December 1994, the invitation to tender for consulting services and equipment under
Phase 1 will have been issued.
-       The implementation phase will take place during the period January 1995 through July
1996. The major hardware costs will be incurred during the second half of this period.
Simultaneous with the above steps, efforts will begin immediately to improve the legal
infrastructure for control, accounting, data protection, etc. Furthermore, a range of educational programs
will be run in an effort to: establish knowledge and trust in the payments system among the population
at large; and, enhance banking, accounting and auditing skills for personnel managing payments in the
system.           Chart 3: Financial Infrastructure Investment Component
