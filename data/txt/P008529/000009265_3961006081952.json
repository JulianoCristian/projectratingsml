These reforms will pave the way for\n            improved intermediation through the banking sector. The\n            credit component of the loan will act as an incentive to the\n            development of intermediation at the medium- and long-term\n            end of the maturity spectrum. The project will have three\n            components: 1) a credit line component that will provide\n            resources for commercial banks to make medium- and long-term\n            loans to recently privatized and other private sector\n            Latvian enterprises for investment and related permanent\n            working needs; 2) an institutional development component\n            that will support the Latvian Privatization Agency by\n            financing an accelerated privatization track through open\n            auctions, and to also support the development of a Project\n            Management Unit and a Technical Unit; and 3) a financial\n            infrastructure investment component for computer hardware\n            and software for payments system development."}, "docdt": "1994-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
