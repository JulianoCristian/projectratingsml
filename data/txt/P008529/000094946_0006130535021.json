Key lessons learned include: 1)\n            It is important to put in place good management and a good\n            management structure in complex institution-building\n            projects. 2) This project suffers from misunderstanding of\n            complex Bank disbursement procedures. These added to the\n            transaction costs of the credit line and slowed down the\n            lending process. Both disbursement and procurement\n            procedures need to be simplified as far as possible. 3) In\n            terms of project design, the need for flexible management\n            and willingness to find solutions by refining the design are\n            important lessons of experience for all financial\n            intermediary loans (FILs). 4) The course correction came as\n            a result of good quality supervision which in turn benefited\n            from continuity. It is a feature of institution building\n            projects such as FILs that intensive continuous supervision\n            is essential. 5) The intervention of the Bank may not be\n            feasible in a highly competitive financial market. The\n            \"window of opportunity\" for the Bank needs to be\n            carefully judged, and speed is needed to take advantage of\n            it. 6) Where working capital finance is an integral part of\n            an enterprise's investment program, it should be\n            regarded as performing the same function as fixed capital."}, "docdt": "2000-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
