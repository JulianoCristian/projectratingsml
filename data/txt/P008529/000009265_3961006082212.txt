MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENATION OF TNE PRESIDENT
OF THE lNTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED LOANS
FOR
AN ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR RESTIRUCTURING PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and reconmendation on two
proposed loans to the Republic of Latvia for the equivalent of US$35 million to help finance an Enterprise
and Financial Sector Restructuring project. The first is a single currency loan with a US dollar tranche
of US$!0 million equivalent and a deutsche mark tranche of DM8.5 million eqvivalent. This loan will
be repayable in seventeen years including 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based interest
rate for US dollar and deutsche mark SCLs, respectively. The second is a US$20 million currency pool
loan at the Bank's standard variable rate repayable over seventeen years including five years of grace.
2.           Sector Background.  In the enterprise sector structural reforms encompassing
privatization of rural land and small businesses have been progressing well; but, privatization of medium
and large scale enterprises has been at a virtual standstill since 1991. The current government, however,
is comnmitted to quickening the pace of privatization. Progress has been made in preparing the legal and
institutional infrastructure to begin the mass privatization of medium and large-scale enterprises. An
amended Privatization Law was enacted, for instance, in March 1994 and a State Property Fund and
Privatization Agency have been established. A first phase of privatization transactions is now being
prepared with the assistance of the Bank and a number of bilateral and multilateral donors.
3.           In the financial sector the reform process-particularly the restructuring of the banking
sector-had been proceeding slowly until early 1993. However, considerable progress has now been made
in addressing the future of the 49 branches of the Bank of Latvia that were formerly branches of the
Soviet specialized banks. Some branches have been sold to existing banks, some have been privatized
individually, and the remaining 19 have been amalgamated into a new state commercial bank-the
Universal Bank of Latvia (Unibank)-which the Government intends to privatize. The Government has
also decided to rehabilitate and privatize the Savings Bank, which has a large branch network and still
commands the confidence of the public at large. World Bank preparatory nissions have been working
with the Latvian authorities since February 1993 on a strategy for addressing the strucal issues in the
banking system.
4.           Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operadons.  Previous bank involvement in
project implementation in Latvia has been limited to the Rehabilitation Project (Ln 35250 LV) and the
Agricultural Development Project (Ln 3695 LV). In addition to this involvement, the experience of a
number of bank missions to Latvia bas underlined the inadequacies in management and institutional
capacity to support adjustment and restructuring. Experience in Eastem Europe also points to the
necessity of supporting enabling institutio-s as the economy opens to entrepreneurial activity. Another
pertinent lesson from this region is that bank and enterprise reform should proceed, to the extent possible,
in tandem. The Latvian bankng system has begun to act as a channel for credit lines, most recently
through facilities provided by the G-24 and IMF. Experience with the former facility suggests that, on
the one hand, there is a significant demand for longer-term funding. On the other, the reported misuse
of funds in some speciic cases suggests that it is important to design and implement a robust mechanism
for the channeling of credit.



-2-
5.           Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank has a firm commitment to assisting Latvia
undertake the difficult transition from a centrally planned to a narket economy. However, structural
reforms in the enterprise and financial sectors have, until rel.'tively recently, proceeded slowly in Latvia.
Given the central impormance of the two sectors to the economy, it is vital to reinvigorate the reform
process in these areas if the overall reform program is not to stall.
6.           The proposed project is designed to provide an impetus to the reforms in the enterprise
and financial sectors and bring closer the point at which income and employment generated by new
industrial activity begins to exceed income and employment falls in the declining industries. The project
is consistent with current bank policy in that it helps to catalyze trans-sectoral support for private sector
development, privatization and subsequent restructuring. As Latvia is a new member, an interim Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed when the first Bank-supported Rehabilitation Loan (Ln 35250
LV) was presented in October 1992. A comprehensive CAS, to be presented to the Board alongside this
project, provides a full discussion of the Bank's assistance strategy for Latvia of which this project is an
integral component.
7.           Project Objectives. The project's main objective is to support-and help accelerate-the
Government's reforms in the ttiterprise and financial sectors, focussing in particular on entetprise
privatization and bank restructuring. An important aspect of this is the design and implementation of a
coordinated stregy of reform for both sectors and the development of skills for addressing problems on
the interface between the sectors (i.e., work-out capacities for dealing with bad debtors). These reforms
will pave the way for improved intermediation through the banldng sector, specificaly to newly-privatized
and other emergng private sector enterprises. To further support intermediation thogh the banking
system, the project will assist in the development of the payments system. The credit component of the
loan wi1l act as a catalyst to the development of intermediation at the medium- and long-term end of the
maturity spectrum and will encourage new investment in the emerging private sector. A key objective
in this context will be the establishment of a strong mechanism-a Technical Unit-for channeling credit
lines to the private sector.
8.           Project Description. The project comprises the following three components: (1) a
Credit L;ne-in tandem with a Capital Fund for bank capitalization that is expected to be provided by the
Government of Sweden-to finance investme and related permanent working capital needs in newly
privatized and other private sector enterprises; (2) an Insitonal Development Component, in support
of the Latvian Privatization Agency (LPA), the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the Technical Unit
(TU); and (3) a Financial Irfrastrutre Invesonen Component, for the purchase of computer hardware
and software for payments system development.
(1)   CreditLine Component (US$29.58mllion'): This component will be financed out
of the single currency loan-US$10 million and DM8.5 million (about US$5.0
million equivalent)-and US$14.58 million equivalent from the currency pool
loan. The purpose of the credit component is to provide resources for invesmunent
finance (and associated permanent working capital) for newly-privatized
enterprises and other private sector enterises. US$10 million of the credit line
will be earmarked for newly privatized enterprises. If this element is not
I   This amount includes US$980,000 of unallocated funds under the currency pool loan that are expected to be
deployed in the credit line.



-3 -
disbursed within eighteen months, it will be made available for other private
sector borrowers. This component will be supported by the Swedish Government
in the form of a Capital Fund (of US$10 million) that will be used for bank
capitalization. A small number of private commercial banks will be eligible for
injections of capital (US$2 million) from this Fund. These will also be recipients
o funds- from the credit line. Unibank and the Savings Bank are also expected
to be direct recipients of a capital injection from the Capital Fund (US$5 million
and US$3 million, respectively). The Government has already replaced non-
performing loans in Unibank's balance sheet with government bonds as part of
an overall recapitalization program for the bank. Over time, as Unibank
develops acceptable investment projects, subloans under the credit line will
replace the bonds (which will then be extinguished). The Savings Bank-which
has also been recapitalized by an injection of govenment bonds-will not,
however, be a participating bank for the channeling of the credit line.
(2)   Institaional Development Component (US$3.42 million): This component is
financed entirely from the currency pool loan. A subcomponent for the LPA
(US$3 million) will help to fill critical gaps in the overall progr -- of TA being
provided to support the enterprise privatizaton process by a ra.6;  of bilateral
and multilateral donors. Grant funding will be sought to finance this component
also, where possible. Where additional grant funding is obtained there will be
a reallocation of this loan component's proceeds to the credit line component.
The technical assistance being included under this component (US$ 2.5 million)
will support the auction track of the Mass Privatization Program. Channeled
through the Latvian Privatization Agency, loan funds will be used to assist in the
preparation of selected enterprises for privatization, specifically through the
provis .n of basic pre-privatization financial and organizational restucturing. To
this end, about 10 advisory teams will be formed, comprising local experts and
foreign specialists with extensive privatization experience in Cental and Eastern
Europe. Each team will analyze the economic and financial situation of the
enterprise, recommend 'soft' restructuring measures to be taken prior to auction,
develop a strategic business plan, and prepare a short prospectus for auction
participants. The loan will also finance the equipment necessary for a bidding
center to facilitate the auction process. US$0.5 million will also be used to
finance computer hardware and software for strengthening the LPA and for
establishing the auction mechanism. A subcomponent of US$0.42 million will
also be provided to strengthen the PMU and the TU. With regard to bank
restructunng, the Bank has taken the lead during the loan preparation phase in
providing assistance, with the help of a PHRD grant, for rehabilitating Unibank.
During the loan in   phase, the Bank has secured resources from a
range of donors in support of the further institutional development and
privatization of Unibank and the Savings Bank.
(3)   Financial Infrasructure Investment Component (US$2.0 million):  This
component is financed entirely from the currency pool loan. The Government
has decided to undertake a modernizaon of the domestic payments and clearing
system. In the first phase of development, which will be supported under the
loan, the existing payments and clearing mechanism will be upgraded to Western



-4 -
standards. This component will finance the acquisition of comrputer hardware and
software equipment to assist the Bank of Latvia in the upgrading of the payments
system. The component will be cofinanced by EC PHARE and bilateral donors.
If, subsequently, grant sources are identified to finance equipment needs, the
proceeds of this component will be reallocated to the credit line component.
9.           Project Inplemeutaton. The proposedproject would be supported by the establishment
of a strengthened Project Management Unit in the Ministry of Fiance and a new Technical Unit that will
be an independent state entity. The project cost is estimated at US$114 million equivalent, with a foreiga
exchange component of US$61 million equivalent (54%). The Bank's standard variable interest rate
would be charged on the disbursed portion of the currency pool loan. For the single currency loan - in
US dollars and deutsche mark - t*. Bank's standard LIBOR-based interest rate for the relevant currency
will-be charged. Of the total financing requirement of US$114 million, the Bank will fmance US$35
million (31%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Republic of
Latvia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 12977 LV dated August 5, 1994, is being distributed separately.
10.          Agrements reached at Negotiations. Agreements were reached at Negotiations on:
(1) the overall structuring of the loan; (2) the organization, staffing, functions and financing of the PMU
and TU; (3) the guidelines for the Credit Line Regulations Manual and the Operating Procedures for the
TU; (4) the framework for the Special Performance and Monitoring Program for participating banks, and;
(5) environmental review procedures and the content and scope of environmental technical assistance.
In addition, agreements were reached on two "set asides." First, a set aside of US$10 million equivalent
of loan finds for newly-privatzed enterprises that become eligible for subloans. This set aside would
be in effect for the first eighteen months following loan effectiveness. Second, a set aside of US$2
million for the Swedish Capital Fund (SCF) for eligible participating financial institutions (PFIs). This
would be in effect for the first nine months following loan effectiveness. The funds from the set aside
will be disbursed to specific PFIs eligible for participation in the SCF established under an Agreement,
acceptable to the Bank, between the Borrower and the Govermment of Sweden. The following conditions
of effectiveness were established: (i) the V'-bsidiary Loan Agreements between at least two participating
banks and the Bond Redemption Agreement for Unibank, satisfactory to the Bank, must have been
executed by the relevant parties; (ii) a Financial Agency Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, must have
been signed and a Separate Project Account must be opened at thi Bank of Latvia on behalf of the
Republic; (iii) the TU must have been staffed in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (iv) an environmental
screening procedure for subproject financing, satisfactory to the Bank, must be established (including an
Environmental Assessment Manual); (v) a model of the Subloan Agreement, satisfactory to the Bank,
must be submitted to the Bank; (vi) a privadzation program for Unibank, satisfactory to the Bank, must
be prepared; and (vii) the Credit Line Regulations Manual and the Operating Procedures of the TU must
have been agreed with the Bank.
11.          Environmental Aspects. This project is classified as a category "B" project involving
intermediary lending. An enviromnental review mechanism will be built into the subproject approval
process. Technical assistance will be provided to strengthen the capacities of the Ministry of
Environment to monitor subprojects. Technical assistance will also be provided to help the Govermnent
develop legislation that will address the issue of liability for past pollution in regard to enterprises that
are being privatized.



-5-
12.          Project Benefits. The project will assist tht marshalling and efficient allocation of
resources in Latvia by enabling improved intermediation. The heavy emphasis in the project on the
restructuring of the banking system, coupled with the strengthening of the flivancial irastructure (through
the upgrading of the payments system) will place the fir_ncial system in a better position to support an
enhanced level of activity in the real sector. The project will also encourage new investment in the
emerging enterprise sector through the provision of medium- and long-term credit. By acting as a catalyst
to the privatization process it will improve the supply response in tL. econonw- and quicken the transition
to a market based economic system. Undergirding all of the loan components is a major effort to support
the development of ir.ditutions-and the associated skill transfers-that will be vital to the success of
transition. The choice of single currency loan terms for a portion of the credit line will enable the
onlending of that currency which is best suited to the needs of the subborrowers without requiring the
govermnent or the conunercial banks to take the foreign exL ange risk.
13.          Risks. The project is being developed against the backdrop of a fragile coalihion
governnent. This increases the risk that project objectives could be undermined by a sudden change in
government. Another risk is the development of unacceptably high budgetary costs associated with
enterprise and financial restructuring that might act as a drag on the reform process. With regards to the
channeling of the credit component, any resurgence of inflation would curtail the trend towards lower
nominal interest rates. This could undermine the credit line by reducing the demand for credit by the
private sector. Similarly, there is some pcssibility that the highly profitable trade transactions (involving
trading in Russian commodities and metals which is stimulated by Russian prices. below international
levels), which have been financed at very high rates of interest, will not run down quicldy. This type
of financing is dominating bank lending and distorting the interest rate structure at present. A specific
risk to the bank restructuring effort is that a ftrther deterioration in the economy will lead to a significant
future build-up of non-performing loans that would undermine the stability of the banking system. The
LIBOR basis of the single currency loan component may create interest risk for those subborrowers
whose revenues do not have the same interest rate sensitivity: credit appraisals should take into accoun
the capability )f subborrowers to manage this risk.
14.          Recoendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would oomply with the Articles
of Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
