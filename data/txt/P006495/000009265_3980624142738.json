overall\n            outcome of the project is satisfactory, performance of the\n            Bank was satisfactory, and the performance of the Borrower\n            was also rated as satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned\n            from the project are: 1) the use of a large portion of the\n            Project funds to support environmental programs in large\n            facilities recognized as major polluters of a region will\n            result, once the programs are fully implemented, in\n            substantial reductions in pollutant emissions and\n            improvements in environmental quality indicators; 2) the\n            Project empowered National Bank of Econormic and Social\n            Development (BNDES) as a facilitator of the dialogue between\n            the State Environmental Protection Agencies (SEPAs) and\n            polluting companies formerly owned by the state. Before the\n            implementation of the project, the SEPAs had little or no\n            influence to enforce environmental regulations on these\n            companies. A constructive dialogue has been initiated and\n            enforcement agreements have been signed and are currently\n            under implementation; 3) during project preparation it is\n            important to note that potential demand for credit line\n            resources may be different from actual demand, depending on\n            the level of enforcement or public pressure; and 4) the\n            incorporation of large and technically complex subprojects\n            in a credit line for pollution control brings implementation\n            difficulties and increases the risk of disbursement delays.\n            At the same time, large facilities with decades of\n            environmental neglect are commonly one of the main sources\n            of pollution in the areas where they are located. It is\n            important to appraise this type of subprojects prior to loan\n            approval to increase targeting and avoid disbursement delays."}, "docdt": "1998-03-24T00:00:00Z"}
