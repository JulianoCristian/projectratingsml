MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO HUNGARY
FOR A PRODUCT MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    1 submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) with the guarantee of
the Republic of Hungary for the equivalent of US$100 million to help finance a
Product Market Development Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of fifteen years, including five years
of grace.
2.    Background:  Hungary was among the earliest of the Central and East
European countries to initiate economic reform, starting the process in 1968,
and its economic reform efforts since the mid-1980s have been supported, inter
alia, by IMF Stand-By Agreements, two Bank Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs),
an Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan (ISAL), and an Enterprise Reform Loan
(ERL). The present democratically-elected Government, which assumed office in
mid-1990, has imbued the reforms with the clear and unambiguous vision of
moving the Hungarian economy to one that is dominated by a private sector and
integrated with Western European market economies. At the same time it has
continued the earlier emphasis on safeguarding Hungary's creditworthiness
without recourse to debt rescheduling or reduction. The Government's success
in implementing its policies is reflected in the fact that, notwithstanding
the cumulative adverse effects of external shocks such as the collapse of the
CMEA market, the Gulf crisis and the 1990 drought of unprecedented proportions
for Hungary, macroeconomic indicators look favorable for Hungary in the
medium-term. Hungary's balance of payments situation has been strengthened in
respect of both the current account, reflecting in large part a successful re-
orientation of exports from former CMEA markets to Western markets, and the
capital account, reflecting the striking demonstration of foreign investors'
confidence which led to an impressive growth in direct foreign investment to a
level of nearly US$1.5 billion in 1991, about three times the previous year's
inflow. Inflation was reduced to about 16% on an annual basis in the second
half of 1991 after an initial surge at the beginning of the year resulting
mainly from relative price adjustments, including subsidy reductions and
administered price increases.
3.    Key elements of the macroeconomic reforms have been the liberalization
of prices and trade. At the end of 1991, about 90X of consumer and producer
prices were free of Government control. Price controls remain in effect
mostly for public utilities and some basic consumer products including wheat
and milk. Steady progress has been made over the past few years in the
liberalization of both domestic and external trade. Every company,
organization and individual now has the right to engage in trading activities
which has sparked a striking increase in trading activity and created
competition. The program has also liberalized around 92Z of total imports.
Products that continue to be under licensing include most food products and
items subject to international and multinational negotiations such as steel,
textiles and some agricultural products. Furthermore, important parts of the



- 2 -
institutional and legal infrastructure required for the functioning of markets
have already been put in place, including a modern tax system and a two-tier
banking system. The legislative and institutional framework for private
sector development is well advanced, consisting of a set of laws recently
passed by Parliament, among which are: (a) a Company law; (b) a Law on
Accounting; (c) a Bankruptcy law; and (d) a Competition law (Law on Unfair
Market Practices) which also established a competition office to monitor
compliance with the law. The Government is pursuing an ambitious
privatization and enterprise reform program, supported, inter alia, by the
Bank's ERL. Privatization, pursued on a multi-track approach, is to be
accelerated to reduce the share of state enterprises (SEs) in the competitive
part of the economy to less than 50% by 1994. The multi-track approach
includes the privatization of small business units (typically in the retail
sector) under the 1990 Retail Privatization Law. The passage of the
Cooperative and Transformation Laws in early 1992 is expected to accelerate
further the privatization of cooperatives by requiring a reorganization of
cooperatives based on a clear definition of ownership rights.
4.    For 1993 and beyond, the main objectives of macroeconomic policy will
shift from an improvement of creditworthiness to the further reduction of
inflation and the restoration of sustained economic growth. Inflation is
targeted to approach 10X by the end of 1993. The restoration of economic
growth will depend on continued export growth and increases in labor and
capital productivity. Realization of these productivity gains will require
concurrent and matching progress in the main sectors of the economy. One such
sector is the product market -- covering the marketing, trade and distribution
of consumer goods -- in view of the sector's impact on the competitiveness of
Hungarian products in domestic and export markets, particularly taking into
account the demands that would be placed on them by Hungary's growing
integration into the European Community (EC) markets following upon its
Association Agreement with the EC. Although the sector is responding rapidly
to the growing domestic and external competitive pressures, as reflected in
the break-up of the old organizational forms under the impetus of the ongoing
enterprise reform process, and the shrinking market shares of the traditional
firms in the face of increasing competition from new entrants, efficiency
gains are not yet being realized rapidly enough. Under the past central
planning policies, the sector received inadequate attention and was unable to
build up the financial resources, and organizational and management skills
required for undertaking modernization and upgrading improvements that are
essential in a competitive environment. This is reflected in particular in
the area of logistics, covering the process of planning, implementing and
controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow of goods to conform to consumer
requirements, which is of key importance in the process of marketing, trade
and distribution of consumer goods. Logistics-related costs are estimated to
be strikingly higher in relative terms in Hungary as compared to Western
comparators, their proportion to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) being about
twice as high in Hungary as in the comparators.
5.    Other areas that need attention to improve efficiency in the sector have
been identified as the following: (a) insufficiently developed market
information systems that have not yet been adapted to meet the needs of a
market economy in delivering timely and reliable nation-wide information on
the prices and quantities traded of principal commodities; (b) market
development institutions, e.g., commodity exchanges, that are still in their



- 3 -
infancy and operating without the necessary legal and supervisory framework
for wider acceptance; (c) lack of essential communication links between major
market participants including producers, traders and providers of associated
services which constrain appropriate coordination of activities; (d) new forms
of business arrangements that facilitate trade such as factoring, franchising
and leasing are not yet sufficiently supported in the legal framework; and
(e) inadequate exposure on the part of most enterprise management and staff in
the sector to the management methods, technologies and practices employed in
comparable enterprises in the West. Finally, the sector entities continue to
face capital constraints, particularly for medium- to long-term financing, as
the Hungarian commercial banks are not as yet sufficiently familiar with the
newly evolving investment needs in the sector and methods of assessing them.
6.    In order to tackle the broad problem of marketing inefficiencies the
Government has prepared, with the assistance of Bank staff, the Product Market
Development Project. As an overall framework for the project, the Government
has decided to take a series of actions designed to strengthen the enabling
environment for the product market, and thereby to stimulate the sector
entities to undertake the necessary efficiency improvements, as follows:
(a)   Market Information and Development:  preparation and
implementation of a plan for an improved market information system
that would provide information on supply and demand for major
commodities, and on improved crop forecasting; and presentation to
Parliament of a law on commodity exchanges that would define their
legal status and supervisory arrangements;
(b)   Product Safety and Quality Control:  presentation to Parliament of
an amended Food law; laws on product liability and consumer
protection, animal health, and plant protection; and
implementation of a plan for reform and control of the quality
control and inspection system;
(c)   Product Standardization: presentation to Parliament of a law on
standards and accreditation; and strengthening of the capabilities
of the Hungarian Office of Standardization to carry out its
functions effectively;
(d)   Infrastructure Constraints:  pursuit of a program for
participation of the private sector in improving
telecommunications, and carrying out other actions to improve the
functioning of the sector as agreed with the Bank under the two
ongoing Telecommunications projects (Loans 2847-HU and 3264-HU);
(e)   Trade Procedures Simplifi_ation-  completion of harmonization of
documents and procedures in selected activities; and preparation
of a plan for establishment of a computer network among customs
offices; and
(f)   Commercial Legislation:  finalization of legislative proposals to
incorporate factoring, franchising and financial leasing in the
Civil Code; presentation to Parliament of a new law on
arbitration;, and completion of an audit of significant regulations



pertaining to domestic trade to eliminate unjustifiably
restrictive measures.
7.    The Government has confirmed its intention to undertake the above
actions which are embodied in a Public Sector Action Program. In conjunction
with the Government's program, the main concerned private sector organizations
have confirmed their intention to participate, with the support of the
Government, in a Private Sector Action Program that would establish
appropriece organizational arrangements for (a) awareness creation, and
provision of training and advisory services in a broad range of logistics-
related aspects of marketing, trade and distribution to the concerned entities
in the sector; and (b) training of bank management and staff in evaluation and
supervision of projects in the sector.
8.    Project Objectiv..s:  The overall objective of the project is to
strengthen the operational and pricing efficiency of product markets, and,
thereby, to improve the business environment so that producers and trading
companies would be able to adjust efficiently to changing market conditions.
Within such a broadly defined framework, the specific project objectives are
to: (a) reduce costs in the overall logistics system (i.e., packaging,
transport, handling, storage, and the management of general consumer goods)
and to pass, in part, these savings to consumers in the form of lower cost;
(b) add value to products in terms of improved services; (c) enhance the
competitiveness of Hungarian products in domestic and in foreign markets; and
(d) assist commercial banks to add financing of investment in this new field
to their portfolios.
9.    Project Description and Implementation:  Within the framework of the
Public and Private Sector Action Programs, the project would address
constraints that impede the development of improved product markets and flow
of goods. In this respect, the project consists of two components:
(a)   Financial assistance through eligible participating banks (PBs) to
a broad range of investors to undertake a variety of activities to
strengthen their logistics-related operations in the marketing,
trade and distribution of consumer products; and
(b)   Technical assistance in support of the public and private sector
agencies involved in carrying out the Public and Private Sector
Action Programs.
10.   Financial assistance would be a line of credit of US$99.2 million
througl NBH to eligible PBs for onlending to eligi'le entities in the sector,
including enterprises, firms, cooperatives and other entrepreneurs, for the
establishment of new, or for enhancing the efficiency of existing, operations
involving marketing, trade and distribution of consumer products. Financing
would cover investment in machinery and equipment, spare parts, computer
hardware and software; civil works including construction of buildings and
structures, or purchase of construction materials; and permanent working
capital.
11.   Technical assistance to be provided under the project includes
(i) support for the establishment of an appropriate organization to be
responsible for the promotion, enhancement and encouraging better coordination



-5-
in the provision of training and advisory services in a broad range of
logistics-related aspects of marketing, trade and distribution; (ii)
establishment of a program for training of commercial bank management and
staff in evaluation and supervision of projects in the marketing, trade and
distribution areas with an emphasis on logistics-related aspects; and
(iii) support to various ministries and public sector agencies concerned in
support of the Public Sector Action Program. Prospects for donor financing of
the technical assistance program, estimated to cost about US$4.3 million,
appear good as a number of potential donor sources have expressed initial
interest. However, in view of their importance for project implementation,
the Government will undertake the financing of two of the technical assistance
components, namely, those for establishing appropriate organizational
arrangements for the provision of training and advisory services in logistics-
related aspects and for the training of bank staff, estimated to cost about
US$1.8 million, should donor financing not be forthcoming in time and in the
required amounts. A provision of US$0.8 million has been made under the
proposed loan to finance eligible expenditures in this regard.
12. The loan would be made to NBH which would onlend a part (US$99.2
million) of the funds to eligible participating banks which in, turn, would
onlend funds to the ultimate beneficiaries and the remaining part (US$0.8
million) to the Government for channeling, as grants, to organizations that
would promote and organize the provision of training and advisory services.
NBH would onlend the funds at maturities not exceeding 15 years including a
grace period not exceeding five years, at its applicable refinancing rate
which will be adjusted from time to time to keep it positive in real terms and
to cover: (a) NBH's average cost of funds; and (b) the expected foreign
exchange risk to be borne by NBH. The PBs would onlend the funds to the
ultimate beneficiaries at maturities not exceeding 10 years with grace periods
not exceeding three years, at rates that would conform to the principles of:
(a) adequate margin to cover the PBs' average cost of funds, administrative
costs and provisions for doubtful loans; and (b) positive rates relative to
inflation.
13.   The Government has approved the establishment of a Steering Committee to
monitor and coordinate implementation of the project. The Committee would be
chaired by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and include representatives of
the main ministries involved, those of Agriculture; International Economic
Relations; Transport, Telecommunications and Water Management; Finance; and
Justice. The Committee would also include representatives of the main public
sector organizations involved in the field of standardization and quality
assurance; NBH; the commercial banks; and appropriate representation from the
main private sector associations involved in the project. The Committee would
be assisted by a Project Work Unit attached to MIT.
14.   Project Sustainability:  Within the overall context of the Government's
demonstrated strong commitment to economic reform, the project supports
actions by the main public and private sector agencies concerned to strengthen
the specific enabling environment for the project, including institutional
strengthening to enhance and better coordinate key training and advisory
services relevant to project implementation. Project benefits are thus
expected to be sustained.



- 6 -
15.   Lessons Learned:  While performance of previous intermediary loans in
Hungary has been satisfactory, these earlier projects have highlighted (a) the
need for better coordination between public and private sector efforts to
support the investment environment; and (b) the need for simplification in
loan administration to enable a more efficient commitment of funds. The
proposed project builds on this experience under earlier and ongoing Bank
credit lines in Hungary for agriculture and industry by emphasizing proper
arrangements for coordination between the main public and private sector
agencies concerned in project implementation, including the carrying out of
specific actions in support of strengthening the enabling environment for
product markets; seeking greater involvement of relevant private sector
associations under the project in keeping with the Govcrnment's objective of
encouraging a private-sector based market economy; and introducing greater
flexibility and simplification in loan administration features in reflection
of the accumulated experience of the Borrower and the PBs under Bank credit
lines.
16.   Rationale for Bank fnvolvement:  Bank strategy in Hungary focuses on
creating growth through economic change and more efficient use of resources.
In the 1980s, the Bank's strategy focussed on encouraging and supporting the
phased economic reforms then being undertaken in Hungary through industrial
restructuring loans and a FY88 Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan in support of
institutional and policy reform, and restructuring at the enterprise and
subsector levels, and investment loans in support of operations in the
agriculture, energy, telecommunications and transport sectors. With the
coming into power in 1990 of a democratically elected Government, the Bank's
assistance entered a new phase. In support of the Government's objective of
radical transformation to a predominantly private, market economy, the Bank
approved two structural adjustment loans focussing on measures to improve
competition in domestic markets, a final round of trade liberalization, and
reform of social programs. The FY92 Enterprise Reform Loan supports a
fundamental reform of the enterprise sector. Future Bank operations will
increasingly emphasize investment financing to deepen the implementation of
structural reforms and promote efficient development within a market economy.
In line with this strategy, the proposed project aims at enhancing the
competitiveness of Hungarian consumer goods in domestic and export markets by
its support for strengthening the enabling environment relevant to such
product markets and by the provision of finance to enterprises for their
marketing, trade and distribution activities, complementary to the financing
provided under the Bank's existing credit lines for agriculture and industry
that are primarily in support of production and manufacturing activities.
17.   Environmental Aspects:  NBH and the PBs will ensure in their onlending
agreements that the ultimate beneficiaries 'Till build and operate their
facilities, financed under the project, in accordance with environmental
safety standards according to Hungarian regulations.
18.   Agreed Actions:  Agreements reached at negotiations relate to:
(i) financing arrangements for key technical assistance; (ii) NBH's onlending
arrangements; (iii) the participating conditions for the eligible banks; (iv)
criteria for eligible subborrowers and subprojects; (v) establishment of the
Steering Committee and the Project Work Unit; (vi) procurement arrangements
and procedures; (vii) disbursement arrangements; and (viii) auditing and
reporting requirements.



19.   Conditions of loan effectiveness would be (i) the signing of subsidiary
financing agreements between NBH and at least two eligible PBs; (ii) the
signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between NBH and the Government; and
(iil) establishment of organizational arrangements, satisfactory to the B.nk,
for the provision of training and advisory services in logistics-related
aspects.
20.   Benefits:  The project would contribute to raising operational and
pricing efficiency in marketing, trade and distribution activities in Hungary
through its support for improvements in the relevant enabling environment,
including in respect of market information systems; product safety, quality
control, and standardization; and introduction of improved technology and
practices in logistics management. By assisting commercial banks to
strengthen their capabilities for assessing the evolving needs of the business
entities engaged in these activities, the project would improve the access of
these entities to the term finance required by them to carry out viable
efficiency-improving investments. This would enable the entities to realize
significant efficiency gains, particularly in regard to logistics-related
costs, which would increase their competitiveness and profitability. Overall,
the project would contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of Hungarian
products in domestic and export markets.
21.   Risks: The main risk to successful project implementation is that a
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could impact adversely on the
investment climate and the realization of efficiency gains by the project
beneficiaries. The continued application of sound macroeconomic policies
under agreements with the IMF and the Bank should help reduce macroeconomic
instability and help sustain a conducive environment for project
implementation. There is also a risk that a lack of coordination within the
project agencies could affect the creation of the proper environment for
enterprises to introduce cost reducing innovations and business practices.
Arrangements to be made under the project would help provide for proper
coordination between the main agencies, including the carrying out of specific
actions to strengthen the enabling environment relevant to project
implementation. Technical assistance under the project should further help
reduce this risk.
22.   Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
