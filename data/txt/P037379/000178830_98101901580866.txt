S uIrAim
i.     The Ind-ustrialization Fund of Finland Ltd. (1FF) was reorganized
in 1963 and has since received three Bank loans amounting to Us$ 43 millior.
The last loan of US$ 22 million was granted in January 1969. This
loan is expected to be fully committed by the end of September 1970 and
IFF has requested a fourth loan fron the Bank.
ii.    The economy of Finland responded favorably to the stabilization
measures taken in late 1967, including a substantial devaluation of
the Finnish IMarkka. Economic activity recovered during 1968 and gained
further momentum in 1969.  The increase in GNP was about 8% in 1969,
approximately equalling the total increase for the three previous years.
iii.   Total industrial investment increased by about 15% in 1968 and
39% in 1969 reaching Fmk 2,521 million. This includes the invesbnents
made by state-owned enterprises, which account for about 20% of the
total. The upward trend in industrial investment is continuing in
1970. IFF's disbursements indicate the same trend rising from Fmk
51.5 million in 1968 to Fmk 101 million in 1969. These figures show
that IFF's disbursements have accounted only for a small proportion of
total private industrial investment in Finland, about 4% in 1969.
iv.    Since IFF is a small institution in the total economic en-
vironment of Finland, the direct resource mobilization that it has
been able to achieve has been small in the context of total invest-
ment in the country. However, IFF has had a more significant role at
the project level especially in respect of medium-sized enterprise;
its management has played a significant part in the reformation of
tax legislation affecting the Finnish capital market, and IFF has
introduced underwriting into Finland.
v.     IFF's appraisal techniques have been instrumental in building
up a sound portfolio which is well diversified. IFF has followed a
policy of giving preference to projects in the non-traditional fields
of Finnish industry and which have export potential. IFF's loan super-
vision effort has improved in recent years.
vi.    Until August 16, 1970, when he went back to the Bank of Finland
as a  Member  of the Board of Management, M4r. Jaakko Lassila was
IFF's General Manager. He has been succeeded by Mr. Pertti Tuomala,
a M4ember of the Board of Management and Assistant Director of the
Central Bank of the Cooperative Banks of Finland Ltd., one of the
largest financial institutions in Finland. Mr. Tuomala has a good
academic background and practical experience of banking and industry.
IFF's professional staff although small, is well qualified and comr-
-o,-trent. A feature of IFF's organization is a training program in
financial analysis of industrial projects for young professionals
from its shareholding institutions.



- ii -
vii.    IFF's profitability although still modest has improved since
1968. Its financial position is sound. Total assets, as of June 30,
1970, stood at US$ 71.2 million equivalent, an increase of over 70%
since the year ending 1968. Reserves and provisions are adequate.
viii.   The Bank finances a fixed percentage of all IFF's loans, a
percentage fixed at less than the estimated foreign exchange component
of industrial investment in Finland. It is recommended that the Bank
continue this practice of financing IFF projects on the basis of a
fixed proportion of its total commitments. However, in order to reduce
IFF's dependence on the Bank for funds, it is recommended that the Bank
.educe its financing to 40% of IFF's total commitments (from 45% and 50%
respectively in the case of the last two loans).
ix.     On uhe basis of estimated commitments of about Fnk 210 million,
during the two year period October 1970 - September 1972, and the Bank's
financing 40h  of total commitments, a loan of US$ 20 million is recom-
-mended. Considering the size of IFF's loans, no increase in the free-
limit (US$ 750,000 equivalent, defined in terms of total financing
provided by IFF) is recommended. To ensure adequate supervision, it
has been agreed that IFF shall submit at least two projects in every
quarter for prior approval of the Bank. No change in the debt/equity
ratio is needed but it is recommended to modify the definition of debt
and equity to include the entire amount of "B" shares in the equity base.

TEOLLISTAMISRAHASTO OY - INDUSTRIALIZATION FUND OF FINLAND LTD.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Teollistamisrahasto Oy - Industrialization Fund of Finland
Ltd. (IFF) has received three loans from the Bank totalling US$ 43
million. The Company's performance has been satisfactory and the
last loan of TUS$ 22 million made in January 1969, is expected to be
fully committed by the end of September 1970. This report recommends
a new loan of US$ 20 million to meet part of IFF's total resource gap
for the period up to the end of September 1972.
1.02      After giving a very brief economic perspective, this report
focuses on the evaluation of IFF's performance with regard to two
main functions: the mobilization of resources and their allocation.
The report then analyses the institutional strength of the Company.
The last part discusses IFF's prospects, estimates its capital needs
and makes recommendations about the proposed Bank loan. For the
economic background, reference is invited to Memorandum on the
Economic Situation - Finland, dated April 9, 1970 (ENA-20). Annexes 1
through 5 update the information about shareholders, Board members,
organization structure, etc. and no further reference is made to
them in this report.
II. IFF's ROLE IN FINLAND
Perspective
2.01      The Economic Recovery. The economy of Finland responded
favorably to the devaluation and stabilization measures taken in
late 1967. Economic activity recovered during 1968 and gained further
momentum in 1969.  The increase in GNP at fixed prices for 1969 was
about 8%, approximately equalling the total increase of the three
previous years. In 1968, economic growth was influenced mainly by
an upsurge in exports; in 1969, a sharp increase in private investment
was an additional factor responsible for continued growth of the economy,
2.02      Industrial Investment and Financing.!/  Total industrial
investment in Finland, which had declined to Fmk 1,576 million in
1967 from Fmk 1,760 million in 1966, increased by about 15% to Fmk
1,811 million in 1968 and further by 39% to Fmk 2,521 million in 19695
These figures include investments by state-owned enterprises, amounting
to about 1/5 of total investment in recent years. The upward trend
in industrial investment is continuing in 1970. IFF's disbursements
indicate the same trend. Total disbursements by IFF, after declining
to Fmk 29 million in 1967 from Fmk 35 million in 1966, rose to
Fmk 51.5 million in 1968. In 1969, IFF's disbursements almost
doubled and amounted to about Fmk 101 million.
/ Statistics quoted in this section were obtained by IFF from
the Bank of Finland.



- 2 -
2.03      As the above figures indicate, IFF's disbursements have ac-
counted for a very small proportion of total private industrial finance
in Finland, roughly about 4%. It should be noted however that IFF
does not serve large-scale enterprises and, if they were excluded,
IFF's contribution wlould be much higher. The bulk of industrial fi-
nance is provided by commercial banks, insurance companies, and, in
recent years, also by the pension funds. Detailed statistics showing
the contributions of these institutions to total investment are however
not available.
2.o4      In capitalization of Finnish industry, equity funds are of
secondary importance; debt financing is predominant. In 1968, equity
accounted for only 23% of total capitalization of all the industrial
enterprises in the country. A study of combined balance sheets of
Finnish industrial enterprises shows that the relative importance of
equity financing in fact declined over the 1965-68 period.
2.05      Interest Rates.  The basic interest rates paid on deposits
and charged on loans are determined by the Bank of Finland. However,
since the rates determined are "average rates", the banks have a fair
degree of flexibility in fixing the rate on an individual loan. The
highest rate that can be charged in Finland is 10%. The present
average lending rate for the commercial banks is 7.5%, the same as
in the past several years. Most long-term lending by the commercial
banks is in the form of roll-over of short-term loans. But it is
also in the form of bonds and debentures which typically carry a
coupon of 711 to 814 p.a.
2.06      IFF's lending rates are not determined by the Bank of Finlani.
Its present rates vary from 8.5% - 10% depending on the security
offered and the management's evaluation of the risk involved. The
average lending rate has increased from 8.5% in 1968 to 8.7% in 1969.
IFF also charges a commitment fee of 1% and a project appraisal fee
of up to 1% of the loan amount. IFF's interest rate structure is
flexible, giving it the facility to increase its average rate, as it
has indeed done in the past. From a financial point of view, IFF,
which is only moderately profitable, would benefit from an increased
spread on the cost of its resources; however, the prevailing interest
rate structure sets a limit to which it can increase its lending
rates, and IFF is charging what the market will bear.
2.07      As a measure of encouragement, the Government subsidizes in-
terest paid by small entrepreneurs in less developed areas. The maxi-
mum subsidy is 3%. Since this subsidy applies only to a very small
proportion of total lending in Finland, it has not distorted the
overall interest rate structure in the country.



2.08    Foreiga Investment.  The total quantum. of direct private
foreign investment has so far been very small. During 1965-1968,
it amounted to about Fmk 21.4 million annually. During the first half
of 1969, it showed a sharp increase, amounting to Fmk 44X1 million.
Whether this increase shows a new trend is too soon to say. There
are no special incentives provided to foreign private capital.
IFF As Mobilizer of Resources
2.09    IFF is a small institution in the total economic environment
of Finlando The direct resource mobilization that it has been able to
achieve is therefore small in the context of total investment in the
country. However, IFF has had considerable indirect influence on
resource mobilization in Finland through the part it has played in
modifying the tax legislation which has had a bearing on capital market
development.
2.10    The Capital Market.  Although Helsinki has one of the oldest
stock exchanges in Europe, the capital market is still in its infancy
in Finland.  However, after a long period of slow growth, trading on
the Stock Exchange increased by 51% in 1968 over that in 1967, and
a further increase of 32% was registered in 1969 over 1968. During
1969, the average monthly turnover was 229,000 shares, and average
monthly value of shares traded was 'about Fmk 4e5 million.  An encouragjix;
feature in the volume increase was the relatively better showing by
industrial shares -- increasing by 69% in 1968 and 43% in 1969. Together
with the improvement in volume, the prices also moved up.  The overall
index of prices in December 1969 showed an increase of 26% over the
previous yearts figure and as much as 80% increase over what it had beep
in December 1967. Again the increase in the prices of industrial
shares was relatively more significant. Most of the companies listed
on the Stock Exchange paid a dividend in 1969, ranging from 14% to 35%,
with the majority falling between 8-12%.
2.11    The significant improvement in the activity on the Stock Ex-
change resulted not only from the general improvement in the overall
economy in Finland, but also from a number of specific measures taken
to help revive the capital market. Before 1968 fixed term deposits and
Government bonds were distinctly more attractive to investors because
of index-linked interest rates. Index linking was abolished in 1968.
The interest on bonds issued by private companies is now allowed to be
tax-exempt, like the interest on Government bonds. Measures have been
taken to make equity investment more attractive vis-a-vis debt financing
by allowing dividends to be treated as an expense for tax calculation
purposes. Dividends declared in the year of issue of new capital and
in the five following years are now allowed to be treated as an expense;
after five years, 40% of the amount of dividends will still be allowed
to be treated as an expense. Stamp duties on most capital market trans-
actions have been abolished. Also, dividends in the hands of the re-
ceiver have been made tax-exempt to a maximum of Fmk 400 and for amountrc
exceeding this limit, 15% is deductible from taxable income.



-4 -
J.12     Al1. Vaes~: measures have helped to create k more fa,orab3s
climate for equity investment and for developmant of the capital market.
It will, however, be a slow process. There is still a preference on
the part of Finnish enterprises, particularly relatively small entre-
preneurs, to have femily concerns without any outside participant.
More incentives are needed, on the one hand, to induce closely held
companies to offer their shares to the general public, thus broadening
the ownership base and, on the other hand, for private investors to own
shares rather than to hold fixed deposits or buy Government bonds as
the preferred form of their investments. Consideration could, for ex-
ample, be given to (i) some tax preference for companies "going public".,
(ii) raising the maximum limit for tax exempt dividend income, and
(iii) relaxation of the five-year holding requirement for exemption
from capital gains tax. Another area in which improvement is needed
is professional accounting practices and the extent to which operational
and financial data are disclosed. Because of the peculiar practice
of creating "hidden reserves" in Finland, published profitability
figures are not very meaningful.
2.13      Steps are also being taken to provide the legal framework
needed to create and operate mutual funds. However, there are no con-
crete proposals for actually establishing either closed or open-end
funds and it may be premature to establish such funds since the market
in shares is so thin. A draft of the legislation has already been
prepared.
2 .4      IFF's Chairman, Mr. Valvanne and Mr. Lassila, until recently
the General Manager of IFF, deserve a major share of the credit for the
reforms in tax legislation affecting the capital market development.
Both have been members of the various committees whose recommendations
resulted in the legislation affecting the capital market development
as described above. The legislation on mutual funds has also been
proposed by Mr. Valvanne and Mr. Lassila.
2.15      IFF's Sources of Funds. The principal sources of IFF's funds
are its shareholders, the-Government and the World Bank. From the time
it was formed to June 30, 1970, IFF had acquired total resources of
Fmak 365.0 million. Of this, it had obtained Fmk 173.9 million by
domestic borrowings, Fmk 160.8 from the World Bank and Fmk 30.3 million
was shareholders' equity, or 48%, 44% and 8% respectively of total
resources. Details are given in Annex 6. On a cumulative commitment
basis, World Bank funds have been used to cover a little less than 40%
of IFFts aggregate commitments. Through the increase in its share capi-
tal in 1967 and through retention of profits, IFF's total equity has
almost doubled during the past three years. Another capital increase
is proposed for 1971. The Government (through the Bank of Finland
Post Office Savings Bank and also directly) has provided about 30% of
IFF's total resources in the form of share capital, including the
subordinated ITBI" shares, and debenture loans.



2.16      As the above figures indicate, the World Bank has been
IFFts principal source of funds. IFF recognizes the need to de-
crease its dependence on World Bank funds. As noted in more de-
tail in paragraph 4.o6, it is proposed that the share of the World
Bank funds in IFF's total resources should decrease in the next
two years. IFF has not so far obtained any part of its resources
directly from the capital market because it has been able to meet
its requirements by borrowgings from its shareholders at a lower
rate. It is expected, however, that in the future IFF will obtain
at least some part of its total requirements by offer of bonds for
public subscription. (See paragraph 4.07).
2.17      Resource Mobilization So Far.  Considerable amounts have
been mobilized at the project level in the form of investments by
the sponsors of the projects that IFF has financed. The statistics
show that IFF has, on an average, financed not more than about one-
third of the total costs of the projects. IFF's gross disbursements
up to June 30, 1970 amounted to Fmk 311 million. This would mean
that there has been a total investment of about 933 million in IFF-
financed projects.
2.18      In addition to resource mobilization at the project level,
IFF has borrowed at home (from sources other than the Government)
Fmk 94 million.  All the loans were, however, obtained from its
shareholder banks and insurance companies. IFF has not so far
approached the market to tap private savings directly. In the past,
IFF has explored, through its major foreign shareholders, the possi-
bility of floating bonds in the international market; but this has
not proved practicable.
2.19      IFF recently undertook a pioneering step in Finland by in-
troducing the practice of underwriting. In the beginning of 1970,
IFF underwrote for the first time in the history of Finland a bond
issue for an amount of Fmk 10 million for a private industrial com-
pany. IFF charged a fee of 2.5%. It handled the operation alone,
taking full responsibility for marketing arrangemients as well.  The
issue itself was not entirely sold because the company, without con-
sulting IFF, also made a share issue at the same time; but the opera-
tion gave IFF valuable experience and introduced. a new concept in
Finland. IFF recognizes the need to enlarge its role in this field
and proposes to undertake two more underwriting operations during
the next six months. It also proposes to associate other institutions,
principally the insurance companies, in future underwriting, in order
not only to minimize its own exposure but also to make underwriting
operations better known as a technique of resource mobilization.

IFF As Allocator of Resources
2.20    Appraisal work and criteria0  IFF's appraisal work is satis-
factory. Analysis of the creditworthiness of borrowers and financial
aspects of the projects are given the highest importance in its appraisall
As financial criteria, IFF eonsiders, in general, a rate of return of
10% on total capitalization and a debt/equity ratio of 65/35 to be
acceptable, Considering the competitiveness of industry and the general
pattern of financing in the country, IFFts rate of return and debt/equity
criteria appear reasonable. IFF would not generally accept a project
if the estimated debt-service cover is less than two. Using these
criteria, IFF has been able to build up a sound portfolio.
2.21    IFF does not undertake a detailed economic analysis of the pro-
jects it finances on the grounds that the financial tests it applies
adequately reflect a project's competitiveness. This is understandable
considering the Finnish environment with an open economy, relatively
few import restrictions, generally low tariff rates and with an exchange
rate which is not unrealistic, There is strong evidence that IFF-
financed projects are in fact quite competitive. As mentioned in para-
graph 2.29, exports of IFF's clients, as a percentage of total sales,
have increased markedly in the past two years.
2.22    IFF has three well qualified engineers on its staff (including
the head of the Project Appraisal Department), who review the engineer-
ing aspects of individual projects. IFF does not undertake detailed
technical analyses. Its experience has been that its large clients
have their own engineering staff and that in the case of smaller pro-
Jects, difficult engineering aspects are infrequent. In a few
instances, IFF has also required a client to engage outside consultants
for appraising specific technical aspects. Statistics to measure the
extent of IFFts influence on clients in modifying or improving projects
on the basis of its technical advice are not available. However,
according to IFF's management, there have been many projects where the
designs, capacities proposed or the financial structures were modified
in the light of the review and comments made by IFF.
2.23    A commendable aspect of the broad appraisal work done by IFF
is the sectoral studies that it has undertaken. These studies have
analyzed various sectors with a growth potential in the Finnish market
(beer, wool and construction material industries) or in the export
market (fur and saw-mill products). At times such studies have also
been undertaken upon request from outside, such as from trade bodies.
Besides being used as valuable background material for its own project
analysis, IFF has made these studies available to the members of its
Board of Directors, which consists of representatives of important
financial institutions in the country.



°,24       FF also niakes special appraisals of companies upon request of' outside
,,'ies, for a fee. Usually such appraisals are undertaken on behaIf of other
£inancial institutions and have the object of assessing a company's net worth
:pr'ior to a merger or liquidation.  Such requests are evidence of the esteem in
which IFF is held by other institutions in Finland. IrF sees an expanding role
in this type of consulting work.
'o.25     Loan Supervision.  IFF has 583 active loans to 436 clients in its
,sortfolio and thus an effective procedure of loan supervision has to be selec-
ive.  Basic operational and financial data is obtained from all clients.  After
a preliminary scrutiny, projects indicating problems are picked out for more
intensive follow-up. IFFvs loan supervision effort has certainly improved in
recent years; staff has been increased to enable IFF to follow up on loans more
t,ioroughly. The performance on the part of client companies in submitting the
prescribed periodic reports is very good. Their reports are promptly analyzed
a-d the data obtained are transferred to standard cards, one for each loan,
which facilitates future reference. The number of visits to projects has also
;-nproved; during the year ended April 30, 1970, 114 projects were visited.
CXlose coordination is maintained with the staff which had appraised the projects
originally. A factor which facilitates IFF's end-use supervision is the con-
0sntration of its clients in the Helsinki area. That the system works pretty
well is reflected in the fact that the difficult projects are picked out at an
early stage.
2.26      The appraisal mission that visited IFF in May found that IFF's dis-
ovirsement procedures were not as thorough as they should have been. A staff
member of the Controller's Department subsequently visited IFF in July and held
discussions with IFF management, on how to improve its disbursement procedures.
During negotiations for the proposed loan, the subject was further discussed
with IFF representatives and steps to improve and tighten the procedures were
a7reed.
Features of IFF Operations
2.27      IFF's commitments sharply increase in 1968 and 1969.  Total commit-
ments during these two years amounted to Fmk 187 million, which was one-fiftl
creater than during the previous four years. Disbursements have shown a similar
trend. During 1968-1969 they amounted to Fmk 152.4 million or one-third more
rGhan during the previous four years. The level of operations during the current
year, 1970, is running at about the same level as in 1969. Details of commit-
ments of loans and equity investments and disbursements are given in Annex 7.
24.28     Sectoral Distribution.  IFF's portfolio is well diversified among
various industrial sectors. Its exposure in the traditional forestry based
industries is small. Annex 8 shows the sectoral distribution of IFF's port-
folio in comparison with the distribution of gross fixed industrial investm.ent
in the country. Although the data is not strictly comparable because the two
sets of figures are of different dates, some conclusions can be drawn. IFF has
concentrated more heavily on financing non-traditional industries in Finland.
About 22% of its total portfolio consists of food processing enterprises compar-
ed with less than 12Z of gross fixed industrial investment in the country for
t.his group of industries.  Similarly, compared with less than 7% of the coLnt'r5!
total gross fixed industrial investment for textile and related industries, IFF
has about 1507 of its total portfolio devoted to financing of this groulp of industriek



- 8 -
Conversely, only about 4% of IFF's portfolio consists of paper and
printing, compared with about 34% of the countryls gross fixed
industrial investment in this group.
2.29    As a matter of deliberate policy, IFF gives preference to
projects which would increase the export potential of Finland. The
effectiveness of this policy is shown by the statistics on the export
performance of the projects IFF has financed. In 1965, exports of IFF
clients accounted for 8.5% of their total sales. This percentage in-
creased to 17% in 1967. In the past two years, the share of exports of
IFF clients in their total sales further increased to 26%.
2.30    GeoFraDhical Distribution of IFF Portfolio.  IFF's lending, like
industry in Finland, is concentrated in the Helsinki area.  In 1969, the
Government adopted a regional development policy reflected in dividing
the country into three zones with incentives provided to industries to
be set up in two of them. IFF, whose operations cannot yet -have
shown the effect of this new policy, feels that relatively few viable
projects come from these regions. Geographical distribution of IFF
loan portfolio is shown in Annex 9.
2.31    Size of Loans. There is a distinct trend towards larger loans.
In 1969, loans over Fmk 600,000 amounted to 85% of the total lending
in that year, against 65% in the previous six years. Available in-
formation for 1970 shows that the percentage of larger loans is con-
tinuing to increase. Notwithstanding the trend towards larger loans,
43% of the loans approved (by numbers) in 1969 were for less than
US$ 70,000 equivalent each, although this represented only 7% by
amount of that year's lending volume. IFF's policy statement states
that it "will as a rule, not consider projects requiring financing in
amounts of less than Fmk 150,000"(about UJS$ 35,000 equivalent).  This
rule is generally observed but exceptions have been made in the past in
special circumstances.
2.32    IFFts Board is now considering lowering IFF's lower limit on
loans to Fmk 50,000. The reason for this is that the Government has
discontinued its direct allocation of funds to small borrowers and
would like IFF to be available to do such business. While IFF can
undertake some such business without affecting its costs, it is in
IFFts interest financially at least to maintain, if not increase, the
average size of its loans. This is a view with which IFF's management
concurs and it does not expect a lowering of IFF's lower limit to re-
sult in an excessive number of small loans. The Bank has informed IFF
that it would agree to the new lower limit if IFF's Board requests
such an amendment of the Policy Statement.
2.33    Amortization Period.  The amortization periods of individual
loans made by IFF is on the average quite long. In 1969, about half
of the total loans approved (by value) had a term of 12 years or more.
It has become apparent that the amortization periods have been extended
beyond what the projects actually required from a financial point, of



'rlew. This has been discussed with IFF and I.t has been agreed that ,a
the future the terms of loans  will be determined primarily by finanrial
requirements of the borrowers.
2.34    Equity Investments.  IFF has not been active in making equity
investments. Most of its "equities" are in fact in the nature of
long-term loans with fixed redemption schedules in place of amortiza-
tion schedules and with rates so determined as to yield 1FF a fixed
return. Real equity investments have been negligible partly because
of a general reluctance on the part of entrepreneurs to offer shares
to outsiders and partly because of the reluctance of IFFts management
to take the risks inherent in equity investments. The management,
however, hopes that, with a better investment climate and a more actire
capital market, IFF will be able to increase its equity investments.
aSponsor ozr
2.35     Sponsor Oy was established in 1967 as a promotion company to
finance new product ideas and processes. Its paid-in capital is Fmk 10
million, of which 65% is held by the Bank of Finland.  IFF has an
investment of Fmk 245,000 or about 2.5% of the total share capital.
However, Sponsor Oy is de facto a subsidiary of IFF for Mr. Lassila
has been the Acting Managing Director from the beginning and its
office is located in IFF. For its staff, numbering 4, Sponsor Oy has
depended entirely on IFF. Besides extending research and development
loans for which it can draw funds from SITRA, a special governmental
fund administered by the Bank of Finland, an important function of
Sponsor Oy is to take majority equity interest in companies in dif-
ficulty but with good potential. Sponsor Oy's Chairman is Mr. Klaus
Waris, formerly the Governor of the Bank of Finland and Chairman of
IFF and now the Chancellor of the Helsinki School of Economics.
2.36     Sponsor Oy's operations are yet to gain momentum.  The results
of the financing of the research and development of new products has
been disappointing and it has completed only three equity operations
since its inception, two in 1969 and one in 1970, for a total amount
of Fmk 3.9 million (of which one operation alone accounted for Fmk
3.3 million). All three operations are proving exceptionally profit-
able. It has already received high dividends from two companies;
the third will also pay a dividend in the first year after Sponsor
Oyts investment. The low level of Sponsorts business is due to
three things: (i) its task is very difficult in Finland's environ-
ment; (ii) it has been quite conservative and (iii) it has been
handicapped by having only part-time management and a small staff.
2.37     Effective September 1, 1970, Mr. Esila, former staff member
of IFF and deputy to Mr. Lassila in Sponsor Oy, will become the
MIanaging Director of Sponsor. Sponsor Oyts staff is also being
increased, and its office will be moved out of IFF. It is also
intended that Sponsor Oy will become more aggressive in seeking business.



- 10 -
P,Tphrsis will be given to seeking equLity investments in exLstirig conpafl eas
and projects that have potential but which have a fairly long gesta'ion
ceriod. Availability of resources is not regarded as a constraining factor
as shareholders are reported to be ready to provide the required capital.
III. IFF's ORGANIZATION AND FINANCIAL PERFORM.ANCE
Mianagement and Staff
3.01    1Mr. Lassila succeeded Mr. Konttinen as IFFts General Manager in
January 1967, and ably led the institution until he was appointed in
August 1970 as a Member of the Board of Management of the Bank of Finland.
He has been succeeded by Mr. Pertti Tuomala who was until his appointment
as the General Manager of IFF, a MIember of the Board of Management and
Assistant Director of the Central Bank of the Cooperative Banks of Finland
Ltd., one of the largest financial institutions in Finland. He has a good
academic background and practical experience in banking and industry (he
represented his institution on Boards of several industrial companies).
Wlith the support of IFF's Board of Directors and backed by a well establich-
ed staff and organization, Mr. Pertti Tuomala should prove to be a success-
ful General Manager.
3.02     IFF's professional staff, presently totalling 24., is comparatively
young but well qualified.  Some of the present staff members have part-
time teaching assignments at the Helsinki School of Economics.  Three of
IFF's staff members have also received training in the Bank. Staff turn-
over has been very low.
3.03     A feature of IFF's organization is the training program it
offers in financial analysis of industrial projects for young profession-
als from shareholding institutions. Starting in 1966, IFF has provided
training, usually lasting for one year, to 11 trainees who have now taken
up positions as financial analysts, in some cases as department heads, in
their organizations.
Relations with Government and Business Community
3.0h     During the seven years since its reorganization, IFF has become
an important financial institution in Finland, notwithstanding the
relatively small volume of its lending.  Its standing in Government and
private financial and business circles is high. Its role in Finland is
appreciated and achievements acknowledged, particularly the educational
effects of its techniques of project appraisal and the part it has played
in laying the base for the future development of the capital market. IFF
has actively participated in governmental committees, mostly in associa-
tion with the Bank of Finland, which were, or are still, involved in
formulating legislation designed to broaden and stimulate capital market
activity. IFF management and senior staff has been invited frequently to
deliver lectures and participate in round-table discussions with various
business and industrial groups on subjects of mutual interest, e.g.
problems of small entrepreneurs, location of new industrial plants, etc.



- 11 -
Profitability and Financial Position
3.05     IFF's financial position is sound.  Total assets increased by
18% in 1968, 55% in 1969 and by a further 19% during the first six
months of 1970. IFF's term debt outstanding as of June 30, 1970
amounted to Fmk 258.5 million, of which about 47% was in the form of
subordinated debentures. The total long-term debt/equity ratio was
8.5:1 as of the same date. Reserves and retained earnings increased
from 9.3% of share capital in 1968 to 12.5% as of June 30, 1970. IFF's
financial statements are given in Annexes 12 and 13.
3.o6     The Bank loan agreement (582-FI) limits IFF's borrowings to a
maximum of three times its equity. The "equity" for this purpose in-
cludes the amounts of certain subordinated debentures. The ratio was
1.8:1 as on June 30, 1970. The term "equity" is further defined in
such a way as to exclude (and include in debt) such amounts in respect
of "B" shares as shall be redeemable before the last maturity of the
Bank loan. The amount redeemed annually, Fmk 300,000, is payable only
out of profits. It is nevertheless, a tax deductible item. The total
face value of "B" shares continues to be shown in the balance sheets
of IFF irrespective of the amount redeemed. In essence, the "B" shares
are preference shares which only qualify for dividends for a fixed
life. Consequently, it is recommended that in the loan agreement for
the proposed fourth loan the full amount of "B" shares be included in
the equity of IFF.
3.07     Although still low, IFF's profitability has improved since
1968. In 1969, IFF earned a net return (net income after taxes and
provisions) of 6.7% of its equity, up from 3.8% in 1968. The return
on equity is low because of high incidence of taxes in Finland (IFF
paid about 60% of its income for the years 1968/1969) and because IFF
gets a fairly thin spread over the cost of its resources. The return
on "A" shares plus reserves, after deduction of the Fmk 300,000 pay-
ment to "B" shareholders, was 4.5% for 1968 and 8.1% for 1969.  For
the years 1968 and 1969, IFF had a spread of 2.8% and 2.4% respectively
on its outside long-term funds. Results of the first six months in 1970
show that the profitability has further improved.
3.08     Despite a comparatively modest record of earnings, IFF has
been paying dividends since 1964. For the years 1968 and 1969, IFF
paid a 7% annual dividend. The pay-out ratio has ranged from a low
of 30% in 1967 to a high of 64% in 1968. IFF has been building up
reserves in accordance with the provisions in its Articles and Policy
Statement.  As of December 31, 1969, IFF's "lA" shares had a book value
equal to 137% of par. IFF shares are not listed on the Stock Exchange.
In 1969, three major commercial banks listed on the Stock Exchange
paid dividends at the rate of 11% p.a.

Quality of Portfolio
3.09      IFF flow has 583 active loans in its portfolio.  Of these,
115 loans are to projects still under construction; 468 projects have
been completed and are in operation. The outstanding loan and equity
portfolio as of December 13, 1969 was Fmk 248 million. There were
arrears of interest and/or principal in respect of 12 projects. The
total amount overdue for more than 30 days was Fmk 0.18 million. The
outstanding principal amount of loans to which these arrears related
was Fmk 1.5 million or 0.6% of the outstanding portfolio.  These figures
show a remarkable record of collections. 1FF has experienced only
very few defaults and loan rescheduling is rare. So far, IFF has in-
curred no losses. The provision for doubtful loans and investments
at Fmk 5.1 million is quite adequate. IFF's portfolio is sound and
the balance sheet value does not overstate its real worth.
IV. PROSPECTS OF IFF
4.01      As stated in paragraph 2.01, the Finnish economy is in a
boom condition which started in late 1967. Industrial production in
1969 increased by more than 10%, and the growth outlook remains favor-
able.  With a high dependence on the private sector, it is expected
that private industrial investment will continue to run at a high
level. For that reason, and also because of the relatively small
proportion of finance that IFF provides to the private industrial
sector, IFF should not face any lack of business during the next two
years.
4.02      In the following paragraphs IFF's capital needs are discussed
on an overall basis without showing local currency/foreign currency
breakdown. Although the proportion of expenditure incurred on directly
identifiable imports in IFF's total disbursements has been about 35%-
40%, the locally procured goods contain a fairly high proportion of
imported inputs. It is estimated that, over all, about 55%-6o% of
IFF's total disbursements are to meet imports, although the percentage
varies from project to project. The Bankts financing of IFF's pro-
jects has been on the basis of a fixed proportion of IFF's total
disbursements (45% for Loan 420-FI and 50% in the case of 582-FI),
on individual projects.
Forecast of Oerations and Resource Requirements
4.03      IFF's projections for the period 1970-1974 show only a
modest increase in total loan and equity commitments compared with
the actual 1969 level of about Fmk 96 million (Annex 13). For the
five-year period, an annual growth rate of about 6$ has been forecast,
reaching a level of Fmk 130 million in 1974. Equity investments have,
however, been forecast to increase relatively more rapidly, growing
from Fmk 1.2 million in 1969 to an estimated Fmk 15 million in 1974.



- 13 -
This is in line with IFF's plans to give more emphasis to investments
in share capital. Considering the actual business achieved by IFF
during the past two completed years, the forecast level of business
appears realistic.
4.o4      The present Bank loan is expected to be fully committed
by the end of September 1970. IFF's uncommitted resources as of
July 1, 1970 amounted to Fmk 17 million. This amount together with
collections to be made through September 1970 will be sufficient to
meet IFF's commitments through September 1970.
4.o5      IFF's commitments during the two year period October 1970 -
September 1972 are estimated at Fmik 213 million, or US$ 50.7 million
equivalent. IFF's loan collections (minus repayments) during this
period will amount to FMk 43 million and retained earnings (after
payment of taxes and dividends) during the same period are estimated
at Fmk 7 million.  In addition, IFF will receive Fmk 13 million
in 1971 from a proposed capital increase (see para. 4.09). Finally,
IFF has secured commitments from its shareholders for subscriptions
to IFF debentures totalling Fmk 36 million. Taking into account the
availability of funds from all these sources, there will be a gap
of Fmk 114 million in IFF's total requirements of funds to meet its
estimated comaitments to the ond of September 1972.
Proposed Bank Loan
4.o6      In the case of the last two loans, the Bank has financed
IFF projects on the basis of a fixed proportion of its total disburse-
ments. For the proposed loan, it is recommended that the Bank continue
this basis of financing IFF projects. However, the proportion financed
by the Bank should be reduced as IFF should be reducing its dependence
on Bank funding. Also, with the improved capital market climate it
should now be possible for IFF to seek some of its resource require-
ments from the market. Consequently, it is recommended that the
Bank reduce the proportion of its financing from 50% to 40% of IFF's
total commitments. On this basis it is recommended that the Bank
grant IFF a fourth loan of US$ 20 million. Assuming the past pro-
portion of import financing in IFF's total disbursements, 55% to 60%,
the proposed Bank loan will cover about 2/3 of IFF's disbursements
to finance imports. A schedule of estimated disbursements is attached
as Annex 14.
4.07      The remaining gap in the capital requirements of IFF to
meet estimated commitments to the end of September 1972 would be
Fmk 30 million. During negotiations, various alternatives were dis-
cussed, including a private bond issue by IFF, additional subscriptions
to IFF debentures by its shareholders and borrowings from the Bank
of Finland. A bond issue by IFF amounting to Fmk 10 million and a
loan of Fmk 10 million from the Bank of Finland were considered



- 14 -
possible by the company, and it is likely that the gap will be closed.
The coat of a private bond issue by IFF would probably be of the order
of 8 - 8S14. While the marginal spread on these funds would be negligible,
the average cost of capital to IFF will give it an overall spread of
about 2% in the next few years even with a relatively high cost bond issue.
Projected Profitability and Financial Position
4.o8     IFF's profitability will continue to be moderate.  After-tax
income is expected to rise from Fik 2.0 million in 1969 to Fmk 3.5
million in 1972. Ehccluding "B" class shares and taking into account
the proposed capital increase, the return on average equity is esti-
mated to be 8.9% in 1970 and 9.1% in 1972. A 7% dividend on "A"
shares is forecast to be paid in 1970. From 1971 onwards, IFF intends
to raise the dividend to 8% on "A" shares and pay 1% dividend on "B"
shares.
4.09     IFF proposes to increase its paid-in capital by Fmk 13 million
in 1971 (including "B" class shares amounting to Fmk 5 million). IFF
is confident that the new issue will be fully subscribed. The proposed
increase will also help keep the over-all capital structure in balance.
4.10     IFF's total assets are forecast to grow by about 25% in 1970
and 1971 and by about 12% in 1972, reaching Fik 444 million in 1972.
The loan and investment portfolio is estimated to increase from
Fmk 311 million in 1970 to Fmk 433 million in 1972 and total term
debt outstanding is expected to grow from Fmk 286 million in 1970 to
Fmk 394 million in 1972. The ratio of long-term debt (including
subordinated loans) to equity is forecast to be 8.3:1 at the end of
1972.  The debt/equity ratio as defined in the propos-d Bm7nk Loan Agreement
will remain within the set limit of 3:1, rising from 2.2 in 1970 to
2.8 in 1972.
4.11     IFF's liquidity position and its debt service coverage will
remain satisfactory during the forecast period. Annual loan collec-
tions will cover debt repayments by more than 2.3 times. Annual in-
terest payments after 1971 are estimated to be 0.88 times IFF's net
profits before financial expenses. The corresponding figure for the
last two completed years was 0.86 and o.84. IFF's debt coverage
position should remain satisfactory during the entire period of the
proposed Bank loan. Projected financial statements are attached as
Annexes 15-19. These do not take into account, the effect of the
increase in the Bank's lending rate to 71-. It is estimated that
IFF's interest expense will increase by about Fmk 30,000 in 1971,
Fmk 50,000 in 1972 and Fmk 114,000 in 1973.  At least a part of this
will be passed on to the ultimate borrowers.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECO, 0-1NDAT! OTS
5.01      IFF is a small institution in the economic environment of
Finland, catering to the needs of small and medium-scale enterprises
mainly in the non-traditional sectors of industry. However, its
project appraisal techniques are recognized in the country for their
competence and have had significant educational impact. IFF has also
played an important role in reforming tax legislation affecting the
capital market development in Finland.
5.02      IFF operates in an economy where, because of the limited
domestic market, most projects have to be export-oriented to be
commercially viable. It does not need, therefore, to set up separate
measures other than profitability, to judge the economic merits of
the projects it finances. IFF's project appraisal and loan super-
vision procedures and techniques are satisfactory. Loan supervision
has improved in recent years.
5.03      IFF is well managed although it could be more aggressive,
particularly in the field of equity financing. The staff is com-
petent.
5.04      IFF's profitability is moderate.  Its portfolio is sound
with very small arrears; rescheduling of loans is rare. Provisions
are adequate. It is a sound company.
5.05      IFF's prospects look good; with booming economic conditions
in Finland, IFF should face no difficulty in realizing the projected
volume of business. Its profitability and financial condition should
improve.
5.06      The Bank has been the major source of funds for IFF and
IFF remains a suitable recipient for the proposed fourth loan.
However, in the future IFF should reduce its reliance on the Bank.
In the two year period to end of September 1972, it is estimated
that IFF will need Fmk 213 million to meet projected commitments.
It is proDosed that the Bank finance only 40% of IFF's commitments
(compared with 45% and 50% in the case of the previous two loans,
respectively). On this basis it is recommended that the Bank grant
IFF a fourth loan of US$ 20 million.
5.07      The terms of the loan should be those normally applied to
lending to development finance companies, including the standard com-
mitment charge and a flexible amortization schedule.  Considering the
average size of IFF loans, no change is recommended in the free limit
(defined in terms of the total financing by IFF of a project, of
which 40% will be covered by the Bank), of US$ 750,000. To ensure
adequate supervision, it has been agreed that IFF shall submit at
least twqo projects in every quarter for prior approval of the Bank.
There is no need to change the debt/limit ratio, but it is recommended
to modify the existing definition of debt and equity so as to in-
clude the entire amount of "B" shares in the equity of IFF.

TEOLLISTAIIISRAHASTO OY - INDUSTRIALIZATION FUND OF FINLAND LTD.
Statement of Policies and Procedures
(Adopted by the Board of Administration, September 3, 1963; amended
April 29; 1968)
Teollistamisrahasto Oy - Industrialization Fund of Finland Ltd.
has been established to promote the establishment of new and the ex-
pansion of existing small-and medium-sized industrial enterprises
through loans and other forms of investment and to assist in the de-
velopment of a capital market in Finland. The Fund will conduct its
operations in accordance with sound investment banking practices.
Scope and Nature of Operations
1.     The Fund will invest in small-and medium-sized industrial en-
terprises in Finland. Proposals for the financing of projects in the
fields of agriculture and service industries will be considered only
in exceptional cases where such projects are closely associated with
or are likely to contribute directly to thae development of industry.
2.     It will invest only in enterprises which are privately managed
and operated, and will, as a rule, not consider projects requiring
finance in amounts less than Fmk 150,000.
3.     The Fund will invest in projects which will contribute to the
economic growth of the country. Projects will be judged on the basis
of their economic, technical and financial merits. The Fund will
finance onlr projects that will be soundly managed and appear on care-
ful investigation to be financially sound and economically and techni-
cally well conceived.
4.     The Fund's loans and other investments will be used to finance
fixed assets and, where appropriate, permanent working capital. The
Fund will not make short-term credits and will not engage in opera-
tions which are primarily devoted to the financing or refinancing of
exports or imports.
5.     nThe Fund will provide financial assistance in any fcrm cr
combination of forms it considers appropriate to its clients' and
to its own interests. It will consider its clients' needs for both
loan and, equity financing and will be prepared to offer not only
these, but other types of assistance such as loans with equity features,
loan guarantees and the underwriting of new securities issues.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
6.     The Fund will be prepared to provide such technical assistance
and advice as its clients may require in the formulation, execution,
and operation of their projects.
7.     The Fund considers that one of its major objectives is to assist
in the growth and development of the capital market in Finland.  To th-s
end, the Fund will act in such a manner as to broaden the market for in-
dustrial securities. The Fund will, where possible, engage in joint
operations with other financial institutions both domestic and foreign.
It stands ready and will actively endeavor to sell its own bonds when
it has need of such resources. It will sell its investments to local
and foreign private investors, whenever it can do so on appropriate
terms.
The Fund will study measures in the fields of taxation, fiscal
policy, foreign exchange regulations and accounting practices necessary
to assist the development of the capital market and will, in co-
operation with other interested entities in the public and private
sector, make appropriate recommendations for the adoption of such
measures.
Policies Regarding Financial Prudence
8.     The Fund will acquire adequate security for the loans it pro-
vides.
9.     The Fund will build up reserves consistent with sound financial
practice. In accordance with its Articles, it will set aside each year
15 per cent of its net profit after taxes until the reserves amount to
25 per cent of the paid-up share capital, and subsequently not less
than 10 per cent until the reserves amount to 50 per cent of the share
capital.
10.    The Fund will not assume the exchange risk on its borrowings
in foreign currency. It will pass that risk on to its borrowers to
the extent that it is not assumed by the Government of Finland.
11.    The following limitations will be observed by the Fund:
(a) The Fund's commitments in any single enterprise will
not exceed 15 per cent of the aggregate of (i) the
Fund's paid-up share capital, reserves, and (ii) the
outstanding amount of the Debentures I/1956, II/1963,
III/1966 and V/1967;
(b) The Fund's equity investments in any single enterprise
will not exceed 10 per cent of the Fund's paid-up share
capital and reserves;



Page 3
(c) The Fund will not make any equity investment if at the
time or as a result of such investment the total nominal
amount of the Fund's equity investments would exceed the
aggregate amount of its paid-up share capital and reserves.
(d) The Fund will refrain from taking a controlling interest
in any enterprise; to this end, it will not acquire more
than 25 per cent of the voting shares of any single en-
terprise, except as may temporarily be necessary in
connection with an underwriting, or in cases where the
Fund's investment is or would be in jeopardy.
Procedures and Organization
12.    Financing will be provided by the Fund directly to the ultimate
beneficiary. The Fund will not operate through intermediary institu-
tions.
13.    The Fund will build and strengthen its own management and
professional staff; it will develop a staff capable of providing
the financial and economic analysis, technical, accounting and
legal services, and supervision of previously concluded invest-
ments, necessary to carry out the functions previously referred
to.
