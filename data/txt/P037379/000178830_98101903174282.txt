REPORT AND RECOMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
FOR THE FOURTH DEVELOPIMENT BANK PROJECT
TO TEOLLISTAMISRAHASTO OY -- INDUSTRIALIZATION FUND OF FINLAND LTD.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF FINLAND
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $20 million to Teollis-
tamisrahasto Oy - Industrialization Fund of Finland Ltd. (IFF).
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the fourth to IFF, a private institut3.on
established in 1954, whose purpose is to assist the financing of private
industrial enterprises and the growth of the capital market. As part of
the reorganization of IFF in 1963, IFC subscribed to Fmk 502,000 of IFF's
ordinary shares, and the Bank made a loan of US $7 million. The Bank made
a second loan of US $14 million to IFF in 1965 and one of US $22 million in
1969. Although $10 million of the third loan remained to be disbursed as
of August 31, it is expected to be fully committed to sub-projects by the
end of September 1970 and fully disbursed by the end of 1972.
3.        In January 1970, IFF requested a fourth loan from the Bank. A
mission visited Finland in May to appraise IFF's position and prospects and
concluded that its performance and the outlook for its future operations jus--
tified further borrowing from the Bank. Negotiations for the proposed loan
were held in August 1970. The negotiators for the Borrower were Dr. Lassilas
acting General Mlanager of IFF, and Mr. Antson, Assistant General Manager of
IFF; the negotiator for the Guarantor was 14r. Pusa, Counselor of the Embassy
of Finland.
4.        The following is a summary statement of the Bank loans to Finland
as at August 31, 1970:

5.        In addition to its shareholding in 1FF, IFC has an investment, made
in February 1965, in Huhtamaki-Yhtyma Oy, a company manufacturing pharma-
ceuticals; IFC?s total investment included a loan of approximately US$700,000
(now fully repaid) and an equity participation of about US $100,000. This
investment was a joint operation with IFF. The present amount of IFC in-
vestrnents in Finland is US $230,122, including $159,279 in IFF.
6.        The Bank is considering a loan for a third highway project;
negotiations are expected to take place towards the end of 1970.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.        Borrower:          Teollistamisrahasto Oy - Industrialization-: Fund
of Finland Ltd.
Guarantor:         Republic of Finland
Amount:            The equivalent in various currencies of
US $20 million
Purpose:           To assist IFF in providing finance to private
industrial enterprises in Finland
Amortization:      In 17 years including a 2 year period of grace,
through semi-annual installments beginning on
May 1, 1973 and ending on November 1, 1987. The

zation schedule to conform substantially to the
aggregate of the amortization schedules appli-
cable to the sub-loans and investments financed
from the proceeds of the proposed loan
Interest Rate:     7-1/4 percent

PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A report on the project entitled "Appraisal of Teollistamisrahasto
Oy - Industrialization Fund of Finland Ltd." (DB-71a) is attached (No. 1).
9.        The high concentration of industrial exports on wood-based produc'ts
combined with recurrent inflationary pressures have been the major reasons
for the fluctuations that have strained the Finnish economy in the past.
Following the devaluation and stabilization measures of 1967, steps have
been taken to increase exports, to raise the extent of domestic processing
of export products and to complement with more dynamic industries the trad-
itional pulp and paper industries whose rate of growth has lately been de-
clining. These steps have resulted in a marked improvement of the balance
of payments with new exports, mostly from the engineering, textile and chemi-'
cal industries, expanding rapidly. IFFts role in support of these measures
has been, and will continue to be, vitally important.



-3 -
10.       IFF is the only privately owned and managed financial institution
in Finland to provide long-term financing to private industrial enterprises.
Established in 1954, it was reorganized in 1963, in collaboration with the
Bank and IFC, as an investment corporation capable of attaining an adequate
return on equity, attracting new capital and providing direct financing to
industries. 1FF is a well-established institution with an efficient staff,
which carries out its operations in accordance with sound policies. Be-
cause of his return to the Bank of Finland as a Member of its Board of
Management, Dr. Jaakko Lassila, IFF's General Manager since 1967, has just
been replaced by Mr. Pertti Tuomala, formerly a M4ember of the Board of
Management and Assistant Director of the Central Bank of the Cooperative
Banks of Finland Ltd. IFF's profitability remains modest but has improved
over the past two years, and the return on equity is expected to go up to
about 9 percent in 1972.
11.       IFF's level of activity has grown substantially, particularly sir,ce
its reorganization, reflecting the growth of industrial investment in Finlan.-3.
Commitments in respect of new loans and investments increased to Fmk 37.4
million in 1965, and although they fell in 1966 and early 1967 because of
the recession, they have picked up rapidly since. Commitments reached
Fmnk  96.4 million  in  1969 (about $24 million equivalent), and are ex-
pected to reach about FnIc 100 million in 1970. Increases of about
Fmk 5-10 million per year are forecast for the following four years. Loans
have been, and will continue to be, IFF's principal activity, but equity in-
vestments are now expected to increase relatively more rapidly in line with
IFFts policy to give more emphasis to investments in share capital. An
increase from Fmk 1.2 million in 1969 to Fmk 15 million in 1974 is projected.
12.       IFF is playing a more important role in the economy than its
share in the financing of total Finnish industrial development (about 4 per-
cent in 1969) would suggest, especially in promoting the diversification
of industry. The bulk of its commitments are for non-traditional activi-
ties (i.e., other than wood-based industries) such as food processing and
textiles, and are made to export-oriented firms. This policy is to be
continued in the future. IFF has also made a considerable educational
impact through its project appraisal methods and techniques. Moreover,
its management has been active in helping to secure the reform of tax legis-
lation affecting the capital market, and has recently introduced undert-riting
into Finland.
13.       The proposed Bank loan of $20 million would cover about 40 per-
cent of IFF's expected requirements for additional funds in the next two
years, when total commitments are expected to amount to some Fnk 210 million,
or about US $50 million. In the present situation of the international
financial market, IFF can have no assurance that it will be able to raise
funds abroad, but it has made arrangements with its shareholding institu-
tions for them to subscribe additional debentures and increase its share
capital. Debentures will be issued for Fmk 36 nillion before .mid-1972 and
IFF's capital will be raised by Fmk 13 million in 1971. IFF also intends



to issue bonds for Fmk 10-20 million and expects to receive a Fmk 10 million
loan from the Bank of Finland. These additional resources, together with
internally generated funds, will enable IFF to continue its operation on
a sound financial basis and will ensure full commitment of the proposed
Bank loan by the end of September 1972. Borrowing by the IFF and its sub-
sidiaries is limited to three times their consolidated capital and surplus.
14.       It is proposed to continue the arrangement under the previous
loans whereby the Bank finances a fixed percentage of IFF's disbursements
on investment projects. This percentage was set at 50 percent under the
latest loan, a proportion which was somewhat less than the average foreign
exchange component of IFF's projects. As IFF should be able to draw some
of its requirements from the market, and in order to decrease its dependence
on Bank funds, it is now proposed to reduce the proportion of Bank financing
to 40 percent of IFF's disbursements on investment projects.
15.       The limit to the size of a loan that may be made without the Bank-,
approval would remain unchanged at US $750,000.  This limit applies to the
total amount lent by IFF to a sub-borrower for any sub-project and not only
to the amount provided out of the proceeds of the Bank loan. In order to
ensure adequate supervision, it has been agreed that IFF will submit to the
Bank for prior approval every quarter at least two sub-loans, including,
when necessary, sub-loans below the $750,000 limit.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Teollistamisrahasto
Oy - Industrialization Fund of Finland Ltd., the draft Guarantee Agreement
between the Repulb..ic of Finland and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately.
17.       Except for the provision referred to in paragraph 14 above, under
which the Bank would finance 40 percent of disbursements made by IFF (Sectioi
2.02 of the Loan Agreement), the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements con-
form substantially to similar Agreements of the Bank for projects of this
type.
PART V - THE ECONOM4Y
18.       A "Memorandum on the Economic Situation of Finland" dated April 9.,
1970 (EM4A-20) was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 15, 1970
(R70-64). A basic data sheet is annexed.
19.       Finland's economic performance has been satisfactory since the
devaluation in October 1967 and subsequent stabilization. The agreement
between the Government, trade unions and employers on income policies has
been an essential factor in restoring internal stability and fostering post-
devaluation recovery. Credit policy guidelines have been laid down between
the Central Bank and the financial institutions to avoid excess demand and
prevent the overheating of the economy, and the Government has taken a nurmb-



- 5 -
of measures that should permit an effective counter-cyclical policy. Ex-
ports and investments have been the leading factor in the post-devaluation
expansion. After a short interval, imports recovered strongly, in particu-
lar because investment was stimulated by growing corporate profits and a
favorable economic outlook. Although exports continued to rise substantially
the balance on current account, in surplus until 1969, will this year revert
to a slight deficit. This situation is expected to persist through 1971,
and is being carefully watched by the Government.
20.       The large investment requirements of the Finnish economy cannot
be financed exclusively out of domestic resources, and consequently in the
absence of sufficient foreign borrowing, the country would have to follow
a financial policy that would slow down growth below the country's poten-
tialities and needs, in particular with respect to employment requirements.
Finland will, therefore, need further capital inflows to sustain its growth
over the next several years. Gross external capital requirements are esti-
mated at more than $200 million per year in 1970-73. In 1968-69 Finland
raised about $115 million in the international financial market, mostly in
Germany where six bond issues totalled $3105 million. Finland's special
geographical and political situation and the stringency in international
capital markets still severely limit the prospects for raising a sufficient
amount of long-term capital abroad. Continued Bank lending is therefore
justified.
21.       Total external medium- and long-term public debt outstanding as
of December 31, 1969 amounted to $787 million, of which $52 million was
undisbursed. Debt service payments are moderate. They will amount to
only about 3.7 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1970, and the debt
service ratio is not expected to increase appreciably in the next few years.
Finland's debt servicing record is very good, its borroAing capacity is sub-
stantial, and it is creditworthy for the proposed lending.
PART VI - COITLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEIENT
22.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOM1ENDATION
23.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed lopn-
