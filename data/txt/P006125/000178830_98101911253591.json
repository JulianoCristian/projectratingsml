sector in Bolivia, consisting of a supervised credit\n            program, survey of small mines and technical assistance to\n            participating institutions. Its overall cost is estimated at\n            US$18.2 million equivalent. The Bank loan of US$12.0 million\n            to the Government would cover the project's estimated\n            foreign exchange costs. It is the third Bank Group financing\n            for the mining sector but the first one for small mining. Of\n            the total loan amount, US$9.0 million would be relent to the\n            Banco Minero de Bolivia (BAMIN) for financing mining\n            subprojects; US$1.9 million would be used for equipment and\n            technical assistance to the Bolivian Geological Service\n            (GEOBOL) to continue the survey of small mines, including\n            pre-investment studies, and provide technical assistance to\n            small miners; and US$1.1 million would be used for technical\n            assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Metallurgy (MMM) in\n            policy planning and cadastral survey and to BAMIN in project\n            evaluation and supervision. To finance the project's\n            local costs, BAMIN and its loan beneficiaries would provide,\n            in equal parts, an equivalent of about US$4.0 million, and\n            the Government would contribute the remaining US$2.1 million."}, "docdt": "1976-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
