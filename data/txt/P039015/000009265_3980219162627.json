There are\n            five components in this project. First, institution building\n            and policy development will develop a regulatory and\n            monitoring framework and capacity, and undertake studies for\n            development of water sector policy. Second, preparation for\n            private sector management of urban water supply will support\n            the bidding process for the private sector management of the\n            water supply systems of the five cities, design and\n            construct emergency works, prepare plans for the provision\n            of sanitation services in the five cities. Third, rural\n            water supply and sanitation (RWSS) will reorient and reform\n            the management and implementation of RWSS. Fourth, water\n            resources management will develop a national water resources\n            management strategy. Fifth, human resources development will\n            emphasize management training and development."}, "docdt": "1998-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
