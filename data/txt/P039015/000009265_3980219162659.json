The project has\n            three components: i) urban and peri-urban water supply; ii)\n            rural water and sanitation; and iii) water resources\n            management. This project will involve little resettlements.\n            However, the study does provide guidance for future\n            resettlement planning, as well as standard environmental\n            requirements. During construction, noise, dust and air\n            emissions should be minimized by using modern equipment.\n            Measures must be taken to prevent oils and chemicals from\n            seeping into the ground or into water courses. Used oils and\n            lubricants should be collected and disposed out of the\n            working area. Trenches should be carefully backfilled to\n            avoid later subsidence and erosion. During operation, intake\n            water quality should be monitored regularly to minimize the\n            risk of unknown substance or minerals adversely affecting\n            drinking water. Significant leakage of pipes will cause\n            erosion and flooding, and should be prevented by automatic\n            monitoring of pressure of flow."}, "docdt": "1996-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
