       Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and\n            the Grenadines.  The project intends to achieve this by (a)\n            improving the quality of facilities and instruction, (b)\n            expanding training capacity and (c) enhancing sector\n            management.

In\n            addition, the project includes for each project school,\n            supplies and spare parts to be used in equipment maintenance\n            and in repair service programs.  Further to this, the\n            project entails technical assistance in support of training\n            program development efforts, establishing a labor market\n            information system with interregional linkages and\n            conducting feasibility studies on cost-saving/cost-recovery\n            measures in the education sector of all beneficiary states."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
