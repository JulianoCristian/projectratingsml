The\n            self-financing irrigation and drainage district (SIDDs),\n            introduced as a pilot project were successful to a large\n            extent. Adequate and Timely Counterpart Funds are Critical.\n            Active participation by government leaders at all levels and\n            project beneficiaries is very important in ensuring smooth\n            project implementation, especially in raising by local\n            counterpart funds, organizing contributions of labor for\n            large volume earthwork construction, and resolving\n            day-to-day project implementation problems and issues.

The project has\n            demonstrated positive economic viability of non-grain\n            production to meet changing market and demands when grain\n            production was less attractive."}, "docdt": "2005-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
