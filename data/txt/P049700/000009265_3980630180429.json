Component 1 consists of\n            irrigation and drainage works, mainly small-scale works,\n            including civil works for irrigation and drainage facilities\n            improvement and extension, and secondary and tertiary level\n            canal rehabilitation. The second finances agricultural\n            intensification and support services, including land and\n            soil improvement; provision for more intensive use of\n            organic fertilizer; strengthening production of high quality\n            seeds; improving agricultural extension systems with better\n            facilities, equipment, and staff training; establishing\n            fertilizer blending plants to provide chemical fertilizer;\n            building organic manure digesting pits; providing\n            agricultural production inputs and materials; and promoting\n            science & technology and integrated pest management.\n            Component 3, afforestation and environmental monitoring,\n            increases the vegetative cover as well as controls pests and\n            disease, and provides machinery and equipment.
