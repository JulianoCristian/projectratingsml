To minimize adverse effects on\n            farmers, caused by the project's land occupation,\n            construction, and housing relocation, recommendations\n            include quality upgrade of specified standards, by dredging,\n            and repairing existing branch canals, laterals, and ditches\n            as possible. Additionally, in some arable lands, the length\n            of ditches could be reduced, by replacing the curved on-farm\n            ditches with straight ones, and, if construction of new ones\n            is required, the farm land area of each household will be\n            adjusted during land leveling to ensure no area losses, and\n            ensure as well, that works be adjusted to the planting\n            season, to avoid any waste of crops. To maximize land uses,\n            canal profiles will be designed to control infiltration, and\n            reduce the canal cross-section areas. The study indicates\n            that the departments of land management have guaranteed\n            compensation, based on replacement costs, for those people\n            whose livelihoods may be affected by land acquisition, and,\n            provide as well, work benefits, and, grievance mechanisms,\n            to ensure their living standards, and rights are not disrupted."}, "docdt": "1998-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
