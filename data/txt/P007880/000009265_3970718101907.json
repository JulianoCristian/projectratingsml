this project\n            is to increase productivity, income and employment in three\n            selected agricultural frontier areas where rural development\n            projects are ongoing or being planned.  The project would\n            provide about 16,000 farmers and rural workers with basic\n            and intermediate skills courses in agricultural techniques\n            and artisan occupations over a six-year period.  A fund\n            would be established to provide credit for equipment, tools\n            and working capital to graduates of the intermediate skills\n            training program.  The project would strengthen SNPP's\n            capacity to conduct rural training and improve its ability\n            to coordinate and integrate its training program with rural\n            activities being implemented by other government agencies."}, "docdt": "1983-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
