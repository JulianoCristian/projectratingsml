and achievement.  Participation would be increased\n            by: (a) improving access facilities and school maintenance;\n            and (b) providing incentives to improve enrollment and\n            retention of children in school. Delivery would be improved\n            by: (a) introducing measures to enhance the recruitment,\n            motivation and retention of teachers; (b) improving the\n            supply, training and supervision of teachers; and (c)\n            improving planning, management and implementation of primary\n            education. Student achievement would be enhanced by\n            improving the quality, durability, distribution and\n            availability of teaching and learning materials, textbooks\n            and supplementary reading materials."}, "docdt": "1990-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
