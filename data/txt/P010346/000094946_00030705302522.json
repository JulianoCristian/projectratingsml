enrollment\n            rates. In spite of the extremely difficult conditions in\n            Sindh over the last ten years, sustainability is likely,\n            although some innovative features, introduced under the\n            project, remain uncertain due to financial constraints. The\n            lessons convey that although provision of primary education\n            improved, experience suggests that boys' education\n            enrollment cannot be taken for granted, - for, project\n            incentives were mainly designed for girls participation -\n            and boys education should also be prioritized when planning\n            for primary education improvement. Educational strategies\n            require realistic assessments of the managerial technical\n            capacity of implementing, managing, and financial\n            institutions, thus, the development of a sustained capacity\n            to design improved policies, and programs, remains a high\n            priority. The report further emphasizes the need for\n            synchronized planning in both, physical facilities for\n            schools with the related architects/engineers, and,\n            procurement capacity, which should be assessed early, in\n            accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.\n            While project ownership is paramount for implementing\n            agencies to sustain activities and skills, technical\n            assistance should be provided in support of the\n            borrower's efforts, ensuring the transfer, and\n            sustainability of those skills."}, "docdt": "2000-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
