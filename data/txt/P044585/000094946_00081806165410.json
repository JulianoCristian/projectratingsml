During\n            rehabilitation, and expansion of schools, it is expected\n            that unsuitable materials will pose environmental, and\n            health risks. Mitigation measures include: 1) precautionary\n            clauses in technical specifications, prescribing the quality\n            of materials to be used for construction works, restraining\n            insulation materials containing asbestos, and, the use of\n            lead-based paint; 2) construction and rehabilitation of\n            sanitary facilities, enforcing the above mentioned standards\n            for construction materials; 3) preparation of an\n            environmental training program for school principals, and,\n            an awareness campaign aimed at teachers, students, and\n            parents to minimize health risks, and enhance hygiene\n            measures in the school environment; 4) the design, and\n            introduction of a school upkeep, and maintenance system to\n            prevent school degradation; and, 5) an epidemiological study\n            on children's health, including information on\n            mortality causes among school students, in addition to\n            improvements in the medical system to observe\n            children's health status, thus facilitating\n            decision-making on health issues."}, "docdt": "2000-07-23T00:00:00Z"}
