Lessons learned\n            from the project: The commitment of the Djiboutian\n            government and of stakeholders was the leading factor\n            impacting on the satisfactory outcome of the project. Donor\n            coordination for a reform program, especially an ambitious\n            one, needs to be systematically organized using a formal\n            system. The beneficiary government needs to play a leading\n            role. A strong and reliable monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system is essential, particularly in undertaking\n            reforms. The new Bank policy on expenditure eligibility\n            approved for Djibouti in May 2005 provides flexibility and\n            reduces transaction costs to both the Government and the\n            Bank in the implementation of development programs. The\n            adaptable program lending (APL) approach provides the needed\n            flexibility and capacity building in implementing reform programs."}, "docdt": "2005-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
