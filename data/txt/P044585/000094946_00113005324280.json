         Improvement Program Project in Djibouti, is to enhance the\n            quality of education, and to increase enrollment in primary\n            schools. The components will: 1) finance the rehabilitation\n            of new classrooms for primary, and middle schools, expected\n            to increase school enrollment capacity. Additionally,\n            rehabilitation works will also include sanitation services;\n            2) improve teacher training curricula, upgrade\n            qualifications of training staff, and expand the capacity of\n            the Personnel Training Center for National Education\n            (CEPEN), to provide improved training to primary school\n            teachers. This would entail additional classroom\n            construction, and refurbishment at the Center, as well as\n            provision of subsidies to teachers during training.\n            Technical assistance (TA) will be provided to the National\n            Education Research and Information Production Center\n            (CRIPEN), for the reform of grades 1-9 curriculum, and for\n            the development of new textbooks. Training will also be\n            provided for Head Masters on administrative, pedagogic, and\n            community relations responsibilities; and, 3) improve the\n            Government's capacity to manage sector reforms, by\n            supporting the activities of the National Education\n            Organization Committee (CNOSEGE) to coordinate reforms, and\n            manage resources. The component will also finance capacity\n            building of the Ministry of Education's Planning Unit,\n            and the Education Projects Bureau; and, TA will improve\n            public-private partnerships, effective gender strategies,\n            and textbook policy reforms."}, "docdt": "2000-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
