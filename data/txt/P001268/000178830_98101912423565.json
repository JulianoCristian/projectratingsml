        during 1980-1982. The main objectives of the plan are to\n            preserve investment in existing paved roads; to selectively\n            upgrade the existing road network; to establish equitable\n            levels of road access throughout Kenya, with special\n            emphasis on rural areas; to maintain existing classified\n            roads to acceptable standards; to strenghthen the Ministry\n            of Works; and to enforce traffic regulations. Components of\n            the proposed project would include: (a) strenghthening and\n            reconstruction of existing paved roads; (b) upgrading of\n            existing earth/gravel roads to bituminous standards, and\n            upgrading of existing earth roads to all-weather standard;\n            (c) extension of the Rural Access Roads Program; (d) support\n            for the Maintenance program; (e) support for the traffic law\n            enforcement and road safety program; (f) technical\n            assistance and consultants' services for studies; and\n            (g) provision of buildings and equipment."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
