      Rehabilitation Project for Rwanda were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible; the Bank's performance was satisfactory;\n            and the Borrower's performance was also satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: supply side and demand side\n            should be tackled together to enhance outcomes. Early\n            acknowledgement of shortfalls in project design and\n            proactivity can ensure realism. Decentralization of project\n            supervision: in countries and sectors with limited\n            experience and institutional capacity, the World Bank group\n            can provide considerable value added by decentralizing\n            project supervision and implementation support resources to\n            country offices. The bank as well as borrowers should be\n            realistic about the time it takes to initiate and complete\n            project activities, taking into account the implementation\n            capacity of the borrower and the potential technical\n            challenges in project implementation."}, "docdt": "2011-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
