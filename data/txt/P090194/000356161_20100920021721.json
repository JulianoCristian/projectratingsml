Food will be provided during construction of\n            the new site.

Assistance for loss of\n            rental accommodations will be compensated at six months rent\n            to cover moving disturbances. Concerning encroachers and\n            vulnerable groups, assistance will be provided in securing\n            other access to land for crops growing, subject to approval\n            of local authorities/communities.
