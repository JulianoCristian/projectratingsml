EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction and Study Objectives
The Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) being implemented by its partners including
ELECTROGAZ Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA) and RURA through the UERP Project Coordinating
Unit (PCU) plans to construct a substation in Birembo as part of its effort to ensure effective distribution of
energy in Rwanda which remains one of the fundamental objectives of the UERP. For this reason in
compliance in accordance with the operational policy and procedures of the World Bank and the regulation
of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study
report must be prepared to identify the potential adverse impacts of the projects. The Environmental
Safeguards Advisor (EA) for the UERP has therefore prepared an EIA report in the fulfillment of these
requirements.

The objectives of the study were to:
    · Identifying both positive and negative impact of the project and the most appropriate interventions
          during construction, operation and decommissioning of the project based on the new proposed
          site.

    · Undertake a baseline socioeconomic background of the project area and potential impact expected
          from project construction, implementation, operation and decommissioning,

    · Develop an (Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to be implemented

    · Develop an Environmental Monitoring Program during construction and operation and present
          plans to minimize, mitigate, or eliminate negative effects and impacts

This Project is classified under category B according to the World Bank Operational Procedure and
therefore only requires the preparation of an EMP. However, Rwanda's Organic Law requires an EIA report
and therefore this is an EIA report prepared to fulfill the Organic Law while at the same time, meet the
bank's EMP requirements.

Project Description
The UERP through ELECTROGAZ and its implementing agencies including RURA and MININFRA is
seeking a contractor to install a substation in Birembo area which is in Kinyinya sector, Gasabo District in
Kigali Province. The project is a response to the emergency power generation programme by the
UERP/ELECTROGAZ under a World Bank loan following the acute energy crisis experienced by Rwanda.

Substations are essential for the smooth running of any electrical system. They are the point where high
voltage electricity is reduced (or "stepped down") into lower voltage electricity suitable for distribution into
commercial and residential areas. The proposed Birembo sub station will basically play the role if stepping
down the high voltage electricity into low voltage and then to be distributed to the commercial and residential
areas in Kigali. Specifically, ELECTROGAZ would like to expand the electricity network on the Eastern part
of Kigali city and it is for this reason that the site in Birembo was selected.

Administratively the site for the proposed sub station is situated in the province of Kigali, in the District of
Gasabo, Kinyinya sector in the Murama cell. The actual project site is approximately 3 kilometres from the
Deutsche Welle broadcasting station along a dusty murram road interspersed with rural households.




                                                                                                              2

The project will involve the construction of a new 110/15 kV - MW sub station at the site. The new Birembo
substation will be in the final stage the main substation of the national grid and the main feeder substation
for the Kigali distribution system. On the 220kV and 110kV level it will be an outdoor substation; the 15kV
level will be of the indoor type.

The substation will be erected in three main stages:

STAGE 1
This will involve the construction of a 110/15 kV substation with one 110 kV line bay, one 110/15kV
transformer bay and one 110/70 kV autotransformer bay. The substation will be connected to the overhead
line of Jabana ­ Gasogi. This is a new line that is planned for construction under the UERP Distribution
component.

From this indoor substation two 15 (30) kV double circuit lines, length 7.5km, will go in the direction of
Rubungo and Remera to connect the existing 15kV network of the surrounding areas north east of the town
center (area of Kacyiru, Kibagabaga, Rubungo, Nyabisindu, Kimironko, Nyarutarama, etc.) ­A separate EIA
and ARAP is under preparation for the entire UERP distribution component that will include this line and all
the other lines proposed in that component which will identify associated adverse impacts.

The distribution component EIA/ARAP report once finalised will be submitted to the bank and REMA for
review and approval. The construction of the Jabana ­ Gasogi line and other lines in the distribution
component of the UERP is expected to start in July 2009.

STAGE 2
This will involve the extension of the Birembo substation by an additional 110kV line bay for the
interconnection with Uganda and an additional transformer 110/15kV (TR2). The construction of this line is
still under planning phase and no actual timing has been decided upon. Once a definite time frame is
decided upon, an EIA and ARAP report will be prepared and submitted for approval to the bank and REMA.

STAGE 3
This will involve the extension of the Birembo substation by a 220kV substation with one line bay and two
220/110 kV power transformer bays for the interconnection on the 220kV level with Tanzania.       Also there
will be a further extension of the 110kV substation by two bays for connecting the power transformers
220/110kV. The construction of this line is still under planning phase and no actual timing has been decided
upon. Once a definite time frame is decided upon, an EIA and ARAP report will be prepared and submitted
for approval to the bank and REMA.

Note: Only Stage 1 will be part of this contract, however areas and designs for future extensions (Stage 2
and Stage 3) will be availed by the contractor.

Birembo Substation ­ Stage 1

The new substation will be constructed outside the town of Kigali in the north close to the tower 198 of the
110(70) kV overhead line from Jabana to Gasogi. The GPS coordinates of the tower 198 are:

Table 1.
                      Zone                           East                            North

                      36M                           180264                         9788846




                                                                                                           3

The substation will be looped in to the 110kV line coming from Jabana substation and continuing via
Gasogi, Musha, and Rwamagana to Kabarondo as a 70kV line. In the final layout, the substation will be the
main substation of the national grid and the main feeder substation for the Kigali distribution system.

The new substation shall be of a conventional open air type (AIS) for the 110 kV voltage level and of an
indoor SF6 insulated switchgear type (GIS) for the 15 (30) kV level. Construction of this sub station is
expected to begin in July 2009.

Proposed Activities
The construction of the substation shall also include related engineering works, earthworks, and service
utility buildings including an engine hall and control building.

Project Alternatives
The study assessed potential project alternatives in terms of
      · Project site Alternative,
      · Alternative project with capacity to achieve the same goal,
      · Process or material alternatives: Materials and process alternative
      · No project alternative.

Positive Impacts
The proposed substation will contribute immensely in the access and distribution of electricity to the
households in the project area as well as increased supply of electricity to the residents of Kigali city. In
effect, the beneficial impacts of the substation are mainly those associated with availability of electricity and
include among others: Access to lighting for institutions and homesteads, increase in the growth of industrial
and small and micro enterprises, improved security, and reduced reliance on fuel wood for different activities
among others.

Adverse Impacts

Destruction of Vegetation and Crops
The proposed project site for the construction of the substation plant is located in an area that is currently
being utilized by the PAPs to cultivate crops including Avocado trees, Tomato, Orange trees, Mango trees,
Grevillea, Pepper, Ficus Trees, Eucalyptus Trees, Euphorbia Trees, Flowers, Cassava, Euphorbia live
fence, Maracuja, Cactus tree, Lemon trees, Papaya trees among others as well as a few scattered trees.

These crops and trees will inevitably have to be removed to pave way for the construction of the substation

Land Acquisition
The project will only acquire approximately 2.9 ha of the existing land area for which is currently under
different uses and separately owned by four individuals one of the owners being a church.

There will also be compensation for land because the land in question is owned by 4 different households'
individuals who use the targeted land for shelter, raising of livestock and cultivating crops.

Noise Pollution
There is expected to be noise impacts during the construction of the substation and this will mainly emanate
from the activities and operations of heavy vehicles including trucks, excavators, tippers and tractors. Noise
impacts from the machinery during the construction phase could be significant and hence adequate
mitigation measures will be put in place to minimize the impact especially on workers.




                                                                                                               4

However, noise impacts will primarily be insignificant during the operation stage of the project especially on
residents because sub stations of this capacity generally do not emit noise of more than 39 decibels within
the plant boundary. The particular equipment that will be procured under this contract has been designed to
meet these requirements.

According to the standards of World Bank in relation to noise emission, when implementing projects in
residential/institutional zones, then a maximum limit of 45-55 is allowed for day and night. Levels beyond
this are considered adverse and not acceptable. The sub station will emit noise during operation from the
transformers and this will not exceed 39 decibels within the plant boundary. However, for the substation
workers, noise is inevitable within the plant area and noise mitigating measures to protect workers will be
put in place as described in the mitigation section of this report.

Rwanda does not have noise pollution standards for comparison and hence in the absence of these
standards, the World Bank standards will be used.

Soil Erosion
There is a likelihood of localized soil erosion during the civil works which entail compacting, earth
excavations and moving works. However, these impacts will be largely localized to the project area and will
only occur during the construction phase.

Waste and Waste oil pollution
Waste is also an output of the project that poses potential environmental problem in case of poor handling
and disposal methods. Poor disposal of waste oil filters also has a potential of adversely affecting the
environment through water and soil contamination.

Workers Health and Safety
Adverse impacts on the workers health and safety is likely to occur especially through workers interaction
with the equipments and machines during construction and operation of the plant. Accidents are likely to
occur during construction and operations when the equipments are in use, and further to this if workers are
exposed to the noise of the equipments could lead to potential harm on health of the workers.

Traffic Congestion
During the construction phase, heavy moving vehicles in and out of the project site are likely to increase
traffic along the Kinyinya-Deustche Welle road and could cause congestion.

General Environmental Management Conditions and Measures
Annex 6 of this report contains generalized environmental management conditions that the contractor will be
obligated to fulfill. These are general conditions providing an overall guidance and conditions to ensure
environmental safeguards. However, specific mitigation measures are also highlighted and are included in
summary below with the detailed mitigation measures found in the EMP section.


Mitigation Measures
Compensation for Land, Loss of Crops and Damage to Existing structures
The UERP/PCU will compensate for all the land, structures and crops that will be destroyed to pave way for
the construction at the time of construction of the substation.       This compensation will be calculated
according to the Resettlement Framework Policy document and will include compensation for labor on any
work undertaken in terms of digging, planting and weeding of the land prior to the establishment of a cut of
date. A separate Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) has been prepared and adequately




                                                                                                            5

addresses issues in relation to compensation as required by the bank and Rwanda law on resettlement.
This ARAP has been approved by REMA and the bank and disclosed locally and in the infoshop.

Noise Abatement Measures
    · All equipments and machinery installed must be tested to verify if they are compliant with the World
       Bank acceptable standards of noise as contained in the World Bank Pollution Prevention and
       Abatement Handbook (PPAH) 1998. The tested noise levels should be recorded as baseline and
       used for future monitoring.

    · Noise emitting equipment should comply with the applicable Rwanda and World Bank noise
       standards and should be properly maintained. The World Bank environmental regulations allow a
       maximum 70dB noise level in industrial zones and 45 dB(day), and 55 dB (night) for residential
       areas.   The project site is a rural residential zone and hence the standards of the bank for
       residential areas must be met. The sub station will emit noise during operation mainly from the
       transformers and this will not exceed 39 decibels within the plant boundary. This is because the
       transformers have been designed internationally to emit no more than 39 decibels within the plant
       boundary.

    · All workers in the project site must be equipped with the necessary and required Personal
       Protective Equipment (PPE) prescribed by the Directorate of Occupation Health and Safety of the
       Ministry of Health but not limited to facilities to protect against noise impacts, ear muffs, safety
       helmets, boots, dust masks, gloves, overall, goggles, hearing protection etc.

Soil Erosion Mitigation Measures
    · The final site grade should include an adequate drainage channel which should facilitate drainage
       to avoid flooding and pooling. A site drainage plan should be developed to protect against erosion.
       Protecting stockpiles through the use of silt fencing and reduced slope angles should be used to
       minimize soil erosion during construction.

    · Installation of drainage ditches is necessary. Minimization of disturbances and scarification of the
       surface should be observed to reduce erosion impacts.

    · Borrow pit areas (if any) should avoid other non site areas; borrow areas should be reworked to
       blend into the surroundings. Re-vegetation should be performed using local plants. All slopes and
       working surfaces should be returned to a stable condition.

    · Topsoil on the final site would be graded and re-planted as appropriate.

Dust Emission Mitigation Measure(s)
    · Fugitive emissions from roads and site work to be eliminated or minimized by applying water on a
       need to need basis to dirt roads, unpaved surfaces and exposed construction areas during the dry
       season.

    · The dirt roads and exposed construction areas should be moisturised during the dry season to
       prevent or minimise the fugitive dust emissions.

Workers Health and Safety Mitigation Measure(s)
    · All workers entering the construction site must be equipped with PPE including ear muffs, factory
       boots, overalls, gloves, dust masks, among others. The PPE should be those that meet the
       international standards of PPE.



                                                                                                         6

     · Personal protection gear must be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire
         workforce of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear, handling of chemical
         products and acid storage cells, electric safety equipment, procedures for entering enclosed areas,
         fire protection and prevention, emergency response and care procedures. Training given to the
         employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures.

     · `Restricted ENTRY' signs should be installed to keep away unqualified workers from access to
         restricted areas.

     · Machines and Equipments must be operated only by qualified staff and a site supervisor should be
         on site at all times to ensure adherence.

     · The contactor must develop a workers Health and Safety Manual for which all the workers should
         be conversant with for response in case of accidents.

     · The contractor should develop an Emergency Response Plan for handling any emergencies arising
         thereof during the construction.

     · A perimeter fence should be constructed all around the project site to keep away unauthorised
         persons from the site.

Fire Suppression Measure(s)
The construction site must contain fire fighting equipments of recommended standards and in key strategic
points all over the site. Fire pumps, hydrants, sprinkler/water spray systems, hose houses, dry chemical
systems, carbon dioxide systems, detection/alarm systems and portable fire extinguishers are all specified
in the tender documents as necessary in the plant. All these fire suppression equipments are required in a
plant and must all be present at key strategic points. The contractor is expected to provide all these
equipment for fire suppression as stipulated in the tender documents.

A fire evacuation plan should be developed by Contractor and ELECTROGAZ and must be posted in
various points of the construction site including procedures to follow when a fire is reported. All workers
must be trained on fire management and fire drills undertaken regularly.

Solid waste pollution and littering
     · ELECTROGAZ and the contractor should develop a solid waste disposal plan which includes the
         provision of receptacles at strategic points within the construction site, recycling programmes for
         recyclable wastes, separation of wastes.

     · ELECTROGAZ and contractor should engage a refuse handling company to remove the wastes
         from the site to the recommended waste management site.

     · Warning signs against littering and dumping within the construction site should be erected by the
         contactor.




                                                                                                          7

Accidents at the work place from operating of machineries and equipment by
workers

    · Personal protection gear will be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire workforce
        of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear, handling of chemical products and acid
        storage cells, electric safety equipment, procedures for entering enclosed areas, fire protection and
        prevention, emergency response and care procedures.

    · Training given to the employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures

    · Restricted ENTRY signs should be installed to keep away unqualified workers from access to
        restricted areas.

    · Machines and equipments must be operated only by qualified staff and a site supervisor should be
        on site at all times to ensure adherence.

    · The contactor must develop a workers Health and Safety Manual for which all the workers should
        be conversant with for response in case of accidents.

    · The contractor should develop an Emergency Response Plan for handling any emergencies arising
        thereof during the operation.

Monitoring Plan
The EMP proposes parameters to be monitored during preparation, operation and decommissioning of the
plant.

Conclusion and Recommendations
On the basis of the EIA study of the Birembo substation, the following conclusions have been drawn by the
UERP/PCU Safeguards Advisor:
    · An annual environmental audit should be conducted to review the compliance to the proposed
        Environmental Management Plan.

    · The project in the short term is environmentally feasible with the implementation of the mitigation
        measures prescribed in the EMP. The benefit of the project outweighs the costs of the project and
        being an emergency stop gap measure to save the country from long term outages, the
        environmental implications can be mitigated against the costs of the project on environment.

    · The contractor's tender documents have elaborately spelt out the mitigation requirements against
        environmental degradation during construction and installation and thus serve as a good basis for
        developing the EMP.

Recommendations
    · An Environmental Audit (EA) should be conducted annually to review compliance to the proposed
        Environmental Management Plan.           According the EIA regulations of REMA, an annual
        environmental audit must be conducted at the end of every year once the diesel plant begins
        operating. The audit will be conducted by registered REMA consultants or the environmental
        safeguards advisor as required by the Organic Law on environmental protection.




                                                                                                           8

    · The goal of this EA is to establish and ascertain the extent to which the project achieved
        compliance with the environmental mitigation measures and requirements that were specified in
        the approved EIA report and make recommendations for correcting any problematic or non-
        compliant activities.

    · It is expected as required by the REMA EIA regulations that the cost of the environmental audit will
        be paid for by the client in this case ELECTROGAZ who will engage competent registered
        consultants.

REMA Approval
This EIA and ARAP report has been submitted to Rwanda Environment Management Authority for approval
and required approval and go ahead to proceed with the project with conditions have been accorded by
REMA upon review of the report. These conditions for approval are included in the annex 10 section of this
report.

2.0 INTRODUCTION


Energy is crucial to Rwanda's economic growth. In Rwanda, electricity is the second most important source
of commercial energy for the formal sector after petroleum fuels. Commercial and industrial establishments
as well as institutions and households in the country use electricity.

Rwanda remains among the lowest per capita electricity and petroleum products consumption countries in
the world. Only about 65,000 (6-8percent) of households have access to grid supplied power, almost
entirely in the main urban areas. Diesel remains the primary fuel for self-generation in rural areas, and also
fro back up in urban areas during the current crisis, and kerosene for lighting for the vast majority.

Grid extension has been extremely limited, and economically justified only to meet rural industrial loads and
emerging population clusters.

Rwanda's post conflict genocide economic recovery is under threat from severe power supply shortages. A
combination of strong demand growth with unexpectedly low water levels in its hydro power sourced lakes
further exacerbated by high technical losses and unreliability of ELECTROGAZ dilapidated network, have
led to extensive and lengthy power cuts.

Despite re-commissioning of an old diesel power plant, load shedding has increased to about 25% of peak
demand with serious adverse consequences. Supply shortages have raised the cost of doing business, in
particular for short export enterprises, and weakened the prospect of attracting new investments. Power
supply shortages have also worsened water supply problems in the main urban areas, leaving
ELECTROGAZ to switch to diesel water pumping and adding to its financial woes.

Rwanda already imports 60% of its electricity needs, mostly from SNEL and Sinelac plants in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and there is a little scope to increase this further. In the near term before
any new hydro or gas based power can be brought on line, Rwanda will have to increasingly rely on higher
costs diesel power (about 150USc/kWh compared to 2003 average bulk supply cost of around 5USc/kwh).

Urbanization and industrial growth, combined with limited access to electricity and high cost of petroleum
products have led to an even more rapid growth in urban charcoal demand. Severe deforestation during
conflict, in part by internally displaced persons and returning refugees has been further compounded by the
large scale demands for charcoal making, construction materials, and agro industrial, institutional and
commercial customers.

By the end of 2004 Rwanda has faced year energy crisis that has never happened before. The Government
Rwanda of (GoR) ELECTROGAZ through has managed to mitigate the crisis by putting in places Diesel
Power Plantations with additional capacity of about 12.5 MWS. The effort to get rid of the deficit has
continued. As part of the strategy of the Government of Rwanda to arrest the energy crisis in the country,
the GoR has asked the World Bank for support of its Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP). The
overall development objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) Alleviate the power shortages: and (ii)
enhance the capabilities of energy sector institutions.

The UERP project is intended to further mitigate the power crisis in Rwanda and to help to restore good
utility practice heart its facilities. The project is being coordinated by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)

housed in ELECTROGAZ and which works under the overall responsibility of a Steering Committee chaired
by the Ministry of Infrastructure. This study was commissioned by UERP/PCU to assess the environmental
effects of the proposed substation.




                                                                                                  13

2.0 STUDY SCOPE AND
METHODOLOGY

The scope of the study was determined by the influence of the potential impacts and stakeholders input.
The terms of reference also helped in shaping the scope as well as the methodology to be applied in
assessing the impacts.

The study was undertaken in the Birembo area and its environs. Administratively the site for the proposed
sub station is situated in the province of Kigali City, in the District of Gasabo, Kinyinya sector in the Murama.
The actual project site is approximately 3 kms from the Deutsche Welle broadcasting station along a dusty
murram road interspersed with rural households.


2.1 Study Scope
A rapid scoping study was undertaken at the beginning of the study. This exercise helped the EIA to define
the spatial and contextual scope of the study.

The scoping process helped the EIA identify the issues that were likely to be of priority importance during
the study and eliminates those that were of little concern. The rapid scoping exercise also enabled the
consultants identify the stakeholders and public concerns.

Scoping exercise also helped in introducing the project to stakeholders and involving them in determining
the scope and focus of the EIA study.

2.2 Methodology
Baseline Assessment
Baseline data was first collected from secondary data however the EA discovered that not much data has
been collected in the area. The EA went to the field to collect primary data.

Data collected included information on; physical environment: geology; topography; soils; climate and
meteorology; ambient air quality; surface and ground water hydrology; existing sources of air emissions;
existing water pollution discharges; and receiving water quality, biological environment: flora; fauna; rare or
endangered species; sensitive habitats, including significant natural sites etc.; species of commercial
importance; species with potential to become nuisances, vectors or dangerous and socio-cultural
environment: population, land use; planned development activities; community structure; employment;
distribution of income, goods and services; recreation; public health and safety; cultural aspects/properties;
aspirations and attitudes.

Project Alternatives
The EA analysed the various project alternatives available to achieve this project's objectives but with the
least adverse environmental impacts. The alternatives were identified and evaluated determining impacts
and cost implications of each alternative.




                                                                                                              14

Public Consultation
During the scoping process, a stakeholder mapping exercises was undertaken to identify Interested and
Affected Parties (I&AP) to the project. The mapping exercise was conducted simultaneously with the
scoping exercise. The exercise identified all the stakeholders in the area.

After identifying the relevant stakeholders, a cleaning exercise was undertaken to do away with those who
would not be impacted both positively and adversely.

The stakeholders' consultation also helped in highlighting the serious socio-economic and environmental
concerns and impacts that could arise from the project and was instrumental in helping to come up with
feasible mitigation measures.

Impact Prediction and Evaluation
Various methods and techniques were applied in impact identification, prediction and evaluation. The EA
identified and analysed potential impacts linking these with specific project activities and phase. First the
task was to consider both positive and negative impacts of the project. While considering the impacts, the
study examined them in light of their characteristics i.e. nature (positive or negative), extent (spatial),
occurrence (one-off, intermitted or constant), magnitude, whether reversible or irreversible, direct or indirect,
probability of occurrence and significance with and without mitigation.

3.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION AND
BASELINE DATA

This chapter gives background information of the project area as a whole then narrows down to project
specific site in terms of its location, administrative set-up, climate, settlement patterns, and the major
environment attributes, which will play a crucial role in the identification and development of the project.

This section begins with the relevant information pertinent to this project in terms of Gasabo District and
then in the next section the report focuses on the specific background information of Kinyinya sector,
Murama cell and project site.

Geographical Location (Gasabo District)
Gasabo District is one of three districts of Kigali City and form one of 30 such entities that in Rwanda after
the administrative reform of February 2006. With 15 sectors, 73 cells and 501 villages (imidugudu), it follows
from the merger of the former districts of Gasabo, Kacyiru, Gisozi, Kabuga (3 six sectors namely Gasogi,
and Ndera Rusororo) Kanombe (Masoro sector) , Buliza (Cyunga sectors, Jabana, Kabuye and Ngiryi)
Gasabo (Bumbogo sectors, Gasabo, Gacaca I & II, Gikomero, Gishaka, Jurwe Karama, Kayanga, Nduba,
Sha, Shango, and Rubungo Rutunga).

It is located northeast of the City of Kigali, the Rwandan capital. It is bounded on the south by the district
Kicukiro; to the north by the district and Rulindo Gicumbi; to the east by the districts of Rwamagana and
west by the district Nyarugenge. It has an area of 429.2066 km ², and currently has 410 485 inhabitants.

Due to this configuration, the District is a duality between rural and urban areas. The rural area accounts for
more than 90% of the District, with a population representing 66%, which involves more effort in the field of
urbanization and land use.

Relief
The terrain of Gasabo district is dominated by mountains of altitude (1800 m), especially in rural areas.
Gasabo District is also surrounded by watersheds and valleys. The District has small rivers in the valleys of
areas with high hills. The only river worth mentioning in name is the Nyabugogo River which has its source
in Lake Muhazi and drains into the river Nyabarongo after crossing wetland valley approximately 50
kilometres long and 1000 m wide.

In addition, the usual method of sanitation in the city of Kigali promotes the infiltration of sewage that enrich
groundwater creating small springs scattered here and there in the valleys.

Flora and fauna
Natural vegetation is almost non existent in Gasabo District. It was gradually replaced by artificial vegetation
whose presence is the dominant eucalyptus tree species. However, some wild plants are found in the
marshes and in small corners of uncultivated land. Depressions are occupied by natural vegetation
composed of Typha fringe of papyrus and Cyperus latiforialius.

In the hills, the natural vegetation there is especially herbs like hyparenia spp (imikenke) and eragnostis
(inshinge). There are also various shrubs and savanna trees and the most dominant types are Albizia
gummifera (imisebeya) mimosacées, including Acacia abyssinica (iminyinya).

As for wildlife, Gasabo district is characterized by a diversity of species of birds and small wild animals
familiar to the type of vegetation in the District as well as fish species compatible with the aquatic
environment of Lake Muhazi (tilapia, barbus, Clarias galiepunus, common carp, haprochromis,).

Climatic zones
Gasabo District has four seasons: two rainy seasons and two dry seasons alternately distributed as follows:

    · A short dry season: December, January, February
    · A great rainy season: March, April, May
    · A long dry season: June, July, August, September
    · A small rainy season: October, November

The four seasons are the common features of climate in the country. The seasons are irregular and hence
the boundary cannot be correctly predicted. The rainy season may extend into the dry season and vice
versa. The average temperature is 22 ° C and a rainfall between 900 and 1150 mm of annually is
experienced.

The Sectors of Gatsata, Kimirunko, Kimihurura and Kacyiru have a higher density compared to other
sectors are those in both urban and predominantly spontaneous neighbourhood.

Furthermore, data from the census and the Integrated Household Survey of the District show that the
population is predominantly young Gasabo with a proportion of persons under 45 years is about 80% of this
result that it is the younger who migrate to urban areas.

Economic Activities

Agriculture
Agricultural activity is developed in the 8 rural areas of Gasabo. However with the expansion of the City
there will be more and more loss in agricultural space. The land is relatively fertile and crops such as
tomatoes, soybeans, sunflower, corn, coffee and vegetables have a comparative advantage for various
reasons, including improved techniques for the production of tomato popularized by SORWATOM; proximity
to the City of Kigali, which offers opportunities for vegetables; the proximity to factories washing coffee in
Ndera.

The priority crops are cassava, beans, sorghum and bananas. In small wetlands, there are vegetables such
as cabbage, onions, tomatoes, eggplants and other legumes. The promotion of modern agriculture is not yet
widespread in all sectors; only the introduction of radical terraces to prevent erosion is in progress. People's
participation in this activity is estimated at 75%.

In the "Urban", there are small agricultural activities like growing vegetables carried by individuals in some
portions of the wetlands. However, there are some marshes where you can organize and modernize
agriculture with a few adjustments.

Energy
The main sources of energy used for cooking are: electricity gas, oil, firewood, charcoal and agricultural
residues. Charcoal is the energy source most used in cooking in urban areas. This use is among the direct
causes of environmental degradation in the country in general and the District of Gasabo in particular urging
or forcing peasants to engage in disorderly exploitation of forests.

For lighting, energy sources are used ELECTROGAZ electricity, solar panels, generators, lamp oil, lanterns,
candles and wood.

Kerosene is the most used by households as a source of lighting. Other energy sources such as biogas,
peat can be initiated and operated centres or correctional schools are almost unknown in the District. Solar
energy and generators are used by high-income households when downloading current ELECTROGAZ.




                                                                                                            18

Housing and Settlement
The housing in the District of Gasabo is characterized by four different types: the well-developed urban
area, urban areas in settlements, villages (imidugudu) in rural areas and houses scattered in rural areas.

3.2.4 Sensitive Ecosystem
There are no sensitive ecosystems worth mentioning or recognising in the project area or site that would be
adversely impacted by the proposed project.

3.3 Socio-Economic Environment

3.3.1 Population and Demography
The project area is not densely populated and scattered interspersed rural homesteads are observable as
one move along the murram road to the project site. Within a radius of 500 metres on the project site there
are 4 households/structures that have already been earmarked for resettlement under the ARAP. At a
radius of 1km there are 15 houses with an estimated population of 60 people and are not likely to be
adversely affected by the proposed project mainly due to the distance especially in relation to noise impacts.

3.3.2 Socio Economic Profile
The project area is an area where the local communities practice subsistence agriculture and to some
extent minimal livestock husbandry. As mentioned above, the immediate project site that will be acquired for
the construction of this plant has visible signs and evidence of subsistence farming at a small scale mainly
at the household level.

3.3.3 Land Uses
The major land uses in the immediate project area are mainly small scale agricultural activities like
cultivation of food crops like maize, bananas, yams, cassava among others. The area is also primarily rural
residential with 4 rural households and a church mainly made from mud walled grass thatched houses
within the project site intended for acquisition and will be resettled. There are 5 other residential houses
within a distance of 100 metres from the project site. These houses will not be destroyed or affected by the
project especially in relation to noise impacts. About 3 kilometres away is the Deutsche Welle radio
transmitting station. 4 kilometres from the site, is the Kinyinya Health Centre, the office of the Executive
manger in Murama, and a small trading centre with kiosks and bars.

3.3.4 Infrastructure
Roads, Electricity and Communication
There is an existing electricity transmission line that passes across the project site. The road network in the
project area is generally loose surface road and could be difficult to access during the rainy season.
However, there is a tarmac road which is the main Kigali-Kinyinya-Deustche Welle road which is busy and is
the main route connecting the sector with Kigali city centre. Deutsche Welle a German broadcasting
company has its main station a few kilometres from the proposed project site and telecommunication masts
can be observed at a distance.

4.0 PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

This chapter describe and examine the various alternatives available for the project. Alternatives examined
during the study included site alternatives in project location particularly with regards to location based
impacts and land use conflicts was assessed, and finally a No Project alternative was also assessed to
determine the impact of this No Project Scenario.

The choice of an appropriate site for locating a new substation was guided by the following issues presented
by ELCTROGAZ/UERP as the criteria:
     · Location;- The site should not be sited close to a highly dense residential areas in order to
         minimise impacts and costs related to resettlement.
     · The site should have adequate access in terms of road network to facilitate transport of
         construction material and equipment and also allow for emergency intervention during operations
     · The project site should not increase the overall cost of the project
     · The site should have adequate space for future extension
     · Specifically for ELECTROGAZ, the priority was to construct a substation on the Eastern part of
         Kigali City so as to expand the network on this side which is limited and requires expansion.

4.1 Alternative Site(s)
In assessing alternative site to determine potential, the above points were used to come up with the
preferred choice of site.

Gikondo site
This site already houses the 110kV substation of Gikondo and is situated in the center of Kigali city in a
densely populated area and is the important most substations, serving the biggest load in Kigali and the
country. For this reason it does not become a very appropriate site for locating the proposed substation
because it is first and foremost already overloaded. Secondly, it is not in the Eastern Part of Kigali city and
locating the plant would mean extension of long lines and voltage drops to the Eastern part of Kigali which
would mean addition costs related to construction of distribution network and compensation. Hence this site
was rejected.

Gasogi site.
The Gasogi site houses the Gasogi Substation in the Eastern part of Kigali City. However, this site is
located in a ridge making it unsuitable for locating the new substation, mainly because of the challenges that
will be experienced in the transportation of bulk goods and equipment due to access related problems.
Because of the ridges, the project will be required to create access roads to the site for use during
transportation of construction equipment and this will increase the overall project cost. This site also lacks
adequate space for future expansion. Therefore this site was also rejected even though it lies along the
Eastern part of Kigali city.

Mt Kigali Substation
The Mt Kigali Substation is located at the South of the city of Kigali and is right inside and within a town
housing development area thus making it unsuitable in terms of location for any future extension for that
matter. This is because it will require a lot of compensation when undertaking the resettlement which will
increase the project cost. This substation is also located towards the Southern part of Kigali and hence
does not meet ELECTROGAZ's criteria of intending to increase the electricity distribution network in the
Eastern part of the city. Therefore this site was also rejected because of the stated reasons.




                                                                                                            25

Jabana Substation
The Jabana site houses the Jabana Substation and is situated in the West of Kigali along the Byumba Road
with the incoming line from the Mukungwa Ntaruka and Hydropower stations, and was established in 1960
and rehabilitated in the mid 80s. The 70 kV line to the East Rwanda has its origin at this substation. This
substation is not located in the Eastern part of the city hence the rejection.

Birembo Site (Preferred Location)
Due to the above reason, the Birembo site in comparison to the other sites presents the most appropriate
site for locating the substation because, the proposed site is not densely populated; it is easily accessible
using the Kigali-Kinyinya-Deustche Welle tarmac road, and is located in the Eastern part of the city.

4.6 No Project Alternatives
A No Project alternative would primarily mean that the status quo will be maintained and in a sense the
environmental impacts (adverse) will not occur. However the positive benefits will be forgone in terms of
providing more access to electricity to the populace of Kigali which would have in turn spurred and
contributed to economic growth.




                                                                                                          26

5.0 LEGISLATIVE, POLICY AND
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

The chapter of the study reviews the relevant legal and institutional arrangements that would hinder or guide
the development of the project in line with the national and international laws. Rwanda being a signatory to
various international conventions and laws, it's important that national projects are in line with these laws
and as such some of the relevant international conventions are reviewed in this chapter.

5.1 Organic Law on Environment Protection and Management
The law sets out the general legal framework for environment protection and management in Rwanda. It
also constitutes environment as a one of the priority concerns of the Government of Rwanda. Under the
fundamental principle on national environmental protection policy develops national strategies, plans and
programs, aiming at ensuring the conservation and use of sustainable environmental resources.

The law gives right to every natural or legal person in Rwanda to live in a healthy and balanced
environment. They also have the obligation to contribute individually or collectively to safeguard country's
natural, historical and socio-cultural heritage.

The framework of the law on the protection and management of natural resources centres on avoiding and
reducing the disastrous consequences on environment. It measures result from an environmental evaluation
of policies, programs and projects, aimed at preventing the consequences of such activities.

The principle of sustainability of environment and equity among generation emphasizes human beings at
the core of sustainable development. They therefore, have a right to a healthy and productive life in
harmony with nature. They must so as to equitably meet the needs of the present and future generation.

The protection and management of environment is currently registered in the environmental organic law that
has been published in the official Rwanda newspaper in May 1st 2005.

MINITERE which is the ministry responsible for the environment under the article 65 puts the in place
Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) which is the institution now charged with the
responsibility of ensuring environmental protection by demanding for EIA studies to be undertaken before
projects are executed.

The present organic law has the following objectives:

    · To protect human and natural environment;
    · To establish fundamental principles of management and protection of environment against all
          forms of degradation so as to develop natural resources and to fight all kinds of pollutions and
          nuisances;
    · To improve the living conditions of the population while preserving ecosystems            and available
          resources;
    · To ensure sustainable environment and resources as well as rational and sustainable use of
          resources, taking into account the equality between the present and future generations;
    · To guarantee to all Rwandans an economically viable, ecologically rational and socially acceptable
          development;



                                                                                                          27

     · To establish the precaution principle in order to reduce the negative effects on Environment and
          ensure the rehabilitation of degraded areas.

Chapter IV of the Organic Law Article 65 clearly calls for the need to subject projects to mandatory
Environmental Impact Assessment.

Article 3: States that every person has the duty to protect safeguard and promote environment. The State
shall protect, conserve and manage the environment.

Article 65: Further specifies that every project shall be subjected to environmental impact assessment prior
to its commencement. It shall be the same for programs, plans and policies likely to affect the environment.
Specific details of projects referred to in this Article shall be spelt out by the order of the Minister in charge of
environment.

Article 66:

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) shall include at least the following:

          · A brief description of the project and its variants.
          · Analysis of direct and indirect foreseeable consequences on the environment.
          · Analysis of the initial state of the environment.
          · Measures envisaged reducing, preventing or compensating for the consequences.
          · Reasons for the choice.
          · A summary of requisitions from clause1 to 5 of this article;
          · A       definition  of  the     evaluation     and    monitoring    methods      used   regularly    and
               environmental indicators before (initial state), during and after implementation of
          · the project or, as the case may be, at the final evaluation stage of the project;
          · A financial evaluation of measures recommended preventing, reducing or compensating for
               the negative effects of the project on the environment and measures for regular monitoring
               and control of relevant environmental indicators.
Article 67:

States that the analysis and approval of environmental impact assessments is done by the Rwanda
Environmental Protection Authority or any other person given a written authorisation. The project promoter
shall pay a levy which shall be assessed from the amount invested or to be invested, excluding the amount
of operating cost. The assessment of this levy shall be fixed by law establishing the National Fund for the
Environment. The impact study shall be done at the expense and under the responsibility of the promoter.


The Organic Law also puts in place the National Fund of the Environment in Rwanda (FONERWA). The
composition, the working and the assignments of these institutions will be determined by particular laws.

The article 66 of the Organic Law on the environment specifies that it has created, to the level of the
Provinces, of the City of Kigali, of the Districts, the Cities, the Sectors and the Cells, Committees
responsible for the conservation and the protection of the environment. The composition, the working and
the assignments of these committees will be determined by Decree of the prime minister.

Title IV of Article 67 of the Organic Law requires that the execution of Policies, Plans and Projects must be
subject to mandatory EIA studies to identify the potential adverse impacts they could have on the
environment.

Further to this through the Ministerial Decree, a list of all the project that must be subjected to mandatory
EIA has been put in place under article 68 of the Organic Law. Article 30 further stipulates that works of
public or private construction as roads, dams etc must be subjected to EIA studies.



                                                                                                                 28

Article 69 of the Organic Law further specifies that the EIA studies undertaken must be submitted to REMA
for approval and the studies must be undertaken at the proponent's expense.

The Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 2007
REMA has now developed the EIA regulations which provide a guideline and requirements for EIA in
Rwanda. According to these new regulations Sub Article 1 makes it mandatory for all the projects listed
under schedule I to be subjected to a full scale EIA. The Sub Article further states that :

Sub Article 1) No environmental authorization shall be granted by the Authority for any project in Schedule I
to these Regulations if no environmental impact assessment has been submitted to the Authority in
accordance with the provisions of these Regulations.

Sub Article 2) states Any project listed under Impact Level III of Schedule I to these Regulations shall
require a full environmental impact assessment by the preparation of an environmental impact report, unless
the Authority refuses permission.      The construction of a substation is in this category and thus must be
subjected to full scale EIA.

Public Hearing Process
Article 47: The Authority shall on receipt of the developer's environmental impact report, arrange for a public
hearing to take place within twenty (20) working days from the first day of public notification, at which
relevant Lead Agencies, local governments, civil societies and concerned members of the public may
comment on the environmental impact report and express views on impact of the proposed development.
The Authority shall cover all costs incidental to the public hearing.

Article 48: All projects classified under Impact Level III shall be subjected to a public hearing prior to the
decision-making process.

5.2 Energy Policy
The national policy goal is to meet the energy challenges and needs of the Rwandan population for
economic and social development in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner.

Since 1994, the energy sector as well as the overall economy has gone through structural modifications,
where the role of the Government has changed, markets have been liberalised and private sector initiatives
encouraged. Hence, the energy policy document has to take into account structural changes in the economy
and political transformations at national and international levels.

The national policy objective for the development of the energy sector is to provide an input in the
development process by establishing an efficient energy production, procurement, transportation,
distribution, and end-user systems in an environmentally sound manner.

The Energy Policy, therefore, focuses on market mechanisms and means to reach the objective, and
achieve an efficient energy sector with a balance between national and commercial interests.

An interactive and participatory process between Government, other stakeholders and relevant groups has
been necessary as part of the formulation process in order to incorporate views of market actors and energy
consumers to address the complex nature of the sector.




                                                                                                              29

Specifically, the energy policy takes into consideration the need to:
(a) Have affordable and reliable energy supplies country wide;
(b) Reform the market for energy services and establishes an adequate institutional framework, which
facilitates investment, expansion of services, efficient pricing mechanisms and other financial incentives;
(c) Enhance the development and utilisation of indigenous and renewable energy sources and technologies,
(d) Adequately take into account environmental considerations for all energy activities,
(e) Increase energy efficiency and conservation in all sectors; and
(f) Increase energy education and build gender-balanced capacity in energy planning, implementation and
monitoring.

Domestic energy demand has grown rapidly due to population growth and the increase in economic
activities especially during the last ten years

The vision of the energy sector is to effectively contribute to the growth of the national economy and thereby
improve the standard of living for the entire nation in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner. The
mission of the energy sector is to create conditions for the provision of safe, reliable, efficient, cost-effective
and environmentally appropriate energy services to all sectors on a sustainable basis. By fulfilling its vision
and mission, the energy sector will contribute to social economic development, and in the long-term
framework, poverty reduction.

The national energy policy objectives are to ensure availability of reliable and affordable energy supplies
and their use in a rational and sustainable manner in order to support national development goals. The
national energy policy, therefore, aims to establish an efficient energy production, procurement,
transportation, distribution and end-use systems in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner.

Short and medium term policy priority actions
The priority for Rwanda is to implement projects now, to overcome the current electricity crisis, to prevent
the next electricity crisis, to tackle proactively the wood crisis, to begin to provide greater access to modern
energy and to reduce reliance on petroleum products due to the oil price crisis. Without implementation
further capacity building and studies will have no value.

Our management and institutional capacity has to continue to progress if these projects are to be delivered
effectively and efficiently. This will require further external support and guidance.

Several policy actions will be implemented in order to achieve the broad and specific objectives of this
energy policy. Strategic financial interventions required to move forward the policy priority actions are
indicated alongside the proposed actions.

Priority policy actions

     1.   Meet the crisis of blackouts caused by delayed investment and drought
     2.   Provide economic power by developing the use of Lake Kivu methane, and by bringing on line
          more hydro power.
     3.   Enhance overall electrical infrastructure to meet demand growth and supply quality needs ­
          generation, transmission and major distribution construction and rehabilitation.
     4.   Deliver a programme of rural electrification on the basis of enhanced distribution networks, micro
          hydro, and solar power.




                                                                                                               30

    5.    Implement a wood and charcoal efficiency and substitution strategy to counter the deforestation
          crisis.
    6.    Continue steady progress to a viable electricity and gas sector, consistent with meeting social
          needs.
    7.    Commence utilisation of Kivu gas for other than power generation.
    8.    Determine options for response to oil prices and petroleum products costs, and their impact on the
          economy. Reduce reliance on petroleum products.

5.3 Land Policy
Apart from a few scattered land regulations, most of which date back to the colonial period, Rwanda has
never had a proper land policy nor has it ever had a land law, a situation that enhances the existing duality
between the very restrictive written law and the widely practised customary law, giving rise to insecurity,
instability and precariousness of land tenure.


The Rwandan Government, therefore, found it compelling and necessary to establish a national land policy
that would guarantee a safe and stable form of land tenure, and bring about a rational and planned use of
land while ensuring sound land management and an efficient land administration.


The following are the main obstacles that hinder the efficient management of land in Rwanda, necessitating
the establishment of a national land policy that would guide the essential land reforms:
· Strong pressure on the already spatially limited land resources by a rapidly growing population;
· Domination of the agricultural sector which lacks any specialization in terms of human resources and
  equipment, and lack of alternative concrete and realistic options that would reduce the pressure on land
  resource;
· A land tenure system dominated by customary law which favours land fragmentation, a practice which
  reduces further the size of the family farms which are already below the threshold of the average surface
  area that is economically viable;

    -          A considerable number of landless persons who have to be resettled at all costs;
    -          Scattered farming plots that are difficult to manage due to the scattered mode of human
               settlement;
    -          Lack of a reliable land registration system that would guarantee the security of land tenure;
    -          Weak and inadequate existing methods of land-use planning and land improvement (outline of
               land potential, land use and land development; reliable methods of soil and water
               conservation);
    -          Disorderly and fraudulent land transactions, necessitating the establishment of regulations that
               would enable the authorities to give to the land a recognised market value which brings
               considerable profit to the Government Treasury;
    -          Unplanned use of marshlands which, in spite of their good agricultural soil, cannot be wholly
               recovered for agricultural purposes, in view of the following factors:

               · Abundance of water which is necessary as a useful water reservoir;
               · The soil make-up, which does not lend itself easily to the current cultivation methods;
               · The biotic environment and biodiversity which should be protected at all costs;
               · The obvious poor coordination among various institutions which use with land to support
                    their activities;




                                                                                                            31

Currently, the land tenure system in Rwanda operates in a dual legal system: On one hand, there is:

· The customary law, which governs almost all the rural land and promotes the excessive parcelling out of
  plots through the successive father-to-son inheritance system. And on the other, there is
· The written law, which mostly governs land in urban districts and some rural lands managed by churches
  and other natural and legal persons. This law confers several land tenure rights to individuals such as
  land tenancy, long term lease and title deeds (particularly in towns).


On the whole, Rwanda's land tenure system requires comprehensive reforms, from the elaboration of a
national land policy to the establishment of a land law and land code, which will guide the judicious use and
management of the land resource for the economy to be able to take off in such a way that our country is
freed from the grips of poverty.

In the perspective of the harmonious and sustainable development, the overall objective of the national land
policy of Rwanda is to establish a land tenure system that guarantees tenure security for all Rwandans and
give guidance to the necessary land reforms with a view to good management and rational use of national
land resources.

Specific Objectives
     · To put in place mechanisms which guarantee land tenure security to land users for the promotion
         of investments in land.
     · To promote good allocation of land in order to enhance rational use of land resources according to
         their capacity.
     · To avoid the splitting up of plots and promote their consolidation in order to bring about
         economically viable production.
     · To establish mechanisms which facilitate giving land its productive value in order to promote the
         country's socio-economic development.
     · To focus land management towards more viable and sustainable production by choosing reliable
         and time-tested methods of land development.
     · To develop actions that protects land resources from the various effects of land degradation.
     · To establish institutional land administration arrangements that enable land to have value in the
         market economy.
     · To promote research and continuous education of the public in all aspects of duties and obligations
         with regard to land tenure, land management and land transactions.
     · To establish order and discipline in the allocation of land and land transactions in order to control
         and/or curb pressure on land, inappropriate development, land speculation and land trafficking.
     · To promote the involvement and sensitization of the public at all levels in order to infuse land use
         practices that are favourable to environmental protection and good land management.
     · To promote conservation and sustainable use of wetlands.

Land tenure may be considered as a set of modes or procedures of land acquisition and ownership. It is, in
other words, a combination of rules that define the modes of access, use and control of land and its
renewable natural resources. It is therefore a relationship between men or social groups and land or its
underlying resources.

Land tenure has a multidisciplinary dimension that includes social, technical, economical, institutional, legal
and political aspects. Debates on land issues must deal with various aspects of the environment, including
the vision of space and nature, forms of land ownership, the role of the government, etc.




                                                                                                            32

In Rwanda, there are currently two modes of land acquisition, namely acquisition according to customary
law or conceptions, and acquisition according to the rules of the written law.

According to custom, land ownership is held by whoever occupies the land first. This rule has always been
respected in our society. However, in modern times, land acquisition by occupation has become obsolete
since all vacant land belongs to the State. Likewise, the provisions of the decree-law No. 09/76 of 4th March
1976, article 1, stipulate that `all land not held under the written law and affected or not by customary law or
land occupation belongs to the State'.

Customarily, land rights are passed on from father to son through inheritance. Girls are excluded from
inheritance of the family land from the father. Concerning inheritance rights of widows, the custom merely
gives them the right to use the land that belonged to their deceased husbands.

In its original customary conception, land was owned collectively. Any disposal of land was therefore
inconceivable, since such land was considered as family property that belonged to the ancestors, as well as
to present and future generations.

With the introduction of the subdivision of land into individual plots due to successive inheritance
procedures, each family owner of a plot of land was considered as the real owner of the plot, having the
right to dispose of it as it wishes. However, Article 2 of the decree-law No. 09/76 of 4th March 1976,
stipulates that nobody may sell off his land rights except with the written authorization of the Minister of
Lands upon the recommendation of the Municipal Council where the land is located.

In actual fact, ownership through prescription originates from the written law since traditionally, title deeds
were unheard of. Rwandans consider that once a right has been acquired or recognized, even customarily,
it is indefeasible. This is why the many existing landless people, not having received any new land, continue
to feel cheated and left out because they have no right over the land which they owned customarily over 30
years ago, since the law has fixed the time limit of acquisition by prescription to 10 years.

Method of acquisition through written law

      · Tenancy contracts of plots for building purposes for a 3-year period in urban areas.
      · Long lease contracts of land for agricultural purposes for a period of 15 years or more in rural
           areas.
      · Free assignment contracts in both rural and urban areas to natural or legal persons for social
           activities with real impact on the welfare of the people.
      · Sale contracts and title deeds for plots that are built in urban areas. This is a system of land tenure
           by urban residents who first lease plots with the contractual obligation of developing them. The
           Ministry of Lands delivers the title deeds after confirming that the plots have been developed.
      · Right of access: mode of land acquisition which is common for public institutions.

Apart from the above-mentioned different modes of land acquisition and land ownership, there is the case of
the landless people who live in rural areas and who must live from farming. These are mostly the refugees
of 1959 who were forced into exile for political reasons and left their land behind. These same refugees
have now returned to their country and find themselves landless. They cannot claim back their previously
owned land which has been occupied by other Rwandans who remained in the country, because the Arusha
Peace Accords fixed the time limit for acquisition by prescription to 10 years.

5.4. International Legislations
Rwanda is a signatory to a number of conventions on sustainable development and is a member of various
bilateral and multilateral organizations. Some of the relevant development partners in this project are the
World Bank and a number of United Nations agencies.

5.4.1 World Bank Environment and Social Safeguards Policy
World Bank Operational Policies (OP) and Bank Procedures (BP) Environmental Assessment - BP4.01 and
OP 4.01 (January 1999 all of which require environmental assessment of projects proposed for World Bank
financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and sustainable.

Environmental Assessment is one of the 10 safeguard policies of the World Bank.              The World Bank
Environment and Social Safeguard Policy aims at improving decision making, to ensure that project options
under consideration are sound and sustainable, and that potentially affected people have been properly
consulted.

The World Bank's environmental assessment policy and recommended processing are described in
Operational Policy (OP)/Bank Procedure (BP) 4.01. The World Bank system assigns a project to one of
three project categories, as defined below:

Category "A" Projects
An EIA is always required for projects that are in this category. Impacts are expected to be `adverse,
sensitive, irreversible and diverse with attributes such as pollutant discharges large enough to cause
degradation of air, water, or soil; large-scale physical disturbance of the site or surroundings; extraction,
consumption or conversion of substantial amounts of forests and other natural resources; measurable
modification of hydrological cycles; use of hazardous materials in more than incidental quantities; and
involuntary displacement of people and other significant social disturbances.

Category "B" Projects
The construction of this sub station falls under Category B of the World Bank Operational. A proposed
project is classified as Category B if it's potential adverse environmental impacts on human populations or
environmentally important areas--including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural habitats--are
less adverse than those of Category A projects.

These impacts are site-specific; few if any of them are irreversible; and in most cases mitigation measures
can be designed more readily than for Category A projects. The scope of EA for a Category B project may
vary from project to project, but it is narrower than that of Category A Environmental Assessment.

Like Category A Environmental Assessment, it examines the project's potential negative and positive
environmental impacts and recommends any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or
compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance.

Category "C" Projects
No EIA or other analysis is required. Category C projects result in negligible or minimal direct disturbance of
the physical environment. Typical projects include education, family planning, health, and human resource
development.

6.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) through the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) has
identified a site where it wants to install a substation for electricity transmission by ELECTROGAZ of
Rwanda.

Substations are essential for the smooth running of any electrical system. They are the point where high
voltage electricity is reduced (or "stepped down") into lower voltage electricity suitable for distribution into
commercial and residential areas. The proposed Birembo sub station will basically play the role if stepping
down the high voltage electricity into low voltage and then to be distributed to the commercial and residential
areas in Kigali.

Administratively the site for the proposed sub station is situated in the province of Kigali City, in the District
of Gasabo, Kinyinya sector in the Murama cell. The actual project site is close to the Deutsche Welle
broadcasting station along a dusty murram road interspersed with rural villages and households.

The project will involve the construction of a new 110/15 kV - MW sub station at the Birembo site. The new
Birembo substation will be in the final stage the main substation of the national grid and the main feeder
substation for the Kigali distribution system. On the 220kV and 110kV level it will be an outdoor substation;
the 15kV level will be of the indoor type.

The substation will be erected in three main stages:

STAGE 1
This will involve the construction of a 110/15 kV substation with one 110 kV line bay, one 110/15kV
transformer bay and one 110/70 kV autotransformer bay. The substation will be connected to the overhead
line of Jabana ­ Gasogi. This is a new line that is planned for construction under the UERP Distribution
component.

From this indoor substation two 15 (30) kV double circuit lines, length 7.5km, will go in the direction of
Rubungo and Remera to connect the existing 15kV network of the surrounding areas north east of the town
center (area of Kacyiru, Kibagabaga, Rubungo, Nyabisindu, Kimironko, Nyarutarama, etc.) ­A separate EIA
and ARAP is under preparation for the entire UERP distribution component that will include this line and all
the other lines proposed in that component which will identify associated adverse impacts.

The distribution component EIA/ARAP report once finalised will be submitted to the bank and REMA for
review and approval. The construction of the Jabana ­ Gasogi line and other lines in the distribution
component of the UERP is expected to start in July 2009.

STAGE 2
This will involve the extension of the Birembo substation by an additional 110kV line bay for the
interconnection with Uganda and an additional transformer 110/15kV (TR2). The construction of this line is
still under planning phase and no actual timing has been decided upon. Once a definite time frame is
decided upon, an EIA and ARAP report will be prepared and submitted for approval to the bank and REMA.

STAGE 3
This will involve the extension of the Birembo substation by a 220kV substation with one line bay and two
220/110 kV power transformer bays for the interconnection on the 220kV level with Tanzania.           Also there
will be a further extension of the 110kV substation by two bays for connecting the power transformers



                                                                                                              35

220/110kV. The construction of this line is still under planning phase and no actual timing has been decided
upon. Once a definite time frame is decided upon, an EIA and ARAP report will be prepared and submitted
for approval to the bank and REMA.

Note: Only Stage 1 will be part of this contract, however areas and designs for future extensions (Stage 2
and Stage 3) will be availed by the contractor.

Birembo Substation ­ Stage 1

The new substation will be constructed on a settled and farmed area outside the town of Kigali in the north
close to the tower 198 of the 110(70) kV overhead line from Jabana to Gasogi. The GPS coordinates of the
tower 198 are:

Table 4.
                     Zone                               East                            North

                      36M                              180264                         9788846


The substation will be looped in to the 110kV line coming from Jabana substation and continuing via
Gasogi, Musha, and Rwamagana to Kabarondo as a 70kV line. In the final layout, the substation will be the
main substation of the national grid and the main feeder substation for the Kigali distribution system. The
conductor of the 110kV line is ACSR 138/22, the shield wire S35.

The new substation shall be of a conventional open air type (AIS) for the 110 kV voltage level and of an
indoor SF6 insulated switchgear type (GIS) for the 15 (30) kV level.

Proposed Activities
The project activities will fall under site preparation, installation of equipments and operation/generation. The
project specific activities will include the following;

Activities expected to occur during the planning and design phase of the project include;
     · Identification of project site including feasibility studies
     · Acquisition of land for construction of the substation and its ancillary structures
     · Valuation and Compensation of PAPs for loss of land, structures and crops

During the construction phase of the project the following activities will be undertaken namely;
     · Site clearing
     · Excavation related works
     · Construction works including erection of towers and building of the staff quarters and housing unit

At the operation phase of the project activities to occur are mainly controlling operating of the substation

Design and Planning Phase
During the design phase of this project, the expected activities some of which have already occurred
include:

Site Selection
Identification of a proper site for the construction of the substation remains one of the fundamental activities
that will have to be undertaken before the construction works begin. This has already been undertaken and
the Birembo site has been identified as a suitable site for the sub station.



                                                                                                              36

Land Acquisition /Compensation
The land in question must be acquired for purposes of construction and for this reason; the (PAPs) who will
loose their land will have to be compensated as required by the World Bank and Government of Rwanda.
Compensation for land will be based on the current land rate values. An Abbreviated Resettlement Action
Plan (ARAP) has been prepared, approved by the bank and already disclosed in the infoshop.

Annex 11 of this report shows the quantities of crops and tress that will be destroyed to pave way for the
project.

6.3 Project In Puts, Outputs and Wastes Generated
The aim of the project is to step down electricity from the HV lines to MV and then distribute to the
households and institutions in Kigali. However in the process the principle of input-output applies. The input
of the project as mentioned earlier include, transformer oil and water for use by the staff in the substation.
The output will be the stepping down of the electricity for consumption by the residents of Kigali.

It is estimated that 16,000 litres of transformer oil will be required for the transformers to begin operation and
this will be topped up whenever the concentration is low.

Water use in the plant by the staff will be from the ELECTROGAZ pump station in Mazira. 10 staff members
are expected to reside in the staff quarters and will use approximately 500 litres of water on a daily basis.

Wastes Generated
The main wastes from the process include; during construction the waste generated will mainly be
construction debris including paper, scrap metals, pieces of rods, packaging material etc. All these will be
disposed by the contractor in an acceptable site(s) in Kigali city or recycled for instance the scrap metal.

At the operation phase the wastes below will be generated namely;

      1.  Waste water from general cleaning and washing of the plant, domestic use within the plant
          constitutes the other only set of liquid wastes that will be generated during the operation phase of
          the plant. The waste water will be channelled into the existing storm water drain and sewage line.




                                                                                                               42

    2.   General solid waste materials from the staff quarters and the plant for example domestic
         household wastes, papers, etc will be generated and disposed through the collection by waste
         providers to the dumping site in Kigali.


6.5 Project Operations and Management
As described in chapter one of this report, UERP/PCU through ELECTROGAZ will contract a company to
install generators for the purposes of producing electricity to be connected to the existing grid. Upon
commission of the plant, the contracted firm will hand over the plant and its operations back to
ELECTROGAZ.




                                                                                                    43

7.0 BIREMBO SUB STATION -
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

This chapter address the potential adverse impacts of the construction and installation of the Birembo
substation. In this report, environmental impacts are defined in totality to mean, socio-economic, cultural,
physical as well as biological. The chapter is structured into two parts one describing positive impacts of the
development and the second part addressing the adverse impacts of the project on the environment.

The project being a national development agenda in the energy sector has immense benefits that could
save the country losses in terms of power rationing and frequent outages. However poor planning of the
project could also affect the environment that supports millions of Rwandese through the project potential
hazards that the project could pose to the public, pollution of water resources and atmospheric resources.


7.1 Positive Impacts
Positive impacts of these project are various and diverse in nature. They range from employment
opportunities, to wealth creation, industrialization, improvement in service delivery to technology transfer
and capacity building.

7.1.1 Socio-economic Benefits
The impacts of the project on socioeconomic development of the people in the area include additional
electricity for the region, provision of conditions for rational and effective use of natural resources in the
country, creation of new jobs for related services and direct workers, and acceleration of the investment
process in the region.

Employment Opportunities
On employment the project expects to employ local casual and skilled labor on-site. Approximately 200
workers will be employed over a period of 18 months which is the projected construction phase. UERP has
no control over who will be employed by the contractor but will advise the contractor to consider using
workers from the project area and women. This is exclusive of indirectly employed people who will provide
support and related services including those trading in foodstuff for the workers on site and construction
personnel during the site preparation phase of the project.

Electricity
The substation will ensure increased access to electricity to the residents of Kigali city and it environs which
will be good for economic development and other benefits associated with the availability of electricity.

7.1.2 Environmental Benefits
The existence of Birembo substation and the eventual distribution of electricity to the local communities and
population will ease the pressure on the use of fuel wood that is rampant in the city and in effect would help
to conserve the fragile and diminishing forest cover of the country by providing an alternative source of
energy.




                                                                                                            44

7.2 Adverse Impacts
Adverse impacts of the Birembo Substation are those unintended effects of the project that have negative
impacts to sustainable development and the environment.

7.2.1 Impacts on Physical Environment
Land Acquisition/Compensation
In order to construct the substation, land will definitely have to be identified (suitable site) and thereafter
acquired.

Size of Land expected to be Acquired
The project will only acquire approximately 2.9 ha of the existing land area for which is currently under
different uses and separately owned by four individuals one of the owners being a church.

Land Use Type
The land to be acquired is being utilized in different ways that vary in nature and include:

     · Settlement/Shelter
     · Livestock Keeping
     · Crop Growing
     · Church/Worship premise by the Seventh Day Adventist

In terms of compensation, the construction activities will lead to the acquisition of land, destruction of crops
and vegetation found in the proposed site including:
     · Avocado trees
     · Tomato
     · Orange trees
     · Mango trees
     · Grevillea
     · Pepper
     · Ficus Trees
     · Eucalyptus Trees
     · Euphorbia Trees
     · Flowers
     · Cassava
     · Euphorbia live fence
     · Maracuja
     · Cactus tree
     · Lemon trees
     · Papaya trees

Mitigation
There will be compensation for the land to be acquired as well as the crops that will be destroyed to pave
way for construction in accordance with the already prepared and approved ARAP.

Fugitive Dust
Fugitive dust may be emitted from construction works and stock piles of materials including machinery as
well as from truck traffic. This could cause health related impacts to the communities around and workers in
the project site.




                                                                                                             45

The diesel power construction machinery and vehicles will also have other air quality impacts.

Mitigation
     · The dirt roads and exposed construction areas should be moisturised during the dry season to
          prevent or minimise the fugitive dust emissions.

     · Installation of speed bumps and speed limit signs to reduce speed of construction equipments
          capacity to blow dust

     · Proper location of material stockpiles, especially sand and soil downwind from the commercial,
          residential and other establishments will be required; Frequent wetting of the stockpile and working
          area; screening of or providing wind breaks for stockpiles;

     · Diesel powered construction equipment and vehicles should be well maintained to minimise
          tailpipe emissions; Covering of trucks; and proper selection of equipment and control of speed
          limits in construction area.

     · Workers in the project site must be equipped with the necessary and required Personal Protective
          Equipment (PPE) prescribed by the construction industry.

Soil Erosion
During the construction phase, activities involving preparation, stripping, grading, soil removal, backfilling,
compacting, disposal of surplus and excavation of the earth surface to pave way for the installation of the
thermal power plant will lead to fugitive dust emission and accelerate soil erosion and run off.

Another impact of the project on soil and geology will be compaction, soil erosion and increased runoff. The
compaction will prevent infiltration of surface water to the ground. This impact will only occur on site where
compaction will be done.

Mitigation
     · To prevent soil erosion during site preparation, disturbed soils should be compacted immediately.
          Development of storm water drains around the site should prevent erosion occurring on the site.

     · Wind blown erosion is to be prevented by soil compaction and wetting the ground to prevent rising
          of soil particles.

     · The final site grade should include an adequate drainage channel that should facilitate drainage
          and avoid flooding and pooling. A site drainage plan should be developed to protect against
          erosion. Protecting stockpiles through the use of silt fencing and reduced slope angles should be
          used to minimize soil erosion during construction.

     · Borrow areas (if any) should avoid agricultural areas; borrow areas should be reworked to blend
          into the surroundings. Re-vegetation should be performed using local plants. All slopes and
          working surfaces should be returned to a stable condition

Vehicular Emission
During the construction phase of the thermal power plant, increased use of heavy equipment and machinery
like trucks, and excavators will cause increased vehicular emission (CO2) in the atmosphere and will cause
to some extent some form of atmospheric pollution. This impact though is expected to last only and up until




                                                                                                            46

the construction phase which will take 18 months. However the use of motorised equipment like trucks,
excavators, tippers and tractors that release emissions will only be for a period of 6 months.

Mitigation
     · Install vehicles with emission reduction gadgets to reduce the quantities of emissions.

     · Ensure that the vehicles are regularly services and properly maintained so as to reduce emissions.

Visual Impacts
The construction works for the installation of the substation and associated civil works is likely to cause
visual impacts in the immediate surrounding.

Mitigation
Construction of lower profile structures, Use of less visible colors to fence off the site, planting of screening
vegetation around the plant boundary and roper design of the stack and dispersion characteristics

Noise Pollution
The machinery and equipment that will be used to undertake different civil works during the construction
phase of the plant will cause noise pollution in the immediate surrounding of the project area. The impact is
expected to last only during the construction phase (18 months) and will be short term in nature and not very
significant. The equipment and machines that will be used during the construction are mainly excavators
and trucks and these do not normally generate noise to levels that would be of concern or harmful to the
residents. It is only the operators of these equipment and workers who will be affected by the impacts from
the construction equipment and for this reason PPEs will be provided.

Mitigation
     · Noise emitting equipment should comply with the applicable Rwanda standards and World Bank
         noise standards.

     · Construction traffic off-site will not contribute significantly to noise levels on public highways
         because roads leading to the site already have very heavily traffic.- The Kigali-Kinyinya-Deustche
         Welle road is a major tarmac road with a lot of traffic already.

     · Noisy equipment will be operated only during daytime. World Bank environmental regulations allow
         a maximum 45-55 dB noise level at the boundary of a construction area when the area is zoned as
         residential. This facility will only emit 39 decibels along the plant boundary during operation phase
         hence the impacts will be insignificant to the residents as already mentioned above.

     · All workers in the project site must be equipped with the necessary and required Personal
         Protective Equipment (PPE) prescribed by the construction industry but not limited to facilities to
         protect against noise impacts, safety helmets, boots, dust masks, gloves, overall, goggles, helmets
         etc.

     · Workers and personnel operating equipments and machinery producing incessant noise and
         vibration should stick to no more than 5 hours a day in handling of equipment and machinery.

Destruction of vegetation cover/crops
The project area is present with a variety of crops including Avocado trees, Tomato, Orange trees, Mango
trees, Grevillea, Pepper, Ficus Trees, Eucalyptus Trees, Euphorbia Trees, Flowers, Cassava, Euphorbia
live fence, Maracuja, Cactus tree, Lemon trees, Papaya trees among others as well as a few scattered



                                                                                                              47

trees. These crops and trees will inevitably have to be removed to pave way for the construction of the
substation.

Mitigation
This impact is unavoidable and UERP/PCU will compensate for the crops that will be damaged as a result of
the construction activities. The area will also be landscaped by replanting and replacing the few trees that
will be destroyed in the process of construction works.

Accidents/Hazards
As a result of the operation of equipment and machinery, there is a likelihood of accidents occurring
especially to the workers when operating the equipments on and off the site.

Mitigation
      · All workers need to be provided with the recognised and appropriate Personal Protective
         Equipment while at the construction site including gloves, dust masks, boots, goggles, and overalls
         among others.

      · ONLY competent workers and staff should be allowed to operate any machinery and equipment to
         reduce the incidents of accidents.

      · During the construction the project site should be completely sealed off and warning signs erected
         informing the general public to keep off the construction site when construction is in progress.

      · Personal protection gear must be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire
         workforce of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear, handling of chemical
         products and acid storage cells, electric safety equipment, procedures for entering enclosed areas,
         fire protection and prevention, emergency response and care procedures. Training given to the
         employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures.

      · No ENTRY signs should be installed to keep away unqualified workers from access to restricted
         areas.

      · The contactor must develop a workers Health and Safety Manual for which all the workers should
         be conversant with for response in case of accidents.

      · The contractor should develop an Emergency Response Plan for handling any emergencies arising
         thereof during the construction.


Increased Traffic/Road Accidents
It is expected that during the construction, an increase in traffic along the Kinyinya-Deustche Welle road will
be experienced along the road and more specifically closer to the construction site because of the several
vehicles that will be getting in and out of the construction site. This increased vehicle movement will
increase the general traffic of the area which is already heavy and is likely to cause traffic congestion. Also
the area could experience road accidents owing to the increased traffic.

Mitigation
The entire heavy vehicles that is likely to cause traffic congestion when delivering goods in the construction
yard should provide these services during traffic off peak hours to reduce traffic congestion.




                                                                                                           48

To reduce potential road accidents, there is need to erect speed bumps closer to the project area and
warning signs limiting the speed when approaching the construction site.

    · Install advance warnings and traffic signs indicating on going construction and heavy machinery
        frequently using the area. Install speed bumps to warn other road users of on going construction
        and also to reduce speed when approaching the area.

    · Transport of heavy goods likely to congest traffic should be undertaken during off-peak times to
        reduce congestion

    · Full time vigilance at the site during construction

    · Request for the support of traffic police officers prior to construction works to control the traffic

    · Adherence to road load cargo bearing capacity for Rwanda


Storage and treatment of solid waste
Solid waste materials during the construction include paper wrapping, scrap metal, excavated soils,
polythene, plastic and metal containers will cause pollution and littering of the immediate and localized
environment.

Mitigation
    · ELECTROGAZ and contractor should develop a solid waste disposal plan which includes the
        provision of receptacles at strategic points within the construction site, recycling programmes for
        recyclable wastes, separation of wastes.

    · The ELECTROGAZ and the contractor should engage a refuse handling company to remove the
        wastes from the site to the recommended dumping site.

    · Warning signs against littering and dumping within the construction site should be erected by the
        contactor.

    · The contactor must construct toilets for use in the site during the construction which must be
        connected to the existing sewer line.

Fire Hazards/Accidents
During the construction phase the chances of fire hazards occurring cannot be overlooked due to the use of
combustible machinery and equipment in undertaking the construction works.

Mitigation
    · A robust fire prevention program and fire suppression system should be developed by the
        contactor. (A draft fire suppression plan is attached herewith but needs further refinement by
        the UERP and the contactor who must carry out a vulnerability assessment before refining
        this plan into a final suppression program).

    · The construction site must contain fire fighting equipments of recommended standards and in key
        strategic points all over the site. Fire pumps, Hydrants, Sprinkler/water spray systems, Hose
        houses, Dry chemical systems, -alternative systems, Carbon dioxide systems, Detection/alarm
        systems, Portable fire extinguishers among others.



                                                                                                           49

     · A fire evacuation plan must be posted in various points of the construction site including
            procedures to take when a fire is reported

     · All workers must be trained on fire management and fire drills undertaken regularly.

7.2.2 Adverse Impacts
The following adverse impacts are anticipated to occur during the operation phase of the substation plant.

Noise Pollution
Generally during operation of sub stations the only source of noise that can be considered adverse is from
the transformers. The typical noise in decibels that emanate from this type of transformers will not exceed
39 decibels within the plant boundary according to international best practise design.            Therefore, the
residents around the project site will not be impacted by the noise from this plant. However, the workers
operating the plant will experience noise impacts during plant operations and mitigation measures are
described below. Annex 1 of this report details the ambient noise levels required by the bank.

From above figure, noise limits on the table below for various land uses, the project will not exceed the
levels as specified on the World Bank standards below.

World Bank Maximum Noise Levels

Location/Zone                                     Day                        Night
Residential, educational
or institutional area                             55 dB(A)                   45 dB(A)
Industrial or                                     70 dB(A)                   70 dB(A)
commercial area

Mitigation

     · The equipment should be designed and enclosed in an acoustic enclosure to limit noise to 39
            decibels (A), and thereby meet World Bank requirements. Workers in close proximity to this
            equipment would be required to use hearing protection.

     · All equipment and machinery installed MUST be tested to verify if they are compliant with the
            World Bank acceptable standards of noise as contained in the World Bank PPAH 1998. The tested
            noise levels should be recorded as baseline and used for future monitoring.

     · All workers in the project site must be equipped with the necessary and required Personal
            Protective Equipment (PPE) prescribed by the construction industry but not limited to facilities to
            protect against noise impacts, hearing protection etc.

     · Personal protection gear will be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire workforce
            of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear to handle noise impacts.

     · Training given to the employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures.

Oil spills Occurrences
Oil spills could occur during the transport, unloading and transfer of the fuel used for the transformer to the
site and during storage. Approximately 16,000 litres of transformer oil is needed as a start up in running the
transformers and cooling the plant.


                                                                                                              50

Mitigation

      · Need to design appropriate protection devices against accidental discharge of toxic substances

      · Storage and liquid impoundment areas for fuels, raw and in-process material solvents, wastes and
          finished products should be designed with secondary containment (dikes) to prevent spills and the
          contamination of soil, ground and surface water

      · A retention area should be designed that surrounds the fuel storage tanks;

      · The plant operator should provide containers for the storage of chemical and lubricating products

      · A spill and emergency response plan would be developed and put in place prior to commencement
          of construction. (Annex 3, 4, and 5of this report is a draft response plan for further refinement
          by the ELECTROGAZ/UERP).

      · A written emergency response plan should be prepared and retained on the site and the workers
          should be trained to follow specific procedures in the event of a spill.

      · All waste oils and lubricants from maintenance of construction equipment should be segregated
          and disposed properly in accordance with REMA requirements for disposal of this type of waste.

Solid waste pollution and littering
Wastes generated from the operation of the plant will include wastewater, used oil, solid waste including oil
filters, papers etc.

Mitigation
      · ELECTROGAZ and contractor should develop a solid waste disposal plan which includes the
          provision of receptacles at strategic points within the construction site, recycling programmes for
          recyclable wastes, separation of wastes.

      · ELECTROGAZ and contractor should engage a refuse handling company to remove the wastes
          from the site to the recommended dumping site within Kigali city

      · Warning signs against littering and dumping within the construction site should be erected by the
          contactor.

Accidents at the work place from operating of machineries and equipment by workers
The potential for accidents and hazards occurring in the substation during the operation of the equipment
and machinery is a likely adverse impact that could lead to loss of life or injury to the workers.

Mitigation
      · All workers entering the construction site must be equipped with PPE including goggles, factory
          boots, overalls, gloves, dust masks, among others. The PPE should be those that meeting the
          international standards of PPE.

      · Personal protection gear will be provided and its use made compulsory to all. The entire workforce
          of the plant should be trained in the use of protective gear, handling of chemical products and acid




                                                                                                          51

         storage cells, electric safety equipment, procedures for entering enclosed areas, fire protection and
         prevention, emergency response and care procedures.

    · Training given to the employees should be backed by regular on- site training in safety measures.

    · No ENTRY signs should be installed to keep away unqualified workers from access to restricted
         areas.

    · Machines and Equipments must be operated only by qualified staff and a site supervisor should be
         on site at all times to ensure adherence.

    · The contactor must develop a workers Health and Safety Manual for which all the workers should
         be conversant with for response in case of accidents.

    · The contractor should develop an Emergency Response Plan for handling any emergencies arising
         thereof during the operation.

    · A perimeter fence should be erected all around the project site to keep the place secure and ward
         of any unauthorised persons.

Fire risk

Mitigation
    · A robust fire prevention program and fire suppression system should be developed by the
         contactor. (A draft fire suppression plan is contained in annex 4 of this report but needs
         further refinement by ELECTROGAZ who must carry out a vulnerability assessment before
         refining this plan into a final suppression program).

    · The site must contain fire fighting equipments of recommended standards and in key strategic
         points all over the site. Fire pumps, Hydrants, Sprinkler/water spray systems, Hose houses, Dry
         chemical systems, Carbon dioxide systems, Detection/alarm systems, Portable fire extinguishers
         among others.

    · A fire evacuation plan must be posted in various points of the construction site including
         procedures to take when a fire is reported.


7.2.3 Project Decommissioning
Decommissioning of the plant will involve shutting down the substation, removing the structures from site,
dismantling the supporting infrastructure and all those structures that were not on site before the project
implementation.

Some of the impacts of this project phase are similar to those that have been discussed during construction
and operational phase.

But there are those impacts that are specific to project decommissioning after the project life is over. After
the project decommissioning, the proponent will be required to rehabilitate the site to its former status or
near what it was before the project was commissioned.      ELECTROGAZ will be responsible for preparing
the decommissioning plan because it is the proponent and as specified by the Organic Law, the project
proponent remains responsible for this. As per the regulations of REMA the proponent will bear the costs for
decommissioning and site rehabilitation.


                                                                                                           52

9.0 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
PLAN FOR BIREMBO SUBSTATION

9.1 Environmental Mitigation and Management Measures
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been developed for this project and will be implemented by
UERP/PCU and the relevant implementing agencies namely Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA), Rwanda
Environmental Management Authority (REMA), RURA, and ELECTROGAZ.

This EMP defines the measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts,
and to improve environmental performance while ensuring compliance with applicable environmental
standards during the planning and design phase, construction and operation and eventual decommissioning
of the sub station at the Birembo site.

The recommendations for main environmental mitigation measures include waste management and
disposal planning, soil erosion mitigation, noise abatement measures, fire suppression as well as the
purchase of necessary emergency response equipment. These mitigation measures are being incorporated
in the project design and are already included in the tender documents for procurement of the equipments.

In order to develop institutional capacity in implementing and enforcing the EMP, training should be provided
with adequate budgets to ensure satisfactory achievement of sound environmental performance. The
training proposed here should include capacity building and training in environmental assessment,
environmental mitigation plans, and environmental monitoring. In some cases, it may be appropriate to
include the staff from the environmental implementation agencies, such as REMA, and other relevant
ministries involved in the implementation of the UERP.

Training and capacity building will be vital in implementing the EMP especially ELECTROGAZ staff who will
be responsible for primarily ensuring that mitigation and monitoring of the key activities are followed. The
proposed training will target relevant UERP, ELECTROGAZ, REMA, RURA and MININFRA staff and will
entail training in monitoring and evaluation, impact mitigation and internal self environmental audit.


Development of internal tracking/monitoring system
The Environmental Advisor is in the process of developing a participatory computer based monitoring and
tracking sheet that will be used to monitor the mitigation of the adverse impacts of the project. The tracking
sheet will use Microsoft Access program application and upon its completion, all the implementing agencies
for UERP will be trained on how to use this tool to monitor compliance.

9.2. Responsibility of Institutions in Implementing the EMP
The company that will be awarded the contract to construct and install Birembo substation will remain the
key responsible institution for undertaking the mitigation measures proposed as well as the monitoring
activities/measures associated with this mitigation plan.      The other institutions mainly ELECTROGAZ,
REMA, UERP/PCU, etc. will be solely involved in supporting the monitoring to ensure compliance. The
tender documents clearly specify the mitigation measures that the contractor must institute during
construction phase to minimise adverse impacts.




                                                                                                           54

Upon successful installation, commissioning and handing over of the substation to ELECTROGAZ by the
contractor, ELECTROGAZ shall henceforth become the sole and lead institution responsible for ensuring
proper mitigation measures and monitoring as indicated in the EMP document is followed.             However the
contractor will provide one technical advisor for a period of one year to provide capacity building support in
all the related management and maintenance field.

Specifically in Monitoring and Evaluation the following institutions will play the following roles namely;

9.2.1 Roles of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA):
Oversight Monitoring
As the lead agency responsible for the protection of environment in Rwanda, REMA will play the leading
oversight role of monitoring the activities of the project according to the legislation establishing REMA and
its functions.

Site Inspection Visits
REMA will undertake regular site visits to inspect and verify for themselves the nature and extent of the
impacts. They will then be expected to make viable recommendations based on their findings to the EA,
World Bank, UERP and ELECTROGAZ. REMA is mandated by the Organic Law to conduct period visits
and site inspections at will in any facility in Rwanda. They have a budget for this type of work, they have
conducted visits for other projects and it is expected that they will continue providing this regulatory and
enforcement role in this project.

Periodic Reports
REMA will prepare periodic environmental consolidated reports on the monitoring progress of the substation
plant and submit to the proponent in this case ELECTROGAZ as required and stipulated by the Organic
Law.

9.2.2 Role of the Contractor
Daily and Routine Monitoring
The company that will be awarded the contract to construct the Birembo substation will undertake the major
role of ensuring the mitigation measures in the EMP are followed to the detail during construction phase.

During construction the contactor will undertake regular monitoring of all the activities occurring in the
project site to ensure compliance to the EMP.

The contactor will bear all the costs related to monitoring activities during the construction and installation
phase of the substation.

9.2.3 Role of the Environmental Adviser/UERP
The UERP/PCU assisted by the Safeguards Advisor will undertake regular monitoring of all their planned
activities during all the phases of the project as specified in the EMP document.

The Safeguards Advisor will assist the UERP/PCU to develop suitable records of the site inspections and
visits for submission to REMA and the World Bank. This will involve efforts towards building the capacity of
the UERP/PCU towards this end as well.

The Safeguards Advisor will also be responsible for assisting in building capacity of the UERP/PCU in
monitoring the impacts and mitigation measures resulting from the action of the contractors, transporters
and suppliers and all third parties in the course of their duties under the project.




                                                                                                            55

9.2.4 Kigali Fire Brigade
Site Inspection
During the construction and installation of equipments in the project area, the Kigali Fire Brigade which is
the agency responsible for fire management in the City Kigali will undertake site inspection to verify if a fire
management plan is in place before construction works begin. Thereafter upon commissioning of the
project, this agency will further ascertain that the correct fire management equipments as stipulated in the
fire response plan are in place and in the right points.

Fire Drills
The EMP provides for regular fire drills preferably once annually. The overall objective is to ensure that
there is a high level of preparedness against fire outbreaks at all times. ELECTROGAZ will organise its own
fire drills but efforts will be made to bring on board the Kigali Fire Brigade depending on resource availability
and if the brigade is available to conduct these drills.

9.2.5 World Bank
Approval
The World Bank will provide approval to the final EMP and RAP for the Birembo substation developed
before construction activities begin. This approval will only be given if the World Bank is satisfied with the
EMP and RAP developed.

9.2.6 Role of ELECTROGAZ
Routine Monitoring
ELECTROGAZ will provide routine monitoring at all the stages of the project implementation as indicated in
the EMP. More specifically during the operation phase of the plant, ELECTROGAZ will be the main
responsible institution for undertaking all the mitigation and monitoring requirements in the EMP.


9.3 Clarification of Responsibilities Related to Monitoring

9.3.1 Contractor
The contracted company will be solely responsible for ensuring that monitoring and adherence to the EMP
beginning from the construction phase up to the point where they install the substation and it is
commissioned. Thereafter there responsibility to the project monitoring ceases henceforth. However, the
contractor will for a period of one year provide one technical person to provide capacity building support in
all the related management and maintenance field.

9.3.2 UERP/PCU
The UERP PCU will provide oversight monitoring of the project in accordance with the EMP up until the 4
year life span of the project. Upon the end of the project duration, the UERP PCU will no longer be
responsible for any monitoring activities associated with the project thereafter.

9.3.4 ELECTROGAZ
ELECTROGAZ will remain the sole institution that will fundamentally be responsible for undertaking
monitoring through out the project phase, when the contactor hands over the project and also after the
UERP PCU winds up as a project. ELECTROGAZ will be expected to ensure monitoring through out the
project phase until if it gets decommissioned.

9.4 Monitoring Protocol for Birembo Sub Station

9.4.1 Monitoring Plan
A detailed environmental monitoring plan has been developed to verify that predictions of environmental
impacts are accurate and that unforeseen impacts are detected at an early stage and allow corrective
measures to be implemented, if needed. During the construction phase the plan provides for dust, noise and
safety monitoring.

During the operation period, monitoring is planned in terms of routine inspection of the health and safety of
the workers. The Monitoring Plan is developed is presented at the end of this report as part of the EMP.

9.4.2 Responsibilities and Costs for Environmental Mitigation Measures
Table below outlines the overall package of environmental mitigation measures that will be implemented in
relation to the facility as outlined in detail in the EMP document. The table also assigns general
responsibilities for implementing each group of mitigation measures. A detailed implementation schedule
has also been developed.

Consistent with the UERP/PCU and World Bank's contracting strategy of integrating environmental
protection and mitigation activities into the Contractor's Scope of Work, the specifications for many of the
activities were included in the bid package upon which the Contractor is developing its base rates.
Therefore, since many of the costs associated with environmental protection and mitigation activities are
included in the Contractor's base rates, it is not possible to present a detailed accounting of all the monies
devoted to the project's construction phase environmental protection and mitigation activities. These costs
are therefore described as `Within contract budget' in Table below. Similarly, mitigation or monitoring
measures that will be carried out by ELECTROGAZ staff, with no additional expenditure required, are
described as `Within operational budget' in Table below.

The table below provides a summary of the capital (one off) costs that will be incurred by either the
contractor or Electorgaz during monitoring. The costs to be met by the contractor in ensuring mitigation will
be contained in the final bid document and for this reason cannot be reflected in this table at this point in
time.

The costs for resettling and compensating the PAPs will be met by UERP/ELECTROGAZ and is contained
in the separate Abbreviated Resettlement Acton Plan already developed as a separate document.

9.4.4 Recurring cost related activities
Reccuring costs imply costs that will be met by Electorgaz either on annual or monthly basis. At this point in
time, the costs related to replacement of new PPE will largely depend on the rate of wear and tear, however
initial cost is estimated as 5,000.00 USD as indicated below.

Cost related to maintenance of the fire equipment will be met bi annually and costs towards solid
waste disposal will be monthly though out the project life.

10.0 CONCLUSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS


Based on the findings of the study, the project is environmentally and socially viable with minimal adverse
environmental impacts. Being an emergency project, most of the impacts will be short term with low
magnitude confined within the project site.

Some of the impacts are inevitable and can only be minimised due to inadequate or lack of effective
technology. If the Environmental Management is implemented, the impacts of the project will either be
eliminated or minimised to a manageable and sustainable levels.

10.1 Recommendations
The contractor should develop an Emergency Response Plan (ERP) for the plant after undertaking a
vulnerability assessment for the plant.

When decommissioning the project, the proponent should rehabilitate the site to its former status.

INSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND MONITORING
ELECTROGAZ will undertake environmental monitoring to ensure that the construction and operation of the
Birembo substation complies with high environmental standards and the requirements of the environmental
legislation applicable in Rwanda and the policies and guidelines by World Bank.

Annual monitoring reports arising from the monitoring activities will be made available to REMA and World
Bank and others as requested and appropriate. If any standards have been exceeded, the operator will
investigate probable causes and if any are traced to the operation of the plant, remedial measures will be
implemented to restore compliance.

ELECTROGAZ will submit to World Bank and REMA an annual report containing the summary of the
     (i)       Monitoring results for the noise levels
     (ii)      Copies of all permits, licenses, and clearances related to the environment and safety issued by
               the relevant government agencies; and
     (iii)     In the event that in the reporting period the project has been cited for violation of any
               environmental or safety regulations, the report will include a certification from the relevant
               government agency that the defect has been corrected or an acceptable plan to correct the
               defect has been approved.

Monitoring data will be analyzed and reviewed at regular intervals and compared with the operating
standards so that any necessary corrective actions can be taken. Records of monitoring results will be kept
in an acceptable format. The results will be reported in summary form, with notification of exceptions, if any,
to the responsible government authorities and relevant parties, as required. In the absence of specific
national or local government guidelines, actual monitoring or surrogate performance data will be reported at
least annually.

ANNEX 3. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN FOR PROPOSED PLANT
The construction and installation including the operation of the proposed Birembo substation is expected to
trigger the likelihood of potential incidences which require the need for the development of an Emergency
Response Plan to arrest such incidences whenever and if they occur.

This is a framework of how the emergency response plan is for the sub station is expected to look and is by
no way the actual response plan. It is expected that the winning company to be awarded the contract of
constructing the substation will develop a comprehensive response plan which will be guided by a
vulnerability assessment for which the company will have to undertake. This emergency response plan has
incorporated separate sections handling responses to fire hazards in the plant including steps for reporting
incidences.

Why develop an Emergency Response Plan?
An ERP is a definite plan to deal with major emergencies in any enterprise and in effect is an important
element in all thermal power plants and programs. Besides the major benefit of providing guidance during
an emergency, developing the plan has other advantages. Unrecognized hazardous conditions that would
aggravate an emergency situation may be uncovered, allowing them to be eliminated. The planning process
may bring to light deficiencies, such as the lack of resources (equipment, trained personnel, supplies), items
that can be rectified before an emergency occurs. In addition an emergency plan promotes safety
awareness and shows the organization's commitment to the safety of workers.

The lack of an emergency plan could lead to severe losses such as multiple casualties and possible
financial collapse of the organization.

An attitude of "it can't happen here" may be present. People may not be willing to take the time and effort to
examine the problem. However, emergency planning is an important part of company operation.

Since emergencies will occur, preplanning is necessary to prevent possible disaster. An urgent need for
rapid decisions, shortage of time, and lack of resources and trained personnel can lead to chaos during an
emergency. Time and circumstances in an emergency mean that normal channels of authority and
communication cannot be relied upon to function routinely. The stress of the situation can lead to poor
judgment resulting in severe losses.

What is the overall objective of this plan?
This emergency plan specifies procedures for handling sudden unexpected situations. The objective is to
reduce the possible consequences of the emergency by:
     · Preventing fatalities and injuries;
     · Reducing damage to buildings, stock, and equipment; and
     · Accelerating the resumption of normal operations.
     · Development of the plan begins with a vulnerability assessment. The results of the study will show:
     · How likely a situation is to occur
     · What means are available to stop or prevent the situation and
     · What is necessary for a given situation
From this analysis, appropriate emergency procedures can be established. At the planning stage, it is
important that several groups be asked to participate. Among these groups, the setting up of a joint
occupational health and safety committee can provide valuable input and a means of wider worker
involvement. Appropriate municipal officials should also be consulted since control may be exercised by the
local government in major emergencies and additional resources may be available. Communication, training
and periodic drills will ensure adequate performance if the plan must be carried out.


                                                                                                            78

Vulnerability assessment
Although emergencies by definition are sudden events, their occurrence can be predicted with some degree
of certainty. The first step is to find which hazards pose a threat to any specific enterprise. When a list of
hazards is made, records of past incidents and occupational experience are not the only sources of valuable
information. Since major emergencies are rare events, knowledge of both technological (chemical or
physical) and natural hazards can be broadened by consulting with fire departments, insurance companies,
engineering consultants, and government departments.

The company to be contracted will be expected to undertake a comprehensive vulnerability assessment for
the Birembo substation project site.        The hazards identified here are merely the common hazards
associated with substations. They are classified into two categories mainly:

Technological hazards
Areas where flammables, explosives, or chemicals are used or stored should be considered as the most
likely place for a technological hazard emergency to occur. Examples of these hazards are:
     · Fire
     · Explosion
     · Major structural failure
     · Spills of flammable liquids
     · Accidental release of toxic substances
     · Loss of electrical power
Natural Hazards

     · Floods,
     · Earthquakes,
     · Other severe wind storms,
     · Severe extremes in temperature

What is the series of events or decisions that should be considered?
Having identified the hazards, the possible major impacts of each should be itemized, such as:
     · Sequential events (for example, fire after explosion)
     · Evacuation
     · Casualties
     · Damage to plant infrastructure
     · Loss of vital records/documents
     · Damage to equipment
     · Disruption of work
Based on these events, the required actions are determined. For example:

     · Declare emergency
     · Sound the alert
     · Evacuate danger zone
     · Close main shutoffs
     · Call for external aid
     · Initiate rescue operations
     · Attend to casualties
     · Fight fire




                                                                                                          79

The final consideration is a list and the location of resources needed:

     · Medical supplies
     · Auxiliary communication equipment
     · Power generators
     · Respirators
     · Chemical and radiation detection equipment
     · Mobile equipment
     · Emergency protective clothing
     · Fire fighting equipment
     · Ambulance
     · Rescue equipment
     · Trained personnel

Elements of the emergency plan to be developed by the contractor
The emergency plan should include;
     · All possible emergencies, consequences, required actions, written procedures, and the resources
          available
     · Detailed lists of personnel including their home telephone numbers, their duties and responsibilities
     · Floor plans, and
     · Large scale maps showing evacuation routes and service conduits (such as gas and water lines).

Since a sizable document will likely result, the plan should provide staff members with written instructions
about their particular emergency duties.

The following are examples of the parts of an emergency plan. These elements may not cover every
situation in every workplace but serve they are provided as a general guideline when writing a workplace
specific plan:

Objective
The objective is a brief summary of the purpose of the plan; that is, to reduce human injury and damage to
property in an emergency. It also specifies those staff members who may put the plan into action. The
objective identifies clearly who these staff members are since the normal chain of command cannot always
be available on short notice. At least one of them must be on the site at all times when the premises are
occupied. The extent of authority of these personnel must be clearly indicated.

Organization
One individual should be appointed and trained to act as Emergency coordinator as well as a "back-up"
coordinator. However, personnel on the site during an emergency are key in ensuring that prompt and
efficient action is taken to minimize loss. In some cases it may be possible to recall off-duty employees to
help but the critical initial decisions usually must be made immediately. Specific duties, responsibilities,
authority, and resources must be clearly defined. Among the responsibilities that must be assigned are:

     · Reporting the emergency
     · Activating the emergency plan
     · Assuming overall command
     · Establishing communication
     · Alerting staff
     · Ordering evacuation
     · Alerting external agencies


                                                                                                            80

     · Confirming evacuation complete
     · Alerting outside population of possible risk
     · Requesting external aid
     · Coordinating activities of various groups
     · Advising relatives of casualties
     · Providing medical aid
     · Ensuring emergency shut offs are closed
     · Sounding the all-clear

This list of responsibilities should be completed using the previously developed summary of
countermeasures for each emergency situation. In organizations operating on reduced staff during some
shifts, some personnel must assume extra responsibilities during emergencies. Sufficient alternates for each
responsible position must be named to ensure that someone with authority is available onsite at all times.

External organizations that may be available to assist (with varying response times) include:
     · Fire department
     · Ambulance services
     · Police departments
     · Telephone company
     · Hospitals
     · Utility companies
     · Government agencies
These organizations should be contacted in the planning stages to discuss each of their roles during an
emergency. Mutual aid with other industrial facilities in the area should be explored. Pre-planned
coordination is necessary to avoid conflicting responsibilities. For example, the police, fire department,
ambulance service, rescue squad, company fire brigade, and the first aid team may be on the scene
simultaneously.

A pre-determined chain of command in such a situation is required to avoid organizational difficulties. Under
certain circumstances, an outside agency may assume command.

Possible problems in communication have been mentioned in several contexts. Efforts should be made to
seek alternate means of communication during an emergency, especially between key personnel such as
overall commander, on-scene commander, engineering, fire brigade, medical, rescue, and outside
agencies. Depending on the size of the organization and physical layout of the premises, it may be
advisable to plan for an emergency control centre with alternate communication facilities. All personnel with
alerting or reporting responsibilities must be provided with a current list of telephone numbers and
addresses of those people they may have to contact.

Procedures
Many factors determine what procedures are needed in an emergency, such as
     · The degree of emergency,
     · The size of organization,
     · The capabilities of the organization in an emergency situation,
     · The immediacy of outside aid,
     · The physical layout of the premises, and
     · The number of structures determines procedures that are needed.

Common elements to be considered in all emergencies include pre-emergency preparation and provisions
for alerting and evacuating staff, handling casualties, and for containing of the emergency.


                                                                                                          81

Natural hazards, such as floods or severe storms, often provide prior warning. The plan should take
advantage of such warnings with, for example, instructions on sand bagging, removal of equipment to
needed locations, providing alternate sources of power, light or water, extra equipment, and relocation of
personnel with special skills. Phased states of alert allow such measures to be initiated in an orderly
manner.

The evacuation order is of greatest importance in alerting staff. To avoid confusion, only one type of signal
should be used for the evacuation order. Commonly used for this purpose are sirens, fire bells, whistles,
flashing lights, paging system announcements, or word-of-mouth in noisy environments. The all-clear signal
is less important since time is not such an urgent concern. The following are "musts":

     · Identify evacuation routes, alternate means of escape make these known to all staff; keep the
          routes unobstructed.
     · Specify safe locations for staff to gather for head counts to ensure that everyone has left the
          danger zone. Assign individuals to assist handicapped employees in emergencies.
     · Carry out treatment of the injured and search for the missing simultaneously with efforts to contain
          the emergency.
     · Provide alternate sources of medical aid when normal facilities may be in the danger zone.
     · Containing the extent of the property loss should begin only when the safety of all staff and
          neighbours at risk has been clearly established.

Testing and Revision
Completing a comprehensive plan for handling emergencies is a major step toward preventing disasters.
However, it is difficult to predict all of the problems that may happen unless the plan is tested. Exercises and
drills may be conducted to practice all or critical portions (such as evacuation) of the plan. A thorough and
immediate review after each exercise, drill, or after an actual emergency will point out areas that require
improvement. Knowledge of individual responsibilities can be evaluated through paper tests or interviews.

The plan should be revised when shortcomings have become known, and should be reviewed at least
annually. Changes in plant infrastructure, processes, and materials used and key personnel are occasions
for updating the plan.

It should be stressed that provision must be made for the training of both individuals and teams, if they are
expected to perform adequately in an emergency. An annual full-scale exercise will help in maintaining a
high level of proficiency.

ANNEX 4. FIRE RISKS AND MANAGEMENT PLAN

ELECTROGAZ, through the Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project is in the process of selecting a
company to install a substation in Birembo as part of the Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation that is aimed
towards alleviating the power problems experienced in Rwanda.

An Environmental Management Plan for the project has been developed to provide a plan for mitigating and
monitoring the adverse impacts identified.

Even though the EMP contains measures for mitigating the potential risk of fire occurrences in the
substation, the UERP Safeguards Advisor has developed a Fire Risk and Fire Management Plan aimed at
setting out an outline of procedures to manage and suppress any fire out breaks that could occur during the
functioning of the plant.

This plan is a draft guideline and it is expected that the selected company will refine this plan upon the
undertaking of a vulnerability/risk assessment.

This fire safety plan has been developed and will make every effort to comply with and enforce the
requirements of the Government of Rwanda Fire Code, and all other statues, policies, protocol, procedures
and instructions as may be issued by the Kigali Fire Brigade.

The plan is expected to provide for the safety of plant occupants through the elimination and control of fire
hazards, maintenance of fire protection and life safety systems, establishment and implementation of fire
safety plans, procedures, and inspections of the plant.

The eventual contracted company to install the equipments will be expected to develop a written fire safety
plan which is intended to protect occupants from fire and helps to ensure effective evacuation of the building
under all emergency conditions.

Training
Fire safety training and emergency evacuation practice drills for workers must be conducted jointly by a
competent Security/Fire Safety firm or Kigali Fire Brigade no less than once every twelve months.

Emergency Evacuation
In the event of fire or other emergencies that require emergency evacuation of the plant, the procedures
contained in this Fire Safety Plan shall be carried out upon refinement by the contractor.

Emergency Procedures for Occupants
Emergency procedures signage should be affixed to the wall at all key strategic points within the substation.
Note: It should be mandatory to evacuate the substation upon sounding of the Fire Alarm.

Upon Discovery of Fire:
· Leave the fire area immediately and close all doors
· Activate the Fire Alarm
· Call the Kigali Fire Brigade
· Leave building via nearest Exit
· Do not return until it is declared safe to do so by a Fire Official




                                                                                                           83

Upon Hearing Fire Alarm:
     · Before opening doors, feel door and doorknob for heat. If they are not hot, brace yourself against
          the door and open it slightly. If you see smoke, or feel air pressure or a hot draft, close the door
          quickly.
     · Leave building via nearest Exit
     · Close all doors behind you

Fire Alarm Systems
The purpose of the fire alarm system is to alert all occupants to a fire emergency so that evacuation
procedures can be initiated. The fire alarm audible devices should be heard throughout the substation. The
fire alarm system should consist of the following components:

Alarm Initiating Devices ­ These devices should be installed throughout the plant designed to detect
heat, smoke or flame causing an electrical signal to be sent to the Central Control Panel.

Central Control Panel ­ A microprocessor-based device that receives and processes electrical signals
from alarm initiating devices located throughout the plant including heat detectors, smoke detectors, manual
pull stations, sprinkler system alarm switches, etc, then transmits signals that cause audible and visual
alarm devices such as bells, horns, strobe lights, etc to operate.

Annunciator Panel ­ a lighted or graphical display device, located in the main entrance to the plant that
indicates the location or zone of the activated initiating device, e.g. detector that has responded to the
presence of smoke, heat or flame; or a manual pull station that has been activated by an occupant.

Signaling Devices ­ audible and visual devices (horns and strobe lights) located throughout the building
in corridors and rooms to indicate the actuation of the fire alarm system.

Fire code maintenance requirements

     · Check maintain corridors free of obstructions

Elimination of Ignition Sources
All nonessential ignition sources must be eliminated where flammable liquids are used or stored. The
following is a list of some of the more common potential ignition sources:

     · Open flames, such as cutting and welding torches, furnaces, matches, and heaters-these sources
          should be kept away from flammable liquids operations. Cutting or welding on flammable liquids
          equipment should not be performed unless the equipment has been properly emptied and purged
          with a neutral gas such as nitrogen.
     · Chemical sources of ignition such as D.C. motors, switched, and circuit breakers-these sources
          should be eliminated where flammable liquids are handled or stored. Only approved explosion-
          proof devices should be used in these areas.
     · Mechanical sparks-these sparks can be produced as a result of friction. Only non-sparking tools
          should be used in areas where flammable liquids are stored or handled.
     · Static sparks-these sparks can be generated as a result of electron transfer between two
          contacting surfaces. The electrons can discharge in a small volume, raising the temperature to
          above the ignition temperature. Every effort should be made to eliminate the possibility of static
          sparks. Also proper bonding and grounding procedures must be followed when flammable liquids
          are transferred or transported.
     · The storage of any flammable or combustible liquid shall not physically obstruct a means of egress
          from the building or area.
     · Containers of flammable or combustible liquids will remain tightly sealed except when transferred,
          poured or applied. Remove only that portion of liquid in the storage container required to
          accomplish a particular job.

Ventilation
Every inside storage room will be provided with a continuous mechanical exhaust ventilation system. To
prevent the accumulation of vapors, the location of both the makeup and exhaust air openings will be
arranged to provide, as far as practical, air movement directly to the exterior of the building and if ducts are
used, they will not be used for any other purpose.


Removal of Incompatibles
Materials that can contribute to a flammable liquid fire should not be stored with flammable liquids.
Examples are oxidizers and organic peroxides, which, on decomposition, can generate large amounts of
oxygen.

Flammable Gases
Generally, flammable gases pose the same type of fire hazards as flammable liquids and their vapors. Many
of the safeguards for flammable liquids also apply to flammable gases, other properties such as toxicity,
reactivity, and corrosivity also must be taken into account. Also, a gas that is flammable could produce toxic
combustion products.




                                                                                                             86

Location and Marking of Extinguishers
Extinguishers should be conspicuously located and readily accessible for immediate use in the event of fire.
They should be located along normal paths of travel and egress. Wall recesses and/or flush-mounted
cabinets should be used as extinguisher locations whenever possible.

Extinguishers should be clearly visible. In locations where visual obstruction cannot be completely avoided,
directional arrows should be provided to indicate the location of extinguishers and the arrows will be marked
with the extinguisher classification.

If extinguishers intended for different classes of fire are located together, they will be conspicuously marked
to ensure that the proper class extinguisher selection is made at the time of a fire. Extinguisher classification
markings will be located on the front of the shell above or below the extinguisher nameplate. Markings will
be of a size and form to be legible from a distance of 3 feet.

Condition
Portable extinguishers should be maintained in a fully charged and operable condition. They should be kept
in their designated locations at all times when not being used. When extinguishers are removed for
maintenance or testing, a fully charged and operable replacement unit should be provided.

Mounting and Distribution of Extinguishers
Extinguishers should be installed on hangers, brackets, in cabinets, or on shelves. Extinguishers having a
gross weight not exceeding 40 pounds should be so installed that the top of the extinguisher is not more
than 3-1/2 feet above the floor.

Extinguishers mounted in cabinets or wall recesses or set on shelves should be placed so that the
extinguisher operating instructions face outward. The location of such extinguishers should be made
conspicuous by marking the cabinet or wall recess in a contrasting color, which should distinguish it from the
normal decor.

Extinguishers must be distributed in such a way that the amount of time needed to travel to their location
and back to the fire does not allow the fire to get out of control. OSHA requires that the travel distance for
Class A and Class D extinguishers not exceed 75 feet. The maximum travel distance for Class B
extinguishers is 50 feet because flammable liquid fires can get out of control faster that Class A fires.
There is no maximum travel distance specified for Class C extinguishers, but they must be
distributed on the basis of appropriate patterns for Class A and B hazards.

Emergency Egress
Every exit should be clearly visible, or the route to it conspicuously identified in such a manner that every
occupant of the building will readily know the direction of escape from any point. At no time should exits be
blocked. Any doorway or passageway which is not an exit or access to an exit but which may be mistaken
for an exit should be identified by a sign reading "Not An Exit" or a sign indicating it actual use (i.e.,
"Storeroom"). Exits and accesses to exits should be marked by a readily visible sign. Each exit sign (other
than internally illuminated signs) should be illuminated by a reliable light source providing not less than 5
foot-candles on the illuminated surface.

Fire Drills
The purpose of the fire drill is to ensure that supervisory staff and occupants are totally familiar with
emergency evacuation procedures, resulting in orderly evacuation with efficient use of exit facilities.




                                                                                                              87

The Kigali Fire Brigade should oversee the fire drill and direct designated supervisory personnel to carry out
the requirements of the Fire Safety Plan. All designated supervisory personnel should be provided access
to the approved Fire Safety Plan prior to being assigned any fire related duties/responsibilities.

The drill should be reported to the Fire Department prior to commencement, in accordance with "Required
Procedures for the Conducting of Fire Drills". The fire drill should include, but not necessarily be restricted
to:

      · Checking of the annunciator panel
      · Identifying the alarm source/location (the elevators are not to be used)
      · Reviewing the fire alarm systems, silence and re-set procedures.
      · Reviewing the Fire Safety Plan documents required By the Fire Code
      · Practicing the emergency evacuation plan

Following each drill, all persons with delegated responsibility should attend a debriefing session to report on
the actions and the reactions of the participants. The Plant Manager should keep a record of the date of the
drill, who directed the drill, what actions were taken, any problems with supervisory personnel and what
corrective actions can be taken.

Information regarding the fire drills and Fire Code maintenance tasks should be entered in the Fire Log
Book for inspection by the Chief Fire Official, if requested, and kept at the plant Reception Desk.




                                                                                                            88

ANNEX 5. INCIDENTS REPORTING SYSTEM AND INVESTIGATION
PROCEDURE

Introduction
The Incident Reporting System should be designed to:
     1.   Track and analyze employee injuries and illnesses, property and machinery damage, as well as
          serious events or near misses which might have resulted in personal injury, illness, or property and
          machinery damage
     2.   Initiate the worker's compensation process, if necessary
     3.   Meet regulatory reporting requirements

All incidents (accidents resulting in injury or causing illness to employees) and events (near-miss accidents)
should be reported in order to:

     · Establish a written record of factors, which cause injuries and illnesses and occurrences (near-
          misses), which might have resulted in injury or illness but did not, as well as property and
          machinery damage.
     · Maintain a capability to promptly investigate incidents and events in order to initiate and support
          corrective and/or preventive action.
     · Provide statistical information for use in analyzing all phases of incidents and events involving
          personnel.
     · Provide the means for complying with the reporting requirements for occupational injuries and
          illnesses

The Incident Reporting System requirements apply to all incidences involving personnel arising out of or in
the course of employment, which results in (or might have resulted in) personal injury, illness, and/or
property and machinery damage.

A. Incidents (Occupational injuries and illnesses)
Injuries and illnesses that require reporting include those injuries and illnesses occurring on the job which
result in any of the following: lost work time, restrictions in performing job duties, requirement for first aid or
outside medical attention, permanent physical bodily damages, or death. Examples of "reportable injuries
and illnesses include, but are not limited to, heat exhaustion from working in hot environments, strained
back muscles from moving equipment, acid burns on fingers, etc.

Other incidents requiring reporting include those incidents occurring on the job which result in any of the
following: injury or illness, damage to a machine, fire/explosion, property damage or chemical releases
requiring evacuation of at least that immediate spill area. Examples of reportable incidents include denting
the fender of machines/equipment, and release of pressurized air through a leaking valve into a room.

Examples of "non-reportable" injuries and illnesses include small paper cuts, common colds, and small
bruises not resulting in work restrictions or requiring first aid or medical attention. Examples of other non-
reportable incidents include, but are not limited to, dropping and breaking an empty glass sample bottle.




                                                                                                               89

B. Events (Near Misses)

Other incidents which, strictly by chance, do not result in actual or observable injury, illness, death, or
property damage required to be reported. The information obtained from such reporting can be extremely
useful in identifying and mitigating problems before they result in actual personal or property damage.

Examples of near miss incidences required to be reported include the falling of a compressed gas cylinder,
overexposures to chemical, biological, or physical agents (not resulting in an immediately observable
manifestation of illness or injury), and slipping and falling on a wet surface without injury.


Personnel Responsibilities
All personnel have a responsibility to report all occupational injuries and illnesses, and other incidents or
events under the Incident Reporting System.

A. Committee of Health and Safety
OHS has the overall responsibility for implementing the Incident Reporting System, including review of
incident/event reports, recommendation of corrective and/or preventive actions, and maintaining record
keeping required by the regulations.

B. Supervision
Supervisors are primarily responsible for ensuring that the Incident Report and appropriate workers
compensation forms are completed and distributed as indicated on the forms in a timely manner.

C. Personnel
All employees must be familiar with the procedures for reporting occupational injuries and illnesses and
hazardous conditions or situations in which employees may be potentially exposed. All personnel have the
responsibility to initiate the incident reporting sequence by informing their supervisors immediately of an
actual or potential injury or illness as soon as possible after an incident has occurred.


Incident Reporting Procedures and Practices
This section describes the specific procedures that shall be followed by personnel in order to effectively
report occupational injuries and illnesses and other incidents or events.

A. Incidents (Injuries and Illnesses)
Serious injury or illness posing a life-threatening situation should be reported immediately to the local
emergency response medical services (Call 911).

Injuries and illnesses should be reported by the injured employee to his or her supervisor in person or by
phone as soon after any life-threatening situation has been addressed. If the injured employee is unable to
report immediately, then the incident should be reported as soon as possible.

B. Events
Incidents not involving injury or illness, but resulting in property damage, must also be reported on within 48
hours of the incident. In cases of a fire or explosion that cannot be controlled by one person, vehicular
accident resulting in injury or damage, or a chemical release requiring a building evacuation, the involved
party must immediately report the incident to the emergency response services in the area (911 - police,
fire, etc.) If injuries or illnesses occur, the reporting must follow those procedures outlined in above.




                                                                                                            90

All near miss incidences are also required to be reported on the Incident Report Form within 48 hours of
occurrence. In place of indicating the result of the incident (i.e., actual personal or property damage), the
reporting person shall indicate the avoided injury or damage. Events, hazardous working conditions or
situations, and incidents involving contractor personnel must be reported to OHS immediately.

C. Record keeping
OHS will maintain the required and summary of (recordable) Occupational Injuries and Illnesses and the
Supplementary Record of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses for each calendar year.

Incident Investigations
OHS personnel should review each reported incident and event to:
     1.  Determine if further investigation is required and then perform the investigation
     2.  Make recommendations for corrective and/or preventative actions necessary to reduce or eliminate
         hazardous conditions and monitor the status of the abatement actions.

Health and Safety Manual
Each new employee should be given a copy of the Health and Safety Manual upon starting employment.
This manual describes health and safety programs and is available to the employee as a reference dealing
with health and safety issues.

Training
To ensure that personnel are cognizant of the Incident Reporting System requirements and are aware of
their own and other's responsibilities, a series of informational and instructional training opportunities should
exist. Personnel new to the plant should attend New Employee Orientation training, which will inform them
on organizational structure, resources, and procedures. This orientation will ensure that new personnel are
aware of the existence of this Manual and of its contents, and who the responsible persons in their
organizations are.

Review and Audit
The effectiveness of a program can only be accomplished if the program is implemented. Therefore,
periodic reviews and audits should be conducted to confirm that all employees have obtained a copy of this
Manual and are familiar with the incident reporting requirements. Furthermore, review and auditing should
include an inspection of report submissions and filing systems.

Implementation
Implementation of the Incident Reporting System should be effected through a combination of mechanisms.
The general theme of these means is focused on program education, understanding, and awareness which
include:
     1.  Distribution of the Health and Safety Manual
     2.  Training for supervisors
     3.  Program review and audit




                                                                                                              91

ANNEX 6. GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS
  This section describes the general environmental management conditions to be observed anc complied
  with during the construction of the sub station. These general conditions have been presented here but
  are also expected to be included in the construction contract with the aim of guiding the contractor on the
  conditions to comply with. It is expected that the procurement department of the UERP/PCU will include
  this section as an attachment to the construction contract.

· In addition to these general conditions, the Contractor shall comply with any specific Environmental
  Management Plan (EMP) for the works he is responsible for. The Contractor shall inform himself about
  such an EMP, and prepare his work strategy and plan to fully take into account relevant provisions of that
  EMP. If the Contractor fails to implement the approved EMP after written instruction by the Supervising
  Engineer (SE) to fulfil their obligation within the requested time, the Owner reserves the right to arrange
  through the SE for execution of the missing action by a third party on account of the Contractor.

· Notwithstanding the Contractor's obligation under the above clause, the Contractor shall implement all
  measures necessary to avoid undesirable adverse environmental and social impacts wherever possible,
  restore work sites to acceptable standards, and abide by any environmental performance requirements
  specified in an EMP. In general these measures shall include but not be limited to:

    (a) Minimize the effect of dust on the surrounding environment resulting from earth mixing sites,
    asphalt mixing sites, dispersing coal ashes, vibrating equipment, temporary access roads, etc. to
    ensure safety, health and the protection of workers and communities living in the vicinity dust producing
    activities.


    (b) Ensure that noise levels emanating from machinery, vehicles and noisy construction activities (e.g.
    excavation, blasting) are kept at a minimum for the safety, health and protection of workers within the
    vicinity of high noise levels and nearby communities.

    (c) Prevent and minimize the impacts of quarrying, earth borrowing, piling and building of temporary
    construction camps and access roads on the biophysical environment including protected areas and
    arable lands; local communities and their settlements. In as much as possible restore/rehabilitate all
    sites to acceptable standards.

    (d) Upon discovery of ancient heritage, relics or anything that might or believed to be of archeological
    or historical importance during the execution of works, immediately report such findings to the SE so
    that the appropriate authorities may be expeditiously contacted for fulfillment of the measures aimed at
    protecting such historical or archaeological resources.

    (e) Implement soil erosion control measures in order to avoid surface run off and prevents siltation, etc.

    (f) Ensure that garbage, sanitation and drinking water facilities are provided in for construction workers.

    (g) Ensure that, in as much as possible, local materials are used to avoid importation of foreign
    material and long distance transportation.

    (h) Ensure public safety, and meet traffic safety requirements for the operation of work to avoid
    accidents.




                                                                                                           92

· The Contractor shall indicate the period within which he/she shall maintain status on site after completion
  of civil works to ensure that significant adverse impacts arising from such works have been appropriately
  addressed.

· The Contractor shall adhere to the proposed activity implementation schedule and the monitoring plan /
  strategy to ensure effective feedback of monitoring information to project management so that impact
  management can be implemented properly, and if necessary, adapt to changing and unforeseen
  conditions.

· Besides the regular inspection of the sites by the SE for adherence to the contract conditions and
  specifications, the Owner may appoint an Inspector to oversee the compliance with these environmental
  conditions and any proposed mitigation measures. State environmental authority (REMA) may carry out
  similar inspection duties. In all cases, as directed by the SE, the Contractor shall comply with directives
  from such inspectors to implement measures required to ensure the adequacy rehabilitation measures
  carried out on the bio-physical environment and compensation for socio-economic disruption resulting
  from implementation of any works.

Worksite Waste Management

· All vessels (drums, containers, bags, etc.) containing oil/fuel/surfacing materials and other hazardous
  chemicals shall be bunded in order to contain spillage. All waste containers, litter and any other waste
  generated during the construction shall be collected and disposed off at designated disposal sites in line
  with applicable government waste management regulations.


· All drainage and effluent from storage areas, workshops shall be captured and treated before being
  discharged into the drainage system in line with applicable government water pollution control regulations.


· Used oil from maintenance shall be collected and disposed off appropriately at designated sites or be re-
  used or sold for re-use locally.


· Entry of runoff to the site shall be restricted by constructing diversion channels or holding structures such
  as banks, drains, dams, etc. to reduce the potential of soil erosion and water pollution.

· Construction waste shall not be left in stockpiles along the road, but removed and reused or disposed of
  on a daily basis.


· If disposal sites for clean spoil are necessary, they shall be located in areas, approved by the SE, of low
  land use value and where they will not result in material being easily washed into drainage channels.
  Whenever possible, spoil materials should be placed in low-lying areas and should be compacted and
  planted with species indigenous to the locality.

Material Excavation and Deposit
· The Contractor shall obtain appropriate licenses/permits from relevant authorities to operate quarries or
  borrow areas.

· The location of quarries and borrow areas shall be subject to approval by relevant local and national
  authorities, including traditional authorities if the land on which the quarry or borrow areas fall in traditional
  land.



                                                                                                                 93

· New extraction sites:


       a.  Shall not be located in the vicinity of settlement areas, cultural sites, wetlands or any other
           valued ecosystem component, or on high or steep ground or in areas of high scenic value, and
           shall not be located less than 1km from such areas.

       b.  Shall not be located adjacent to stream channels wherever possible to avoid siltation of river
           channels. Where they are located near water sources, borrow pits and perimeter drains shall
           surround quarry sites.

       c.  Shall not be located in archaeological areas. Excavations in the vicinity of such areas shall
           proceed with great care and shall be done in the presence of government authorities having a
           mandate for their protection.

       d.  Shall not be located in forest reserves.       However, where there are no other alternatives,
           permission shall be obtained from the appropriate authorities and an environmental impact study
           shall be conducted.

       e.  Shall be easily rehabilitated. Areas with minimal vegetation cover such as flat and bare ground,
           or areas covered with grass only or covered with shrubs less than 1.5m in height, are preferred.

       f.  Shall have clearly demarcated and marked boundaries to minimize vegetation clearing.

· Vegetation clearing shall be restricted to the area required for safe operation of construction work.
  Vegetation clearing shall not be done more than two months in advance of operations.

· Stockpile areas shall be located in areas where trees can act as buffers to prevent dust pollution.
  Perimeter drains shall be built around stockpile areas. Sediment and other pollutant traps shall be located
  at drainage exits from workings.

· The Contractor shall deposit any excess material in accordance with the principles of these general
  conditions, and any applicable EMP, in areas approved by local authorities and/or the SE.

· Areas for depositing hazardous materials such as contaminated liquid and solid materials shall be
  approved by the SE and appropriate local and/or national authorities before the commencement of work.
  Use of existing, approved sites shall be preferred over the establishment of new sites.

Rehabilitation and Soil Erosion Prevention
· To the extent practicable, the Contractor shall rehabilitate the site progressively so that the rate of
  rehabilitation is similar to the rate of construction.

· Always remove and retain topsoil for subsequent rehabilitation. Soils shall not be stripped when they are
  wet as this can lead to soil compaction and loss of structure.

· Topsoil shall not be stored in large heaps. Low mounds of no more than 1 to 2m high are recommended.

· Re-vegetate stockpiles to protect the soil from erosion, discourage weeds and maintain an active
  population of beneficial soil microbes.



                                                                                                          94

· Locate stockpiles where they will not be disturbed by future construction activities.

· To the extent practicable, reinstate natural drainage patterns where they have been altered or impaired.

· Remove toxic materials and dispose of them in designated sites. Backfill excavated areas with soils or
  overburden that is free of foreign material that could pollute groundwater and soil.

· Identify potentially toxic overburden and screen with suitable material to prevent mobilization of toxins.

· Ensure reshaped land is formed so as to be inherently stable, adequately drained and suitable for the
  desired long-term land use, and allow natural regeneration of vegetation.

· Minimize the long-term visual impact by creating landforms that are compatible with the adjacent
  landscape.

· Minimize erosion by wind and water both during and after the process of reinstatement.

· Compacted surfaces shall be deep ripped to relieve compaction unless subsurface conditions dictate
  otherwise.

· Revegetate with plant species that will control erosion, provide vegetative diversity and, through
  succession, contribute to a resilient ecosystem. The choice of plant species for rehabilitation shall be
  done in consultation with local research institutions, forest department and the local people.

Water Resources Management
· The Contractor shall at all costs avoid conflicting with water demands of local communities.

· Abstraction of both surface and underground water shall only be done with the consultation of the local
  community and after obtaining a permit from the relevant Water Authority.

· Abstraction of water from wetlands shall be avoided. Where necessary, authority has to be obtained from
  relevant authorities.

· Temporary damming of streams and rivers shall be done in such a way avoids disrupting water supplies
  to communities down stream, and maintains the ecological balance of the river system.

· No construction water containing spoils or site effluent, especially cement and oil, shall be allowed to flow
  into natural water drainage courses.

· Wash water from washing out of equipment shall not be discharged into water courses or road drains.

· Site spoils and temporary stockpiles shall be located away from the drainage system, and surface run off
  shall be directed away from stockpiles to prevent erosion.

Traffic management
· Location of access roads/detours shall be done in consultation with the local community especially in
  important or sensitive environments. Access roads shall not traverse wetland areas.

· Upon the completion of civil works, all access roads shall be ripped and rehabilitated.



                                                                                                            95

· Access roads shall be sprinkled with water at least five times a day in settled areas, and three times in
  unsettled areas, to suppress dust emissions.

Disposal of unusable elements
· Unusable materials and construction elements such as electro-mechanical equipment, pipes, accessories
  and demolished structures will be disposed of in a manner approved by the SE. The Contractor has to
  agree with the SE which elements are to be surrendered to the Client's premises, which will be recycled
  or reused, and which will be disposed of at approved landfill sites.

· As far as possible, abandoned pipelines shall remain in place. Where for any reason no alternative
  alignment for the new pipeline is possible, the old pipes shall be safely removed and stored at a safe
  place to be agreed upon with the SE and the local authorities concerned.

· AC-pipes as well as broken parts thereof have to be treated as hazardous material and disposed of as
  specified above.

· Unsuitable and demolished elements shall be dismantled to a size fitting on ordinary trucks for transport.

Health and safety
· In advance of the construction work, the Contractor shall mount an awareness and hygiene campaign.
  Workers and local residents shall be sensitized on health risks particularly of AIDS.

· Adequate road signs to warn pedestrians and motorists of construction activities, diversions, etc. shall be
  provided at appropriate points.

· Construction vehicles shall not exceed maximum speed limit of 40km per hour.

Repair of private property
· Should the Contractor, deliberately or accidentally, damage private property, he shall repair the property
  to the owner's satisfaction and at his own cost. For each repair, the Contractor shall obtain from the
  owner a certificate that the damage has been made good satisfactorily in order to indemnify the Client
  from subsequent claims.

· In cases where compensation for inconveniences, damage of crops etc. are claimed by the owner, the
  Client has to be informed by the Contractor through the SE. This compensation is in general settled
  under the responsibility of the Client before signing the Contract. In unforeseeable cases, the respective
  administrative entities of the Client will take care of compensation.

Contractor's environment, health and safety management plan (EHS-EMP)
Within 6 weeks of signing the Contract, the Contractor shall prepare an EHS-MP to ensure the adequate
management of the health, safety, environmental and social aspects of the works, including implementation
of the requirements of these general conditions and any specific requirements of an EMP for the works.
The Contractor's EHS-MP will serve two main purposes:

     · For the Contractor, for internal purposes, to ensure that all measures are in place for adequate
         EHS management, and as an operational manual for his staff.
     · For the Client, supported where necessary by a SE, to ensure that the Contractor is fully prepared
         for the adequate management of the EHS aspects of the project, and as a basis for monitoring of
         the Contractor's EHS performance.




                                                                                                          96

The Contractor's EHS-MP shall provide at least:

     · a description of procedures and methods for complying with these general environmental
          management conditions, and any specific conditions specified in an EMP;
     · a description of specific mitigation measures that will be implemented in order to minimize adverse
          impacts;
     · a description of all planned monitoring activities (e.g. sediment discharges from borrow areas) and
          the reporting thereof; and
     · the internal organizational, management and reporting mechanisms put in place for such.

The Contractor's EHS-MP will be reviewed and approved by the Client before start of the works. This review
should demonstrate if the Contractor's EHS-MP covers all of the identified impacts, and has defined
appropriate measures to counteract any potential impacts.

EHS Reporting
The Contractor shall prepare bi-weekly progress reports to the SE on compliance with these general
conditions, the project EMP if any, and his own EHS-MP. An example format for a Contractor EHS report is
given below. It is expected that the Contractor's reports will include information on:

     · EHS management actions/measures taken, including approvals sought from local or national
          authorities;
     · Problems encountered in relation to EHS aspects (incidents, including delays, cost consequences,
          etc. as a result thereof);
     · Lack of compliance with contract requirements on the part of the Contractor;
     · Changes of assumptions, conditions, measures, designs and actual works in relation to EHS
          aspects; and
     · Observations, concerns raised and/or decisions taken with regard to EHS management during site
          meetings.

It is advisable that reporting of significant EHS incidents be done "as soon as practicable". Such incident
reporting shall therefore be done individually. Also, it is advisable that the Contractor keeps his own records
on health, safety and welfare of persons, and damage to property. It is advisable to include such records,
as well as copies of incident reports, as appendixes to the bi-weekly reports. Example formats for an
incident notification and detailed report are given below. Details of EHS performance will be reported to the
Client through the SE's reports to the Client.

Training of Contractor's Personnel
The Contractor shall provide sufficient training to his own personnel to ensure that they are all aware of the
relevant aspects of these general conditions, any project EMP, and his own EHS-MP, and are able to fulfil
their expected roles and functions. Specific training should be provided to those employees that have
particular responsibilities associated with the implementation of the EHS-MP. General topics should be:
     · EHS in general (working procedures);
     · emergency procedures; and
     · Social and cultural aspects (awareness raising on social issues).




                                                                                                            97

Cost of compliance
It is expected that compliance with these conditions is already part of standard good workmanship and state
of art as generally required under this Contract. The item "Compliance with Environmental Management
Conditions" in the Bill of Quantities covers these costs. No other payments will be made to the Contractor
for compliance with any request to avoid and/or mitigate an avoidable EHS impact.
