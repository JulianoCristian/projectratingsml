EXECUTIVESUMMARY

The Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) with the support of World Bank has identified
a site for the construction of a sub station for electricity in the out skirts of Kigali town. The
construction of the sub station is expected to involve the acquisition of land for the same purpose.

Land acquisition is expected to lead to physical and economic displacement of people and loss of
access to the land that provides for economic resources as well as shelter.             This therefore
principally triggers World Bank Operational Policy OP4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and certain
laws of Rwanda primarily the laws on land that provides and recognises individual ownership of
land.  Further to this, the customary laws regarding land ownership in Rwanda is also triggered.
The land already identified for the construction of the sub station is owned by four different
individuals who are utilizing the pieces of land into various land uses ranging from shelter/home;
livestock keeping and subsistence agriculture. The identified piece of land also is used as a church
by the Seventh Day Adventist church.

In accordance with the World Bank Policy OP4.12 a resettlement action/compensation plan must
be developed by the Safeguards Advisor to be submitted to World Bank for approval before any
land acquisition, resettlement, loss, denial of, and restriction to economic resources or any other
impact on livelihoods occur.

This is therefore the duly prepared Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) by the
Safeguards Advisor in line with all the necessary requirements outlined in the Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) document. This report principally describes the activities of the project that is
proposed and the associated impacts arising thereof.       The section on land acquisition highlights
the existing land uses on the targeted land, brief biography of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs)
and the magnitude of the loss.

Eventually, the report describes the process used in land valuation including surveying of the land
in question, valuation of the existing structures, and crops including trees present in the project
site. Lastly it demonstrates the level of community consultation and stakeholder engagement in the
compensation process that started all the way back in 2004.

The consultations then during the year 2004, were mainly preliminary and very initial in nature and
served mainly to inform the would be PAPs that their land might at some point be acquired to pave
way for the construction of a sub station. During this period, staff from Electrogaz and UERP/PCU
periodically made visits to the project site with the aim of making the PAPs of the possible
relocation. However, because of the slow progress in implementation of the UERP, in spite of this
very early knowledge by the PAPs that their land would be acquired, realistic and fruitful
discussions were not achieved until 2006.     In effect the process of compensation was not started
all over again, but remained a continuously slow effort until when the EA came on board and
finalised the process as per the requirements of the World Bank and Rwanda laws on land.




                                                                                                    5

The total size of land is that has been duly surveyed and found to be adequate in size for the
construction of this substation is 28,853.604 m2 (2.88853604 ha) in size.              The PAPs will be
compensated for 2.721 ha and the remaining 0.16ha is land that is owned by Electrogaz as part of
the way leave where an existing transmission line passes. It should be noted that one of the PAPs
has actually constructed a house for rental under the existing transmission line which is against the
regulations for building. It is this extra land within the way leave that sums up the total land size to
(2.88853604 ha).

The tables below provide a summary of the total compensation for each of the PAPs for their land
that is targeted for acquisition, the existing structures and inherent crops.

which already set aside funds to cater for the resettlement and compensation costs of this nature
within the UERP.

The Safeguards Advisor would like to present this report to the World Bank as an Abbreviated
Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) document.        This is mainly because the adverse impacts of the
project on the entire displaced population are minor.       Fewer than 200 people will be displaced
(economically or physically) in this site.

As a matter of fact, only one household will be physically fully and physically displaced from the
project site and will end up loosing all of the land. The existing church members will also end up
loosing all the land where their worshiping structure sits and will have to relocate elsewhere. The
other two remaining households will only loose a portion of their land and will In effect only suffer
from economic displacement.

It is for this reason that this report does not comply with the full requirements required in the
preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) but instead conforms to the requirements for
preparing an ARAP.

DESCRIPTIONOFTHEPROJECT

The Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP) through the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)
has identified a site where it wants to install a substation for electricity transmission by Electrogaz
of Rwanda. Substations are essential for the smooth running of any electrical system. They are the
point where high voltage electricity is reduced (or "stepped down") into lower voltage electricity
suitable for distribution into commercial and residential areas.   The proposed Birembo sub station
will basically play the role if stepping down the high voltage electricity into low voltage and then to
be distributed to the commercial and residential areas in Kigali.

Administratively the site for the proposed sub station is situated in the province of Kigali City, in the
District of Gasabo, Kinyinya sector in the Gasharu 1 cell. The actual project site is close to the
Deustche Welle broadcasting station along a dusty murram road interspersed with rural villages
and households.

The project will involve the construction of a new 110/15 kV sub station at the Birembo site. The new
Birembo substation will be in the final stage the main substation of the national grid and the main
feeder substation for the Kigali distribution system. On the 220kV and 110kV level it will be an
outdoor substation; the 15kV level will be of the indoor type.

The substation will be erected in three main stages:

STAGE 1
This will involve the construction of a 110/15 kV substation with one 110 kV line bay, one 110/15kV
transformer bay and one 110/70 kV autotransformer bay. The substation will be connected to the
overhead line Jabana ­ Gasogi.

From this indoor substation two 15 (30) kV double circuit lines, length 7.5km, will go in direction of
Rubungo and Remera to connect the existing 15kV network of the surrounding areas north east of
the town center (area of Kacyiru, Kibagabaga, Rubungo, Nyabisindu, Kimironko, Nyarutarama, etc.

STAGE 2
This will involve the extension of the Birembo substation by an additional 110kV line bay for the
interconnection with Uganda and an additional transformer 110/15kV (TR2).

STAGE 3
This will involve the extension of the Birembo substation by a 220kV substation with one line bay
and two 220/110 kV power transformer bays for the interconnection on the 220kV level with
Tanzania.      Also there will be a further extension of the 110kV substation by two bays for
connecting the power transformers 220/110kV.

Note: Only Stage 1 will be part of the contract, however areas for future extensions areas for future
extensions (Stage 2 and Stage 3) should be availed.




                                                                                                       8

BIREMBOSUBSTATION­STAGE1

The new substation will be constructed on a free area outside the town of Kigali in the north close
to the tower 198 of the 110(70) kV overhead line from Jabana to Gasogi. The GPS coordinates of
the tower 198 are:


                    Zone                         East                       North

                    36M                         180264                     9788846


The substation will be looped in to the 110kV line coming from Jabana substation and continuing
via Gasogi, Musha, and Rwamagana to Kabarondo as a 70kV line. In the final layout, the
substation will be the main substation of the national grid and the main feeder substation for the
Kigali distribution system. The conductor of the 110kV line is ACSR 138/22, the shield wire S35.

The new substation shall be of a conventional open air type (AIS) for the 110 kV voltage level and
of an indoor SF6 insulated switchgear type (GIS) for the 15 (30) kV level.




                                                                                                 9

PROPOSEDACTIVITIES

Design and Planning Phase
During the design phase of this project, the expected activities some of which have already
occurred include:

Site Selection
Identification of a proper site for the construction of the substation.     This has already been
undertaken and the Birembo site has been identified as a suitable site for the sub station.

Land Acquisition /Compensation
The land in question must be acquired for purposes of construction and for this reason; the (PAPs)
who will loose their land will have to be compensated as required by the World Bank and
Government of Rwanda. Compensation for land will be based on the current land rate values.

Construction Phase

Excavation of land during civil works
Civil works including stripping of the land, excavation and installation of equipment is largely
expected to occur.     However this is expected to occur only after the PAPs have been duly
compensated and resettled with approval from World Bank.

Installation of the sub station
This will involve the construction of a 110 kV substation will be of the open air type with a double
tubular busbar system, inline layout. Under the present project, only three busbar sections for one
busbar need to be erected. However, the necessary gantries shall be erected for a double busbar
system.

The stage 1 is equipped with the following feeders:

         ·       One (1)110kV line bay to Jabana substation
         ·       One (1) transformer bay for transformer 110/15 kV
         ·       One (1) transformer bay for transformer 110/70 kV
         ·       One (1)110 (70) kV line bay to Gasogi

The future 110 kV substation extensions shall be indicated on all drawings and single line diagrams
as future installations and the detailed planning must take into account the foreseen future
extensions.

The design shall be such as to leave space for the future feeders as well as for installation of the
second busbar without relocation of any equipment. The future bays and the 110 kV installations
shall be included in the design and marked as "Future".

15 (30)kV Switchgear


                                                                                                 10

Urgent Electricity Rehabilitation Project (UERP)                            Resettlement Action
Plan



      · The 15 kV substation will be of the indoor type, composed of the following cubicles:
      · two (2) incoming transformer feeders for transformer 110/15 kV
      · one (1) bus coupler
      · three (3) overhead line feeders
      · one (1) equipped spare feeder for overhead line
      · one (1) station supply feeder

The 15 (30) kV switchgear room shall be designed such as to have space for at least 2 additional
feeders for each busbar side (total 4 additional feeders). All necessary cut outs in the floor slab of
the switchgear room shall be provided.

There will also be construction of a transformer bay, cable overhead feeder, transformer incoming
feeder, station supply feeder and line bay to Jabana among others.


Operation Phase
During operation phase the expected activities include, operation and maintenance of the
transformers, circuit breakers, circuit switches and capacitors that will have been installed during
the construction phase. Sub Station buildings will also be constructed as described above, as well
as other instruments and devices that ensure the efficient functioning of the system.

POTENTIALADVERSEIMPACTS

Loss of Land
The proposed construction of the sub station in the Kinyiya area, Birembo site will have adverse
impacts in terms of activities that will trigger off resettlement of the local communities living or
utilizing the land for different reasons in the selected project area. This is because the acquisition
of land for the project will lead to the physical displacement of some of the households living in the
project site and or utilizing the land for economic purposes. In the execution of this project, land will
be acquired which will lead to the individuals in the identified site to be resettled.

Destruction of Vegetation
The civil works activities during the construction will entail clearing of the vegetation inherent in the
project site which includes fruit trees, normal tress, grass and crops that have been planted and or
cultivated by the PAPs.

Other Impacts will be those related to Occupation Health and Safety of the workers during the
construction and operation of the sub station.

Size of Land expected to be Acquired
The project will only acquire approximately 2.885304 ha of the existing land area for which is
currently under different uses and separately owned by four individuals one of the owners being a
church.

Land Ownership
The identified site and land for the construction of the substation is owned by four different
individuals who have the legal right over the different pieces of land. They include:

OBJECTIVESOFARAP

The main objective of this Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan is to compensate the PAPs for the
loss of land that will be acquired from them to pave way for the construction activities and eventual
installation of the substation.

There will also be compensation for the structures and crops including tress that are inherent in the
project site that will be destroyed or cleared in the process. The persons (families) to be
compensated have been meaningfully consulted and have been given several opportunities to
participate in planning and implementing of the compensation programs.




DOCUMENTATIONOFHOLDINGS
ANDASSETS

Electrogaz through the UERP/PCU has engaged the local community leaders in the area in
discussing the compensation process. Using qualified land surveyors and valuers, UERP/PCU has
already undertaken a complete and detailed inventory of all the assets of the PAPs in the land to
be acquired, total land holdings including necessary personal information of the same.

This information has been confirmed and witnessed by the BIZIMANA Emmanuel, secretary
general of the Kigali City Council. The information has also been witnessed by the office of Good
Governance at the district level and duly countersigned by the PAPs as a true reflection of the
same. The UERP/PCU with the assistance of the Safeguards Advisor is developing a database for
keeping all this information including the relevant signed records and copies.

Determination of Cut Off Date
The entitlement cut-off date refers to the time when the assessment of persons and their property in the
identified project areas are carried out, i.e. the time when Electrogaz has identified the land sites it would
need and when the socio-economic study is taking place. Thereafter, no new cases of affected people will
be considered.

The cut off date was determined through a meeting with the PAPs and the representatives of Electrogaz
soon after the census survey if the assets within the project site were finalized. The census survey ended in
January 2007 and therefore the 31st January 2007 was agreed t o be the cut off date.

Unfinished structures were also identified and secured during this period and unused materials were piled at
the site so that the cut ­off survey could estimate investment which should be compensated for in lieu of
expenses (including labor) incurred until the cut ­ off date.


Magnitude of expected loss
The magnitude and impact of the expected loss can be termed as fairly significant especially
because most of the land targeted for acquisition is in a fairly densely populated area and is mainly
utilized by the PAPs for shelter, keeping of livestock under zero grazing and cultivation of crops
and fruit tress as well as normal trees.



                                                                                                          15

Plan




The individuals (PAPs) who will loose their land that is currently under utilization for livestock
keeping and crop cultivation own adjacent parcels of land in the vicinity of the project site and have
already agreed to move their cowsheds and pens further down after and when the compensation
occurs. The existing Seventh Day Adventist church in the project site has all through been
engaged in consultation by the UERP/PCU and through its members accepted to relocate after
finding an alternative piece of land for which they are already in discussions with the owner to
purchase and set up another church once compensation occurs.

The only significant loss of land will be the widowed woman (Mrs. NYIRAHITIMANA Zanabia) who
in the process of land acquisition will contend with the loss of her shelter and that of her 4 children.

In terms of compensation then, care will be taken to ensure that the widowed woman is facilitated
in identification of a new parcel of land very quickly and assistance provided in helping her to put
up a new shelter.

Note* Mrs Nyirahitiana Zanabia after being informed of the interest of Electrogaz to acquire her
piece of land for construction of the sub station decided on her own even before compensation to
demolish her mud walled single house on her own accord and moved to a different nearby rented
house.

Information on vulnerable groups or persons
The widow Mrs. NYIRAHITIMANA Zanabia will require special provisions due to her vulnerability
as a widow firstly and secondly as the single head of a household. She is going to loose her house
(dwelling unit) due to the land acquisition and will require identification of another land to be
resettled and have her new house constructed. It should be noted that only Mrs. NYIRAHITIMANA
Zanabia will be supported with funds to construct a new house, the rest of the 3 PAPs will not be
provided for this because they are not considered vulnerable.      They do not also use the targeted
land for personal housing but have rented out these dwellings.

This  section   describes   the methodologies    that  was   used   to value   losses   and  determine
replacement costs      as well as the roles of the different institutions and        PAPs    during the
determination of compensation process.

Land Measurements/Valuation
The UERP/PCU has used the Kigali City Urban Planning Department professional land surveyors
to measure the different individual parcels of land that will be acquired for construction of the
substation. The total size of land is 28,853.604 m2 (2.88853604 ha) in size. The individual parcels
of land which have been identified for acquisition and makes this total figure is as follows:



                                                                                                     16

Size of Land Owned: Mrs. NYIRAHITIMANA owns land which is 1,064m2 (0.1064 ha) in size.

Size of Land Owned: The Seventh Day Adventist Church owns land which is 1543, 5 m2 (0.15435
ha) in size.

Size of Land Owned: Mr. KAMALI owns land which is 11460m2(1.1460 ha) in size.

Size of Land Owned: Mr. NSANZABAGANWA owns land which is 13125, 3 m2 (1.31253 ha) in
size.

The process of taking measurements of the land to be acquired by Electrogaz was done in full
presence of the PAPs and thereafter verification was done to ensure agreement in sizes recorded.
The PAPs were informed of the day that the land measurement would be done and informed to be
present on that day. The unit of land measurement was done in m2 and later converted into
hectares. After the measurements, the PAPs were told to verify the same and eventually signed a
document indicating that indeed the size of land measured is correct.

Roles of the UERP/PCU during Land Measurements
The UERP/PCU played an oversight role in monitoring and ensuring that the process of surveying
the land was done in an open and transparent manner and in the presence of all the PAPs.        The
UERP/PCU informed the PAPs advance and within adequate time on the dates when the survey
and measurements would be done and insisted upon the presence of the PAPs in all these
meetings.

Roles of the PAPs during Land Measurements
The primarily role of the PAPs during the process of measuring land was to be physically present
and ascertain that indeed the measurements were correct and to their satisfaction.       They upon
being adequately satisfied that these measurements were correct appended their signatures as
proof of satisfaction with measurements.

Roles of the Kigali Town Council during Land Measurements

The Kigali City Urban Planning Department of Land Surveyors was the institution contracted by the
UERP/PCU to undertake measurements, survey and valuation of land targeted for the construction
of the substation.  The role of this department was to take physical measurements of the land in
the presence of the PAPs and UERP/PCU and use this to demarcate the size of land to be
acquired and determine parcel of land of each of the 4 PAPs.       The department then produced a
map highlighting the total size of land to be acquired which it then submitted to the UERP/PCU.

Compensation for Land
The valuation of the existing land has already been done by qualified land valuers from the
department of Urban Planning of Kigali City Council.     Valuation was undertaken using the current
land rates for the area. At the time of valuation the land value rates was ranging from 1,500-2,000
FRW per m2.       Through dialogue the PAPs accepted to be compensated at a value of 1,500.00
FRW per m2.

The Kigali City Council-Department if Urban Planning is the principal agency that undertook the
process of land valuation using its staff. The value of land for compensating the PAPs was arrived
at by comparing with the existing land value rates in Kigali which at that point in time was ranging
between 1,500-2,000 FRW per m2.

The new law on land ownership especially private land in terms of compensation and acquisition in
Rwanda provide for negotiations over the value of land during acquisition as a preferred means for
arriving at a common agreement.       In other words, PAPs are accorded room to negotiate for the
best price for their land after being made aware of the current existing market land rates.     It is
through negotiations between the PAPs and the UERP/PCU, Electrogaz and Kigali City Council
that 1,500 FRW per m2 was arrived at as the compensation figure.

The land owners/PAPs will therefore be compensated for loss of land at the above rates.         The
PAPs have been informed of how this calculation for compensation has been done and it has been
agreed that compensation to the PAPs will be in cash.       The PAPs have already appended their
signatures willingly and in the presence of the local government authorities on documents prepared
and that show how much parcel of land they own that will be acquired and how much that will
translate into cash based on the current land valuation rates.

The table below is a tabulation of the cash compensation that the PAPs will get from the loss of
land that will be acquired for construction of the sub station.   The compensation rate per m2 is
FRW 1,500.00 per m2. The appendix section of this report contains copies of the PAPs indicating
their agreement to their size of land and total compensation.      They have also duly signed this
document showing the total compensation cost for each PAP in the presence of Engineer Ruzibiza
Modest, the Estate Manager from Kigali Town Council.

Compensation for Buildings and Structures
The PAPs will also be compensated for the loss of buildings and structures available in the project
site at the time of establishing the Cut-Off Date.    Of the four PAPs only Mrs. NYIRAHITIMANA
Zanabia (a widow) whose house used primarily as a shelter for her entire family will be completely
destroyed and in effect, she will have full compensation as well as the construction of a house too.

The 3 remaining PAPs do not use their houses for sheltering their families. The first structure is a
church for which full compensation will be provided but a similar church will not be constructed for
them.

The other remaining 2 PAPs will also be fully compensated for structures but there will be no
rebuilding of structures. This is because they use the structures to rear livestock. In other words
the structures are zero grazing units and not family shelter.



Structures and buildings owned by the PAPs are as follows:

Consultations with PAPs on Acceptable Alternatives.
Several and regular consultation meetings have been held with the PAPs to discuss issues related
to resettlement and compensation.         The discussions can be traced back to 2004 when the
UERP/PCU held frequent meetings with the local communities at the Birembo site informing them
about the planned projects. For that matter ever since during this time, the local communities have
been fully aware of the intentions of Electrogaz to establish a sub station and the related process of
land acquisition.

Upon identification of the households that would be affected by the project, the UERP/PCU staff
has   organized   several  meetings    with  the Kigali Town   Council   and  the  PAPs   to   discuss
compensation requirements and concerns.

Most recent meetings and consultations include:
September 2006 (26th). Meeting with the Vice Mayor of Kigali Town together with the PAPs to
discuss on how to proceed with the compensation upon signing of the agreement and contract
documents.

September 2006 (26th). Meeting with the office of good governance at the district level to inform
them about the plans of the PAPs to sell their parcels of land to Electrogaz. This office is charged
with the responsibility of holding meetings with neighbours of those intending to sell their land
before they do so.    The aim is to ensure that in the public interest all the neighbours are made
aware of this transaction and in effect act as witnesses.

Notification/Institutional Responsibility for Implementation and Procedures for
Grievances
The technical arm of the Kigali City Council together with UERP/PCU and Electrogaz notified since
2004 the PAPs and the relevant ministries and departments of the intention to acquire the plot in
the project area to construct a substation.

Grievance Redress Mechanism
The office of the mayor for the Kigali City Council and the Good Governance office at the district
level are the acknowledged institutions for which the PAPs have been made aware of as avenues
for expressing discontent and disapproval to the resettlement and compensation process. Further
to this, the PAPs will be effectively made aware that if they remain dissatisfied with grievance
redress mechanism from the office of the mayor and that of Good Governance, then the high court
or court of appeal of Rwanda remains an avenue for voicing these complaints.

Arrangements for Monitoring and Implementation schedule
The construction works for the substation is planned to start in September, 2007.            It mainly
includes such works as excavations, stripping of the earth, clearing of vegetation, fencing of the
site etc.

The table below illustrates the compensation implementation plan and responsible institutions that
are expected to oversee the implementation.

AGREEMENTONCOMPENSATION
ANDPREPARATIONOFCONTRACTS.

The UERP/PCU has already draft agreement for compensation and prepared contracts for
payments to the PAPs.       The UERP/PCU before compensating the PAPs explained to the PAPs
what will be compensated for whether in cash or kind. This has been done by listing all the assets
and land to be compensated at the current value and the PAPs have already appended their
signatures on these documents approving the same.

UERP/PCU has now drawn a contract containing all this information and compensation already
made in the presence of the affected parties, community leaders, and officials from Electrogaz and
representatives from the local district administration. See Annex for signed contracts.




COMPLETIONREPORT

A completion report of the entire resettlement process for this project will be prepared and will include a
hand over certificate which will ostensibly provide a verification of when the compensation and assistance
were undertaken and to whom these services were provided as well as to indicate that indeed all the
compensation has been delivered.



MONITORINGANDEVALUATION

Monitoring and evaluation of the RAP will be carried out during the whole process the land
acquisition  and    the  compensation       to ensure    that   the   objectives  are  met   and    successful
implementation of the ARAP occur. The monitoring and evaluation will involve both the internal and
external monitoring.

Internal monitoring will be carried out by the UERP/PCU, assisted by the Safeguards Advisor, to
ensure that all of the responsible implementing agencies follow the schedule and comply with the
principles of the RAP.

For proper supervision, UERP/PCU will engage the safeguards advisor to undertake resettlement
supervision, monitoring and evaluation for the project.

The UERP/PCU will through the assistance of the safeguards advisor develop an internal
monitoring framework to supervise the compensation activities. The UERP/PCU Project office will
maintain the basic database of land acquisition, and compensation.
