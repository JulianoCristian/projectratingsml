distribution networks for\n            electricity in Kigali and precisely in Gasabo district with\n            the sole purpose of increasing access to electricity to the\n            residents of Kigali thereby enhancing growth and trade\n            through energy access. Negative impacts include: destruction\n            of vegetation and crops, temporary and permanent land loss,\n            localized soil erosion, localized dust related and noise\n            impact during construction, borrow pit impacts, workers\n            health and safety, bird strikes/collusions, and aesthetics\n            and visual related impacts. Mitigation measures include: 1)\n            avoid siting lines through protected areas, other\n            environmentally sensitive areas or through mature forest\n            stands; 2) string conductors under tension to minimize\n            potential damage to remaining ground vegetation; 3) borrow\n            pit areas (if any) should avoid other non site areas; borrow\n            areas should be reworked to blend into the surroundings.\n            Re-vegetation should be performed using local plants. All\n            slopes and working surfaces should be returned to a stable\n            condition; 4) the entire workforce of the plant should be\n            trained in the use of protective gear, handling of electric\n            safety equipment, fire protection and prevention, emergency\n            response and care procedures. Training given to the\n            employees should be backed by regular on- site training in\n            safety measures; 5) the construction site for the 4 mini\n            substations must contain fire fighting equipments of\n            recommended standards and in key strategic points all over\n            the site. At minimum at least, carbon dioxide systems, and\n            portable fire extinguishers should be installed in the cabin\n            construction site; 6) the contractor should engage a refuse\n            handling company to remove the wastes from the site to the\n            recommended waste disposal site; 7) the project routing has\n            been designed to avoid any ecologically sensitive areas\n            especially wetlands.  In cases where the route will cut\n            across a wetland, minimal disturbance should be observed; 8)\n            the contractor should aim to keep to areas of lower\n            elevation as far as possible, in order to minimize the\n            visual impacts associated with the proposed Transmission\n            line; and 9) dust-suppression techniques should be used\n            along gravel roads, when required."}, "docdt": "2010-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
