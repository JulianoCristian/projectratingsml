        Project aims to measurably improve the adequacy, efficiency,\n            and quality of power supply in the existing network, secure\n            Rwanda's future energy supply, by supporting the\n            development of domestic resources (methane gas, hydro, or\n            other), and, establish a rural energy program framework,\n            including rural electrification and

measures include: a) monitor air quality and warn\n            communities when air commissioning quality is poor and could\n            adversely damage their health; b) fuel transportation should\n
