{"cdata!": "The Structural Adjustment Loan Project\n            will be in support of structural adjustment policies\n            adopted, and to be adopted, by Turkey. These policies are\n            aimed at promoting: greater reliance on market forces and\n            less on direct state intervention and control; increased\n            export orientation; increased mobilization of domestic\n            resources; and a self-reliant State Economic Enterprise\n            sector having higher productivity and better management and\n            which sets prices sufficient to cover operating costs and\n            investment needs. The loan will finance high priority\n            imports to assist fuller utilization of productive capacity\n            in agriculture and industry. For agriculture: plant\n            protection chemicals and raw materials and fertilizer raw\n            materials ($100 million). For industry: steels, special\n            steels, steel products, tin, tinplate, copper, aluminium,\n            petrochemicals and other chemicals ($100 million). Turkey\n            will provide complementary funds (at least $30 million)\n            towards spare parts for industries. Private sector firms\n            would receive at least $65 million from the loan, and 33\n            percent of the total $230 million of Government and Bank\n            funds. The loan would be disbursed in three tranches."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
