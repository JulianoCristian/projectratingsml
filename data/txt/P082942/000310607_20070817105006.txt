F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives:

The objective of the first Petroleum Technical Assistance Project (PTAP I) was to provide,
through the engagement of experienced industry consultants, just-in-time support to the
Government of Timor-Leste on a set of critical, complex, and difficult negotiations with
neighboring countries and oil companies in the petroleum sector and on the parallel drafting of a
legal framework for the sector. The overall outcome to which the Project was expected to
contribute included the successful completion of negotiations and legal drafting resulting in the
commitment of major investments to the sector. Agreements and legal texts were to be consistent
with international best practice.

Building on achievements under PTAP I, the objective of the Second Petroleum Technical
Assistance Project (PTAP II) was to provide support to two key government divisions involved
in overseeing petroleum sector development: (i) the Timor Sea Office (TSO) in the Office of the
Prime Minister; and (ii) the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MoPF), specifically, the Timor
Sea Tax Division (TSTD) and, separately, a petroleum revenue management function. The TSO
had been the lead agency on all sector policy and strategic topics and was conducting the

                                                     5

international negotiations; the TSTD was facing rapidly escalating oversight demands; and there
was no office in the government charged specifically with the critical task of implementing a
petroleum revenue management strategy (this became the responsibility of the MoPF's
Macroeconomy and Tax Policy Unit). Funding for these areas was to focus on maintaining and
increasing capacity in core functions, including the retention and/or recruitment of essential
international advisers, the provision of programmed and just-in-time technical assistance, critical
operating costs (e.g., travel for essential tax audits), and the provision of selected infrastructure
for basic office functions. The intended outcome of the Project was to contribute to successful
and sustainable oversight of the petroleum sector in the areas of investment and project
development, sector policy and administration, and revenue collection and management.

Revised Project Development Objective (PDO):

Neither the PDO for PTAP I nor the PDO for PTAP II was revised.

 PDO           Over the long term, PTAP I was to contribute to successful completion of negotiations and
 Indicator:    legal drafting (with agreements and legal texts to be consistent with international best
               practice), resulting in commitment of major investments to the sector. Over the short term, the
               main objective was to support the government in its negotiations on Bayu Undan and Greater
               Sunrise, through the provision of expert technical and fiscal advice.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

Note: This ICR covers two small, closely related Projects: the First and Second Petroleum
Technical Assistance Projects to the Government of Timor-Leste.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Timor-Leste emerged as the world's youngest nation on May 20, 2002 after 24 years of control
by Indonesia. During and after the restoration of independence, severe civil unrest and violent
conflict persisted, and resulted in significant challenges for development. While the population at
the time of appraisal of the Projects was less than one million, the population growth rate was
one of the world's highest, making employment and poverty-reduction key objectives of Bank
assistance. The development of the petroleum sector was recognized as paramount to achieving
poverty reduction and reaching the Millennium Development Goals, and was also in accordance
with the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy, the Government's National Development Plan,
and the multi-donor Transitional Support Program, all of which emphasized careful management
of oil and gas revenues as a primary goal. In a few short years following the restoration of
independence, the petroleum sector was expected to contribute to roughly 50 percent of Timor-
Leste's GDP and 85-90 percent of government revenues (petroleum production and revenue
profiles are shown in Annex 10).

The Government of Timor-Leste faced tremendous challenges in managing its petroleum sector.
It severely lacked capacity to participate successfully in negotiations with companies and
governments over the development of offshore oil and gas fields shared with Australia,
particularly Bayu Undan and Greater Sunrise.2 Bayu Undan is a natural gas/gas condensates field
that lies wholly in the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA) agreed between Timor-Leste
and Australia under the Timor Sea Treaty signed by the two countries in May 2002 (a map of the
area is included in Annex 11). Under the Treaty it was agreed that revenues from the JPDA
would be split 90/10 in favor of Timor-Leste. Greater Sunrise, a larger natural gas field, lies
partially in but mainly outside of the JPDA, and thus agreements between the Governments of
Timor-Leste and Australia to "unitise" the resource and determine how revenues would be split
were also necessary. Lack of capacity also affected the Government of Timor-Leste's ability to
manage existing3 and future petroleum sector operations and associated revenues. Thus, World
Bank support to the government on the difficult, complex negotiations over shared petroleum
resources and in the building of sector capacity was crucial to laying the foundation for the
country to realize revenues from the development of petroleum resources, which would allow for
future poverty reduction.

In this context, shortly after the country re-gained independence in May 2002, the new
government and donor partners recognized the need for assistance to address pressing petroleum



2 The Sunrise and Troubadour fields, which lie in close proximity in the Timor Sea, are commonly known as Greater Sunrise, or
  are simply referred to as Sunrise.
3 Elang and Kakatua, two smaller, older fields, were under production and transferred to Timor-Leste upon the restoration of
  independence.

sector issues and to start building institutional and human capacity in the sector. As such,
USD240,000 of investment income from the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), administered by
the Bank, was made available for the first Petroleum Technical Assistance Project (PTAP I).
This small amount of funding was designed to provide targeted, expert advisory assistance to the
government in support of negotiations with Australia over oil and gas fields in the Timor Sea.
Additional TFET investment income, in the amount of USD1.7 million, was directed to a Second
Petroleum Technical Assistance Project (PTAP II). Though still a small amount of funding
relative to the revenue expected to accrue to the country as a result of the Project's support,
PTAP II continued support for advisory/technical assistance while expanding in scope to include
funding for collection of tax revenues from petroleum sector operations; training of local staff in
relevant sector institutions; and critical operating costs and basic office equipment for key sector
institutions (since petroleum revenues were not yet significant). In accordance with TFET
procedures, both Projects were approved by the Regional Vice President.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of PTAP I was to provide, through the engagement of experienced industry
consultants, just-in-time support to the Government of Timor-Leste on a set of critical, complex,
and difficult negotiations with neighboring countries and oil companies in the petroleum sector
and on the parallel drafting of a legal framework for the sector.

Building on the achievements under PTAP I, the objective of PTAP II was to provide support to
two key government divisions involved in overseeing petroleum sector development (i) the
Timor Sea Office (TSO) in the Office of the Prime Minister; and (ii) the Ministry of Planning
and Finance (MoPF), specifically, the Timor Sea Tax Division (TSTD, later known as the
Petroleum Tax Division), and, separately, a petroleum revenue management function. At the
time, the TSO was the lead agency on all sector policy and strategic topics and was conducting
the international negotiations; the TSTD was facing rapidly escalating oversight demands; and
there was no office in the government charged specifically with the critical task of implementing
a petroleum revenue management strategy (the MoPF's Macroeconomy and Tax Policy Unit
took up this responsibility). Funding for these areas was to focus on maintaining and increasing
capacity in core functions, including the retention and/or recruitment of essential international
advisers, the provision of programmed and just-in-time technical assistance, financing of critical
operating costs (e.g., travel for essential tax audits), and the provision of selected infrastructure
for basic office functions.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

Neither the PDO for PTAP I nor the PDO for PTAP II was revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured
in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the Project)

Beneficiaries identified under PTAP I included senior government officials in the TSO who were
responsible for the success of the Bayu Undan development plan and Greater Sunrise unitisation
negotiations. Their capacity was to be strengthened through collaboration with expert consultants

population of Timor-Leste was also cited as a beneficiary due to the revenues expected to accrue
to the country as a result of successful negotiations.

Beneficiaries identified under PTAP II included the officials in the TSO and staff in the MoPF
responsible for coordination of petroleum sector activities, including follow-on from the
negotiations, particularly in regard to Bayu Undan production coming on stream. Their capacity
was to be strengthened through training and continuing collaboration with expert consultants
providing legal, auditing, financial management, media, and other advice/support. The entire
population of Timor-Leste was again expected to benefit considerably from the revenues
resulting from Bayu Undan and other gas development projects.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

PTAP I included one main component: strengthening the TSO, through the provision of legal,
technical, and economic assistance, including (i) support to negotiations with oil companies and
neighboring countries for the development of the Bayu Undan natural gas/gas condensate field;
(ii) technical and fiscal advice on negotiations with neighboring countries related to the
development of the Greater Sunrise natural gas field; and (iii) financial advice on projected Bayu
Undan and Greater Sunrise revenues.

PTAP II built on PTAP I, with the main component of strengthening the TSO and the MoPF,
including (i) strengthening the petroleum sector management, petroleum revenue management,
legal, technical, financial and auditing capabilities, and media and outreach functions of the TSO
and MoPF, through the provision of technical assistance; (ii) provision of training to local staff
of TSO in English and petroleum economics and commercial practices, and to local staff of
TSTD in tax accounting and auditing; (iii) acquisition of information technology and
communications office equipment for TSTD; and (iv) provision of logistical and operational
support to TSO and TSTD in petroleum negotiations, petroleum policy oversight, management,
information outreach, and auditing functions.

1.6 Revised Components

Neither the components of PTAP I nor the components of PTAP II were revised.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

No significant change to PTAP I was made. The PTAP II Grant Agreement was amended once,
to extend the Project closing date by one year and to add as a recipient agency the Ministry of
Natural Resources, Minerals and Energy Policy (MNRMEP), which was created after the Project
was approved and which housed the Oil and Gas Directorate.

Extension of PTAP II's closing date was pursued because a substantial undisbursed balance was
available under the Grant in late 2005 as a result of several factors: contingency funds provided
at the time of Grant signing became available when the tasks and positions for which they were
designed were either funded by other donor partners or deemed no longer necessary (due to the



                                                10

rapidly evolving nature of the oil and gas sector in Timor-Leste); the early departure of two key
international consultants to the TSO (the Coordinator and Financial Manager) freed funds under
the Grant since the departures came too late in the life of the Project to begin new recruitments
and since Timorese national staff were able to take up these functions at that stage; and
expenditures for activities by the TSTD were slow due to thin human resource capacity, which
was needed full time on work-related responsibilities. Extension of the Grant allowed the TSTD
to recruit additional local consultants to help address the latter issue.

The rationale for including MNRMEP as a Grant recipient, in addition to the TSO and MoPF, fit
with the Project's objective since the new Ministry, particularly its Oil and Gas Directorate
(which had existed previously under the Ministry of Environment) had become the government's
key technical agency responsible for managing the petroleum sector. In the end, due to a strong
program of bilateral support developed by Norway, the Oil and Gas Directorate did not avail
itself of funds under the Grant.

In accordance with TFET procedures, both Projects had been approved by the Regional Vice
President; in accordance with Regional procedures, the PTAP II Grant Agreement amendment
was approved by the Country Director.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Lessons of similar operations in other countries demonstrated the critical importance of strong
counterpart commitment and access to high-quality, sector-specific expertise. Both factors were
taken into account in the design of PTAP I and PTAP II, which were supported at the highest
levels of government, by the then Prime Minister, and which engaged highly-qualified industry
experts. In addition, the need for effective capacity in core policy, oversight, and coordination
functions was recognized as critical to the design of PTAP II. As such, a wider view of the sector
was taken than under PTAP I, and the close coordination with relevant donor partners initiated
under PTAP I was pursued.

Beginning with PTAP I, the rationale for Bank involvement was due to the fact that support to
the nascent Government of Timor-Leste in the petroleum sector was ad-hoc, short-term, and
seriously inadequate. A few donor partners, including the African Development Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and United States Trade and Development Agency
(USTDA), were providing limited amounts of funding to address specific needs but, at the time
that PTAP I and PTAP II were prepared, donor support to the petroleum sector was just 0.2
percent of the government's budget and less than three percent of donor flows to the country.
The need to define, properly fund, and coordinate a mid- to longer-term program of support was
recognized by the government and donor community. However, it was also recognized that, in
the short-term, "just in time" support to fill gaps would continue to play an important role.
Therefore, PTAP I was designed to fill an immediate need for petroleum commercial, legal, and
financial modeling advisory assistance.




                                                 11

PTAP II was designed to complement existing donor programs, filling a gap in support to the
TSO, which at the time was playing a critical role in international petroleum negotiations and
coordination of government efforts in the sector. The TSTD, responsible for the administration
and collection of tax revenues from petroleum companies, and MoPF's Macroeconomy and Tax
Policy Unit, which took up responsibility for preparation of budget projections based on
petroleum revenues, were also identified as key units lacking sufficient support. As such, they
were included as beneficiary agencies under PTAP II.

Both Projects also took into account the country's need to put in place the legal, contractual, and
fiscal regime to govern new petroleum developments in Timor-Leste's exclusive zone and the
parallel development of a new Petroleum Mining Code and Model Production Sharing Contract
(PSC) for the JPDA. While other donors financed the bulk of the legal drafting, the Projects
supported associated financial/fiscal modeling and information dissemination and sensitisation.

Through the process of Project preparation, the Bank also took a leading role in donor
coordination in the sector. The design of Norway's longer-term program of bilateral support
benefited from the sector coordination introduced by the Bank. Norway's program (initially, two
phases over six years) would focus on the provision and building of human resource capacity and
technical expertise in the Oil and Gas Directorate and would be implemented through in-situ
advisers who would provide on-the-job training to local staff, combined with longer-term formal
education/overseas training. USTDA funding (originally, less than one year) for advisory
assistance on the development of the petroleum sector institutional structure and preparation of
new petroleum legislation was also in place as was early funding from the African Development
Bank for a limited number of expert advisers (though both sources of funding ran their course
over the life of the Projects).

While no Quality at Entry (QAE) review was conducted for PTAP I, a QAE review undertaken
for PTAP II found it to be satisfactory. The review indicated that PTAP II had been prepared by
a strong team and that it had realistic objectives and implementation arrangements. The review
also noted that although PTAP II was of limited size and scope, it could have far-reaching
impacts on medium- to long-term development of the sector and the country's economy. Areas
in need of improvement flagged during the QAE review included the need for a longer-term
vision of capacity building and elaboration of the training program. The QAE was correct in
flagging these areas. Though PTAP II contributed substantially to capacity building in the sector,
this will remain a critical issue for some time to come since such capacity takes years to develop.
Project aide-memoires highlighted this issue regularly from the outset.

The main risk identified under PTAP I was the availability of funding for core TSO staff so that
the TSO could continue to coordinate Timor-Leste's participation in petroleum sector
negotiations. Funding was provided as necessary and thus this risk did not materialize. Given its
expanded scope, the main risk identified under PTAP II was lack of procurement capacity.
Advisory assistance in this area was provided and the risk was mitigated successfully.

2.2 Implementation
(including any Project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken,
as applicable)




                                                12

PTAP I was active for one year (December 2002 - December 2003) and implementation was
without incident. A small sum of USD3,863.07 was left undisbursed under the Grant. Since the
tasks for which it was originally intended had been completed and there was limited time to
reallocate the money prior to Project closing, it was decided to return the amount to TFET rather
than extend the Grant for this limited amount.

PTAP II was active for about three and a half years (July 2003 ­ December 2006) and
implementation was also without incident. The rapid developments in the sector over the period
of the Grant affected implementation, particularly in regard to the international consultancies
envisaged when the Grant was designed.

As provided for under the Grant Agreement, early on the TSO engaged qualified international
consultants in the posts of resident, international Legal/Strategy Adviser, resident international
Coordinator/Legal Adviser, resident international Financial Manager, resident international
Media Director, and international Financial Adviser. Initial consultant turnover affecting the
positions of Coordinator/Legal Adviser and Financial Manager were handled without significant
difficulty. When these consultancy contracts ended (end-January 2005 and end-March 2005,
respectively), the positions were not re-filled with international consultants because Timorese
national staff working in the TSO had sufficient capacity at that stage to handle these duties.
Likewise, when the contract with the resident, international Media Director ended (end-
December 2005) it was not renewed, and the Timorese Deputy Communications Director took
up the duties, with the help of a local Assistant Communications Officer.

The position of Legal/Strategy Adviser was dropped when this contract ended (end-June 2004)
as the TSO no longer required the expertise. The contract for the Commercial/Petroleum Law
Adviser was terminated once funds for the position were exhausted, which essentially coincided
with completion of the required services.

PTAP II also envisaged consultancies to the TSO for a Petroleum Fiscal Adviser and a Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) Adviser. An international consultant was engaged in the former position
during the first year of PTAP II; however, the tasks associated with this position were naturally
combined with the position of international Financial Adviser and the latter covered both
fiscal/financial modeling and revenue projections for the remainder of the Projects. The LNG
Adviser position was dropped as marketing arrangements for LNG production from the Bayu
Undan field were agreed sooner than expected and advisory requirements in this area were met
by consultants financed by USTDA. PTAP II also envisaged the possible need for a resident,
international Petroleum Negotiator, which was later deemed unnecessary given support to
commercial negotiations funded by USTDA.

PTAP II also envisaged funding a resident, international Lead Tax Revenue Adviser to the TSTD,
but AusAID extended funding for such a position under its program of bilateral support to the
MoPF, with Norway picking this up later. PTAP II supported a resident, international Tax Audit
Adviser and three local Technical Tax Officers to the TSTD. While the MoPF's Macroeconomy
and Tax Policy Unit benefited from training and other support under PTAP II, the IMF provided
financing for a Petroleum Fund Adviser to the unit; Australia also financed an Economic Adviser
to the unit, which was later taken up under the Norwegian program. Table 1 shows the main
consultants engaged under the Projects.

+Position deemed no longer necessary at end of contract. *Position taken up by local staff over the life of PTAP II.

Since not all of the consultancies initially envisaged under PTAP II were engaged, funds were
freed up for training activities that had not originally been planned. The expenditure category of
consultant services was underspent by about USD263,000 while the expenditure category of
training was underspent by about USD98,000. The rapid developments in the sector over the
Project period also affected spending on operating costs, which were higher than originally
envisaged, although expenditures on goods were lower. The lack of reallocation of funds among
expenditure categories under the Project was a weakness in Bank supervision, however it did not
negatively affect implementation as the Task Team Leader was able to approve the overruns as
all expenditures were legitimate.

The natural evolution of events in the sector saw TSO's role diminish as the negotiations on
Bayu Undan came to a successful conclusion for Timor-Leste. This resulted in the natural rise of
the Oil and Gas Directorate to oversee and manage petroleum sector operations as production
began in earnest, and to support, along with TSO, further negotiations on Greater Sunrise. This
shift, along with the program of bilateral Norwegian support that was fully under way by the
time PTAP II was closing, contributed to an undisbursed balance of approximately USD87,000
under the Project. Table 2 shows the final status of PTAP II disbursements.

Another relevant development over the period covered by the Projects was the establishment of
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Projects did not discuss EITI
explicitly because they were designed before the first international EITI conference in June 2003.
However, EITI was fully aligned with the petroleum revenue management arrangements and



                                                    14

good governance objectives being pursued by Timor-Leste in the petroleum sector, including the
establishment of a transparently managed Petroleum Fund that would collect all revenues
generated by petroleum sector operations. At the first international EITI conference, the Prime
Minister of Timor-Leste welcomed the opportunity to adhere to EITI, recognizing that it was in
line with the transparent petroleum revenue management arrangements that the country was in
the process of adopting. PTAP II provided support to the government's petroleum sector
transparency agenda, including for two sets of workshops with government and civil society on
Timor-Leste's petroleum revenue management arrangements.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Based on Project design, the monitoring and evaluation framework for PTAP I and PTAP II
included clearly stated, largely qualitative key performance indicators, which were linked to
PDOs and spelled out in the respective Project Appraisal Documents (PADs) and Grant
Agreements. The indicators related to the engagement of qualified consultants, progress in the
drafting of the sector legal framework and finalization of such legal texts, definition and
implementation of training activities, acquisition of relevant office infrastructure, expansion of
information outreach, start-up of negotiations on petroleum developments, and evidence of
expanded tax audits.

The Projects' results frameworks were not fully developed, with the most obvious omission
being the lack of milestones/targets against which to track progress on the stated indicators.
Nonetheless, since the Projects comprised small, targeted assistance, the indicators were
sufficient to gauge implementation progress and to determine whether the Projects were reaching
stated objectives. The set of indicators defined at the outset of the Projects remained relevant
over the life of the Projects.

Implementation progress under the Projects was assessed primarily during supervision missions.
Three supervision missions were undertaken for PTAP I and six were undertaken for PTAP II
(inclusive of a mission that combined PTAP I and PTAP II supervision). Detailed aide memoires
were prepared to address key developments in the sector over the course of the Projects (e.g.,
comments on the draft sector legislation). Project activity reports and records of financial
transactions were also used to cross-check implementation progress noted during supervision
missions.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

PTAP I and PTAP II were classified as environmental category C for safeguard purposes
because of their technical assistance nature. However, it was recognized that the technical
assistance provided under the Projects was designed to contribute to the development of the
country's oil and gas reserves, which would in turn lead to petroleum developments that would
have environmental implications. The Timor Sea Designated Authority (TSDA), the oversight
body for the JPDA where Bayu Undan is located, adopted high environmental standards, which
were based on the Australian environmental regime (the TSDA is now based solely in Dili and is
in the process of being transferred to Timor-Leste). In addition, in the Petroleum Act for its
exclusive zone, Timor-Leste included the need for petroleum prospecting or access authorisation
applications to include proposals relating to the protection of the environment, including



                                             15

preventing, minimizing, and remedying pollution, and other harm from petroleum operations.
Though outside the scope of the Projects, the challenge remains for Timor-Leste to build its
capacity to regulate environmental aspects of petroleum development. Existing international
assistance (e.g., via the Norwegian bilateral program) is helping Timor-Leste meet this challenge.

While certain weaknesses in the Projects' financial management system were noted in Project
audits, there were no major fiduciary issues under the Projects. The Project implementing agency
complied with all procurement and disbursement requirements. All opinions submitted by the
Project auditors were unqualified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation and Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and
next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Both the government and donor partners have expressed the desire that the Bank remain engaged
in the petroleum sector in Timor-Leste. Given the extensive program of Norwegian bilateral
support (which is expected to be extended for an additional four years) and the capacity
transferred to Timor-Leste with the move of the TSDA to Dili, follow-on assistance from the
Bank will be focused on supporting the country as it implements EITI; education, outreach, and
communications activities; and further strengthening the capacity of government and civil
society to understand the country's petroleum sector operations.

Going forward, activities would likely include supporting the country's multi-stakeholder EITI
working group as it undertakes and publishes its first EITI report and looks toward EITI
validation; additional workshops on Timor-Leste's petroleum revenue management
arrangements, for the newly-elected government and civil society; production and dissemination
of brochures and other easily understandable literature on the Petroleum Fund and the country's
petroleum revenue management arrangements; and the possible establishment of a publicly-
accessible petroleum information center. The Bank is also expected to contribute to additional
analytic work in the sector, including reviewing and commenting on key pieces of sector
legislation and regulations; to support to the government as discussions on the development of
Greater Sunrise evolve; and to continue coordination of donor assistance in the sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Project objectives were and remain consistent with the Bank's strategies to assist Timor-Leste.
The importance of the petroleum sector was recognized in the Bank's 2000 Transitional Support
Strategy (TSS), the prevailing document at the time the Projects were designed, and in the
follow-on 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Since petroleum revenue had started to flow
by the time the CAS was being drafted, and since sector institutions and legislation had evolved
to a more mature state than at the time of the TSS (due in part to assistance provided by the
Projects), the importance of and arrangements for managing petroleum revenues were
emphasized in the CAS. Project objectives were also consistent with country and global priorities,



                                                 16

both of which recognized the need for sound petroleum revenue management arrangements. The
government's commitment to the global EITI was evidence of this.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)

Both PTAP I and PTAP II PDOs were achieved and thus the Projects are assessed as satisfactory.
PTAP I received a final PDO rating in the Project Status Report of highly satisfactory given the
success of the support provided by the consultants to the Timorese petroleum negotiating team.
PTAP II received a final PDO rating in the Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) of
satisfactory in light of its achievements, but in recognition of the larger undisbursed balance
remaining under the Grant.

Over the longer term, PTAP I was expected to contribute to the overall outcome of successful
completion of negotiations and legal drafting (with agreements and legal texts to be consistent
with international best practice), resulting in the commitment of major investments to the sector.
Over the shorter term, PTAP I's main objective was to support the government in its negotiations
on Bayu Undan and Greater Sunrise, through the provision of expert technical and fiscal advice.
As such, all of the funding under PTAP I was directed to consultant services. In accordance with
the Grant Agreement, a large proportion of the funds were applied retroactively, to cover the cost
of consultants engaged to assist the government in the difficult, complex negotiations. The legal
advice and negotiations support provided by the Commercial/Petroleum Law Adviser were
crucial to the successful agreement on the PSC and gas development plan for Bayu Undan,
which allowed for the conclusion of negotiations on this field earlier than expected. This brought
Bayu Undan production on stream by early 2004, allowing Timor-Leste to capitalize on the
international rise in oil prices (to which gas prices are linked). As a result, the balance of Timor-
Leste's Petroleum Fund (which captures all revenues from petroleum operations flowing to
Timor-Leste) stood at just over USD1.2 billion at end March 2007.

The financial and fiscal modeling on projected Bayu Undan and Greater Sunrise revenues carried
out by the Financial/Fiscal Adviser initially engaged under PTAP I enabled the TSO negotiating
team to quantify the issues under negotiation. The TSO negotiating team relied on the financial
modeling in its strategy vis-à-vis Bayu Undan as well as the International Unitisation Agreement
(IUA) and Memorandum of Understanding for the Greater Sunrise gas field, which were signed
by the Governments of Timor-Leste and Australia in March 2003. The difficult negotiations on
Greater Sunrise, a larger field than Bayu Undan, and one that lies partly in but mainly outside of
the JPDA, continued under PTAP II. The result was an agreement between Timor-Leste and
Australia to split revenues 50/50 and to postpone discussions on the maritime boundary for 50
years. This was codified in the Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea
(CMATS) signed by the two countries in January 2006 and effective in February 2007. The
agreement paves the way for substantial additional revenue to accrue to Timor-Leste, once a
development plan for Greater Sunrise is agreed.

Over the longer term, PTAP II was expected to contribute to the outcome of successful and
sustainable oversight of petroleum sector investment and project development, sector policy and
administration, and revenue collection and management. Over the shorter term, PTAP II's main

objective was the completion of stakeholder consultations and presentation of the draft petroleum
regime, including revenue management legislation, to the Parliament.

PTAP II supported the finalization of the suite of petroleum laws--Petroleum Act/Model PSC,
Petroleum Taxation Act, and Petroleum Fund Law (detailing revenue management
arrangements)--to govern petroleum operations in Timor-Leste's exclusive zone, as well as the
finalization of the new Petroleum Mining Code and Model PSC for the JPDA. Drafts of the laws
were put out for public consultation in late July 2004 and comments from all stakeholders were
requested by late September 2004. In May 2005, an intensive workshop sponsored by PTAP II
was held with members of Parliament's Commission C, which was tasked with reviewing the
draft legislation in preparation for its presentation to Parliament. Over two days, the details of
each law were reviewed to increase the Commission's comprehension of the laws so as to foster
a more informed parliamentary debate. In June/July 2005, each of the laws was adopted
unanimously by the Parliament.

The outcome of this adoption was the establishment of a petroleum regime that is internationally
competitive in its terms and in line with international best practice. In many respects, the regime
sets new standards in regard to transparency and accountability in the management of petroleum
revenues and the reduction of the scope for discretionary or arbitrary use of such revenues. In
particular, the principle of transparency is codified in the Petroleum Fund Law. The law requires
the public release of non-confidential information. It further requires timely publication of
quarterly reports on the Fund's operations and activities (including the Fund's balance,
essentially the "revenues received" side of the EITI equation), publication of annual financial
statements, and independent audit of the Fund's fiscal year receipts and publication of the audit
report (including information on aggregate company payments, or the "payments made" side of
the EITI equation). An independent Consultative Council, which includes inter alia former high-
level government officials and representatives of civil society and the private sector, advises
Parliament on issues related to the Petroleum Fund (additional details on Timor-Leste's
Petroleum Fund and revenue management arrangements are included in Annex 12).

Through advisory assistance and training, PTAP II contributed to the building of institutional and
human resource capacity in the sector, allowing for successful oversight of petroleum sector
investment and project development, sector policy and administration, and revenue collection
and management. In particular, the successful oversight and management of the Bayu Undan
development allowed for substantial revenues to flow to Timor-Leste as described above. In
regard to revenue administration and collection, from 2004-2006 PTAP II financed a dozen trips
of TSTD staff to Perth, where ConocoPhillips's oversight office for Bayu Undan is located, for
petroleum tax revenue collection/tax audits. The total cost to PTAP II of these trips was
USD72,774.21; the total amount of revenue collected by TSTD over this period was
USD700,000,000. This revenue was channeled into the Petroleum Fund (and through the
Petroleum Fund to the budget). To date, the Petroleum Fund has been successfully managed in
accordance with the arrangements in the Petroleum Fund Law adopted by Parliament.

In addition to advisory assistance, training was critical to capacity building for sector oversight
and management. The training component of PTAP II included English language courses for
local staff in the TSO, TSTD, and Macro/Tax Policy Unit (essential as most of Timor-Leste's
petroleum-related business is conducted in English); petroleum economics and commercial

practices coursework for a key local TSO staff member; and training for TSTD staff in tax
accounting and auditing.

Since not all of the consultancies initially envisaged under PTAP II were engaged, more funds
than originally planned were available for training. In some cases, building of local staff capacity
happened more quickly than expected, which allowed local staff to take over duties originally
performed by foreign consultants much sooner than expected. In particular, the local TSO staff
member who pursued overseas training in petroleum economics and commercial practices was
promoted to Director of the TSO over the life of the Projects (he also pursued Portuguese
language coursework as Portuguese is one of Timor-Leste's official languages and is used in
government). Table 3 summarizes classroom-based (versus on-the-job) training under PTAP II.

MNRMEP's Oil and Gas Directorate, the Grant beneficiary added during the last year of PTAP
II implementation, did not end up accessing resources under the Grant. It had been intended to
allow local staff in the Oil and Gas Directorate to take advantage of training activities. However,
given the extensive program of Norwegian bilateral support to this office, this was not necessary.

While it is too early to judge the long-term sustainability of sector oversight and petroleum
revenue management arrangements in Timor-Leste due to potential future risks (see Section 4),
the track record to date has been impressive.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

No specific efficiency assessment was undertaken for PTAP I or PTAP II. However, the Projects
supported the Government of Timor-Leste in its negotiations over petroleum resources in the
Timor Sea, resulting in agreement on the development of the Bayu Undan field in the JPDA,
where revenues are split 90/10 in favor of Timor-Leste. Although not yet flowing, the agreement
to split revenues from the larger Greater Sunrise field 50/50 between Timor-Leste and Australia
is also a significant achievement. PTAP I and PTAP II total Project disbursements amounted to
USD1.85 million. Taking into account the revenues that are currently flowing to Timor-Leste
from its petroleum resources, for a combined investment of the Projects of just under USD2
million, Bank support helped the country reap the benefits of petroleum revenues amounting to
USD1.2 billion, which was the balance in the country's Petroleum Fund as of the quarter ended
March 31, 2007. This is over 600 times the amount of total disbursements under the Projects.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

Rating: Satisfactory

The satisfactory rating is based on the fact that under both Projects the PDOs were achieved and
the design of the Projects remained relevant. The overall impact of the Projects has been
significant. Not only were negotiations on the development of a key gas field--Bayu Undan--
concluded successfully, resulting in a substantial flow of petroleum revenues to the country, key
sector legislation, which encapsulates international best practice, was drafted and adopted after
highly participatory public consultations. As such, revenues have flowed in a transparent manner
into the Petroleum Fund as envisaged under the legislation. In addition, significant institutional
and human resource capacity in the sector was built.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As indicated in the PADs and Grant Agreements and noted in Section 1.4, the main beneficiaries
of the Projects were members of the government working in the petroleum sector. However,
petroleum revenues expected to flow as a result of support under the Grants would allow the
government to fund its budget and provide services to the population in an effort to reduce


                                                  20

poverty (there was no particular targeting with regard to gender or social groups under the
Projects). It is too early to evaluate fully the government's use of revenues. However, the
government has struggled to date to execute its budget fully. This is largely due to institutional
and human resource capacity constraints in key agencies outside of the petroleum sector. The
Bank is coordinating closely with donor partners and the new United Nations mission on efforts
to help the government improve budget execution. The Bank is also supporting and overseeing a
multi-donor Planning and Financial Management Capacity Building Program, which is targeted
at addressing the issue, and the Bank and other donors are reviewing existing portfolios and
available resources to determine how best to direct assistance to improve spending, particularly
on quick-disbursing, poverty-targeted programs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The Projects, particularly PTAP II, helped the government to strengthen its human resource and
institutional capacity in the petroleum sector. Consultants funded under the Projects helped to
train their counterparts "on the job," while overseas training funded under PTAP II provided
local staff with key knowledge of petroleum sector operations and tax collection/audit functions
and necessary language skills. While much remains to be done, capacity building efforts were
apparent even over the course of PTAP II: at the May 2005 workshop for Parliament's
Commission C, presentations on petroleum sector operations and the draft legislation were made
primarily by international consultants. During a similar workshop held for members of
parliament and representatives of civil society in November 2006, most of the presentations were
made by Timorese civil servants working in the petroleum sector. (In the case of the Oil and Gas
Directorate, this was also due to Norway's program of support.)

In the case of the TSO, the Director of the TSO at the close of PTAP II had started as a junior
staff member in the office at the start of the Projects. He took advantage of several overseas
training courses on petroleum economics and operations and availed himself of English and
Portuguese lessons. As such, he was able, midway through PTAP II, to take over the duties of
the international Coordinator/Adviser when her contract ended. Before PTAP II's end, he had
been promoted to Director of the TSO. Likewise, the junior, local financial management officer
received on-the-job and regional training and was able to take over financial management duties
under PTAP II when the international Financial Manager's contract ended. Finally, the local
Deputy Communications Officer in the TSO, who worked extremely closely with the
international Media Director and also benefited from English language training, took over as
Media Director during the last year of PTAP II.

While the TSTD remains understaffed relative to the amount of work if faces, human resource
and institutional capacity were strengthened under PTAP II through the provision of support for
additional local staff/temporary consultants to the office and the provision of necessary office
infrastructure. Support for staff to travel to Perth to conduct tax assessments and audits of
petroleum companies also helped to strengthen the institutional role of the office and reinforce
the revenue management arrangements adopted by the government.

The MoPF's Macroeconomy and Tax Policy Unit benefited from advisory assistance and
training, particularly from the Financial/Fiscal Adviser. However, this unit remains in need of



                                                 21

additional macroeconomic expertise to perform its duties now that petroleum resources are
growing substantially. This includes translation of petroleum revenues into budget projections
and analysis of macroeconomic implications of petroleum revenues. The Planning and Financial
Management Capacity Building Program being coordinated by the Bank aims to help address
this, but the government needs to devote due attention to the proper staffing and organization of
this unit.

The final Grant beneficiary, MNRMEP's Oil and Gas Directorate, did not avail itself of
resources under the Grant due to the extensive program of bilateral technical support and
capacity building provided by Norway.

Under the Timor Sea Treaty, the powers and functions of the TSDA are to be transferred to
Timor-Leste, either as part of MNRMEP or as a statutory authority. The TSDA began the
transition in 2006, with Darwin-based staff moving to Dili where the sole TSDA office is now
located. This provides opportunities for cross-learning and capacity building between MNRMEP
and TSDA staff. However, the government is in the process of drafting legislation for the
reorganization of the petroleum sector, to allow for the permanent transfer of the TSDA to
Timor-Leste and the establishment of a national oil company. This will also affect institutional
arrangements and sector capacity.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

None.

(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

Achievements in terms of success in negotiations, adoption of key legislation, extensive outreach
activities, collection of petroleum revenues, and institutional and human resource capacity
building under the Projects are significant. The Petroleum Fund is operational and being
implemented in accordance with arrangements spelled out in the law adopted for this purpose;
revenues from the Bayu Undan field are flowing, with the current production of LNG and gas
condensates; and the Government of Timor-Leste has conducted a successful, transparent
licensing round for exploration in its exclusive zone.

Risks to the sustainability of these outcomes are currently judged to be moderate. Though it
appears to be restricted to Dili and now relatively low-level, the continuing violence in the
country, which erupted in April/May 2006, is potentially destabilizing. It is also unclear what the
situation in the country will be following the end June 2007 parliamentary elections. While the
present petroleum revenue management arrangements are being implemented as envisaged, in
line with the laws enacted by the Parliament in mid-2005, the petroleum regime/revenue



                                                   22

management arrangements are still young. The new laws that are under preparation to govern the
transfer of the TSDA to Timor-Leste and establish a national oil company will affect institutional
and governance arrangements in the sector and may strain the limited sector human resource
capacity even further. In addition, the commitment of future governments to respect the
country's revenue management arrangements is unknown (e.g., as part of the election campaign,
some politicians have been calling for additional monies to be withdrawn from the Petroleum
Fund to address the country's dire needs).

Risks are being mitigated by the significant international assistance to the country. This includes
the Bank's support to the government's efforts to fully implement the EITI, the IMF's support to
the Banking and Payments Authority (and Treasury) in its management of the Petroleum Fund,
and Norway's strong presence and program of bilateral support to MNRMEP and other
governmental agencies involved in the petroleum sector. The United Nations mission and the
presence of international soldiers also serve to promote good governance and development and
mitigate the risk of return to full-scale conflict. As mentioned above, the Bank is working with
the government to help improve budget execution since the government needs to improve
substantially its capacity to spend (efficiently and effectively) the significant amount of
sustainable income that is already being channeled to the budget, before any consideration is
given to drawing additional monies from the Petroleum Fund.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Satisfactory

While no QAE review was conducted for PTAP I, as with PTAP II it was prepared by a strong
team. The design of PTAP I was based on two preparatory missions. During preparation, the
Bank undertook a thorough assessment of the status of the petroleum sector in Timor-Leste and
identified needs. The design team spoke with all relevant actors in the sector and collaborated
with donor partners to ensure that Bank assistance would fill gaps and complement
ongoing/planned assistance. Based on the Bank's assessment, the limited amount of funding
available under PTAP I was applied to the area most urgently lacking support.

The assessment undertaken for PTAP I laid the foundation for the design of PTAP II. During
PTAP II preparation, the status of the petroleum sector was again assessed by the Bank, in light
of rapidly evolving developments. Given the relatively larger amount of funding available, PTAP
II took a broader, longer-term view of the sector, again in the context of other donor assistance.
As discussed in Section 2.1, the QAE review conducted for PTAP II found it to be satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Satisfactory


                                                23

Supervision was without major incident in respect of procurement, financial management,
disbursement, and legal aspects. Three supervision missions were undertaken for PTAP I and six
were undertaken for PTAP II (inclusive of a mission that combined PTAP I and PTAP II
supervision). Supervision missions were comprehensive, assessing progress under Project
components and following broader developments in the sector. Bank dialogue with government
counterparts and donor partners was robust and frank. ISRs summarized mission findings while
detailed aide-memoires reflecting that status of activities and events in the petroleum sector were
prepared and shared with the government and donor partners. Observations during supervision
missions were cross-checked against Project activity reports and records of financial
transactions. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the lack of reallocation of funds among expenditure
categories under PTAP II was a weakness in Bank supervision of that Project, however it did not
negatively affect implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The design of the Projects was and remained
relevant to Timor-Leste's needs in the petroleum sector. Supervision was without incident.
Outputs/outcomes under the Projects were positive, meeting and in some cases exceeding
expectations (e.g., early conclusion of Bayu Undan negotiations, faster than anticipated local
capacity development in certain areas).

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Government performance under the Projects was satisfactory. The Borrower demonstrated
extremely strong commitment to the Projects, requesting that TFET investment income be put
toward assistance in the petroleum sector. The government's high-level commitment was further
demonstrated by placement of Project coordination in the Timor Sea Office in the Office of the
Prime Minister.

Government performance and commitment to progress in the petroleum sector was apparent
from its actions over the life of the Projects. For instance, the government demonstrated strong
participation in the negotiations on Bayu Undan and Greater Sunrise; it was closely involved in
the drafting of the legal, fiscal, and contractual regime for the country's petroleum sector and led
the public consultation process on the regime; and it took charge of successful implementation to
date of the petroleum revenue management arrangements adopted by Parliament.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory




                                                24

The TSO performed well all duties associated with the coordination and administration of the
Projects. The TSO coordinated implementation with TSTD and MoPF; engaged consultants and
procured goods in a timely manner and in accordance with necessary procedures; and submitted
regular financial monitoring reports to the Bank. All Project audits were unqualified.
Communication between the TSO and the Bank team was open and regular.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the government's performance as described above, overall Borrower performance is
rated satisfactory. All of the objectives of the Projects were met. The Borrower complied with all
legal covenants in the Grant Agreements.

6. Lessons Learned     (both Project-specific and of wide general application)

The Projects demonstrate the important role that "just-in-time" assistance can play in helping
countries develop their extractive industry resources (i.e., oil, gas, and mining). It is critical that
developing countries bring expert assistance to bear as they negotiate the development of such
resources with international companies and/or developed countries that have highly-qualified
technical staff, lawyers, and negotiators, to ensure that resources are developed in a manner that
benefits the country. PTAP I and PTAP II are testament to the fact that minimal, well-designed
and well targeted funding can have a substantial impact in this regard. While not exclusive to the
extractives sector the importance of engaging experienced industry consultants to assist countries
that do not yet have the necessary technical, legal, and negotiating skills is key, and usually well
worth the investment given the significant returns generated by resource revenues.

While just in time support can fill gaps and address urgent needs, a longer-term plan of support
and coordination among interested donor partners is necessary. Furthermore, training, capacity
building, and institutional development are critical. As mentioned previously, human resource
capacity building in the petroleum sector in Timor-Leste will be a long-term process, and thus
the Bank and other partners should continue to support sector capacity development.

                                   · Outreach Activities Pursued. With PTAP II support, the TSO developed an
                                     extensive program of outreach activities. Beginning in 2003, the Media
                                     Director and Deputy Communications Officer visited each of the country's 13
                                     districts to brief people on petroleum sector issues, including showing a
                                     documentary film, commissioned by TSO with PTAP II support, on the
                                     subject. The team also used media reports (radio, newspapers, etc.), the TSO
                                     and petroleum transparency web sites established by the government
                                     (www.timor seaoffice.gov.tp, www.transparency.gov.tl), articles in the
                                     widely-read children's educational magazine La'faek, and briefings with
                                     parliament, journalists and NGOs to communicate messages on developments
                                     in the petroleum sector.

                                   · Petroleum Regime Adopted. PTAP II continued support for the finalization of
                                     the suite of petroleum laws--Petroleum Act/Model PSC, Petroleum Taxation
                                     Act, and Petroleum Fund Law--to govern petroleum operations in Timor-
                                     Leste's exclusive zone, as well as the finalization of the new Petroleum
                                     Mining Code and Model PSC for the JPDA. Drafts of the laws were put out
                                     for public consultation by the government on July 24, 2004 via the internet. A
                                     subsequent public meeting was held in Dili August 23-25, 2004; comments
                                     from all stakeholders were requested by September 21, 2004. In May 2005,
                                     an intensive workshop, sponsored by PTAP II, was held with members of
                                     Parliament's Commission C, the Standing Committee on Economics and
                                     Finance, which was tasked with reviewing the draft legislation. Over two
                                     days, the details of each Act were reviewed to increase the Commission's

  comprehension of the laws so as to foster a more informed parliamentary
  debate. Parliament unanimously adopted the Petroleum Fund Law, which
  establishes  sound    and    transparent    petroleum    revenue    management
  arrangements, on June 20, 2005. This was followed by adoption of the
  Petroleum Taxation Act on July 5, 2005 and the Petroleum Act/Model PSC on
  July 29, 2005. The Petroleum Mining Code and Model PSC for the JPDA
  were approved by Timor-Leste and Australia on February 28, 2006.

· Further Agreements Reached. Continued support for financial/fiscal
  modeling for Greater Sunrise helped the government quantify the issues
  during the negotiations, resulting in a final agreement between Timor-Leste
  and Australia to split Greater Sunrise revenues 50/50 and to postpone
  discussions on the maritime boundary for 50 years. This was codified in the
  CMATS Treaty signed by Timor-Leste and Australia on January 12, 2006,
  and which entered into force February 23, 2007. While a development plan for
  Greater Sunrise has yet to be agreed, this could provide substantial additional
  revenues to Timor-Leste.

· Petroleum Revenue Management Arrangements Implemented. The principle
  of transparency is codified in the Petroleum Fund Law. Under the law, all
  revenues generated from Timor-Leste's petroleum resources flow into the
  Petroleum Fund and from the Fund to the State budget in accordance with the
  savings rule established in the Act. Since its passage, the revenue management
  arrangements have been implemented as envisaged. Quarterly reports on the
  Fund's activities and operations have been published as required, and the first
  independent audit of the Fund has been conducted (however, publication of
  the audit and the first annual report of the Fund have been delayed due to
  capacity constraints and preoccupation by the government with the crisis that
  erupted in April 2006). Due to the increase in international oil prices (to which
  gas prices are linked), revenues in the Fund grew much faster than expected.
  The Fund's balance reached USD1 billion by the Project closing date of
  December 31, 2006 and stood at just over USD1.2 billion as of March 31,
  2007.

· Successful Bidding Round Concluded.              On September 2, 2005, the
  government launched a bidding round for exploration rights in Timor-Leste's
  exclusive zone. With PTAP II support, representatives of the government
  undertook a petroleum sector "road show" in Singapore, London, Calgary,
  and Houston to showcase the acreage on offer, also in the JPDA. Bidding for
  the exclusive zone was closed April 19, 2006 and awards to ENI and Reliance
  were announced May 22, 2006; award of blocks in the JPDA were announced
  on August 16, 2006. Both rounds were conducted in a highly transparent
  manner.

· Petroleum Revenue Management Workshops Conducted. In follow-up to the
  successful workshop with Commission C, another set of workshops,
  sponsored by PTAP II, was held with members of parliament and
  representatives of civil society in Dili in November 2006. The workshops
  focused on petroleum revenue management from the wellhead to the budget.
  Unlike the earlier workshop with the parliamentary commission, where
  presentations were made mainly by international advisers, presentations at this
  workshop were given primarily by Timorese civil servants, demonstrating
  progress in the development of local capacity. While fewer members of
  parliament attended the workshop than was expected due to a
  miscommunication, the opening of the workshops was well attended by all
  levels of government, including the new Prime Minister, and civil society
  representatives from several districts participated.

                                    · Tax Audits Supported. PTAP II supported the conduct of tax audits by the
                                      TSTD. From 2004-2006, PTAP II financed 12 trips of TSTD staff to Perth
                                      (where ConocoPhillips's oversight office for Bayu Undan is located) for
                                      petroleum tax revenue collection/tax audits. This included 5 trips in 2004, 3
                                      trips in 2005, and 4 trips in 2006. The total cost to the Project of these trips
                                      was    USD72,774.21;      the   total  amount of revenue        collected   was
                                      USD700,000,000.
Provide training to local staff of Training Provided. Classroom-based training activities included:
TSO in English and petroleum       · English Language: 7 local TSO, Tax Revenue Service, and Macro/Tax Policy
economics and commercial              Unit staff attended English language courses (mainly in Dili, but some higher
practices, and to local staff of      level staff studied at more intense programs in Australia).
TSTD in tax accounting and         · Tax accounting and auditing: 16 local Tax Revenue Service staff (including 1
auditing.                             TSO staff) attended tax accounting and auditing courses in Jakarta.
                                   · Petroleum economics/commercial practices: 1 key staff member in the TSO
                                      pursued extensive overseas coursework (UK, Norway) in petroleum
                                      economics and commercial practices. The staffer also pursued Portuguese
                                      language coursework as Portuguese is one of Timor-Leste's official languages
                                      and is used in government.

                                   Capacity Built. Since not all of the consultancies initially envisaged under PTAP
                                   II were engaged, more funds than originally planned were available for training,
                                   which continued over the life of the Project. In some cases, building of local staff
                                   capacity happened more quickly than expected, which allowed local staff to take
                                   over duties originally performed by foreign consultants much sooner than
                                   expected. In particular,
                                   · The local staff member who pursued overseas training in petroleum
                                      economics and commercial practices, and who was in a junior position in the
                                      TSO when the Project began, was promoted to Director of the TSO over the
                                      life of the Project, taking over from the international Coordinator/Adviser
                                      when her contract ended in January 2005;
                                   · The local finance officer took over from the international Financial Manager
                                      when his contract ended in March 2005; and
                                   · The local Deputy Communications Officer took over from the international
                                      Media Director when his contract ended in December 2005.

Provide logistical and             Logistical and Operational Support Provided. As described above, PTAP II
operational support to TSO and     provided logistical and operational support for several activities related to
TSTD in petroleum                  petroleum negotiations, policy oversight and management, information outreach,
negotiations, petroleum policy     and auditing functions. These included:

                               (Project Implementing Agency)


I. ASSESSMENT OF THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES, PROJECT DESIGN AND
IMPLEMENTATION

A. Objectives and Project Components

The project objectives were to provide timely support, in the form of expert industry consultants,
to the Government of Timor-Leste in its negotiations with Australia and oil companies on
petroleum fields in the Timor Sea between Timor-Leste and Australia. The projects also
supported the drafting and consultation process on the legal framework for Timor-Leste's
exclusive zone and for the JPDA, information outreach on petroleum sector activities, training
for staff in the TSO, Petroleum Tax Division (formerly TSTD)/Timor-Leste Revenue Service
(TLRS), and the MoPF. With support from the projects, Timor-Leste was expected to complete
negotiations and put in place the legal regime so that major investments in the sector would
result. The projects also aimed to help build Timor-Leste's capacity for sector management and
oversight, through work with international advisers and training.

PTAP I was small (USD240,000), but critical, and thus there was only one component:

· Strengthening the TSO, through the provision of legal, technical, and economic assistance,
   including (a) support to negotiations with oil companies and neighbouring countries for the
   development of the Bayu Undan natural gas/gas condensate field; (b) technical and fiscal
   advice on negotiations with neighbouring countries related to the development of the Greater
   Sunrise natural gas field; and (c) financial advice on projected Bayu Undan and Greater
   Sunrise revenues.

PTAP II was larger (USD1.7 million) and thus was broadened to include four main components:

· Strengthening the petroleum sector management, petroleum revenue management, legal,
   technical, financial and auditing capabilities, and media and outreach functions of the TSO
   and MoPF, through the provision of technical assistance;




                                             34

· Provision of training to local staff of TSO in English and petroleum economics and
    commercial practices, and to local staff of TSTD in tax accounting and auditing;
· Acquisition of information technology and communications office equipment for TSTD; and
· Provision of logistical and operational support to TSO and TSTD in petroleum negotiations,
    petroleum policy oversight, management, information outreach, and auditing functions.

The projects were well designed, with Timor-Leste's sector needs take into account. The
projects were designed in close consultation between the Bank and the government, and with
other donors supporting the petroleum sector. In this way, the government was able to agree with
the Bank to apply the project funding to areas where there were gaps in assistance, so that the
funding could make a difference. Under PTAP I, support to the TSO was urgently needed and
the Bank's projects helped to address this. Under PTAP II, continued support to TSO, but also
PTD and MoPF, was also greatly needed.

B. Outputs/Outcomes/Achievement of Objectives

The projects met their objectives. PTAP I helped to fund two key advisers to the TSO, a legal
adviser and a fiscal/financial modeling adviser. Both consultants were key to the negotiations on
Bayu Undan and Sunrise. The eventual agreements reached between Timor-Leste and Australia
on these fields were informed by the consultants' advice and expertise, and the Timorese
negotiating team benefited greatly from their knowledge. With the help of the projects,
agreements reached, particularly the relatively quick agreement on Bayu Undan, ensured that
petroleum production came on line in time for Timor-Leste to benefit from high international oil
prices. As such, Timor-Leste had over USD1 billion in its Petroleum Fund by the end of March
2007.

The financial/fiscal modeling adviser continued to work with the team under PTAP II and was of
great assistance in helping the government model different scenarios during the negotiations, and
later to develop a model for Timor-Leste's revenue projections for its petroleum resources as
they were flowing.

Early consultants to the TSO--the Coordinator/Legal Strategy Adviser, Financial Manager, and
Media Director were a great help in running the office, supporting the Prime Minister as he
directed the negotiations, and liaising with consultants, key counterparts on the Australian side,
and donor partners. Timorese staff in the TSO were able to learn a lot from them. During PTAP
II, local staff members were even able to take over the positions of Coordinator, Financial
Manager, and Communications Director. Thus, human resource capacity had been built, both
through contact with the advisers and through training. The Audit Adviser to the PTD sponsored
by PTAP II was of great assistance in helping PTD deal with the overwhelming and challenging
workload in this area (worth much revenue to the country), and the local tax officers supported
by PTAP II helped the PTD cope with its growing workload.

Staff in TSO, PTD/TLRS, and the Macroeconomy and Tax Policy Unit benefited from training
activities, including English language training, which is essential for being able to work in the
petroleum sector. PTD/TLRS staff also benefited from tax accounting/auditing training. The
Timorese who is currently Director of the TSO was promoted to that position during PTAP II, in




                                              35

part because of what he learned through the training courses on petroleum sector operations,
petroleum economics, and so on sponsored by PTAP II.

PTD/TLRS and TSO also benefited from the acquisition of basic office infrastructure equipment
and communications equipment, without which the offices would not have been able to function
as effectively. Office equipment was particularly relevant for the PTD/TLRS liaison office
established in Perth so that revenue could be more easily collected from ConocoPhilips, the main
operator of the Bayu Undan field. With PTAP II support, PTD/TLRS staff were able to travel to
Perth to collect tax revenue due.      From 2004-2006, approximately USD700,000,000 was
collected.

PTAP I helped to kick off the drafting of the legal framework for Timor-Leste's exclusive zone
and the new legislation for the JPDA, agreed between Timor-Leste and Australia. PTAP II
supported the finalization of the laws, particularly a workshop with Commission C of the
Parliament, which was to review the laws (Petroleum Act and Model PSC, Petroleum Taxation
Act, and Petroleum Fund Act) first and present them to Parliament. PTAP II sponsored a two-
day workshop with the Commission in Baucau. The laws were discussed in detail, so that they
were understood by all. In the end, Parliament passed the laws unanimously, and now Timor-
Leste has an internationally competitive, attractive, and extremely transparent regime governing
its petroleum sector.

PTAP II also supported a series of visits to all districts in Timor-Leste, including remote villages.
The TSO team visited each place to tell the people about petroleum and what was happening
with Timor-Leste's petroleum. PTAP II funded a documentary film on the issues that was used
in the meetings with villagers. PTAP II also funded explanatory articles in the children's school
magazine La'faek, which is widely read. TSO also posted information on its web site, and the
Government established a petroleum transparency web site as well (www.timorseaoffice.gov.tp,
www.transparency.gov.tl).

In September 2005, after the laws for Timor-Leste's exclusive zone were passed and the new
legislation for the JPDA was about to enter into force, the Government undertook a petroleum
roadshow to showcase Timor-Leste's potential ahead of a planned exploration licensing round.
The roadshow successfully visited four major cities (Singapore, London, Houston, Calgary) with
PTAP II's help. The bidding round went well and was conducted in a transparent manner. Bid
winners were announced in the first half of 2006.

Commission C asked that another workshop be held, like the one it attended in Baucau, for other
members of parliament, the government, and civil society. Although there were delays with the
timing of the workshop, it was finally held in November 2006 in Dili. Many high-level members
of government attended the opening, which was done by the new Prime Minister, and many
participants from civil society came. The TSO/government really took the lead in organizing the
November 2006 workshop, relying much less heavily on internationals.

The Ministry of Natural Resources, Minerals and Energy Policy was eligible to receive support
from PTAP II, but other than to participate in the roadshow and the workshops, it did not do so
because it was benefiting from support from Norway.

C. Institutional Development Impact

While there is still much to be done, the projects helped the Government of Timor-Leste
strengthen its human resource and institutional capacity in the petroleum sector. Consultants
funded under the projects helped to train their counterparts on the job, while overseas training
funded under PTAP II provided local staff with key knowledge of petroleum sector operations.
As mentioned above, many of the local staff in the TSO were then able to take over from the
international consultants who were originally hired to work in the office. And, by the time of the
second workshop on petroleum revenue management issues, the government was squarely in the
lead.

The projects also helped to reinforce the institutional structure of the sector, which was only
coming together when PTAP I first started. PTAP support, plus support from other donors to the
sector, helped the institutions to take shape, to define their roles and functions, and to coordinate
amongst themselves.

II. LESSONS LEARNED

The Government concurs with the conclusion that just-in-time, expert assistance can play a very
important role in helping developing countries negotiate the exploitation of their extractive
industry resources. Governments that do not have expert assistance to counter that of developed
countries or sophisticated international oil companies will not be able to assert well their rights to
develop their resources.

The Government also agrees that while expert advisory assistance is needed, capacity building
for locals is very important, so that the sector will be sustainable and well managed. The
Government of Timor-Leste will continue to work with international development partners in
this regard, not only in the petroleum sector, so that capacity can be developed to manage all of
the countries resources well for the benefit of the people.

III. EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK AND OTHER DONORS

A. The World Bank

The Bank's performance was satisfactory. The Bank undertook a thorough assessment of Timor-
Leste's needs in the sector and designed support that was able to address these needs and result
in real benefits (in terms of petroleum revenues) to the country. Dialogue between the Bank and
the Government was good, and the Bank was an open, frank and valued partner in this endeavor.

B. The Government

The Government demonstrated its strong commitment to the assistance provided by the Bank in
the sector from the outset, with the Prime Minister leading the Government's involvement with
the projects from his office. The Government actively participated and took the lead in the
negotiations on petroleum resources. There were no major problems with the Government's
implementation of the projects, and the Government met all of its obligations in this regard
(fiduciary, procurement, legal, etc.).

Annex 11. Timor Sea ­ Joint Petroleum Development Area

Annex 12. Timor-Leste's Petroleum Fund and Revenue Management Arrangements

Building on the successful Norwegian model, the Government of Timor-Leste adopted a Petroleum Fund
Law and savings policy laying out a framework for
accountable     and   transparent    management      of             The Theory of the Savings Policy
petroleum revenues on a long-term, sustainable basis.
The law became effective in July 2005. The                 250
arrangements are consistent with the principles of         200
international good practice:                                                 Revenue
                                                           150

· A Petroleum Fund has been established to collect         100
                                                                     Expenditure
  all revenues emanating directly or indirectly from        50
  petroleum resources. All revenues flow into an             0
  earmarked receipts account (including those                   0     5      10      15     20      25  30
  revenues accumulated under the provisionary                                       Year
  savings policy during the transition period).

· A savings policy has been adopted to preserve the real value of petroleum wealth by spreading
  expenditures over an infinite time horizon, safeguarding a sustainable budget in perpetuity. Conditions
  under which the government can withdraw funds from the Petroleum Fund above an estimated
  "sustainable income" are restricted and are always subject to Parliamentary approval.

· Expenditures funded from petroleum revenues are integrated into the budget process. Transfers from
  the Petroleum Fund can only be made to a designated government account, and total transfers in a fiscal
  year cannot exceed a ceiling set by Parliament as part of the approval of the government budget.
  Expenditures are executed through the Treasury and recorded as part of the government's consolidated
  reporting. Revenue and expenditure figures are publicly available, and the budget law and regular
  external audits guard against misappropriation of funds.

· Assets are managed prudently in safe, offshore investments that are sheltered from domestic
  economic risks. Overall Petroleum Fund management is the responsibility of the Minister of Planning
  and Finance, and operational management is the responsibility of the Banking and Payments Authority.
  Under the Petroleum Fund Law, one or more professional investment managers will be appointed to
  oversee Petroleum Fund investments. An Investment Advisory Board has been established to advise the
  government on Petroleum Fund investments.

· Governance mechanisms have been put in place to ensure transparency and accountability in the use
  of funds. The law requires the timely publication of quarterly reports and annual financial statements
  and the public release of non-confidential information. An independent Consultative Council has been
  established to advise Parliament on issues related to the Petroleum Fund. Independent external audits
  will be carried out by an internationally recognized accounting firm, and audit reports will be adapted
  into a format accessible to the public. The government has established transparency as a fundamental
  principle in the law, requiring the publication of aggregate information on company payments.

The arrangements in the savings policy and law are key to safeguarding Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth.
However, their success will depend on the effective implementation of all the checks and balances in the
Constitution. This includes Parliamentary oversight, the justice system, independent audit of government
accounts, the Provedor, and freedom of speech, all of which are weak or not yet existent. In addition, the
independence of these functions and institutions from each other is important, but not yet firmly
established.
