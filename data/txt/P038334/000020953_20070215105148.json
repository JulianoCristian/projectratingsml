Lessons learned were: 1) the expectation of\n            the pace at which the reforms can be implemented and the\n            outcomes realized should be realistic. Given the\n            socio-political constraints the pace of reforms will be\n            determined by the willingness and capacity of the\n            governments to address key reform issues; 2) subsidized\n            power supply to agriculture is a broad public policy issue,\n            not just a sectoral issue. The problem of subsidized power\n            supply to agriculture and resistance to metering is embedded\n            in the political economy of distorted agricultural policies.\n            Sustainable improvement in power sector requires this\n            complex economic and political problem to be addressed; 3)\n            tariff reforms and cost recovery improvement as well as\n            efficiency improvement are essential for the financial\n            turnaround of the power sector. Tariff subsidy to the\n            consumers must be explicitly defined and transparently\n            delivered without compromising the utility's finances;\n            4) public acceptance of sector changes and consequent\n            prospects of sustainability are likely to only come about if\n            the changes result in quickly achieved and highly visible\n            improvements in service quality; and 5) in future, and in\n            general through out the various sectors, while encouragement\n            may well be given for ICB package sizes to be large to\n            encourage international participation and economies of\n            scale, every effort should be made, through market research\n            by the borrower, to ensure that lot sizes are so finalized\n            as to ensure that eligible bids will be received from the\n            most likely source."}, "docdt": "2007-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
