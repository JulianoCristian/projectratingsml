Transmission lines, and substations will not disturb\n            natural habitats, for those will be installed within 100 km\n            of any wild life protection area, and, though lines pass\n            through agricultural land, cultivation is permitted under\n            the towers, and conductors, posing no threat to the\n            surroundings. Soil erosion during construction will be\n            controlled through the installation of retaining walls, and\n            stone pitching, and, vegetation propagation will be ensured\n            as needed. However, there is the potential for\n            electromagnetic frequency (EMF) radiation, noise\n            disturbances, and electric interference along transmission\n            lines, therefore minimum transmission line clearance\n            distances will address EMF effects, in accordance with the\n            Electricity Act. Furthermore, the potential of electrocution\n            hazard exist, thus the Rajasthan State Electricity Board\n            will restrict public access, by fencing substations in\n            accordance with the Electricity Act. The second volume,\n            Social Policy and Procedures, address displaced populations\n            losing land, who will be compensated as per the Land\n            Acquisition Act, through rehabilitation grants to ensure\n            replacement values."}, "docdt": "2000-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
