The components\n            will: 1) reduce Rajasthan State Electricity Board's\n            (RSEB) technical, and non-technical losses through an\n            immediate elimination of the long lower voltage, or low\n            tension lines in rural areas, which heavily overload\n            transformers. Schemes will be financed, consisting of low\n            tension-less systems, replacing low voltage lines with high\n            voltage, and further augment locations of distribution\n            transformers, while capacitor installation will further\n            improve returns of operating voltages; 2) reinforce\n            transmission/distribution systems, by financing equipment,\n            materials, and plant, for substations\n            expansion/construction; 3) install system electronic\n            (static) meters to measure the flow of electricity, a\n            prerequisite for successful commercialization; and, 4)\n            provide technical assistance in the areas of reform project\n            management; institutional development; formation of joint\n            venture distribution companies; socioeconomic impact\n            assessment; renewable energy development; environmental\n            management; and, communications/information, particularly\n            supporting the public information campaign through various\n            media forms."}, "docdt": "2000-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
