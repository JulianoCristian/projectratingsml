farmers.\n            The project would include procurement of: (a) urea handling\n            facilities at three ports, including bulk reception and\n            bagging stations and two special urea unloading piers; (b)\n            200 railway wagons of 30-ton capacity for use in fertilizer\n            block trains; (c) three self-unloading bulk urea ships and\n            one refrigerated ammonia ship for interisland transport of\n            fertilizer; (d) minor improvements to existing urea bulk\n            carriers; and (e) a rail line from the existing PJKA line to\n            the port of Meneng. Consultant services would be provided\n            for design and construction supervision of the ships and the\n            bulk reception and bagging stations and for studies of\n            future fertilizer demand and of the use of block trains.\n            Funds are also provided for continued preparation of a\n            future maritime transport project, including master plans\n            and detailed engineering for several ports."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
