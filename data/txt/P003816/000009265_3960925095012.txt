PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
NATIONAL FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(LOAN 2120-IND)
SUMMARY AND HIGHLIGHTS
PT. Pupuk Sriwidjaja (Pusri) is Indonesia's largest fertilizer
producing company. In addition to distributing and marketing its own
products, GOI, in 1979, assigned Pusri responsibility for distributing and
marketing of all fertilizers in Indonesia. This responsibility includes both
domestically produced and imported fertilizers (para. 1.2).
ii.       The objective of the project was to provide the additional
facilities needed for distributing the products from the planned expansion of
the domestic fertilizer industry during the period 1982-1986. Fertilizer
production in Indonesia more than doubled during 1982-1986, with an increase
of almost 3.0 million tons, and domestic consumption increased by a factor of
about 1.5 over the same period. The project included (i) procurement of three
urea bulk carriers and one refrigerated carrier for liquid ammonia; (ii)
procurement of 200 rail box wagons and construction of a 21 km railway line to
Mteneng; (iii) new fertilizer bagging facilities and piers at Meneng and
Cilacap; (iv) expansion of the existing bagging facility at Belawan, North
sumatera; (v) improvements to existing urea ships and the purchase of ships'
spares; and, (vi) consultancy services (para. 2.2).
iii.      The Bank loan (US$66.0 m) financed the new bagging facilities,
specialized piers, railway wagons, the Fertilizer Marketing and Distribut-n
Study, and the ports and maritime studies. Export credits were used to
finance the four ships and Government funds were used for the railway line
extension (para. 2.8).
iv.       No major problems were encountered during the project implementa-
tion, which was carried out well by Pusri. However, the planned backhaul of
bulk TSP from Cresik did not occur. Thus, the expansion at Belawan for
handling bulk TSP and improvements to the urea carriers were deleted from the
project. Also, construction of the bulk terminal and bagging facilities, and
procurement of the rail box wagons were delayed by the slow tender evaluation
process (paras. 3.2-3.8)
v.        Due to the deletion of components and overestimates at appraisal,
the total project cost was US$135.1 million, a reduction of some US$50.2
million from the appraisal estimates. The loan was closed as originally
scheduled (06/30/88) and approximately US$28.4 m was cancelled (para. 3.9).
vi.       Completion of the project has left Pusri with a distribution system
consisting of seven 7,500 dwt bulk fertilizee ships, one 4,500 dwt ammonia
carrier, six bagging stations, 595 railway wagons, 81 inland storage depots



iv
and a computerized linear program model to optimize shipments on the entire
distribution system (para. 4.1).
vii.      Utilization of the bulk carriers has not been as high as was
projected during appraisal as growth in the domestic consumption of urea has
been less than expected. Utilization of the Meneng facility has been low, due
to lower than expected demand and also to increased production at a competi-
tive bagging plant in Surabaya. On the other hand, fertilizer consumption has
been higher than expected in Cilacap's hinterland and hence the facilities
have been operating well in excess of appraisal expectations. It is expected
that utilization of both the Meneng facilities and the bulk ships will
increase with the commissioning of the Kaltim III project in 1988 (paras. 4.5-
4.11).
viii.     In October 1986, Pusri and PJKA began to develop fully the block
train concept for fertilizer movements in Java using the 595 Pusri owned rail
box wagons of which 200 were furnished under the project. Performance to date
has been good and it is expected that rail shipments will exceed 95% of the
1988 target (para. 4.12).
ix.       Pusri's financial performance over the project period was good and
key loan covenant targets were met or exceeded. Pursi has adequate funds to
finance any future distribution system expansion. Also, the economic rate of
return of the project was acceptable at 15% (paras. 5.1-5.7).
X.        Near the end of the project, part of the Bank loan was used to fund
a Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution Strategy Study (FMDSS) for the period
1986-1995. Pusri is using the results of the study to improve the existing
distribution and marketing system and to prepare proposals to GOI for
additional facilities needed in the future. The study identified key invest-
ment needs totalling about US$29.0 m which Pusri intends to implement
(paras. 6.3-6.6).
xi.       The port master planning and detailed engineering financed under the
project led to the ongoing National Ports Project (L-2577). Also the various
project financed studies have promoted significant changes in port
operations. The Directorate General of Sea Communications and the Perumpels
have benefited substantially (para. 8.2).
xii.      Bank involvement was helpful to Pusri especially by discouraging the
purchase of another bulk carrier in 1985 and also in carrying out the
distribution strategy study. Due to the recommendations of this study, Pusri
has recently made changes which focus primarily on the shipping, marketing and
distribution functions and are intended to improve overall operating
efficiency (paras. 8.1-8.3).
xiii.     In summary, the project helped to finance needed equipment and
facilities although in retrospect some of the latter, like the pier at Meneng,
were overdesigned. The project by design did not contribute much to the Bank/
Borrower macro and sector dialogue on major issues such as fertilizer
subsidies. This was acceptable at the time because food self sufficiency was
a key Government goal and making fertilizer available at low cost to farmers



v
was part of the overall strategy. However, more attention could have been
paid to project specific issues such as potential changes in the Government
mandated safety stock requirements for fertilizers at the ISD's and the
realizable nutrient application levels. As it turned out, reductions in
safety stocks (from 3 months to 1 month) and usage of nutrients below
Government target levels led to reduced fertilizer distribution volumes and
also the resultant underutilization of some facilities.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
NATIONAL FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(LOAN 2120-IND)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja (PUSRI) was established in Palembang, South
Sumatera, in 1959 as a government owned enterprise to m&aufacture ammonia and
urea fertilizers. PUSRI I, the first small plant with installed capacity of
100,000 tons per year (tpy) of urea went on stream by the end of 1963. This
plant was built with assistance from the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development. Subsequently, starting in 1974, regular expansion of
production capacity took place and Indonesia now has (a) nine urea plants,
with a total installed capacity of 4,242,000 tpy in five locations - P.T.
PUSRI with four plants, P.T. Kujang, Iskander Muda and Asean Aceh with one
plant each and P.T. Kaltim with two plants; (b) two triple super phosphate
plants with a total caparity of 1,000,000 tpy; and (c) three ammonium sulphate
plants of total capacity 645,000 tpy at Petrokimia, Gresik. Construction is
in progress on a tenth Ammonia/urea plant- Kaltim III with a capacity of
570,000 tpy. Two more ammonia/urea plants of similar capacities are planned
to be commissioned in 1989 and 1992 respectively, one to replace the obsolete
PUSRI I and the other as the second plant of P.T. Iskander Muda. Details of
production units are given in Table 1.
1.2       Regular expansion of fertilizer production and associated distribu-
tion capacity resulted from the rapid growth in domestic consumption of ferti-
lizers which in turn was due to Government effoyts to enhance production of
rice and other food crops through special intensification programs. The
increased demand for fertilizers was often centered in locations which were
quite far away from the plants and therefore warranted the development of an
efficient distribution system to ensure that farmers get fertilizer in time
and at reasonable prices. PUSRI is responsible for the distribution of all
fertilizer in Indonesia. Two-thirds of it is transported by ships, including
special self unloading ships, to bagging stations at several ports. From
there it is forwarded by road and railway to inland storage depots (ISD).
From the ISDs the fertilizer is sold through private retailers and
cooperatives (KUD) to the farmers.
1.3       The Bank has actively supported the Government's expansion of
fertilizer production and distribution as the following list of projects
shows:

In addition, PUSRI had two other fertilizer distribution projects (equipment
mostly) which were partly financed by other aid agencies.
1.4       The Bank's first Fertilizer Distribution project provided the
specialized equipment needed by the then existing small-scale fertilizer
distribution system to absorb factory output which increased from about
366,000 tons in 1976 to about 1,780,000 tons in 1980. Much of chis increased
factory output was financed by the previous Bank credits and loans for
fertilizer production. The First Project included (a) expansion and provision
of new bulk reception and bagging stations at five ports; (b) provision of 175
railway wagons and locomotives; (c) purchase of four self-unloading bulk
fertilizer ships; and (d) construction of 57 inland storage depots (ISDs).
The project was successful in providing an effective distribution system.
1.5       When the Second project was formulated, domestic fertilizer consump-
tion was growing at about 12% p.a. nationwide but with wide regional varia-
tions from about 7.55% p.a. on Java to over 20Z p.a. on the outer Islands.
Expansion of the distribution system was needed, especially to serve the outer
islands and other areas, where facilities were not provided in the first
project. The second project funded improvements both in sea and land
transport of fertilizer. It included components for modern ships as well as
for block trains for the railway authority (PJKA) and new bagging stations.
1.6       This completion report is based on a draft report submitted by PUSRI
and on the findings of a supervision mission to Indonesia and was prepared by
the Asia 5 Infrastructure Division.

II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Preparation Stage
2.1       The proposed project was identified in discussions between the
Government and the Bank in 1980 and prepared by PUSRI and the Government with
the assistance of two consulting firms. One firm (Canadian) helped PUSRI to
make estimates of the facilities required to distribute the additional amounts
of fertilizer to be produced, and to assist it in the design (and later on the
construction supervision) of the project. The distribution system prepared
under the project was based on the output of plants then (1980) under con-
struction or existing, and on the forecasts of the Department of Agriculture
about fertilizer usage throughout Indonesia. The second firm (Australian)
helped to complete the financial and economic analyses of the proposed
project.
Project Objectives
2.2       The project was part of the program developed by the Government for
increased food production by the proper application of fertilizers. The
objectives of the project were to (a) assist in providing distribution
capacity for the substantial projected increase in fertilizer production from
new plants then under construction; and (b) prepare master plans and detailed
engineering for the development of about eleven ports.
Appraisal Stage
2.3       The appraisal mission, composed of an engineex, an economist and a
financial analyst, visited Indonebia in April/May 1981 and reviewed the
project documents. Several issues were identified; the key ones (financing,
subsidies, and advance contracting) are summarized in the following
paragraphs.
2.4       Project Financing.  The mission had indicated that parts of the
proposed maritime (ships) and railway (locomotives) components of the project
could largely be financed by export credits. If this happened, then the
remaining foreign exchange needs of the project would be less than the then
proposed Bank loan of US$50.0 million. The mission recommended that the
Government submit a complete financing plan for the project and, if necessary,
that an appropriate portion of the loan be reallocated to assist in financing
the civil works for the railway line construction.
2.5       Fertilizer Subsidies.  The Government subsidized PUSRI directly by
purchasing factory production at prices which provided an adequate financial
return on plant assets and then immediately resold the fertilizer at a lower
price to PUSRI so as to provide adequate returns to distribution activities.
This was part of Government's strategy for increasing food production by
providing cheap fertilizer at the farmgate, without penalizing PUSRI. At that
time also, the Government and the Bank were entering a dialogue focused on the
overall question of budgetary subsidies, including those for food, fertilizer,
and energy, and progress was being made on nominal retail price increases fLr
some commodities. The rate at which fertilizer subsidies could be phased nut



-4-
depended, among other things, on policy developments in the food crop sector
(including returns to farmers) and on consumer prices. The mission therefore
recommended that fertilizer consumption be reviewed periodically in relation
to changes in the rice/fertilizer price ratio during project implementation.
No conditions or loan covenants would be sought on fertilizer pricing, as it
would instead remain a part of the broad Bank economic dialogue with the
Government.
2.6       Advance Contracting.  Consultants' contracts for supervision of ship
construction, bulk reception facilities, and railway line designs were to be
signed prior to loan negotiations. These contracts involved about US$5.6
million in foreign exchange liability. In addition, it was possible that
PUSRI could have committed and paid about US$7.5 million on contracts for
services and goods prior to the date of loan signing. The mission recommended
that the loan agreement permit loan funds to be disbursed for any balance of
contracts entered into by PUSRI prior to loan signature, provided such
contracts have been awarded according to Bank procurement guidelines and have
been approved by the Bank. No retroactive financing was proposed.
2.7       In addition to the issues, there were several conditions of negotia-
tions which the appraisal mission asked the Government to fulfill. The major
ones were (a) completion of the right-of-way survey for the railway line to
Meneng and start of the required land acquisition; (b) selection of consul-
tants both for designs and construction of the new bulk reception and bagging
plant and for construction supervision for all ships; and (c) confirmation
that the Petrokimia shiploader can load PUSRI ships.
Negotiations
2.8       Negotiations took place in Washington during February 1-5, 1982.
The focus of discussions was on an implementation schedule for the railway
part of the project and the submission of a satisfactory schedule was made a
condition of Board presentation. The project financing issues were resolved
by having PUSRI use suppliers' credits for obtaining all four ships. The
Government would finance the railway component and the Bank funds (increased
to US$66.0 million) would cover the remaining PUSRI investments as well as the
maritime studies which were added during negotiations. The Bank participation
in the project was set at 35% of total cost. As for fertilizer subsidies, the
Government emphasized the fact that increasing rice production was of
paramount importance and hence decisions on fertilizer pricing would be made
in the context of this concern. Finally, on advance contracting, the Govern-
ment accepted the Bank's position.

Project Description
2.9       The project as approved (total cost US$185.31 million) consisted of
two parts, A and B, as detailed below:
Part A: Fertilizer Distribution
1.   Ships
(a) Acquisition of three shallow-draft self-unloading
ships, of about 7,500 deadweight tons (dwt) each,
similar in design to PUSRI's existing four bulk
fertilizer ships;
(b) Acquisition of one ship of about 4,500 dwt for the
carriage of refrigerated ammonia; and
(c) Improvement of the loading and unloading facilities
aboard PUSRI's existing bulk ships.
2.   Bulk Reception and Bagging Facilities and Pier
(a) Construction of a bulk urea reception and bagging
station at Meneng, East Java, with storage for about
25,000 tons of bulk urea and 35,000 tons of bagged
urea, and capable initially of bagging 750,000 tons
of fertilizer per year (tpy);
(b) Expansion and improvement of the existing urea
bagging and handling facilities at Belawan, Sumatera;
and
(c) Design and construction of a special urea unloading
pier at each of the ports of Meneng and Cilacap,
Java.
3.   Inland Transportation
(a) Acquisition by PUSRI of about 200 railway freight
cars, of about 30 ton capacity each, specially
designed to carry bagged fertilizer; and
(b) Design and construction of about 21 km of railway
line extension from the bulk urea reception and
bagging station at Meneng to Kabat, linking the rail-
head at Banjuwangi to Meneng, East Java.



-6-
4.   Spare Parts
Acquisition of spare parts, as agreed between the Borrower
and the Bank, for the ships, railway freight cars and
other facilities, including the facilities to be provided
under the Project, used in PUSRI's fertilizer distribution
system.
5.   Technical Assistance
(a) Design, procurement and construction supervision of
the ships, and of the bulk reception and bagging
facilities and piers, through technical assistance;
and;
(b) Technical assistance for the carrying out of the
following studies: (i) to update forecasts of
fertilizer use and consumption and to study needed
fertilizer distribution facilities and methods to
increase peak storage capacity; and (ii) to assess
the needs for additional investment and operational
improvements required for expanded use of block
trains for transport of bulk products.
Part B: Port Master Plans and Detailed Engineering
1.   Preparation of port master plans for about 10 ports and
detailed engineering of works; and
2.   Preparation of detailed engineering of works proposed for
the port of Tanjung Priok under the master plan previously
prepared for that port.
2.10      Responsibility for project implementation was divided between PUSRI,
PJKA and DGSC (the Directorate General of Sea Communications). PUSRI was
responsible for Parts A.1, A.2, A.3(a), A.4, A.5(a) and A.5(b)(i); PJKA was
responsible for parts A.3(b) and A.5(b)(ii); DGSC was responsible for the
entire part B of the project. The Bank loan covered the PUSRI and DGSC parts
of the project.
2.11      The appraisal report, No. 3609-IND was dated March 10, 1982.  The
project was approved by the Executive Directors on March 30, 1982 and Loan
Agreement No. 2120-IND (US$66.0 million, for 20 years, including 5 years
grace, with interest at 11.6% per annum) was signed on April 5, 1982 and
became effective on September 27, 1982. Part of the proceeds of the loan was
to be onlent to PUSRI (Project Agreement No. 2120-IND of April 5, 1982) at an
interest rate of 13.5% for 10 years, including 3 years of grace. The
Government bore all foreign exchange risks.



-7-
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Overview
3.1       The civil works components were completed some two years behind
schedule due to delays in commencing and finalizing detailed engineering as
well as in the construction itself. The ships and rail box cars were also
delivered late (about one year) for similar reasons. The total project cost
was considerably less (by 27%) due to over-estimation at appraisal and
deletion of a few components such as the ship improvements and spares and the
Belawan facilities. The ship improvements and spares were deleted because the
planned backhaul of TSP from Gresik was not yet feasible for production
reasons. This also meant that an additional bagging facility at Belawan, the
destination, was not needed and it was also deleted. Operating results were
decidedly mixed--the Meneng pier and bagging facilities are under utilized but
Cilacap is fully utilized. This was due to lower than expected growth in
demand for fertilizers at Meneng, because fertilizer use is already extensive
in its hinterland and also it was less costly to service some of the latter's
needs from Surabaya. PUSRI, however, is financially sound with profits
ranging from US$15.6 million to US$53.5 million (after taxes) during the
project period. Its cash and bank balances (including foreign currencies)
were quite adequate and it could have financed the project on its own.
Table 2 has details of estimated and actual implementation periods.
Implementation
3.2       Meneng facilities.  The project's major civil works consisted of the
bulk receiving and bagging facilities which were .o be built at Meneng, East
Java. These included (i) a special pier for receiving bulk fertilizer; (ii) a
receiving conveyor of 1,000 tons per hour; (iii) reclaiming system and six
bagging modules, for 50 kg bags, both with a total capacity of 1 milLion tpy;
and (iv) five payloaders together with office buildings, maintenance shop, a
35,000 capacity bagged storage space, empty bags and spare parts store. They
were to be completed by July 1983, at an appraisal estimated cost of US$22.48
million. However major delays occurred because all stages of the engineering
design (selection and award of contract, site investigation, actual designs,
etc.) took longer than anticipated. Contracts for the facilities and
equipment were awarded on various dates (Table 3) to a group of Canadian and
local consultants, ranging from detailed engineering in October 1982 to the
construction of the facilities in October 1984. All construction was carried
out by local contractors. The quality of the work done was very good. The
actual total cost of the completed work was US$11.3 million, some 50% less
than appraisal estimates. This was largely due to the imprecision of
appraisal cost estimates which had been made long before designs were
available.
3.3       Cilacap pier.  A special pier solely for unloading urea with con-
veyors connecting the pier to the bagging station was included in the Project
at an estimated cost of US$2.62 million. It experienced similar delays as at
Meneng. The soils investigation, pier and conveyor designs were all awarded
to local consultants, while the same Canadian consultant as at Meneng won the
construction supervision contract. The construction contract was also awarded



-8-
to a local firm but only in July 1984, i.e., more than one year after the
original expected completion date. Construction was completed in mid-1986 at
a total cost of US$2.1 million.  The facility was commissioned in August 1986
and has been well utilized since then.
3.4       Rolling stock and Railway Line.  The project included the purchase
of 200 railway wagons of 30 tons capacity, designed to carry bagged fertilizer
from the bagging stations (UPP) to inland storage depots (ISD). The contract
for the wagons was awarded through ICB procedures and the winning bidder (a
Korean firm) was to supply the wagons to an Indonesian firm in kit-form for
local assembly. The wagons were to be put in service by December 1983.
However the contract for their supply was not awarded until July 1984. The
main reason for delays arose from the tender evaluation and approval process
and also the slow shipping and kit assembly works. The wagons were finally
put into service in October 1986--an aggregate delay of 32 months for this
project component. The actual cost of the wagons and spares was
US$6.4 million, which was just over one third of the appraisal estimated
US$16.0 million. As for the 21 km railway line, from the Meneng pier to the
mainline junction at Kabat, PJKA completed construction about 1 year behind
schedule. This was due to delays in acquiring the right of way and periodic
budgetary shortages. It was funded entirely by the Government and built by
local contractors who were supervised by PJKA and local consultants.
3.5       Ships.  Three 7,500 DWT self unloading ships were to be procured
under the project to supplement the existing four ship fleet. The new ships
were to be similar to the existing ones and hence the same designs prepared by
an American consulting firm under the First Distribution Project (L-1139) were
used. A South Korean firm won the bid and the contract dates for the ships'
delivery were June 1983, October 1983 and February 1984. Deliveries were made
on schedule and all ships met the specifications. The ships were capable of
unloading at rates in excess ci 500 tons per hour. In addition, the three new
ships are outfitted for TSP backhaul, whenever it begins. For the ammonia
carrier, PUSRI used the same consultants for designs and they recommended a
4,500 dwt ship as the optimum. A West German shipyard won the bid and
delivered the ship on schedule and under budget.
3.6       Studie, and Detailed Engineering.  The project included funds for
port master plans and detailed engineering studies and later a fertilizer
marketing and distribution study was added (partly to use saved funds) which
also incorporated the original block train study. The 11 ports to be studied
had been identified earlier under the Integrated Sea Transport Study (L-1250
IND) and belonged mostly to the Perumpel II system. The Director General of
Sea Communications (DGSC) was responsible for this project component which was
largely traated as a part of the Maritime Sector Development Program. The
master plans and detailed engineering for these Inter Island Liner Service
(ILS) ports was to be carried out in two phases. Phase I included detailed
engineering for the expansion of Tanjung Priok port, and master plans and
(where necessary) detailed engineeriAg for the other Perumpel II ports. DGSC
used several foreign and Local consulzants for specific tasks such as the port
planning, navigational and communications systems improvement, dredging
improvement, container operations management, maritime safety studies, etc.
DGSC managed this component well and the study findings led to the ongoing



-9-
National Ports Project (L-2577 IND). In addition to port operations and careG
handling facilities improvements at Tanjung Priok, the National Ports project
also includes investments identified by the study at the ports of Teluk Bayur,
Panjang, Palembang and Pontianak.
3.7       In early 1985, PUSRI discussed with the Bank the requirements for
further development of the fertilizer distribution system serving Indonesia.
It was agreed that a study would be undertaken to establish an overall distri-
bution strategy covering the period 1986-1995 for movement and handling of
fertilizer by land and from the various production units or points of import
to the consumption areas throughout Indonesia. Marketing and organizational
aspects were also to be addressed. This Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution
Strategy Study (FMDSS) was directed by PUSRI, under the guidance of an Inter-
Departmental Steering Committee, chaired by the Director of Agro-Cbh-ical
Industries in the Department of Basic Chemical Industries. The study was
carried out by a team of foreign and local consultants working with a PUSRI
counterpart team. The final report, dated August 1986, recommended strategic
improvements in both sea and land distribution of fertilizers. Also, a linear
programming least cost transshipment model was developed as an integral part
of this study. The model can be used by PUSRI to inter alia: (a) determine
least cost distribution patterns for all fertilizers throughout Indonesia;
(b) assist in the identification of constraints in the proposed alternative
distribution patterns; (c) assist in establishing strategies for the distribu-
tion system; and (d) determine quantities and costs of fertilizer movements on
all links in the system. The study also reinforced the fact that the most
efficient distribution systems is PUSRI's current "pipeline system," which is
really a continuous flow process, at least down to the line III (Kabupaten and
ISD) level. This system is focused on the desirable locat' n of fertilizer
stocks which is at line III and IV in the marketing areas.- There is there-
fore emphasis on seasonality and matching of movements to immediate market
requirements. The report also suggested that since Indonesia is a low cost
urea producer, PUSRI should focus on developing regular, long term export
markets. This would imply that some qualitative improvements to the
fertilizer (lowered percentage of fines, use of anti-caking agents, etc.)
might be required.
3.8       PUSRI is pursuing this and other study recommendations which also
call for the investment of abc:ut US$29 m for additional facilities to cover
distribution system expansion needs during the 1986-95 period. The faciLities
include a bagging station at Cirebon, upgrading Palembang bulk loading
facilities to 700 totns per hour, rail sidings, warahousing, high speed bagging
machines, and also pier, dredging, road improvements and a new bagging station
at Semarang. PUSRI can readily finance these improvements. Also, it was
recommended that additional ships should be of the 10,000 dwt size and be
obtained through long term charters when required (around 1990).
1/   In PUSRI "pipeline" nomenclature Line I is the point of fertilizer pro-
duction or import, Line II is in or near port areas, Line III is the
district level (actually storage) and Line IV is the retail or village
level.

3.9       Project Costs.  The total cost estimate for the project at appraisal
was US$185.3 million. In the absence of engineering designs at appraisal
time, cost estimates were based on prevailing prices and quotations from
suppliers of similar equipment. These estimates turned out t_ be between 1.5
and 2 times higher than actual costs. Also some project provisions were
deleted, like the Belawan facilities and the ships' improvements and spares,
leading to further cost savings. The actual total cost was US$135.1 m, some
27% below the appraisal estimate. The Bank ended up financing about 30% of
the total cost of the project. Table 4 has further details.

IV. OPERATIONS
General
4.1       Completion of the project left PUSRI with a distribution system con-
sisting of seven 7,500 dwt bulk fertilizer ships, one 4,500 dwt ammonia
carrier, six bagging stations, 595 railway wagons and 81 ISDs. PUSRI, and
PJKA to a certain extent, have so far operated the system reasonably well.
This was confirmed by the Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution Strategy
Study. However, operating results for the individual project elements were
decidedly mixed, largely because fertilizer consumption grew neither as
rapidly nor in the locations predicted by the appraisal report. By 1986, urea
consumption was 2.7 mt or some 9% below the appraisal expected 3.1 mt. On the
other hand, consumption of TSP and AS were both over 20% greater than
appraisal expectations (Table 6). These widely varying trends have made
optimization of the distribution system difficult. Also with the commission-
ing of new plants in 1984, urea production began to exceed domestic demand.
Hence in 1985, PURSI began to export urea and 501,287 tons were exported.  In



- 11 -
1986, exports of urea from PUSRI and other domestic producers totalled
1,218,197 tons. This also changed the operational environment as PUSRI had to
consider both the domestic and export markets in its planning scenario.
4.2       Since 1982, PUSRI has devoted efforts to reducing the level of
domestic stocks measured as a percent of sales.  At the end of 1982, the
domestic stock of fertilizers as a percentaga of sales was about 47%; by the
end of 1984 the percentage had been reduced to 21%.  The levelling-off of urea
domestic consumption in 1985 coupled with a very long dry season (and
consequent delayed wet-season planting) caused an increase in domestic stocks
to 25% of sales. A large part of the domestic consumption in 1986 was
supplied from the high stocks remaining from 1985. By the end of 1986, the
domestic stock level was down to 22% of sales.
4.3       Two Government decisions were made in 1986 which will affect distri-
bution system planning in the foreseeable future. The first of these was to
allow a reduction in the required stock levels. Prior to 1986, PUSRI was
required to maintain stock levels in the consumption areas equivalent to two
months of the projected usage. Early in 1986, PUSRI was allowed to reduce the
stock levels to 1 month in Java for urea and TSP, and to 1 month in Bali,
North Sumatera and South Sulawesi for urea. This decision was based on the
fact that the marketing and distribution system had become reliable enough to
justify the reduction in stock levels. The second decision was to pay PUSRI a
pre-determined lump sum amount (subsidy) on a per ton basis beginning in 1987
for marketing and distribution. Therefore, PUSRI will have to plan distribu-
tion and marketing in such a way that Lhe system is operated within the
budget. The past practice of PUSRI's receiving marketing compen.'ation to
offset losses was essentially discontinued. The new procedure should serve as
an incentive for imp-ovements in effectiveness and efficiency throughout the
total system.
4.4       Retail prices of fertilizer have been gradually increased over the
years in an effort to reduce subsidies and compensate for increases in produc-
tion costs.  In 1982, the first year of this project, the retail price was 90
Rp/kg but by 1986, the price was 125 Rp/kg.  Although, it is too early to make
an accurate assessment, it seems that the price increase has not had a signi-
ficant effect on fertilizer usage.  Paddy prices were increa3ed at the same
time such that an acceptable benefit/cost ratio was maintained for the
farmers. Also, in an effort to reduce the use of credit and thus reduce
marketing costs, PUSRI has concentrated efforts toward increasing cash
sales. Cash sales in 1982 amount--. to only 51% of total sales but by 1986
they had risen to 80% of total  aLes.
Operation of the Fertilizer Ships
4.5       Bulk Urea Ships.  During 1984 the ships averaged 38.5 voyages
each. Two of the ships operated 353 days and the last ship began operation in
March and operated 275 days for the remainder of the year. Table 7 gives
statistical information for PUSRI's total fleet of seven urea bulk carriers
and the same information separately for the three bulk urea ships purchased
during the project for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986. The total number of
voyages decreased from 265 in 1985 to 239 in 1986 as a result of less domestic



- 12 -
urea stock in 1985 and increased exports of urea in 1986. This situation has
resulted in under utilization of the urea bulk ships. Utilization is expected
to imp-ove in 1988 when the Kaltim III urea plant is commissioned.
4.6       During appraisal, an assumption was made that backhaul of bulk TSP
would be available from Petrokimia Gresik. However, due to postponing of the
TSP III project, bulk loading facilities have not been installed at Gresik and
the projected backhaul of TSP has therefore not taken place. Hence the three
new ships, which are equipped for backhaul, are somewhat underutilized.
4.7       The second full operating year for the new ships was 1986 during
which the ships made 103 voyages. Cargoes averaged 8,244 tons and total
delivery to the bagging stations was 840,911 tons. The average total freight
haulage cost by the 3 ships purchased under the project was relatively low as
shown below:
Year                                   Rp/ton
1984                                  21,067.75
1985                                  17,496.78
1986                                  21,169.33 /a
/a This increase in freight rate was due to:
(i) devaluation of the rupiah, and (ii) increase
in the price of fuel oil.
Operation of the Ammonia Ship
4.8       The ammonia ship began operating in August 1984.  Utilization of the
ship has been Less than expected during appraisal because of developments at
the Kaltim I ammonia/urea plant. The Kaltim I plant is designed to produce
1,500 tpd ammonia of which 1,000 tpd is for upgrading to urea and 500 tpd is
for direct sales as liquid anhydrous ammonia. The 500 tpd excess ammonia was
to be transported by the bulk ammonia carrier provided under this project to
both domestic (Gresik) and international destintations. However, utilization
of the Kaltim I urea plant has been very low due to technical problems, and
this has led to the availability of much larger quantities of excess anhydrous
ammonia than planned. These larger quantities were sold to exporters who
chartered larger ships than the Pusri carrier for most of their needs. The
Pusri carrier was therefore used r.ainly for inter-plant shipments. However,
the problems at Kaltim are being resolved and the Pusri carrier should soon be
fully utilized.

Bulk Terminal
4.9       Operation of the Meneng Bagging Station.  Operation of the Meneng
bagging station began in May I j85. The Meneng UPP is the second largest
bagging station in East Java.2   Utilization of the UPP and the pier have been
very low, averaging 20X below the design rate. Several constraints exist
which temporarily limit the utilization rate of Meneng. For example, analysis
of least cost distribution patterns has so far suggested satisf)ing some of
the increased demand by using Surabaya; however this is a limited option and
most of the future demand increases will be met from Meneng. The Cilicap and
Surabaya UPP's have both performed well above the outputs projected during
appraisal. For example output from the Surabaya UPP was projected as 450,000
mtpy while actual output has reached almost 700,000 mtpy and is now at maximum
capacity.
4.10      However, Meneng UPP is very important to PUSRI in meeting its
marketing/distribution requirements in East Java, particularly during the wet
season. Utilization has really been below expectations mainly during the dry
season. To date, bagging production for Meneng UPP has been in accordance
with the marketing plan of East Java and Bali. The peak production with 4
bagging lines operating has been 2,000 tons/day. Actual bagging and shipping
at Meneng was 164,739 tons in 1985 and 244,244 tons in 1986. It is expected
that utilization of Meneng's bagging capacity will increase in direct propor-
tion to the increased demand in the East Java and Bali market areas.
Bulk Receiving Pier and Conveyors at Cilacap
4.11      The bulk receiving pier and conveyors at Cilacap began operation in
August 1986. Unloading rates from the bulk carriers, and ship turnaround time
have both been acceptable. During appraisal, the capacity of Cilacap was
estimated at 317,000 mtpy. However due to higher than expected demand for
fertilizer, actual output has reached a maximum of more than 500,000 mtpy.
Cilacap is therefore overutilized and may soon require further expansion.
Operation of Rail Wagons
4.12      In October 1986 PUSRI and PJKA began operation of the block train
system. By December 31, 1986, total rail shipments for the year were 1.03 mt
or 73.6% of the target tonnage. In 1987, inland freight with the block train
concept from all supply points using PUSRI's 595 rail wagons and PJKA's
locomotives was about 1.4 mt or 95% of target. The fertilizer block train
operation has now become one of PJKA's best run services.
2/   Surabaya is the largest and its highest annual production to date has
been 746,968 tons.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
5.1       Audited consolidated income statements of PUSRI for the years 1982
to 1986 are given in Table 8. They show that PUSRI's earnings and financial
performance were quite good over the period
5.2       One of the main contributors to this good performance has been the
occasional increases in the price of urea supplied to farmers since it was
fixed at Rp 70 per kg in late seventies. The increases were to Rp 90 per kg
from November 1982, Rp 100 per kg from November 1984 and Rp 125 per kg from
April 1986. The effect of these increases is reflected in the sales proceeds
especially i.n 1985 and 1986 when revenue increased by 12.5% and 26% while
total quantities sold recorded increases of only 5% and 6% respectively.
5.3       The following financial indicators show that for the period 1982--
1986 PUSRI achieved reasonable overall results although there has been a
slight decline since 1986. The statement of changes in financial position
(Table 9) has further details.

5.4       Section 4.05 of the Project Agreement inter alia stipulated that
PUSRI should at all times maintain a ratio of net revenues earned to long-term
debt service requirements of the next fiscal year of at least 1.5:1. The
ratios achieved ranged between 2.07:1 to 3.22:1 during the years 1982 to
1985. The Agreement also specified that PUSRI shall earn each year a
reasonable return, after taxes on its fixed assets in service. Returns on net
fixed assets during the years 1982 to 1986 amounted to 9.7, 10.3, 25.4, 29.6
and 11.45% respectively.
5.5       Balance Sheets as at the end of the years 1982 to 1986 are given in
Table 10. PUSRI's debt equity ratio consistently improved frortm 35/65 in 1982
to 21/79 in 1986 as against the 42/58 to 25/75 estimated at Appraisal. The
current ratio also improved in 1986 to 2.2 while in the earlier years it was
marginally lower than the estimates. Nevertheless, the lowest was 1.3 in 1983
which was still good. Debt service coverage ranged between 3.4 to 6.0,



- 15 -
confirming the financial stability of PUSRI. Cash and Bank balances
progressively increased from Rp 74 billion in 1982 to Rp 238 billion in 1986
(including foreign exchange). With such large balances in its possession,
PUSRI could finance the construction of a substitute new plant (PUSRI-1B) in
place of the obsolete PUSRI 1 plant or other distribution system expansions.
5.6       A steep decline in credit transactions from Rp 107 billion in 1982
to Rp 70 billion in 1986 while sales have increased from Rp 195 billion to
Rp 468 billion demonstrated the results of appropriate action in recovering
debts as well as the restriction on credit sales. Reduction in inventories
from Rp 103 billion in 1982 to Rp 94 billion in 1986 is also indicative of
strict stock control. Decline in prepaid expenses from Rp 36 billion in 1982
to Rp 5 billion in 1986 showed that advances for supplies and services are
adequately controlled. On the whole, the Balance Sheet reflects effective
management of the finances of the companv.
5.7       PUSRI's accounting system provides inter alia appropriate Profit and
Loss accounts and Balance Sheets. The Profit and Loss accounts reflect the
cost of production and marketing and the earnings thereof. The formats,
however, do not provide information on expenses by type such as salaries and
wages, stores, and other expenses including interest and depreciation. These
have to be worked out by comparing figures of previous years. It is necessary
that suitable formats to provide information on expenditure by type are
introduced in order to better identify costs.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.1       PUSRI has during the last decade developed the capability of not
only operating, maintaining and managing the four fertilizer plants set up at
Palembang, but also of developing an extensive marketing network. PUSRI has
also been able to implement three distribution projects, the first and th
last financed substantially by the Bank and the second financed by CIDA.3
The first bank-financed project under Loan 1139-IND (July 1578) helped to
expand system capacity and also supported operational improvements which
enabled PURSI to handle a 20% increase in fertilizer distribution. PUSRI's
managerial and technical capabilities have been further enhanced with the
completion of the second Bank-financed project. Compliance with loan
covenants was also quite satisfactory; Table 11 has details.
6.2       Despite delays in implementation, the overall performance of the
major components indicate that PUSRI's capability to pla.. and implement
projects has grown considerably. Based on the National Fertilizer Study II
which was undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, PUSRI prepared
proposals for studies to be added to the Project to (a) revise the forecast of
fertilizer use and consumption; (b) optimize the utilization of the fertilizer
3/ A $20.0 million loan which essentially financed 220 fertilizer box
wagons, of 30 ton capacity, and 127 weighing scales and spare parts.



- 16 -
distribution facilities; and (c) effect operational improvements to expand the
use of block trains.
6.3       Based on PUSRI's proposal, the Bank authorized the use of loan funds
and actively assisted PUSRI to initiate a comprehensive study into fertilizer
distribution and marketing strategy for the ten year period 1986-1995. The
consultants' team of expatriate and local experts, drawn from different
sources, were actively assisted by a counterpart team from PUSRI. This helped
to improve PURSI's overall knowledge and capability and provided additional
expertise to undertake major projects independently in the future.
6.4       PUSRI was compensated by the Government for marketing and
distribution losses until 198E. With the recent withdrawal of subsidies by
Government for marketing and distribution activities and substitution in its
place of a lump sum per ton payment, PUSRI will need its experienced personnel
in marketing and distribution, to ensure that the whole system operates
efficiertly and at the lowest cost. To a certain extent, participation in the
FMDSS has helped to prepare PUSRI for this role. This is because PUSRI's
capability as an institution for managing the marketing and distribution
system and for strategic planning have been strengthened significantly.
6.5       PUSRI has already taken some steps to reduce costs including
relocating its main office from Jakarta to Palembang, and thus also providing
the benefit of closer coordination between production, marketing and distribu-
tion functions.  Currently the export division is retained in Jakarta.  Since
Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia and the hub of commercial activity,
especially for international trade, retention of the export division in
Jakarta helps in improving export trade as it facilitates coordination with
the relevant Government departments such as Trade, Industry, and Agriculture
and provides ready access to the international community.
6.6       PUSRI will also manage several improvement projects currently
planned, including the Bank-financed optimization project for PUSRI II, III
and IV ammonia units to enhance production by 20% over the original
capacity. Optimization of PUSRI's urea units to increase urea production,
production of melamine (using area) for supply to the plastic industry, and
replacement of PUSRI I are other major projects currently planned for early
implementation.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.1       The benefits included in the appraisal evaluation were determined on
the same basis as for the First Distribution project. Benefits were expected
to arise from the expected reductions in distribution costs between the PUSRI
plant at Palembang and its network of ISDs. Costs savings were measured net
of (a) the capacity of the distribution system existing in early 1981; and
(b) the overall changes in fertilizer costs to farmers that were to follow the
construction of new urea plants at Bandung and Aceh. Benefits were quantified
by comparing costs with the project's new distribution equipment versus
"without" the project when small bulk and regular line service (RLS) vessels
would be used for interisland shipments and trucks for inland movements.



- 17 -
7.2       The overall project economic rate of return was thus estimated to be
21% at appraisal. The ex-post rate of return was similarly estimated to be
15Z (Table 12). This rate of return is quite acceptable as it is based on a
continued modest average nationwide growth (4% p.a.) in fertilizer usage. The
lower volumes of fertilizer distributed, as well as delays in the implementa-
tion and use of project facilities and under-utilization of the pier at Meneng
also contributed to the reduced rate of return. The reasons can be summarized
as follows.
(a) Urea ships and pier:
(i) the appraisal assumed no ship waiting at Belawan and Cilicap,
instead there were some delays;
(ii) 14% less urea was distributed than expected;
(iii) there were no TSP backhaul benefits; and
(iv) the Meneng bagging facility was underutilized.
(b) NH3 ship:
(i) more ammonia was available than had been expected and it was
sold fob to exporters who chartered larger ships than the
Pu.ri one. This is a temporary arrangement and it is expected
that the ship will be fully utilized eventually.
(c) Railway:
(i) the delayed start of block train operations meant that the
more costly land transport had to be used; and
(ii) the transporting of less than expected ronnages.
VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.1       PUSRI could most likely have financed and implemented this project
on its own. However the Bank did play a meaningful roLe by supporting
planning and operational improvements. The Bank in 1985, for example
convinced PUSRI to not purchase an additional bulk fertilizer ship. This
would have proven to be an uneconomic investment, given the eventual slow
growth in fertilizer usage.  PUSRI has al_o reported that participation in the
Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution Strategy study has helped inter-agency
coordination and it is now working on block train improvements with PJKA.
Also the study's findings on PUSRI's operations has led to the adoption of
major changes in its marketing, shipping and distribution functions. PUSRI is
now, for example, using the Linear Program model developed under the study to
optimize both its domestic and export transhipment and distribution
activities.



- 18 -
8.2       The DGSC has also benefitted from the findings of the studies
financed through Loan 2120. The studies have promoted changes which aftect
the way the Perumpels will operate, the customs procedures, the revision and
application of maritime law, as well as the role of the DGSC itself. The
benefits to the country from the improved maritime and shipping practices are
quite substantial.
8.3       During supervision missions the Bank staff assisted in solving
various implementation related problems, usually those dealing with
procurement and PUSRI/PJKA coordination. The project received much less
supervisions than normal, probably because more emphasis was placed on the
MSDP studies which were also supported by other Bank loans (Loan 1250 and Loan
1337). However, by design, little or no attention was paid to the fertilizer
subsidy issue during project implementation.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.1       The project was successful and was essential to maintaining the flow
of fertilizers from the factory to the farm, in support of GOI's agricultural
intensification efforts. Fertilizer production more than doubled during 1981-
86 and consumption increased by a factor of 1.5.
9.2       Implementation of the expansion facilities proceeded smoothly once
approval was received for awarding tenders. Construction of the bulk terminal
at Meneng and procurement of the rail box wagons experienced delays because of
the time required to receive final approval of the tender evaluations.
Procurement of the bulk carriers and construction *f the Cilacap pier were
completed without major problems.   The expansion  ; Belawan was deleted from
the project. The project was completed below appraisal cost estimates.
9.3       PUSRI and PJKA are working on programs for efficient operation of
the equipment and facilities acquired under the project. Efforts are under
way to improve the block train system and the results are positive. It is
expected that rail shipments will attain planned targets.
9.4       PUSRI has made organizationaL changes using input from the strategy
study which was carried our under the project. Major changes, which all have
the objective of improving efficiency, have been made in the shipping,
marketing and distribution functions.
