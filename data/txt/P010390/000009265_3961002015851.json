The\n            project will therefore undertake a number of sector reforms\n            through : (a) reorganization of the public forest\n            administration and seeking a more active role of the NGOs,\n            village panchayats, cooperatives and the private sector in\n            the development of the sector; (b) improvement of the\n            state's technical capability particularly in the field\n            of seed production, genetic planting material, including\n            monitoring of the forest resource base and training; and (c)\n            rationalization of the policies and regulations constraining\n            the sector. The project would also support five discrete\n            investment activities related to land treatment: (a) village\n            eco-development and joint management; (b) rehabilitation of\n            wasteland and degraded lands; (c) production forestry; (d)\n            biodiversity and conservation; and (e) pasture and fodder development."}, "docdt": "1991-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
