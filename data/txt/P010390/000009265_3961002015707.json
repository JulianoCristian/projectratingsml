The project would also support five discrete\n            investment activities related to land treatment: (a) village\n            eco-development and joint management; (b) rehabilitation of\n            wasteland and degraded lands; (c) production forestry; (d)\n            biodiversity and conservation; and (e) pasture and fodder development."}, "docdt": "1991-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
