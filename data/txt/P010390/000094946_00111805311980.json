Key lessons reinforce once again that\n            Government commitment to reform programs must be clearly\n            established prior to project effectiveness, for, based on\n            the distinction that while policy reforms are dependent on\n            government decisions, institutional reforms result from a\n            gradual change in attitudes, which takes longer time, but\n            needs to be evidenced by the initiation of the reform\n            process; a fact clearly shown by the effective human\n            resources development programs, which brought changes in\n            attitude, providing the driving force for change management.\n            Nonetheless it is suggested that participatory forest\n            management programs should in the future, receive higher\n            priority than government plantations, involving communities\n            in the management of forest resources, which improves\n            forestry protection, and productivity, delivering higher\n            economic returns, and a significant impact on rural poverty,\n            which contrasts with the marginal economic benefits of\n            plantations managed by government alone. However, the role\n            of Government is important in strategically planning for the\n            forest sector, and in the introduction of improved\n            technology, to link production and demand for improved\n            planting materials, whether it be for plantations, or\n            participatory programs."}, "docdt": "2000-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
