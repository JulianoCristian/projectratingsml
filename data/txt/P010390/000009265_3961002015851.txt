MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATQONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIREC2ORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO II.DIA
FOR THE MAMARASHTRA FORESTRY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to India for SDR 88.9 million (US$124.0
million equivalent) to help finance the Maharashtra Forestry Project. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years.
The nroceeds of the development credit would be onlent by the Government of
India (GOI) to the Maharashtra State Government in accordance with the
standard arrangements for development assistance to the state.  GOI will bear
the foreign exchange risk.
2.    Country/Sector Background.  India's forest resources cover 64 million ha
or about 19% of the country's land area. Due to their considerable
geographical extension and the large number of people depending on them,
forest resources play an important role in the conservation of environmental
quality, the welfare of the rural poor anid the productivity of agricultural
lands. Forests are the main source of household energy in India and by far
the main depositories of genetic diversity. The average growing stock and
yield per ha are respectively one-half and one quarter of world averages.
while India's forests are relatively rich in flora and fauna, these resources
are rapidly declining dlue to pressure from local population, cattle and theft.
About 90t of wood demand is for fuelwood (46% of India's household energy).
Forests are also a main source for fodder and non-wood forest products (NWFP),
such as oils, medicinal plants, resins, dyes, fibers and leaves. About 75% of
India's population live in rural areas, and many, particularly women, are
employed in forestry or collection of NWFP.
3.    The Government is addressing deforestation through legislation and
afforestatiorn. The National Forest Policy was revised in 1988 to ensure
environmental stability and maintenance of ecological balance. The Policy
advocates increasing tree cover and use of forest areas to meet requirements
of rural and tribal populations for fuelwood, fodder, and NWFP, while
industries as far as possible are to arrange for raw materials from farm
forestry. In an attempt to force forest departments to pay attention to
social concerns, the policy focusses heavily on such issues. With the
intention of empnasizing social goals this policy resulted in neglecting the
economic considerations. Forestry is a priority in the draft Eighth Five Year
Plan (1992-97). Key objectives are to: develop forest management approaches
based on local participation (joint management); improve the efficiency of
state forest departments and allow a larger role to the private sector in
forest development; improve forest research and technology; and to
modify/adopt legislation to improve incentives for farm forestry and joint
management.
4.    Maharashtra, the most industrialized state in the country, has also the
second largest recorded forest area in India, estimated at about 6.4 million
ha or 20% of the state's geographical area. However, in terms of actual
forest cover it ranks only fifth. Increasing commercial and domestic demands
combined with those of livestock, have led to severe forest and land



degradation in the stat-. It has been estimated that the area under
wastelands in Maharashtra amounts to about 7 million ha. Growing demand of
the domestic wood-based industries for raw materials and the dependence of the
rural popul4tion on fuelwood, on NWFP and on employment in forest operations
has highlighted the growing social and economic dimensions of the forest
sector in Maharashtra. About 9% of the population in Maharasht-a is tribal,
of which 44% are agricultural laborers or urban dwellcrs, and most of zhem are
near forest areas relying on the use of forests for their livelihood.
Maharashtra has a relatively rich and diverse flora and fauna in its forest
area, but there is no clear cut conservation strategy. The Maharashtra
government has recognized that some major changes in the forest sector are
needed, particularly the need to modify its approach to forest resource
management.
5.    Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  Problems of a general
nature in forestry projects in India include: delays in project mobilization;
institutional weaknesses; and inadequate local funding. The major lesson from
projects in India is that it is time to move to a more comprehensive approach
to the sector, based on in depth country and state specific se:tor analysis.
The Bank has no experience in forestry in Maharashtra but experience from the
USAID funded Maharashtra Social Forestry Project which closed in 1990, and
borne out by draft PCRs of Bank-funded social forestry projects in other
states (Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jammu Kashmir and Haryana),
brought out a need for: (a) improved planting material; (b) use of better
techno_ogy and more effective technology dissemination; (c) increased
specialization and training; and (d) increased local participation and sharin-
of benefits by individuals and village communities in forest development and
management.  Building on the State Forest Department's growing commitment to
address these issues, the project preparation process has entailed a
comprehensive analysis of the sector, including a review of needed
institutional, technical and policy reforms.
6.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The strategy for Bank assistance to the
agricultural sector in India is to support policies and investments that
promote economic growth and social development in the context of macroeconomic
restructuring. The emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased
efficiency in the public sector and appropriate targeting and delivery of
support systems to the poor. The proposed project fits well within that
framework. It also fits well with the objectives of the Bank's Forest Policy
Paper and of the Bank's approach co forestry lending in the Asia Region which
emphasizes an on-going policy dialogue with borrowers concerning key forestry
issues coupled with investment in afforestation. A state by state forestry
approach is advocated for India which parallels current strategy for statewide
agricultural and irrisation development projects.
7.    proiect Obeactives and Description.  The overall objectives of the
project are: (a) slowing environmental degradation; (b) maintaining and/or
improving biodiversity; (c) increasing the productivity of forest lands;
(d) developing wastelands; (e) raising biomass self-sufficiency; and (f)
generating rural income and increasing equity in rural areas through increased
community participation. To support these objectives and increase the
effectiveness of project investments some fundamental institutional, technical
and environmental reforms in the management of the forestry sector are needed.
The first phase of the project will address these reforms, including the
building up of technical support for project implenentation. This will be



followed by investmnents for land treatments mainly on degraded lands, the
majority of which will take place in the second project phase.
8.    The project is to be implemented over a six year period.  The project
consists of two sets of project components. First, the project will support
reforms which aim at introducing viable institutional arrangements, technology
improvements and eliminating policy constraints in the development of the
forestry sector. They would include: (a) project organization support,
including restructuring of the forest administration and allowing a greater
role of the NGOs and the private sector in forest development; (b) development
of specialized support services, including research, data base and strategic
planning, market intelligence end policy research, training and publicity; and
(c) technology improvement, particularly in seed production and in nursery and
fodder development. Second, the project will support a set of three distinct
investment activities related to land treatments: (a) plantation devtelopment
consisting of production forestry through plantation development on public
forest lands and private lands and enrichment planting and management of
natural forest; wasteland development of degraded public and private lands,
incl-:ding the application of _atchment protection, horticulture and pasture
development options; and fodder and pasture development; (b) village eco-
development, a strategy for people's participation in the development of
degraded public, communal and private land adjacent to villages, including
tribal areas; and (c) biodiversity conservation.
9.   12roject I  l-lemeatatri.  The proposed project will be carried out by the
Maharashtra Forest Department. The project cost is estimated at US$142.0
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$7.8 million
equivalent (6%) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$4.5 million
equivalent. The IDA Credit would finance US$124.0 million equivalent (100% of
the foreign exchange and 81% of the local costs). Retroactive financing not
exceeding the equivalent of SDR 3.6 million is proposed for project
expenditures incurred after June 30, 1991 to take advantage of the momentum on
project reform and support activities that have already begun. The project
completion date would be March 31, 1998 and closing date of the credit would
be September 30, 1998. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No.10040-IN dated December 19, 1991, is being
distributed separately.
10.   Sustainahility.  The project would be sustainable after IDA funding
ends. Most afforestation investments would have been completed and the
maintenance requirements would easily be met from state resources. The
project includes limited incremental staff who would be funded under declining
basis by IDA during project implementation and subsequently be carried fully
on the state budget. The concept of managing public forests jointly with
local populations ensures that plantations created under the project would
have a good chance of long-term survival and high productivity. Institutional
changes would be made to support the joint management and village eco-
development system.

11.   AreVed Actions.  Most of the actions agreed with GOl and GOM during
iegotiations relate to the proposed institutional, technical and policy
reforms, as these reforms will constitute essentially the operational
framework for the implementation of the project. These actions, summarized
below, will be subject to annual and a mid-term review of progress with IDA:
Tn.titutfcnal:(a) GOM will carry out the reorganization study according to
agreed TOR and formulate an action plan and timetable based on the
recoirmendations of th'o study satisfactory to IDA; (b) specialized project
units to be filled with qualified heads for the duration of the project;
(c) transfer of all ecologically important protected areas from territorial
staff to the wildlife wing will be completed by September 30, 1997 and the
head of wildlife will not have other duties; and (d) GOM wi. 1 implement the
tribal and eco-devvlopment component with the participation of NGOs and local
institutions acceptable to IDA. Technical: (a) Consultants will be recruited
by March 31, 1993 to assist in establishing seed unit, pasture development
unit, and up-grading of selected nurseries; (b) satisfactory treatment models
to be implemented before impraved planting stock is available will be supplied
with seedlings from existing nurseries which have been suitably culled;
(c) all plantaticn development on public lands after March 31, 1995 would
follow the detailed procedures for planning, land preparation and management
satisfacto,ry to IDA; and (d) a research review and agreed research program
between GOM and IDA will be carried out and mainly contracted outside t"ze
forest department. Policies: (a) GOM will adjust a number of forest related
policies (e.g. use of exotic species, harvest and transit rules of timber,
sales of public forest produce), and ensure that the annual investment plan
and plantation budget will reflect the planning and market intelligence unit's
strategy. Agreement was also be reached at negotiations on the disbursement
condition for plantation deveiopment after March 31, 1995. Further
disbursement would be based on evidence satisfactory to IDA that the action
plan resulting from the reorganization study has been formulated and that
satisfactory progress has been made in implementing such plan.
12.   Environmntal Aspecta.  Biodiversity conservation is a major component
in this project. Further, the project is heavily oriented toward
environmental improvement by building a strong community stake in forest
protection. Forestry activities, especially the treatment models have been
reviewed from all relevant standpoints: silvicultural, socio-economic, soil
and moisture conservation, livestock and fodder, and wildlife and
biodiversity.
13.   Institutional Irmact.  The project is expected to foster a major change
in existing forest policy, from one of policing and forest protection, to one
of co-operation and joint venture with local communities, a feature that is
gaining ground in certain parts of the state. This major change, to which the
state is strongly committed, is gaining interest both from within and outside
the country. Measures toward a major restructuring of the forest department
organization are already underway. Project support is also given to reduce
the overlap between agencies and to improve the role in forest development by
NGOs and the private sector.
14.  Impact of the Project on women. The project will have a significant and
positive impact on women. Village women will be included as committee members
of the local village organizations for management of forest and pasture
resources to ensure their involvement in the project, particularly in the
public decision-making and benefit distribution. The project which involves



- 5 -
rehabilitation of degraded forest and afforestation and wasteland will
increase fuel and fodder supply and benefit women who spend a considerable
portion of their time and energy in ccllecting forest products for their fuel
needs and for income-generation. The project also aims to develop on an
experimental basis forest and pasture development on private lands by women's
groups with the help of NGOs. Forest training courses for male and female
staff and farmers will be designed to address issues on women's present and
potential roles in forestry.
15.   Praject Benefits.  The project is expected to undertake a number of
sector reforms which would achiev '.nstitutional, economic and enviro.mMental
improvements in the forestry sectox of the state. The reorganization of the
forest administration and greater involvement of the NGOs, cooperatives, and
the pri,'ate sector in the development of the sector would have significant
benefits both in the short and long run. The project is also expected to
generate about 80 million man-days of employment in plantation establishment
and other allied activities in village eco-development benefiting primarily
disadvantaged sections of the population. About 800,000 households comprising
forest dwellers, tribals and small holders will directly benefit from the
project. Increased supply of wood and wood related products would also
increase raw materials currently in short supply for processors and marketers
of wood and non-wood forest products. The economic rate of return for the
project as a whole has been estimated at about 15% over 40 years. The ERR is
only moderately sensitive to changes in the cost and benefit streams.
16.   Rigks.  The two main risks facing the project are: (a) the willingness
of the GOM to make the necessary institutional and policy reforms envisaged in
the project, (b) the effectiveness of peoples' participation in forest
management and development for the sustained management of common and public
lands. However, the Government's favorable reaction to the reforms suggested
and the experience relating to joint management and village eco-development in
other states along with the support of NGOs are expected to minimize these
risks.
17.   Ee     ndation. I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the credit.
