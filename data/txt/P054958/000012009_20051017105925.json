satisfactory\n            performances by the Bank and Borrower. Lessons outline the\n            partnership success due to the combination between the Bank\n            financing, the Government of Finland grant. The focus on\n            inspection and enforcement balanced the soft loan provided\n            to the end-users, taking into account the prevailing\n            conditions during project preparation. Lessons further\n            reinforce the importance of design flexibility, for it\n            allowed the project to survive external shocks through\n            corrective measures. However, any future projects should\n            probably be more results oriented in terms of environmental\n            improvement objectives. It is important to highlight that\n            involving training institutions and industrial organizations\n            in the project has been essential in attracting high numbers\n            of participants, and in ensuring sustainability, and wide\n            dissemination of experience gained. Lessons on the project\n            as a vehicle for dialogue with the Government, can be\n            measured through the keenness of the Ministry of\n            Environment, as well as the Apex bank in particular, to\n            replicate and build on the project's experience."}, "docdt": "2005-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
