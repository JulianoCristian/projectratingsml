           quality, affordable electricity services to rural\n            communities, in an efficient and sustainable manner to\n            support Vietnam's efforts towards socio-economic\n            development. The overall and also the Global Environmnet\n            Objective outcomes of the project were rated satisfactory\n            with the Bank and Borrower performing satisfactory. The\n            risks to development and to the Global Environmnet Objective\n            were rated moderate. Main risk factors that may affect the\n            sustainability of the project outcomes include increasing\n            energy consumption in project areas; technical capability of\n            the Local Distribution Utility and Power Company for\n            operation and maintenance; and financial stability of the\n            LDUs and PCs. Lessons learned concern the areas of project\n            design and contract management, social and envrionmental\n            safeguards, and financial management. Key performance\n            indicators (in particular, quantitative indicators) needed\n            to be set using the latest cost information and data, and\n            updated where appropriate, especially if there is an\n            additional financing. This lesson is particularly important\n            in the presence of steep currency inflation or deflation.\n            Also, community supervision of technical quality and\n            safeguards aspects was a highly effective means of enhancing\n            community ownership. This helped mitigate disputes and helps\n            resolve issues promptly."}, "docdt": "2014-12-13T00:00:00Z"}
