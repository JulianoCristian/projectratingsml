                         Project Development Objectives
                         Second Rural Energy Project (P074688)
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overall development objective of the proposed project is to improve access to good quality, affordable electricity services to rural communities, in an efficient and
                         sustainable manner to support Vietnam's efforts towards socio-economic development.

                          The development objective of the proposed project would be achieved through: (a) major upgrading and /or expansion of rural power networks in about 1200
                         communes; (b) conversion of current ad-hoc local electricity management systems to local distribution utilities (LDUs) as legal entities recognized under Vietnamese
                         law, to improve management of power distribution in rural areas, improve financial sustainability, and better enable future mobilization of private funds; and (c) capacity
                         building assistance for the LDUs, provincial authorities, participating regional power companies, and national authorities involved in the planning and regulation of rural
                         electrification.

                          The proposed project would improve access to energy to about 2 million households in Vietnam, including many living in some of the poorest communes. The project
                         also will enable supply of large increases in electric power for expanding productive uses in rural areas, alleviating a major constraint to local economic growth.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track to achieve its development objectives. Results from communes that have been rehabilitated show improvements in technical, commercial and financial
                         efficiency. Implementation of the Low Voltage (LV) subprojects under the original credit has almost been finalized, with 99.7% project communes completed and energized.
                         Implementation of the subprojects under the additional financing is moving smoothly.. By the end of May 2012 all subprojects except one are under construction, with 42.8% of
                         subprojects in communes completed and networks energized. The 23 newly-added communes using savings from the allocated amount to provinces are under preparation phase.
                         With the added 623 communes LV systems to be rehabilitated/expanded under the additional financing, the total number of the project communes under the REII project would be
                         1,597, higher than the target set at 1,500 communes.
                         Implementation of MV subprojects under the original credit has been totally completed, with all communes completed and energized. Implementation of the MV subprojects under the
                         additional financing is progressing. The subprojects carried out by SPC and CPC have almost been completed and energized.
                         The GEO indicator of 310,000 tons of carbon emissions reduction by the end of 2014 is expected to be achieved. To date, with the rehabilitation of 1,228 communes (971 communes
                         under the original credit and 257 under the additional financing), carbon emission reduction is estimated at about 300,800 tons.
                         Technical assistance under the project has made progress, and the implementation agencies have a clear action plan for the use of remaining funds.
