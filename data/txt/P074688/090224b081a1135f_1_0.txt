                         Project Development Objectives
                         Second Rural Energy Project (P074688)
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The overall development objective of the proposed project is to improve access to good quality, affordable electricity services to rural communities, in an efficient and
                         sustainable manner to support Vietnam's efforts towards socio-economic development.

                          The development objective of the proposed project would be achieved through: (a) major upgrading and /or expansion of rural power networks in about 1200
                         communes; (b) conversion of current ad-hoc local electricity management systems to local distribution utilities (LDUs) as legal entities recognized under Vietnamese
                         law, to improve management of power distribution in rural areas, improve financial sustainability, and better enable future mobilization of private funds; and (c) capacity
                         building assistance for the LDUs, provincial authorities, participating regional power companies, and national authorities involved in the planning and regulation of rural
                         electrification.

                          The proposed project would improve access to energy to about 2 million households in Vietnam, including many living in some of the poorest communes. The project
                         also will enable supply of large increases in electric power for expanding productive uses in rural areas, alleviating a major constraint to local economic growth.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track to achieve its development objectives in a timely manner, and with greater impact, with the project scope being expanded through additional financing. Project
                         implementation continues to progress well, with the rehabilitation and expansion of rural Low Voltage (LV) networks under the original credit having been completed in almost all of
                         project communes. The rehabilitation and upgrading of Medium Voltage (MV) systems under the original credit is completed. The LV and MV subprojects under the additional
                         financing are also progressing without any major issues.
                         To date, with the addition of 623 communes under the AF, the total number of communes where LV systems were rehabilitated and/or expanded under the REII project would be
                         1,590, higher than the target, which was set at 1,500 communes. The GEO indicator of 310,000 tons of carbon emissions reduction by the end of 2014 has been successfully
                         achieved. To date, with the rehabilitation of 1,428 communes (965 communes under the original credit and 423 communes under the AF), carbon emission reduction is estimated at
                         about 349,860 tons.
                         Completed works have been observed to be of good quality, and provincial and local authorities, local distribution units and end users reported improved reliability of electricity supply
                         and safety of operation, with the rehabilitation of the LV systems, including meters, average losses have been reduced to 10-12% from 30-40%, and going as low as 7% in some
                         communes.
