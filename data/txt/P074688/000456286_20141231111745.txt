F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall development objective of the project is to improve access to good quality,
affordable electricity services to rural communities, in an efficient and sustainable
manner to support Vietnam's efforts towards socio-economic development.
The development objective of the project would be achieved through: (a) major
upgrading and/or expansion of rural power networks in about 1,200 communes; (b)
conversion of current ad-hoc local electricity management systems to local distribution
utilities (LDUs) as legal entities recognized under Vietnamese law, to improve
management of power distribution in rural areas, improve financial sustainability, and
better enable future mobilization of private funds; and (c) capacity building assistance for
the LDUs, provincial authorities, participating regional power companies, and national
authorities involved in the planning and regulation of rural electrification.
The project would improve access to energy to about 2 million households in Vietnam,
including many living in some of the poorest communes. The project also will enable
supply of large increases in electric power for expanding productive uses in rural areas,
alleviating a major constraint to local economic growth.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
The project development objective was not revised. Due to the approval of the Additional
Financing (AF) in 2009, the outcome indicators were revised to reflect the increase of the
project’s coverage from 1,200 to 1,500 communes. Intermediate indicators for
installation of lines, transformers and household meters were also increased accordingly.
Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Global Environment Objective (GEO) is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
by improving and sustaining the energy efficiency of LDUs.
Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
The GEO was not revised. Due to the approval of the Additional Financing in 2009, the
target was revised from 265 to 310 thousand tons to reflect the scale-up of the project.

P080074
1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and Sector Background
1.       At the time of project preparation, there was a strong need for improved
electricity access and service in Vietnam, especially for poor and rural customers. In spite
of rapid increase in access to electricity from around 51 percent in 1996 to over 80
percent at the household level in 2003, there were still around 16 million people,
representing about 3.5 million households, without electricity. Moreover, the rural
population with access to electricity suffered from low quality of service, including low
voltage and poor reliability. This was mainly caused by the traditional electrification
approach where Vietnam Electricity (the EVN), the incumbent state-owned utility,
provided medium voltage (MV) connections to the center of the communes but the local
community, households and provincial governments had to take the responsibility for
mobilizing funds, purchasing and installing equipment for the low voltage (LV) grid and
for its operation and management. Most local grids were poorly designed and constructed,
leading to substantial technical losses varying from 20 to 50 percent. Since the local grid
purchased power at a fixed price, the cost of these losses had to be recovered from the
consumers, leading to high power prices ranging from VND 1,000 to VND 2,000 per
kWh or almost two to three times the nationally prescribed residential tariffs. There were
often insufficient funds for rehabilitation, and in some cases, even for routine operations
and management (O&M). Therefore, there was a strong demand to ensure better
distribution of the benefits of electricity supply to all segments of the population, by
improving service in rural areas, both to improve living standards directly, and to support
development of local industrial, agricultural, and commercial activities for economic
growth and development.
2.       Government Decree No. 45 issued in 2001 outlined the government’s rural
electrification strategy at the time of approval, including provisions that: (a) licenses must
be obtained by all entities engaged in design or operation of electricity generation,
transmission, distribution, or any other related business; (b) diversification in investment
and management of rural electrification facilities would be encouraged; (c) certain
projects in rural areas could obtain favorable loans from the government; (d) the Prime
Minister (PM) would set national ceiling prices, but the chairmen of the Provincial
People’s Committees (PPCs) would regulate specific regional prices; and (e) a
framework would be followed for new investment in rural distribution. According to this
new framework, EVN would invest in and manage MV lines and LV transformers; the
provinces would invest in and manage LV lines; users would have to pay for their
connections; and the government would provide financial support for LV lines and
connections in various parts of the country.
3.     The principal requirement for the above policy was the need to provide financial,
regulatory and institutional conditions that encouraged the distribution utilities to renew
and extend the networks and maintain them in good condition in a financially sustainable
manner. To do this, the government decided that EVN and its subsidiaries would be
responsible for financing and implementing investments in the MV network, while the


                                              1
provinces would be in charge of the LV network. Local participation in the LV system
was critical since the existing grids had been built with their financial contributions.
Similarly, provincial governments had played a key role in supporting these investments
and were expected to continue to do so in the future.
4.      Upon completion of construction of the LV networks, it was expected that they
would be managed locally and existing informal rural distribution units would be
converted to legally constituted local distribution utilities (LDUs). All LDUs needed to
(a) be established as legal entities; (b) have technically sound investment and operational
business plans, and (c) have sufficient financial viability and sustainability. The PPC was
required to transfer the ownership of the assets to the LDUs after completion of
construction.
Rationale for Bank Assistance
5.      The Second Rural Energy (RE2) project was well-aligned with the Bank’s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Vietnam, covering the period from 2003 to 2006.
The project supported one of the three broad CAS thematic objectives, namely ‘equitable,
socially inclusive, and sustainable development’. The project aimed to contribute to that
objective by narrowing the development gap of disadvantaged and lagging areas in terms
of electricity access.
6.       The project fit well with the World Bank strategy in energy. At the time of
appraisal, the Bank focused on four themes: (a) improving energy access to rural areas;
(b) helping the country mobilize finance for meeting the rapidly growing demand; (c)
improving the technical, commercial and financial efficiency of the energy system; and
(d) initiating a reform of the sector including market restructuring, sector, and corporate
governance. The project was consistent with the Bank strategy and was closely aligned
with the government’s long term objective of universal access.
7.      The RE2 project was a major part of Vietnam’s rural electrification program, for
which the Bank had been an important strategic partner since the late 1990s, starting with
the first Rural Energy (RE1) project (Credit 3358-VN, closed in FY2007). Vietnam’s
rural electrification effort has achieved remarkable results in providing electricity to more
than 90 million people over a period of 30 years, from only 1.2 million people with
access in 1976 (2.5 percent of households) to 92 million in 2013 (97.1 percent of
households). The program and its priorities have evolved over time from providing
simple electricity connections to developing and implementing strategic plans to meet
rapidly growing demands for energy and improving the quality of supply.
8.      As the government’s program evolved, so did the Bank’s support, as illustrated in
Figure 1. The RE2 project was the second in a planned series of four. The RE1 project
focused on increasing the number of basic connections. The RE2 project focused on
rehabilitation of the existing LV systems and the institutional development to ensure
service delivery at the retail level. The Rural Distribution Project (Credit 4000-VN,
closed in FY2013) focused on the improvement of the MV systems and supported
corporate development of the power distribution companies. The Distribution Efficiency
Project (DEP, Credit 5156-VN, ongoing) supports Vietnam’s Power Companies (PCs) in
providing quality and reliable electricity services and in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions through demand side response and efficiency gains.

9.       The RE2 project mainly supported the fifth and sixth phases of Vietnam’s
electrification program: ‘focus on quality and regulation (Phase 5)’ and ‘consolidation for
the last mile (Phase 6)’. In particular, it focused on the government’s priorities in Phase 5
including (a) a shift from network expansion to rehabilitation; and (b) direct government
support to extend electricity access, particularly to minorities and those in remote areas.
10.     Inclusion of Global Environment Facility (GEF) financing was expected to
deepen the efforts to ensure that the institutional and regulatory reforms take root and
replicate best practice to other LDUs that were not included in the early phases of the
project. GEF financing was expected to permit the development of an enhanced technical
assistance (TA) program which enables the regulatory reform to be broadened and
deepened, reinforcing the incentives for the LDUs to operate in a technically,
commercially, and financially efficient way.
1.2 Original PDO and Key Indicators (as approved)
11.     The overall development objective of the project was to improve access to good
quality, affordable electricity services to rural communities, in an efficient and
sustainable manner to support Vietnam's efforts toward socio-economic development.
12.     The PDO was to be achieved through: (a) major upgrade and/or expansion of
rural power networks in about 1,200 communes; (b) conversion of ad hoc local electricity
management systems to LDUs as legal entities recognized under Vietnamese law, to
improve management of power distribution in rural areas, improve financial
sustainability and better enable future mobilization of private funds; and (c) capacity
building assistance for the LDUs, provincial authorities, participating regional power




                                             3
companies, and national authorities involved in the planning and regulation of rural
electrification.
13.        The four key performance indicators at the PDO level were:
      a.   Rural communities with electricity on average in project provinces and percentage
           of households with access;
      b.   Average distribution system losses in project LDUs (%);
      c.   Average cost-recovery price needed for power in project LDUs (VND/kWh); and
      d.   Average commercial efficiency (improvement in billing and collection rates,
           reduction of non-technical losses calculated in accordance with an index to be
           agreed upon).
14.        The eight key output indicators at the intermediate outcome level were:
      a.   Length of LV lines installed (thousand circuit km);
      b.   Capacity of transformers installed (MVA);
      c.   Number of households with meters installed in the project area (thousands of
           meters);
      d.   Number of communes under legal management (either LDU or EVN);
      e.   Length of MV lines installed (thousand circuit km)
      f.   Policy and guidelines in place for management of rural electrification by
           provinces;
      g.   Adoption of new policies and regulations for the sustainable management of
           commune electricity system by the LDU or EVN; and
      h.   Number of technicians and managers trained.
1.3 Original GEO and Key Indicators (as approved)
15.     The GEO was to reduce GHG emissions by improving and sustaining the energy
efficiency of the LDUs.
16.     The performance indicator at the GEO level was reduced emissions of carbon
(tons) derived from reduced average losses and agreed methodology calculated by the
Project Management Board (PMB).
1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification
17.     The PDO was not revised. Following the approval of the Additional Financing
(AF) in 2009, the project outcome indicators were revised to reflect the increase of the
project’s coverage from 1,200 to 1,500 communes. Intermediate indicators for
installation of lines, transformers and household meters were also increased accordingly.
Table 1 shows the list of the revised outcome indicators.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
18.     The GEO was not revised. Following the approval of AF in 2009, the outcome
indicator was revised from 259 to 310 thousand tons to reflect the scale-up of the project.
1.6 Main Beneficiaries
19.     The primary beneficiaries targeted by the project were the rural population in the
project areas. Rehabilitation and reinforcement of existing sub-transmission and
distribution systems would reduce losses, improve safety and reliability and enhance the
quality of service. The reduction of losses was expected to lower electricity prices paid
by poor households in rural areas. Improvement of reliability and quality of the power
supplied would allow the rural consumers to expand productive uses of energy.
Investment in the expansion of distribution networks in rural areas would increase access
to electricity on a least cost basis to poor communes with demonstrated potential for
growth. The project was expected to secure efficient and reliable power supply for about
2 million households, representing more than 50 percent of those without electricity at the
time of appraisal. It was estimated that about 10 million people benefit from the project.
1.7 Original Components (as approved)
20.    The project provided funding for the EVN and the affiliated PCs for upgrading
and rehabilitating MV systems, to the provinces for upgrading and installing LV systems,
and for the conversion of existing commercial and district electricity groups (CEGs) into
LDUs. The project also funded a TA to improve the regulation and management of the
LDUs. The project’s five main components at the time of approval and the corresponding
financing amounts are listed below.
21.    Component A: Major upgrading and/or expansion of LV system in the rural
power network in 1,200 communes (Total cost $242.8 million, of which the Bank
funded $162.8 million). This component was implemented by 30 provinces, with
technical support and assistance from EVN subsidiaries.




                                              5
22.    Component B: Major upgrading and/or expansion of MV system in the
Northern Region (Total cost $42.2 million, of which the Bank funded $33 million).
This component was expected to rehabilitate MV systems in the project communes where
LV systems were rehabilitated and/or expanded under Component 1. The component was
implemented by Power Company No.1 (PC1).
23.    Component C: Major upgrading and/or expansion of MV system in the
Southern Region (Total cost $11.2 million, of which the Bank funded $8.5 million).
This component was expected to rehabilitate MV systems in the project communes
supported under Component 1. The component was implemented by Power Company
No.2 (PC2).
24.    Component D: Major upgrading and/or expansion of MV system in the
Central Region (Total cost $18 million, of which the Bank funded $14.2 million).
This component was expected to rehabilitate MV systems in the same project communes
supported under Component 1. The component was implemented by Power Company
No.3 (PC3).
25.     Component E: Technical assistance (Total cost $7 million, of which the Bank
funded $1.5 million and GEF $5.25 million). This component supported: (a) the
development and implementation of a framework for regulation of companies and
cooperatives and building the capacity of national and provincial authorities in planning
and regulation of rural electrification; (b) transformation of LDUs into legal entities; (c)
strengthening the abilities of the LDUs in commercial, technical and financial
management of electricity distribution companies; and (d) replication of the best practices
developed in other LDUs participating in the later phases of the project.
1.8 Revised Components
26.    The five components remained the same, but there were several changes to their
coverage, including the scaling up of the project and change in participating provinces.
These are detailed in section 1.9.
1.9 Other significant changes
27.    Although the overall design of the project remained unchanged during
implementation, there were significant changes to: (a) the scale of the project; (b) the
schedule of implementation; and (c) the funding allocations across the components.
28.     An AF of $200 million equivalent was approved in July 2009 to: (a) address
financing gaps in the original components, due to the high inflation observed in 2008, and
ensure completion of the original subprojects for 1,200 communes; and (b) scale up the
project activities to an additional 300 communes. Therefore, the scale of the project was
expanded from the originally envisaged 1,200 to 1,500 communes.
29.     The number of participating provinces was reduced to 25 from the originally
identified 30 in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). Six provinces asked, or were
asked by the government, to withdraw from the project mainly due to their inability to
comply with the project conditions, such as counterpart funding, transfer of LV network
management to LDUs, or completion of project preparation in time. On the other hand,
one province joined the project during implementation.



                                             6
30.   At the time of AF approval, the project closing date was also extended from
December 2011 to June 2014 to allow for the additional time needed for procurement and
implementation of the subprojects that were financed under the AF.
31.     In December 2013, a project restructuring was carried out, allowing the Northern
Power Corporation (NPC)1 to use the credit proceeds to rehabilitate and expand not only
the MV but also the LV networks and increasing the Designated Account (DA) ceiling
for the NPC to enable faster disbursement for the last period of the project. The
restructuring was necessary because the NPC took over the LV networks from some
LDUs, in line with the requirements of the PM Decision No. 21.
2. Key Factors affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
32.     The project design was well-aligned with the GoV’s rural electrification policy at
the time of approval. At that time, the quality and reliability of electricity supply was
emerging as an important issue. Therefore, the focus of the GoV’s program was on
quality and regulation. Accordingly, along with network expansion, the program’s focus
shifted to rehabilitation, and ensuring and addressing institutional shortcomings.
33.     The project design was technically robust, and the flexibility built into the design
was critical to successful achievement of PDO. To enable support for numerous
subprojects, with different implementation speeds, it was decided at the time of appraisal
that the project would be implemented in four phases. In phase 1, project packages for the
first 6 provinces, covering 355 communes, were appraised. In subsequent phases,
subprojects were added to the project scope, subject to their meeting established criteria
for economic, financial, technical, and social and environmental safeguards performance.
This approach allowed the efficient use of funding, and allocation of available financing
between subprojects that needed funds. As a result of this flexibility built in to the design,
as conditions evolved and as the eligibility of provinces changed, six out of the 30
provinces identified in the PAD withdrew from the Project, while a newly eligible one
joined. There were total 25 provinces participating in the Project.
34.     The project design took into account the lessons of earlier operations. First, the
flexibility of the project implementation was introduced in the light of lessons from two
earlier operations: (a) the Power Development Project (Credit 2820, closed in 1999); and
(b) Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project (Credit 2724, closed in 2000). At
the design stage, flexibility was recognized as key to help cope with delays caused by
approval procedures, foreign exchange fluctuation, financial difficulties of suppliers and
contractors, and insufficient on-time information and guidelines from line ministries and
relevant agencies. Second, the previous operation, the RE1 project, drew important
lessons, including (a) institutional changes needed to be designed and planned carefully

legally re-established as 5 PCs in 2010. PC1 was merged with Hai Phong PC, Hai Duong PC, and Ninh
Binh PC to form Northern Power Corporation (NPC); PC2 was merged with Dong Nai PC to form
Southern Power Corporation (SPC) and PC3 was merged with Da Nang PC and Khanh Hoa Joint Stock
Company to form Central Power Corporation (CPC).

with the full participation of local authorities to ensure effective implementation; (b)
importance of community participation had to be fully recognized; and (c) the pre-
planning of procurement activities (for example, preparation of a common set of bidding
specifications, phased delivery of equipment and material, independent oversight of
construction activities) was essential.
35.     The risks associated with the project were adequately identified at the PAD stage,
most of which were associated with the large number of actors involved in LDU
rehabilitation, and the large number of LDUs to be rehabilitated. The substantial risks
identified were that (a) PPCs would be unable to create and oversee LDUs effectively and
(a) Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT)/PPCs and LDUs would not be capable of
managing the program and introducing the necessary policy and institutional changes in a
timely fashion. The capacity building activities implemented under the project’s
Technical Assistance Component largely helped mitigate these risks.
36.     Selection of PDO and key performance indicators was appropriate. However,
several intermediate indicators could have been better quantified by using the latest unit
cost information for new connections. See section 2.3 for details.
37.    Overall, the social and environmental safeguard issues were addressed adequately
in the project design to minimize social and environmental impacts and ensure
compliance with the relevant World Bank safeguard policies.
2.2 Implementation
38.    Several factors had a negative impact on project implementation, as summarized
below. However, none of them had significant impact on the achievement of PDO.
39.     Delayed start to project implementation due to new government decree. The
project was approved in November 2004, but the implementation was delayed by one
year compared with the original schedule. The primary reason for the delay was the
issuance of the government’s Decree No. 162 dated February 2005, which required that
all cost estimates and detailed designs for all project activities in any province had to be
completed and approved at the outset, before any investment could be made. The
requirements forced IAs to abandon rolling implementation in each province, as
envisaged in the original design. To resolve this, the IAs prepared all the technical
designs for all the communes in many provinces upfront and at the same time. After a
one-year delay, the ground breaking for construction works for the first subproject took
place at the beginning of 2006.
40.     Delays due to coordination challenges. Part of the delay in the early project
implementation was also caused by coordination difficulties among parties (for example,
different approval and implementation procedures of PPCs and PCs). This was an
expected challenge, especially at the beginning, as the first phase provinces moved to
implementation, but it called for renewed efforts to address coordination problems. To
streamline implementation and achieve better synchronization of MV and LV


2
  Project effectiveness was also delayed to October 2005, in order to avoid commitment fees as
procurement work was delayed due to the requirements of Decree No. 16.



                                              8
construction works, the following actions were carried out, which helped implementation
to gradually catch up with the original schedule:
     Design of a template for use by all relevant parties to closely monitor project
       implementation, required to be sent as part of monthly progress reports to the
       Bank, MoIT and EVN.
     As the main project coordinator and implementing agency for the GEF TA, the
       MoIT, assigned additional staff to closely monitor and follow up on day-to-day
       implementation of the provinces.
     The PCs established mechanisms to assist project provinces through agreement of
       cooperation, and provided on-the-job training on procurement and disbursement
       for the provincial Project Management Unit (PMU) staff.
41.    As implementation continued, it was recognized that even though the
implementation and completion of MV and LV systems at the same time is not essential,
a single coordinated design is necessary. The coordination of design of MV and LV
systems required considerable time, leading to slower implementation. This issue was
gradually resolved as the Project went on as the result of frequent discussion between
PPCs and PCs and because of the advice from the Bank team.
42.     Challenges in securing counterpart funds in some provinces. The project
required counterpart funding for each participating province. The counterpart funds for
one fourth of the total provinces were not promptly and sufficiently provided, leading to
slower implementation in those provinces. To resolve this, the provinces with insufficient
budget were dropped from the Project, and the funds were reallocated to different
participating provinces with additional demand for the Bank support and with sufficient
counterpart funds.
43.  Key success factors in implementing and achieving project outcomes are
summarized below.
44.     Good project management and close engagement by communes in project
implementation. The subprojects completed throughout project implementation were
consistently of good quality. Supply reliability and safety of systems rehabilitated under
the project were significantly improved. With the rehabilitation of the LV systems,
including meters, average losses have reduced to 10 percent from 30 percent, and reduced
to 7 percent in about 20 percent of total communes. Behind this success were good
project management and community management.
     Satisfactory project management performance by implementing agencies
        (IAs). The project involved a large number of PMUs: 29 PMUs throughout the
        country, including 25 PMUs in 25 participating provinces; three PMUs in three
        PCs; and one PMB at the MOIT in charge of overall coordination of the project
        and implementation of the TA Component. Several problems occurred during the
        early stages of project implementation 3 . As the project moved ahead, all IAs



3
 These include that (a) RE2 was the first IDA-funded project for most provinces, therefore internal
procedures were not in place and/or took time to develop; (b) coordination between relevant provincial


                                                  9
      gained experiences with project implementation. Each PPC established a steering
      committee, composed of key personnel from related departments, such as
      financial planning, resources, and environment, to supervise and guide the
      implementation of subprojects.
     Proactive participation and ownership by communes. In each project
      commune, a Public Monitoring Group (PMG) was established to support
      implementation and regularly supervise the quality of construction work. The
      communities are cognizant that the LV networks are their own assets, and that the
      quality of the completed assets will affect their daily life directly.
45.     Change in regulatory environment helped the sustainability of LDUs. The
original design assumed that the LDUs as legal entities would be responsible for the
operation and maintenance of the LV networks after project completion. PM Decision No.
21 issued in 2009 introduced a national uniform tariff, in which the tariffs in rural areas
are the same as those in urban areas. The new tariff also brought a new feature, ‘lifeline
block’ in which the first 50 kWh of consumption is subsidized and pegged at about 30-40
percent of costs. Overall, this tariff revision resulted in the reduction of the margins left
for the LDUs. This was expected to cause financial difficulties for the smaller LDUs
particularly for those in less developed and mountain areas. To mitigate this, PM
Decision No. 21 allowed the PCs to take over the ownership and management of LDU
assets. As a result, the LDUs that were not financially sustainable or had insufficient
management and operational capability transferred their LV networks to the PCs with
stronger technical and financial capability. Accordingly, most of the LDU assets that
were constructed under the RE2 project were transferred to the PCs.
46.     Flexibility in project design. The flexibility mechanism, which means that the
project did not have a full design at the beginning of the project, worked well to promote
efficient use of funds in response to the changing needs of subprojects and changing
readiness of participating provinces.
47.   There was one factor, which was out of the IA’s control, but influenced the
implementation as recorded here.
48.     Delay in implementation due to impact of 2007/2008 inflation. Sharp inflation
delayed project implementation for about 3-6 months because a large number of
contractors either refused to sign contracts, or failed to perform as specified in the signed
contracts. In fact the unit investment cost increased from $578 per household in 2005 for
RE1 project to $1,062 per household in 2009 for RE2 project4. In this context, it was
found that the original financing was adequate for only 968 of the originally identified
1,200 communes, which would have led to a reduced scale for the project. To resolve the
situation, first, an estimated $99 million out of total $200 million was provided under the



departments was not smooth at the outset; (c) provincial PMUs had much to learn, therefore effectiveness
was limited; and (d) approval process in some provinces was slow.
 4
   In 2007-2008, there was a significant increase in prices of some key foreign inputs such as aluminum,
copper and steel and domestic inputs such as cement and labor (Vietnam inflation rate between 2007 and
2011: 2007 - 12.63%; 2008 - 19.89%; 2009 - 6.52%; 2010 - 11.75%; and 2011 - 18.13%). Source: General
Statistics Office.

AF, to cover 232 communes shortfall due to inflation and the remaining $101 million was
to expand the scale of the project to reach additional 300 communes. Second, several
procurement solutions were introduced. These included: (a) rebidding of about 200
contracts which otherwise could not ensure re-start of construction work; and (b) price
adjustment through a mechanism introduced for the contracts in late 20085 or through an
agreement to compensation for incidents of default by employers.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
49.     M&E design. The PDO indicators were chosen to measure readily quantifiable
technical and financial outcomes: electrification rate in the project provinces, average
distribution losses in project LDUs, average cost-recovery rate for power supply in
project LDUs, and average commercial efficiency (with an index to be agreed upon). The
intermediate indicators were straightforward and directly connected with the physical
project outcomes as listed in section 1.2.
50.   There are two areas for better M&E design. First, ‘good quality’, which is part of
the PDO statement, should have been defined and included in the performance indicators.
51.     Second, some intermediate indicators could have been better quantified. The
target values of the length of LV line (32,000 km) and number of households with meters
installed (2,700,000) were overestimated because old information on unit investment
costs was used in their calculation. The actual cost could have been assessed better when
setting out the revised target in the AF in 2009, rather than relying on the cost
information for the RE1 project. In fact, the unit investment cost increased from $578 per
HH in 2005 that was drawn from the actual cost in RE1 to $1,062 per HH in 2009 that
was calculated from the disbursement information in RE2 because of the inflation and the
consequent price escalation for materials and labors.
52.     M&E implementation. The collection of M&E indicators was conducted
effectively. The Bank team worked with counterparts to introduce a template for use of
all the IAs to monitor implementation activities. Provincial PMUs and PCs provided
quarterly reports, which were collated by the MOIT PMB and reported to the Bank.
53.    M&E utilization. Because the indicators were designed to capture the physical
progress in a straightforward manner, and collected regularly, they were effectively used
to evaluate the timeliness of the project implementation, decide actions to remedy the
implementation delay, and help timely decision making for the AF.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
54.      Social safeguards. The project triggered OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement and
OD 4.20 - Indigenous People (replaced by OP 4.10 - Indigenous Peoples in 2005). All
safeguard documents were prepared, reviewed, cleared and publicly disclosed according
to the requirements of the Bank’s safeguard policies. The negative impacts of project
activities are generally minor because most of the lines were rehabilitated from the
existing ones. A small volume of land acquisition was required for the new alignments


5
  The mechanism allowed adjustment of contract price with fluctuations of Consumer Price Index (CPI) at
the time of billing. With this, contractors avoided the impact of inflation after late 2008.


                                                  11
and substations. The IAs managed land acquisition and compensation activities in line
with the construction schedule. However, given the difference in the impact magnitude
and the level of commitment, land acquisition and resettlement activities required under
investments implemented by Provincial PMUs (usually led by a vice-chairperson of the
PPC) were implemented more smoothly than those implemented by the PCs. A number
of difficulties were encountered during implementation, including lack of cooperation of
local authorities in some provinces; illegal encroachment of local people to pre-defined
right-of-ways; long negotiations between investors and affected households on
compensation package; and initial lack of cooperation from affected communities.
55.     According to the policy requirement, IAs mobilized independent monitoring
consultants to assess the implementation of social safeguard instruments, such as the
Resettlement Plan (RP) and the Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (EMDP). At the end
of the project, the overall compliance with social safeguard policies triggered by the
Project was Satisfactory.
56.     Environmental safeguards. The project was classified as Environmental
Category B. The only environmental safeguard policy triggered was Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). Potential impacts identified for the rehabilitation and
installation of LV and MV lines and associated transformers were localized soil erosion,
dust, noise, and solid waste management. However, these potential impacts were
identified as minor to moderate and manageable.
57.     The EVN prepared an Environmental Guidelines and Framework (EG&F) which
provides guidance on the EA process to be adopted for subprojects that were to be
considered for financing under the project to ensure compliance with relevant
government regulations and Bank safeguard policies. The subproject EAs and EMPs
were satisfactorily prepared in line with the EG&F and included detailed practical
mitigation measures and estimated budgets for their implementation, institutional
responsibilities, monitoring plans, and capacity building for environmental management
and supervision. Specific requirements were included in all bidding documents to ensure
effective execution of the mitigation measures during construction. Training on
environmental management and monitoring of EMP implementation was provided by the
Bank to the PCs, the staff of the PMUs in the distribution companies and in EVN, local
authorities and contractors. Monitoring of EMP implementation was carried out by the
technical staff of each PMU. An independent safeguards consultant, hired by the EVN
also provided semi-annual reports on EMP implementation, including results of
consultations with local communities regarding environmental concerns and complaints.
There was also community-based monitoring of EMP implementation, which was piloted
under the RE1 project and also proved to be successful in the RE2 project because
communities have a special interest in ensuring that environmental impact is minimized.
The EMPs were implemented satisfactorily as confirmed by the PMUs and the
independent safeguards consultant in project progress reports. Bank missions consistently
rated environmental performance as Satisfactory during project implementation. There
were no outstanding environmental safeguard issues.
58.    Financial management. Project performance in financial management (FM) was
maintained at Moderately Satisfactory. The project financial management system and



                                           12
arrangement provided adequate assurance for the use of project funds for intended
purposes. The below are the issues identified during implementation.
a) The FM capacity at provinces’ PMUs varied and many basic financial reporting and
    internal control procedures were not strictly followed. Since the project was
    implemented in 25 provinces, once being addressed in some particular provinces, the
    FM matters raised in Aide-Memoires recurred at other provinces.
b) Regarding the inventory management practice at provincial level, there was an
    instance of lost materials or diversion of materials outside the project in one province.
    There was also a case of goods consigned to third party warehouses without valid
    documentation to secure the consignment in another province. At the end of the
    project, the two provinces were prepared to refund for these materials with a total
    refund amount of about $ 36,700 (VND 772 million) to the Bank upon receipt of
    invoices from LOA client service.
c) Regarding the quality of financial reporting and oversight, there was a lack of review
    of audit reports and audited financial statements before submitting to the Bank and
    qualified entity audit reports.
59.   The above FM issues did not have a significant impact on either the overall
outcomes of the project or the achievements of the PDOs.
60.     Procurement. Project implementation performance for procurement was rated
satisfactory. The project included a very large number of contracts and complex
decentralized arrangements for procurement. There were more than 1,000 contracts,
mostly for the procurement of goods, mainly through international competitive bidding
(ICB), and procurement of works, mainly through national competitive bidding (NCB).
Procurement processes for these contracts were managed by 29 PMUs located throughout
the country. With the exception of contracts tendered during the price escalation period,
the bidding of most contracts resulted in cost savings of 10-15 percent compared with the
official pre-bid cost estimates.
61.     Major procurement issues that caused some delays included: (a) weak
procurement capacity of some PMUs especially early in project implementation; (b)
inadequate understanding of Bank procurement guidelines by a number of provincial
agencies responsible for review and clearance of PMU procurement decisions; (c) weak
contract management capacity in some provinces; (d) the nature of works–small and
scattered in remote rural areas–failing to attract strong and capable contractors; (e) the
unavailability of construction sites in some provinces at the timing required in contracts.
However, this situation improved as the IAs learned from their experience and with Bank
support. The Bank’s close oversight and detailed guidance in all phases of the Project
helped to ensure the transparency and effectiveness of all procurements, thus contributing
to the IAs’ ability to procure quality goods and works in a competitive manner.
62.    Some complaints were reported and were resolved in a satisfactory manner. No
cases of fraud and corruption have been detected to date.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
63.  Post-completion arrangements. Following completion and commissioning of
MV and LV network rehabilitation and expansion, the ownership and operation of the


                                            13
assets have been transferred to the PCs, while a small number of subprojects are under
the management of the LDUs. Subprojects under PCs’ management will be technically
and financially sustainable considering the PCs’ technical and financial capacity.
Subprojects currently under LDUs will also be transferred to PCs. The process of asset
handover needs to resolve differences in valuation of the assets to be transferred,
primarily due to the mismatch between the depreciation period allowed for in government
regulations and the on-lending repayment period in the FA for the Bank credit. This issue
was pointed out in the Aide Memoire dated July 22, 2014, and the government was asked
to provide clear guidance on this issue.
64.     Follow-up activities by the Bank: Several Bank financed projects have been
built on the positive outcomes of the RE2 project. In particular, the Rural Distribution
Project (RD, Cr.4444-VN, closed in 2013) is the direct follow-up to the Project, focusing
on improving the reliability and quality of medium voltage service to the targeted retail
electricity distribution systems6. The Distribution Efficiency Project (DEP, Cr. 5156-VN,
ongoing) continues focusing on further improving the quality and reliability of supply in
the PCs’ networks. Projects supporting power sector reform and financial viability such
as the Third Power Sector Reform Development Policy Operation (PSRDPO3, approved
on June 30, 2014); and (ii) financial diagnosis study for the EVN and its subsidiaries will
help contribute to improving the PCs’ financial position. Other projects such as the
Transmission Efficiency Project (TEP, approved in August 2014) and Trung Son
Hydropower Project (Loan 8041, on-going) include TA components to improve the
technical and financial capacity of the EVN and its subsidiaries.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
65.    The project remains highly relevant in Vietnam’s current policy priorities as well
as the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). Vietnam has made significant
progress toward achieving universal access to electricity and improving reliability of the
power supply, and these goals continue to be a priority in national policy as stated in
Vietnam’s Socio-economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2011-2015 and its Socio-
economic Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, both of which aim for sustainable
economic growth based on improving quality, effectiveness and competitiveness.
66.     The project objective is still relevant for the competitiveness and sustainability
pillars of the Bank CPS for the fiscal year 2012-2016, which in turn aligned with the
SEDP and SEDS. The RE2 project contributed to competitiveness pillar 1.2 (improved
quality and efficiency of infrastructure services) through improving the quality of
electricity distribution infrastructure and service delivery in Vietnam, while its support to
reduction of losses and GHG emissions contributed to climate change mitigation under
the sustainability pillar 2.2 (strengthened environmental protection and management).




6
  The Rural Distribution Project was approved in 2008 when a large number of subprojects under REII
original project almost finished and the MV system in some places has become a bottleneck in the power
flow from the transmission system to the low voltage systems.


                                                 14
3.2 Achievement of PDO and GEO
67.     The overall PDO was to “(a) improve access to (b) good quality, (c) affordable
electricity services to rural communities, in an (d) efficient and (e) sustainable manner to
support Vietnam's efforts towards socio-economic development”. The underlined five
aspects are assessed as follows:
(a) Improve access. Table 2 shows the status of outcome indicators regarding access
    improvement. Major upgrading and/or expansion of rural power network carried out
    by the project contributed to the improvement of electrification rate in the project
    provinces significantly exceeding the target values. The indicators for physical assets
    for LV networks (LV line and meter) also made significant progress but did not
    achieve the revised target value due to a negative economic factor (project cost
    escalation due to inflation), which is out of the IA’s control. However, looking into
    intermediate indicators, number of communes participated in the project also largely
    exceeded the target values and actual subprojects were well implemented (for figures
    by provinces, see Table A2-1 of Annex1). This is because the PPCs and NPC
    optimized the Bank’s finance to disseminate the benefits as many rural communes as
    possible. In the original project, investments at the commune level were done
    intensively of which both main lines and branch lines of the LV networks were
    rehabilitated with the new materials, thus requiring the large volume of LV lines
    invested in a commune. In the AF, the PPCs and NPC found that investments should
    be done in a more efficient way: the new investments were done for the main lines
    and the old materials (collected from the existing networks) were utilized for branch
    lines. In addition, meters were provided by LDUs or PCs from their own sources.
    Therefore, although the lengths of LV lines and the number of meters at both
    commune and project level are lower than the targets, the number of project
    participating communes and number of benefited HHs well exceeded the targets. For
    MV assets, a revision of investment plans by PCs after the Project approval resulted
    in MV lines exceeding and capacity not achieving the target values. The borrower
    ICR shows that the funds for filling the capacity targets were paid by the PCs.

Length of MV lines installed (thousand circuit km)      0       4.0        4.3       5.3

(b) Good quality. During the ICR mission, provincial department of industry and trade
    (DoIT), local authorities, LDUs and end users reported that reliability of supply and
    safety in the rehabilitated systems have significantly improved, compared to pre-


                                             15
    project period. Households now can use most home appliances, tools and machinery
    which they could not use before because of unstable voltage.
(c) Affordability of electricity service. Due to the operational improvement of the
    LDUs, the cost recovery price for electricity was reduced from 2,000 VND/kWh to
    1,300 VND/kWh, showing the increasing capability for the LDUs and PCs to supply
    affordable electricity. Furthermore, according to a study 7 , the share of electricity
    expenditures as a percentage of total cash expenditures in 2012 was calculated to be
    only 1.7% in the midlands and northern mountains, 1.8% for northern and coastal
    central, and 1.9% for Mekong Delta areas, where most of the Project provinces are
    located. These figures strongly suggests that the price of electricity in the project
    areas has become affordable to all HHs (see section 3.5 (b) for more details).
(d) Efficiency in service delivery. Technical performance of LDUs has been improved
    through the Project, with distribution losses going down to 10 percent from the pre-
    project levels of 30 percent. Economic and financial analysis (see section 3.3 and
    Annex 3) indicates the improvement of distribution loss and higher utilization of the
    invested assets stemming from expanded electricity consumption has brought positive
    financial effects to LDUs.
(e) Sustainability in service delivery. The two indicators for regulatory environment to
    ensure sustainability of rural electrification has been achieved by the issuance of the
    Prime Minister Decision No. 21 in 2009, stipulating (i) a uniform tariff system
    applicable nationwide including rural areas; (ii) sustainable LV network management
    applicable to LDUs and PCs; and (iii) guidelines for rural electrification by provinces.
    This Project supported these aspects by proposing LV management framework to be
    better operated and maintained by PCs and by providing a TA to support developing
    national rural electrification strategy up to 2020. Another indicator for capacity
    building has been also achieved by providing short and long term trainings were
    provided to 5,700 LDU and PC staff exceeding the target of 2,500.
    This project, in particular, contributed to resolving the lack of basic maintenance
    capability by providing technical training to LDU technicians, and to enhancing
    accounting and management capability of LDU to senior management and accounting
    personnel. In addition, stemming from the needs from PCs who are now more
    responsible for the service delivery to rural areas, this Project provided training for
    PC staffs to improve customer care skills with the goal of providing the best services
    with reasonable cost from the rural electrification program.
68.     The project provided access to 325,000 households located in remote rural areas
which otherwise would not have been connected. As a result, the rural electrification rate
in the participating communes reached 98.8 percent in 2013 (see Table 3). The rate would
have been 86.7 percent if not counting the new connections achieved in this project,
which is almost the same with the value measured at the project appraisal. This Project
has clearly accelerated the electrification rate in the participating areas.

69.     Overall, the outcome of this Project is assessed as Satisfactory. As the value of
 PDO indicators has been formally revised during the project, the achievement needs to be
 assessed against both original and revised target values8.
      Rating against the original target at the time of AF is assessed satisfactory. A
       comparison of progress against the project indicators at the AF show the progress
       of 50 percent of the original targets, clearly indicating being on-track to fully
       achieve the original target at completion (not assuming price escalation). But the
       cost increase due to inflation and increasing demand from the IAs to scale up the
       implementation raised the necessity of the AF.
      Achievement against the revised target at completion is also assessed
       satisfactory. The project achieved its PDO, through major upgrading and
       expansion of rural power networks, enhanced management and financial
       sustainability of those networks, and capacity building of key sector entities.
       Targets for all the PDO indicators were fully achieved or exceeded, and five out
       of eight intermediate outcome indicators were fully achieved, with significant
       progress in the targets of the remaining three indicators, when compared to the
       baseline. More than 2.65 million households benefited from the project.
70.     The target for the GEO indicator has been achieved. Significant improvement
of distribution losses from around 30 percent to 8-12 percent reduced emissions of carbon
by 365,000 tons, which surpassed the target of 310,000 tons9.
3.3 Efficiency
71.     An ICR stage economic and financial analysis was conducted for evaluating
Components A through D. These components account for 95 percent ($314 million) of
the total project cost at the appraisal stage; 97 percent ($560 million) of the total project
cost at the AF stage; and 99 percent ($554 million) of the total project cost at the
completion stage. In this section, the total project cost means the sum of that funded by
the Bank support and paid by the counterpart fund. The detailed methodology and results
are shown in Annex 3.
72.    Economic analysis: The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Net
Present Value (NPV) for the whole Project at completion were 18.2 percent and $661.5
million, respectively, indicating that the subprojects were economically viable and
increased social benefits by distributing more power with improved quality. The EIRRs

for the original subprojects were almost the same between appraisal and completion,
indicating that the factors improving economic efficiency (for example, cost
overestimation at appraisal stage, increased consumption level) have been offset by the
factors affecting economic efficiency (for example, cost inflation during 2008-2009). The
values for the additional subprojects were also sound and better than the original
subprojects, but several data on province level shows reduced economic return compared
with the estimation at appraisal. This is because of the overestimation of electricity
consumption levels by households and higher household incomes assumed at the time of
peak inflation during 2008-2009.

*2: EIRR/NPV for the whole project was not calculated in the Project Paper of the AF. The values for the province
level are shown in Table A3-2 of Annex 3.

73.      Financial analysis: The Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) and NPV for
the whole project at completion were 6.5 percent, and $567.9 million, respectively. At the
original appraisal, the FIRR was calculated as 2.1 percent, and therefore the subprojects
were generally not considered to be financially viable because of the nature of rural
electrification for which per capita network investment cost tends to be high in more
remote areas. However, the financial indicators at completion stage have been improved
because household energy consumption levels remarkably increased as a result of
network expansion to the remote areas. Financial viability of the invested assets is largely
dependent on the reduced losses of the network and the difference between selling and
buying price. Future perspectives on this aspect are discussed in section 4 and Annex 3.

74.     Based on the economic efficiency meeting the original expectation and the
financial efficiency exceeding original expectations, the efficiency of this project is rated
Satisfactory.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
75.    The overall outcome of the RE2 project is rated as Satisfactory based on high
relevance of the project to the country policy and the Bank’s CPS, Satisfactory rating of
achievement of PDO/GEO, and Satisfactory rating for efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
76.     Although a specific study to assess impacts of the RE2 project on poverty, gender,
and social development was not conducted, a recent study of rural electrification in
Vietnam showed that access to good quality electricity supply contributes to improving
the quality of life for rural families 10 . The study points out that the benefits include
financial savings from reduced use of kerosene for lighting and batteries; and increased
ownership of time-saving appliances, freeing up time otherwise spent on household
chores for other productive activities, reading, socializing and leisure. The availability of
electricity has also contributed to higher school enrollment of rural youth, increased farm
productivity, and higher household incomes.
77.     Gender and social aspects have been assessed from the perspective of tariff
reform. Since issuance of the PM Decision No. 21, residential electricity tariffs have
continually increased towards reaching cost recovery levels–a key component of sector
financial sustainability. As of August 2013, the average retail tariff had reached 1,509
VND per kWh (7.1 cents per kWh). A recent assessment of the impact of tariff increases
found the following11:
        (i) On national average, Vietnamese households spent 2.1 percent (2.4 percent
             for the poor) of their total expenditure on electricity payments in 2012,
             indicating the affordability of electricity.
        (ii) The share was only 1.7% in the midlands and northern mountains, 1.8% for
             northern and coastal central, and 1.9% for Mekong Delta areas, where most of
             the Project provinces are located.
        (iii)Even after taking into account the price increase in 2013 and hypothetical
             increase in 2014, the impact is acceptable and electricity remains affordable
             for all income groups.
        (iv) Social tariffs for low-income customers, which were introduced by PM
             Decision No. 268/2011 on the retail electricity tariff in 2011, have remained at
             an affordable level. Poor households consuming less than 50 kWh per month
             are charged a tariff of VND 993 per kWh (4.7 cents per kWh), and each
             household receives VND 30,000 per month support in cash.
        (v) The difference in terms of the share of electricity expenditure between male-
             headed and female-headed households is small.
78.    This assessment indicates that overall electricity remains affordable for
households, including the poor in remote areas. Looking ahead, it will be necessary to
continue to monitor the affordability because of the upcoming government initiatives
including: (i) transitional arrangement toward cost reflective tariffs for financial

sustainability of the sector12; and (ii) overall social protection reform under consideration,
which could have an impact on the existing support scheme for electricity payment13.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
79.     The RE2 project was implemented during a time of significant institutional
change in Vietnam’s power sector. The project contributed to institutional strengthening
during this change process through Component E by: (i) helping transform LDUs into
legal entities; (ii) strengthening the abilities of the LDUs/PCs in commercial, technical,
and financial management of electricity distribution networks; and (iii) disseminating and
replicating emerging good practices in other LDUs participating in later project phases.
80.     Support to institutional strengthening under the RE2 project has been effective.
The training program, which was developed based on a needs assessment, was attended
by many more LDU staff than originally planned and highly appreciated by the
participants. The quality of the training was relevant to the technical, commercial and
financial aspects of LDU sustainability. The LDUs reported in their borrower ICRs that
the training helped improve the daily operation and management of LV networks such as
efficient preparation of business plan, more systematic book and record keeping, and
reduced time for discovering and fixing problems, etc. This achievement was backed by
knowledge exchange among the PCs and LDUs, and study tours to learn from
international experience in rural electrification.
81.    Looking ahead, with the absorption of many LDUs by larger PCs, the financial
and technical sustainability of the PCs will be a key to maintaining project outcomes.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating: Moderate
84.    Main risk factors that may affect the sustainability of the RE2 project outcomes
include increasing energy consumption in project areas; technical capability of the LDU
and PC for operation and maintenance; and financial stability of the LDUs and PCs. The
ways in which these factors may pose risks to the PDO and GEO are described below.
    a) Reliability and quality of power supply through increased energy
       consumption. The risk that increasing energy consumption in project areas might
       lead to deterioration of the reliability and quality of power supply over time is

   The World Bank supports Vietnam’s social protection reform through Social Assistance System
Strengthening Project (P123960). This program includes supporting the “Opportunity Program” to be
piloted in four provinces after 2015, in which several social protections including the electricity subsidy of
VND 30,000 per month will be consolidated to a single protection.


                                                     20
      assessed as Moderate. The risk has been mitigated by the implementation of Rural
      Distribution (RD) Project and Distribution Efficiency Project (DEP), which aims
      to improve the performance of PCs in quality and reliability of electricity services.
      Areas of implementation largely overlap with those in the RE2 project, and the
      subprojects are built on those areas implemented by the RE2 project.
   b) Limitations to technical capability of LDUs and PCs. The risk that limitations
      to technical capability of LDUs and PCs may affect operation and maintenance of
      network assets and hence their sustainability is assessed as Low. The PCs have a
      proven track record of operating and maintaining distribution assets in a
      technically acceptable manner. Technical capacity of the LDUs has improved by
      the capacity building under the RE2 project. Moreover, there is continued support
      from larger PCs to the LDUs – in fact, there are many cases where the LDUs are
      supported by technical advisors sent by the nearest PCs. It is highly unlikely that
      the assets are poorly utilized due to a lack of technical experience.
   c) Weak financial situation of the LDUs. The risk that weak financial situation of
      the LDUs may affect sustainability of project outcomes is rated as Substantial.
      The ICR team’s analysis shows that profits for the LDUs has been reduced due to
      the tariff restructuring that has been implemented since the issuance of PM
      Decision No. 21 in 2009. It is estimated that if the current tariff systems are
      maintained, 75 percent of LDUs in the plains and all (100 percent) LDUs in
      mountainous areas would need to transfer their network to the PCs. This risk will
      be mitigated if, as encouraged in PM Decision No. 21, LV assets of the LDUs are
      transferred to the more financially credible PCs. In fact, the ICR team has been
      informed that most of the invested LV assets have been or are being transferred to
      the PCs’ management. See section C of annex 3 for details.
   d) Financial Stability of the PCs. The risk of financial stability of the PCs affecting
      project outcomes is assessed as Substantial. The Bank-financed TA on the
      strategic options for financial recovery of the power sector indicates that further
      rationalization of the tariff system and price level is critical for the PCs to
      maintain an appropriate level of financial health which allows both good
      operation and maintenance of the invested distribution assets and meeting huge
      investment needs by 2020 (see section D of annex 3 for details). This risk will be
      mitigated by the Bank’s comprehensive support to Vietnam combining
      investment projects such as the DEP, TA such as ‘Strategic options for financial
      recovery of power sector’ and ‘Wholesale Market Development’, and a new series
      of Power Sector Reform Development Policy Operations.
85.     Taking all these aspects into account with a particular emphasis on financial
sustainability of the LDUs and PCs, the risk to the sustainability of development
outcomes is assessed as Moderate because the on-going Bank-financed projects and
various TA activities have been mitigating those risks effectively.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory


                                           21
86.    Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Satisfactory. The project
design was aligned with the direction of the GoV’s rural electrification policy at the time
of approval. Responding to the emerging issue of quality and reliability of electricity
supply, the project design correctly incorporated rehabilitation in its design, and included
capacity building efforts to address institutional shortcomings alongside network
expansion. The project took into account lessons learned from past operations, including
the RE1 project, and analytical work. Among the lessons incorporated into design, the
use of a flexibility mechanism to allow efficient use of funding in response to changing
circumstances was the key to achievement of the PDOs. Other lessons that were
incorporated, and had a bearing on achievement of results are: (i) institutional change
should be planned carefully with full participation of local authorities to ensure effective
implementation; (ii) importance of community participation should be fully recognized;
and (iii) pre-planning of procurement activities is essential. The implementation
arrangements, according to which rehabilitation of LV networks was carried out by
provinces and rehabilitation of MV networks was carried out by the PCs were appropriate,
given the institutional structure of the power sector at the time of appraisal. Social and
environmental safeguards issues were identified and addressed adequately in the project
design, in a way that minimized social and environmental impacts and ensured
compliance with the relevant Bank policies.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
87.     Investments in LV and MV networks (Components A-D). The Bank team,
through periodical implementation support missions as well as ongoing exchanges,
regularly and thoroughly monitored the project implementation progress of each
participating province and IA, worked with the PMUs for capacity building and
implementation support, and worked with the counterparts to identify and develop
solutions to issues encountered during implementation, such as cost inflation, land
acquisition and compensation delays. The team and IAs gradually developed a standard
reporting form, which streamlined implementation support for as many as 25 provinces.
One drawback was that the team could have assessed the actual cost performance better
when determining the revised target at the time of the AF rather than relying on the cost
information for the RE1 project.
88.     Technical assistance (Component E). The Bank team provided adequate support
to help the government and the IA to achieve the objectives set out in the PAD. The
training program, which was developed based on a needs survey, surpassed the target.
The quality of the training was relevant to the technical, commercial and financial aspects
of LDU sustainability.
89.    The quality of supervision for fiduciary, procurement and safeguard aspects has
been satisfactory throughout the project. Specialist Bank staff worked with counterparts
to identify fiduciary and safeguard issues in a timely manner, and advised the IAs on
options for addressing issues and achieving compliance with the Bank policies.
Necessary training was also provided by the Bank. Most IAs, in their borrower
completion reports, acknowledged the vigorous implementation support of Bank experts
throughout the project.


                                            22
90.     It is assessed that the Bank team was adequately composed of specialist staff
based in Hanoi and technical staff from Washington D.C., to achieve the above quality of
supervision. Key staff including the Task Team Leader, safeguards, fiduciary and
procurement specialists were all Hanoi-based, which enabled an effective decentralized
project implementation allowing intense communication and timely ad-hoc advice to IAs.
91.    In light of the above, the Bank’s supervision quality is assessed as Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
92.    The overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory. This rating reflects the
technically sound project design; strong implementation support to the client; effective
monitoring of as many as 25 provinces; and good technical and project implementation
advisory support provided in close coordination with the IAs and the Bank fiduciary and
safeguard specialists, which together contributed to the achievement of project outcomes.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
93.     A significant achievement has been made in rural electrification in Vietnam, with
household electricity access rate growing from 2.5 percent in 1975 to over 97 percent in
2013. This is due to the government’s continuous efforts in addressing a wide array of
challenges and balancing the interests of the local, provincial and central governments.
An important milestone for rural electrification was made during the RE2 project. PM
Decision No. 21 dated 2009 stipulated a unified national tariff for all residential
consumers, alongside an incremental block tariff (IBT) arrangement, with a new life
block to protect poor customers, who mostly reside in remote areas. The decision also
allowed the take-over of financially weak LDUs by the PCs. In fact, a significant portion
of rural distribution assets under the financially weak LDUs were absorbed by the PCs
with more financial and technical capability.
94.     The central government guided the provinces to include rural electrification
efforts in their social development plan/strategy, which was one of the strongest
incentives for the provincial governments to assign higher priority to the RE2 project.
95.      Going forward, the GoV continues to be committed to ensuring the sustainability
of achievements to date, by approving the overall program (PM Decision No. 2081 dated
2013) of power supply for unelectrified rural households from the national grid and/or
renewable energy sources in the period 2014-2020 with the investment capital needs of
$1.5 billion. In addition, the government shows a strong intention to realize a financially
sustainable power sector, which is evident by the collaborative work with the Bank on
this critical issue as described in section 4.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
96.    The participating provinces as IAs were able to complete almost all of the planned
subprojects, because of their continuous commitment and dedicated project management


                                            23
activities. Although the provinces faced difficulties, which included limited experience of
the PMUs; insufficient coordination between the PCs and provinces; lack of procedure
for compliance and monitoring of safeguard, fiduciary and procurement aspects; and
price escalation, hindering the physical implementation progress, IAs gained experience
over time and the implementation gradually was on track with the original schedule.
97.     The PCs as IAs played a greater role in this project. Guided by PM Decision No.
21, the PCs implemented not only MV grid expansion and rehabilitation, but also LV
rehabilitation and take-over of the LV assets originally managed by financially weak
LDUs. It was observed by the ICR team that the PCs continuously assisted the LDUs
through technical advice on the operation and maintenance of the local grid system.
Meanwhile, as stated in section 2.4, the PCs faced several implementation issues, and
some of them, particularly the quality of financial reporting, continued to be a problem.
Streamlining of implementation and better synchronization of MV and LV construction
works has been an issue throughout the project period.
98.     Proactive participation from communes was effective to the successful
implementation of subprojects with good technical quality. In each project commune, a
PMG was established to support project implementation. It was reported that the quality
of construction work was regularly overseen by this PMG. The communities recognize
that the LV networks are their own assets, and that the quality of the completed assets
will affect their daily life.
99.     Overall performance of IAs is rated satisfactory. Strong commitment and
dedicated work by both the provinces and PCs, combined with proactive community
participation, led to successful completion of this project. Although there were
moderately satisfactory FM aspects, their impact to achieve the PDO was not significant.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
100. Given the government’s satisfactory performance and the IA’s satisfactory
performance, the overall borrower performance for this project is rated Satisfactory. The
strong commitment from both the central and provincial government and more
importantly proactive engagement from the local community led to the successful
completion of the project. Although the IAs faced several implementation and fiduciary
issues, these did not cause significant impacts to the achievement of the PDO.
6. Lessons Learned
Project Design
   a) Strong commitment by the government is essential for project success, and the
       degree of such commitment is evidenced by several factors, including: (i)
       government vision for rural electrification, and the commitment on policy
       guidance, regulation and physical investment; and (ii) proper guidance by the
       government to the relevant IAs.
       In the RE2 project, the central government guided the provinces to include rural
       electrification efforts in their social development plan/strategy, which is one of
       the most important provincial activities. This guidance was a strong incentive for
       the provincial governments to assign higher priority on the RE2 project.


                                            24
   b) Phased approach is important when a project has a large number of subprojects
      that are implemented in multiple locations over a long period. This approach is
      particularly important to power distribution projects to accommodate the
      changing situations of IAs. This approach helps better listing of subprojects,
      leading to efficient use of funds and better achievement of the PDO.
   c) Key performance indicators (in particular, quantitative indicators) need to be set
      using the latest cost information/data, and updated where appropriate, especially if
      there is an additional financing. This lesson is particularly important in the
      presence of steep currency inflation or deflation.
   d) A single coordinated design is needed when various stakeholders are involved in
      the actual implementation. To do this, considerable time is needed, sometimes
      leading to slower implementation of the whole project.
Project and Contract Management
   a) Project implementation tends to get delayed when project management capacity
       of the IAs is limited or when they have little experience on Bank procedures. In
       that case, the Bank team should be realistic in planning the implementation and
       disbursement schedule, particularly at an early project stage. To enhance the
       familiarity to project management on Bank’s procedures, it is desirable to carry
       out information dissemination activities such as project launch workshop, develop
       project operation manuals, and conduct relevant implementation support mission.
   b) Community supervision of technical quality and safeguards aspects is a highly
       effective means of enhancing community ownership. This also helps mitigate
       disputes and helps resolve issues promptly.
   c) Changes in macroeconomic conditions can hamper the smooth implementation of
       the project. In this project, a sharp inflation caused delays in project
       implementation by affecting the underlying contracts, which were terminated in
       some cases or had to go through lengthy rebidding processes in others.
Social and Environmental Safeguards
   a) For further strengthening the implementation of social safeguards, attention
       should be given to: (i) information disclosure and consultation in a more
       targeted/tailored manner; (ii) implementation of developmental activities (for
       example, training) provided to ethnic minority communities; (ii) close
       collaboration with the local authorities to match the proposed developmental
       support and local needs.
   b) Involving local authorities is critical to successful safeguard activities. In fact in
       the RE2 project, land acquisition and resettlement activities required under
       investments implemented by the provincial PMUs were implemented more
       smoothly than those implemented by the PCs.
Financial Management
   a) In a project involving many IAs with different FM capacity, Financial
      Management Manual (FMM) should be enforced and should serve as guidance for
      FM staff at all levels throughout the implementation of the projects. It is also
      suggested that future power projects involve less PPMUs (not more than ten) to



                                            25
      ensure adequate resources from both the Bank’s team and the Central PMU can
      be allocated to FM supervision and monitoring.
   b) The inventory management procedures and contract management should be
      clearly set out in the FMM and with training provided to all IAs.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component 1: Major upgrading and/or expansion of LV system in the rural power
network in 1,200 communes
The component included the rehabilitation and expansion of the LV systems in
approximately 1,200 communes in about 30 provinces. The component aimed to improve
and expand the power supply to about 2 million households, of which about 200,000
were to be connected. The PPCs of the project provinces were designated as the IAs.
The final number of participating provinces was 25 compared with 30 identified in the
PAD. Six provinces asked or were asked to withdraw from the project, mainly due to
their inability to comply with the project conditions, such as counterpart funding,
converting the management to LDUs, or completion of project preparation in time. On
the other hand, one province (Quang Nam province) newly joined the project during the
project implementation as a result of the flexibility incorporated in the project design and
strong commitments from participating provinces.
During implementation, particularly in 2007-2008, world prices of some key power
sector commodities such as aluminum, copper and steel increased markedly and Vietnam
suffered a period of high inflation of costs of inputs such as cement and labor. To offset
the cost increase and depreciation, the original project could cover only 968 communes.
The approved FA in 2009 aimed to help finance the cost associated with completion of
the original project activities as a result of the above mentioned financing gap. The plan
was to enable completion of the original target of about 1,200 communes, compared with
the 968 for which funds were sufficient; and to implement expanded activities to scale up
project impacts and development effectiveness by increasing the number of communes
from 1,200 to 1,500.
Although the original project design assumed the project provinces as the IAs for LV
rehabilitation and expansion, the new PM Decision No. 21 in 2009 encouraged transfer of
rural LV assets from local authorities to the PCs for better management. Since then, the
PCs started receiving a part of the rural LV networks. The NPC wanted to take advantage
of the financing opportunity of this project to rehabilitate its newly received LV networks
to enable distribution and retail business in rural areas. This was formally reflected in the
amendment to the project’s FA, following the approval of restructuring paper in 2013.
The number of rehabilitated and/or expanded communes, which is the most important
performance indicator, was 1,974 compared with the target of 1,500. This substantial
success is due to the intention by the PPCs and NPC to disseminate the benefits of the
Bank financing to as many rural communes as possible. As a result, the scale of
investment per commune became smaller than originally projected.
Table A2-1 shows the implementation results of Component 1.

      The length of LV networks installed was 27,700 km compared with the target of 32,000
      km. Also, the number of installed meters was 1,915,000 compared with the target of
      2,700,000. This was mainly caused by the performance estimation at appraisal which was
      based on the unit investment cost for new connections per household ($ per HH)
      observed in RE1 project in 2005, while actual investment for the RE2 project was carried
      out in more remote and more geographically difficult areas. The ICR team’s analysis
      shows that unit investment cost for the RE2 project was higher compared with the cost
      observed in the RE1 project.

As shown in Table A2-2, rural electrification rate in the participating communes reached
98.8 percent in 2013. The rate would have been 86.7 percent if not counting the new
connections achieved in this project, which is almost the same with the value measured at
the project appraisal. This project has clearly accelerated the electrification rate in the
participating areas.

 The length of MV networks installed in Components B to D was 5,300 km compared
 with the target of 4,300 thousand km. The capacity of installed meters was 700 MVA
 against the target of 1,100 MVA. Reduction in achievement of transformer capacity was
 caused by the revision of the PCs’ investment plan in which more funds were mobilized
 to the lines and part of the transformer investment was financed by the PC’s funds.
 Component E: Technical Assistance
 At the time of the PAD, the purpose of the TA component was described as follows:
      Purpose i. Developing and implementing a framework for regulation of
         companies and cooperatives and building the capacity of national and provincial
         authorities in planning and regulation of rural electrification;
      Purpose ii. Transforming the LDUs into legal entities;
      Purpose iii. Strengthening the abilities of the LDUs in commercial, technical and
         financial management of electricity distribution companies
      Purpose iv. Replicating of the best practices developed in other LDUs
         participating in the later phases of the project and subsequently.
 Main activities that were actually implemented are summarized as follows.
 Training needs assessment
 The training needs for LDUs were studied in 2007. The study identified a need to train
 and enhance capacity of stakeholders at all levels including the MoIT, PPCs, EVN and its


                                                  32
PCs and LDUs. The study recommended that priority should be given to building
technical, financial and management capability of LDUs.
Phase 1 - technical training for LDUs
Based on the outcomes of the training needs assessment, technical training at basic and
advanced levels were carried out to about 1,100 LDU electricians with the aim of
ensuring the sustainability of the LDUs. This is regarded as ‘phase 1’ training, which is
further improved and rolled out in the scaled-up phase 2 for a larger number of LDU staff.
Phase 2 - technical training for LDUs and PCs
An improved training program as ‘phase 2’ was provided during 2012-2014 to the staff of
the LDUs and PCs. The total number of participants for phase 1 and phase 2 training
reached 2,100. This was below the initially planned number of 6,00014 because the PM
Decision No. 21 in 2009 set forth the new policy encouraging the transfer of completed
LV assets from LDUs to PCs. This policy reduced the training needs for LDU staffs.
Training on customer service for PC staff
To further enhance capacity building and respond to a strong demand from the PCs, the
MoIT provided short-term training for about 3,600 PC staff to improve customer care
skills with the goal of providing the best services with reasonable cost from the rural
electrification program. At the outset, the training was provided to 1,600 staff. However,
as a result of the high satisfaction rating from the after-training survey and a strong
request from the PCs, an additional 2,000 staff were trained through this program.
Survey on the current situation and an assessment on the needs of rehabilitation,
upgrading and expansion of rural networks by 2020 and policy mechanisms
recommendation
The study aimed to identify (a) general solutions to provide electricity to unelectrified
rural areas; (b) recommend policies to achieve the target of rural electrification by 2020;
and (c) the potential scale to supply electricity from off-grid renewable resources to rural
hamlets and villages located in extremely difficult geographical locations.
Rebuilding the sampling list for rural electrification impact survey and analysis
The objective of this assignment is to rebuild the sampling list including the names and
addresses of respondents which were coded in the data set provided by the previous
consultants and match them with the data collected during the previous rounds of surveys,
which will be used to enable continuation of the fourth round survey to assess rural
electrification impact on poverty reduction. The survey will be used to determine
appropriate electricity pricing policies, whether there is a need for subsidies in rural areas,
and for decision support regarding appropriate sizing of electrification projects.

  The training was initially planned for one director, two technicians, and one accountant for each of the
1,500 LDUs participating in the Project.


                                                   33
Support was provided to enhance the capability of the MoIT PMU, including: (a) hiring a
full time project officer; (b) hiring a full time interpreter/secretary for speeding up
relevant activities; (c) hiring a training consultant to supervise the training process, (d)
purchasing equipment for operating the PMU office; and (e) advertising the call for bid,
translation, communication, and supervision travel.
Other activities
    Annual review meetings for the period of 2007-2014 with participation of key
      implementing agencies and related stakeholders. On 26 April, 2014, the MoIT and
      the World Bank convened a conference with the aim of reviewing 15 years of
      Vietnam’s rural electrification programs and discussing future direction.
    Study tour to Korea, Chile and Brazil during 2013-2014 with the aim of
      exchanging experiences in the field of rural electrification. The government office,
      Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), MoIT, Ministry of Finance (MOF),
      provincial PMUs, EVN, State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) and Vietnam Development
      Bank (VDB) participated.
    Capacity building for the MoIT and EVN’s staff through a series of training
      program in English, Project Management and Planning Skill and Working
      Efficiency, training course on Master of Business Administration; and Energy
      Training Week in Paris, France.
    Producing a documentary film on Vietnam's Rural Electrification
    Auditing service for the Project’s financial management.
The TA component was funded by the $5.25 million GEF fund, $1.5 million from the
Bank Credit, and $0.25 million counterpart fund. The total amount disbursed at
completion is estimated to be $4,907,000, equivalent to approximately 70 percent of the
budget. The under-projected disbursement is mainly because the phase 2 technical
training to LDUs was scaled down due to the government’s new policy in 2009
encouraging the transfer of completed LV assets from LDUs to PCs with more technical
experience and financial capability.
It is assessed that the aforementioned activities effectively supported the four purposes of
this TA component. In phase 1 and 2 of the training program, which was developed based
on needs survey, many more LDU staff were trained than originally planned. The quality
of the training was relevant to the technical, commercial and financial aspects of LDU
sustainability. The training was highly appreciated by the participants. This achievement
was backed by (a) knowledge exchange through annual meetings; (b) study tour with the
aim of exchanging views with rural electrification stakeholders in different countries; and
(c) capacity building of the MoIT PMU for better project management.
Also the activities clearly supported the government in terms of providing a proposal for
formulating a long-term electrification policy up to 2020. It is noteworthy to mention that
the implemented activities supported enhancing the government’s analytic capability to
identify poverty reduction effects of rural electrification.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Economic and financial analysis has been conducted for Components A to D of the
project. Components A to D account for 95 percent ($314 million) of the total project
cost at the appraisal stage, 97 percent ($560 million) of the total project cost at the AF
stage, and 99 percent ($554 million) of the total project cost at the completion stage. In
this section, the total project cost means the sum of that funded by the Bank support and
paid by the counterpart fund.
A)       Economic Analysis
Methodology at Appraisal
The economic analysis for the project components was carried out using two scenarios:
(i) ‘with’ the project; and (ii) ‘without’ the project. The ‘with’ project scenario means
investment in the rural networks for: (a) reduction of losses from 30-50 percent at present
to about 8 percent; (b) improvement of the supply and quality of power, so that rural
customers can use the power for the production purposes, and can avoid spending on
quality improvement devices, such as voltage stabilizers or standby diesel units; and (c)
increase in the number of electrified households in the local areas, since at the moment in
many communes proposed for the project, electrified households coverage is still less
than 80 percent. The ‘without’ project scenario is ‘doing nothing’, meaning that there
would be no investment for rehabilitation and expansion of the network, and the
condition of the existing distribution system would further deteriorate: (a) the losses
would increase; (b) rural consumers would not use grid power for productive uses due to
major voltage fluctuations; and (c) there would be no opportunity for new connections for
households, who will continue to use kerosene for lighting.
The economic analysis was done at the provincial level, which means that all the project
communes, for both MV and LV systems, in a given province, were analyzed together,
using the cost–benefit methodology. For the estimation of the economic indicators,
namely the EIRR and NPV, the following assumptions are made: (a) all the costs are
expressed in constant 2003 prices, making no adjustment for shadow exchange rate or
shadow wage rate; (b) the capital investment costs for the first phase are considered over
2005-2007, and analyses are done over a project economic life of 20 years (2005-2025);
(c) the cost for compensation, land acquisition and service drops are included in the
economic cost of the project; (d) operation and maintenance costs are estimated at 2
percent of the investment costs; (e) the input energy bought for the project is estimated to
cost 5.5 cent¢/kWh, the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) at the end of the transmission
system; and (f) the EIRR of the project component is the discount rate at which the
present value of the costs and benefits streams are equal, and the NPV is based on a
discount rate of 10 percent, which is approximately the opportunity cost of capital in
Vietnam.
Methodology at project completion
The methodology is identical to that used at appraisal, except that: (a) actual costs at
project completion are used; (b) a 20 year time horizon covering 2008 to 2028 instead of
2005–2025 for original subprojects and 2010 to 2030 instead of 2009–2029 for additional




                                            35
subprojects; and (c) the updated long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of input energy bought
for the project is estimated to cost 7.5 cents/kWh15.
For the original subprojects under which the MV and LV parts are rehabilitated and
expanded synchronously, the economic analysis was done at the provincial level, which
means that all the project communes, for both MV and LV systems, in a given province,
were analyzed together. The applied capital expenditure (CAPEX) ratio for these
subprojects is 0.93. For the additional subprojects under which rehabilitation of the MV
and LV parts are not conducted synchronously, the economic analysis was done for the
LV system only and the CAPEX ratio of 2.0 was applied for this type of subproject15.
Results and discussion
Table A3-1 and A3-2 show the results of economic analysis for original and additional
subprojects, respectively. The EIRR and NPV for the whole project at completion were
18.2 percent, and $661.5 million, respectively, indicating that the subprojects were
economically viable and increased social benefits by distributing more power with
improved quality. The reason for slightly reduced economic indicators in the original
subprojects is that the costs of these subprojects at appraisal in mid-2004 were under-
estimated. In 2007-2008, the world prices of key electrical materials such as copper and
steel significantly increased and Vietnam also suffered high inflation during this period
which caused an increase in the prices of domestic inputs such as cement and labor.
The values for the additional subprojects were also sound and better than the original
subprojects, but several data on province level shows reduced economic return compared
with the estimation at appraisal. This is because of the overestimation of electricity
consumption levels by households and higher household incomes assumed at the timing
of peak inflation during 2008-2009.

B)        Financial Analysis
Methodology at Appraisal
A financial analysis of the subprojects in the original financing was undertaken by
valuing incremental revenues and costs at the prevailing regulated tariffs in rural areas.
The real tariff was assumed to remain constant throughout the forecast period while
incorporating changes in the composition of total demand served. The estimated levels
were VND 700 per kWh for residential use and VND 1,000 per kWh for production,
commercial, and irrigation use. The following cost assumptions were made: (a) capital
costs are baseline costs plus physical and price contingencies; (b) power purchase prices
at the beginning point of 22/35 kV distribution system are estimated based on an average
current purchase price of PCs in Vietnam in addition to estimated PCs’ losses to the
point; power purchase prices are assumed to remain constant throughout the forecast
period; (c) operating and maintenance (O&M) costs for MV lines are estimated at 1
percent of investment costs and O&M costs for LV lines are estimated at 4-7 percent of
sales revenues depending on the administrative level of LV management; (d)
transmission and distribution losses are estimated at 1 percent for MV networks and
about 5.6-6.0 percent for LV networks after project implementation; (e) foreign costs are
converted to VND at the rate of 15,500 to the US dollar, assuming all investments will be
implemented during the first year; (f) local inflation is estimated at 3 percent; and (g)
income tax rate is assumed as 28 percent.
Methodology at project completion
The methodology is identical to that used at appraisal, except that: (a) actual costs at
project completion are used; (b) a 20-year time horizon covering 2008 to 2028 and 2010
to 2030 is applied for original subprojects and additional subprojects, respectively; (c) the
energy purchasing and selling costs are the average tariffs regulated by the GOV in 2010
(VND 718 per kWh and VND 1,058 per kWh) for original subprojects and 2012 (VND
1,037 per kWh and VND 1,369 per kWh) for additional subprojects; (d) the O&M costs
for both MV lines and LV lines are estimated at 2 percent of investment costs; and (e)
foreign costs are converted to USD at the rate of VND 19,500 for original subprojects
and VND 20,500 for additional subprojects.


                                                 37
For the original subprojects under which the MV and LV parts are rehabilitated and
expanded synchronously, the economic analysis was done at the provincial level, which
means that all the project communes, for both MV and LV systems, in a given province,
were analyzed together. The applied CAPEX ratio for these subprojects is 0.93. For the
additional subprojects under which rehabilitation of the MV and LV parts are not
conducted synchronously, the economic analysis was done for the LV system only and
the CAPEX ratio of 2.0 was applied for this type of subprojects.
Results and discussion
Table A3-1 and A3-2 show the results of financial analysis for original and additional
subprojects, respectively. The FIRR and NPV for the whole project at completion were
6.5 percent, and $567.9 million, respectively. At the time of original appraisal, the
subprojects were generally considered not to be financially viable because of the nature
of rural electrification that per capita investment cost for distribution network tends to be
high in remoter areas. However, the financial indicators at completion stage have been
substantially improved because the energy consumption levels by households remarkably
increased due to network expansion in the remote and deep-lying areas, and rapid growth
of demand for productive uses. It is a fact that the indicators of additional subprojects at
completion are better than that of the original subprojects because the network
improvements were implemented in the higher populated areas, while the indicators have
been slightly reduced in comparison to those at appraisal stage because successive
reductions to the margins between the energy selling and buying prices negatively
affected the viability of the LDUs. Financial sustainability of the LDUs is discussed in
next session.

C)      Financial analysis of the LDUs
One of the main objectives of the project is that after upgrading and rehabilitation of the
LV networks in the various provinces, the existing ad hoc management of the LV system
is to be converted into financially viable LDUs either as cooperatives under the
Cooperative Law or joint stock companies under the Enterprise Law. In this section,
financial analysis has been conducted to hypothetical LDUs using various assumptions.
Methodology and assumption
Analysis of the financial sustainability of the LDUs involves an analysis of the existing
electricity market, the projected electricity sales as a result of the project, the tariff
structure, the institutional arrangement to support the LDUs, and the projected financial
performance of the LDUs. These are the main assumptions for the analysis:
     a) Customer Base. The residential consumer is predominant in the rural network
        system. Residential consumers dominated the project areas on average 75 percent
        in terms of electricity sales, followed by commercial consumers by 15 percent and
        production consumers by 8 percent. Average consumption per household is
        assumed to be 922 kWh/annum (that is, approximately 80kWh/month).
     b) Electricity Sales Projection. Electricity sales for LDUs in the project area are
        expected to increase from 3,213 GWh in 2012 to 6,500 GWh in 2022. This is
        based on increased new connections, increased unit household consumption and
        projected increases in production and commercial use.
     c) Tariff. PM Decision No.21 in 2009 established the mechanism for the annual
        update of the average retail electricity tariff while ensuring the unbundling of four
        cost components (generation, transmission, distribution, and a component to cover
        system operation, regulatory costs and administrative costs). Along with this
        mechanism, the average retail electricity tariff increased by 8.92 percent to VND
        948.5 per kWh in March, 2009. Also, PM Decision No. 21 introduced several key
        instructions: (i) a national uniform retail tariff applies both in urban and rural
        areas, except for off grid areas, with a transition period for its full implementation
        in LDUs, eliminating the ceiling price of VND 700 per kWh in rural areas from
        September 1, 2009; (ii) the residential tariff is designed as an incremental block
        tariff, where the first block is subsidized and pegged at about 30-40 percent of
        costs, to represent the lifeline block, and reduced to the first 50 kWh of
        consumption, compared with 100 kWh in the previous tariff design; (iii) LDUs
        are allowed to charge a margin of 25-30 percent over the purchase prices set out
        by PCs (previously, the margin was VND 390 per kWh plus value-added tax
        (VAT)) to cover their operating costs; and (iv) if the LDU is not financially
        sustainable or its management has insufficient capacity to operate, it is
        recommended that the rural LV networks are taken over by PCs.

Through the application of these mechanisms, the average electricity tariffs have
increased steadily and have started to be revised more than once per year, as seen in
Table A3-516. Along with the update of retail tariff (that is, the LDU’s selling price), the
wholesale tariff at which the LDUs purchase from the PCs has been regularly revised.

Results and Discussion
Table A3-6 shows that the calculated margin for the LDUs as the difference between
buying and selling price has been reduced for lower consumption blocks. This indicates
that there will be increased financial uncertainty for the LDUs whose customers are
mostly residential customers with lower electricity consumption.

Table A3-7 shows several financial indicators that are projected for LDUs by size. Even
if assuming the distribution loss of 7-8 percent17 (i.e., the distribution network is well
maintained without deteriorations throughout the projection period), the calculated


16
   The current tariff revenues still do not reflect all cost items, such as foreign exchange losses and
financing costs. In addition, while nominal average electricity tariffs have increased by 44 percent over the
period 2010-2012, cumulative inflation over the same period amounted to 53 percent. Hence, further real
term increases in tariffs will be required to allow for full cost recovery and create an environment that
would attract private investors.
17
   With the rehabilitation of the LV systems, including meters, average losses have reduced to 8-10 percent
and some communes even reduced to 7 percent from the pre-project loss of 30-40%. Due to geographical
factors such as mountainous regions, remote areas and low population density, and lack of new investments
to rehabilitate and maintain the networks, these networks will be degraded and the system loss will increase
over time if there is no appropriate maintenance. Since the uniform nationwide tariff is applied in
accordance with PM Decision No.21, no surcharge fee to cover high network losses is permitted. Most of
the LDUs therefore cannot mobilize enough funds for network maintenance and expansion as required.

indicators suggest small and medium sized LDUs cannot be financially sustainable as the
network degrades and natural calamities happen over the time. Given the size of existing
LDUs of the whole project, 75 percent of LDUs in the plain areas and all (100%) LDUs
in mountainous areas would need to transfer their network to PCs.

D)      Brief Perspectives for PC’s Financial Sustainability
In the project, a substantial percentage of the invested LV networks have been transferred
from the LDUs to the PCs, in accordance with the PM Decision No. 21 encouraging such
a transfer when LDUs are not financially viable. This means that the sustainability of the
achieved development objectives is increasingly dependent on the financial sustainability
of the PCs.
There are some indications showing financial performance of the PCs. One of the
findings of the Bank’s ongoing study on strategic options for financial recovery of the
power sector is that all the PCs generated positive net cash flow from their operations
between 2008 and 2012 (cash receipts from electricity sales covered all operating and
maintenance expenditures). In terms of debt, the PCs are more balanced between debt
and equity than for the other EVN subsidiaries, partly due to their relatively less capital
intensive structure.
However, these observations do not imply lack of concern about potential financial
difficulties. First, investments in distribution networks executed by PCs based on Power
Development Master Plan No. 7 are huge, totaling VND 446,354 billion (approximately
$23.4 billion) during 2011-2013. Second, and more importantly, the PC’s financial
performance is strongly affected by not only the retail tariff but also the mechanism for
setting the bulk supply tariff, which is the price paid by the companies for electricity
purchased to the single buyer to supply their customers.
According the ‘Strategic options for financial recovery of power sector’, the economic
distribution tariff, to be calculated as the retail tariff less the bulk supply tariff, needs to
be increased over time to meet the demand while complying with various financial
covenants. The required tariff level differs from PC to PC, but it can be stated in general
that the distribution tariff will have to increase by at least 35 percent during 2012-2020.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
On June 30, 2014, the closing date of the project, all of the 29 PMUs, including 25
provincial PMUs, 3 PCs’ PMUs, and the PMB of the MOIT, submitted their ICRs
separately for the original and AF credits. All the ICRs are presented in a
structure/template issued by the Bank to ensure inclusion of all required information. To
avoid repetition of similar contents in the ICRs, this section will not present the ICR’s
contents by each implementing agency but will summarize (a) overall assessment, (b)
findings on the infrastructure component, (c) findings on the TA component, and (d)
future recommendation.
A. Overall Assessment
The project has achieved all objectives set forth in the project design, ensured the success
of the Vietnam Rural Electrification Program for the period 2000–2010, and contributed
to fulfill the national target of ‘almost all rural households being electrified by 2020’18
and the socioeconomic development master plans of the project provinces.
The implementation of the RE2 project has become an exemplary model for coordination
among local authorities and the power sector for similar projects. The project contributed
in helping the government complete the last miles of rural electrification through an
extensive survey on the current situation and assessment on the needs of rehabilitation,
upgrading, and expansion of rural networks by 2020. The project contributed to
legalization of and provision of capacity building to the LDUs and improved
management of power distribution in rural areas by a series of training programs to
thousands of LDU and PC staff.
B. Infrastructure Component
Benefits of the Project
          Providing electricity access to a large number of geographically disadvantageous
           communes. Huge investment requirement in these types of communes imposed a
           burden on the state’s budget. Neither the local authorities nor the PCs can afford
           this investment. The Bank’s financing is a great resource for them to realize the
           development goals of each province.
          Improving reliability of electricity with stabilized voltage supply and reduced
           interruptions. Before the project, rural households frequently suffered because of
           poor power supply. In most project communes, electricity was only usable
           between midnight and early morning because of low voltage. Electric cookers, the
           most useful kitchen appliance, could not be used. There was a popular saying
           about this situation: ‘dinner lit by oil lamp, sleep lit by electricity’.
          Meeting the fast-growing demand in rural areas for productive uses (for example,
           small and medium-sized industries, aquaculture, handicraft, water pumps, and
           agricultural activities) and improving various aspects of domestic life in project
           communes (for example, economy, education, entertainment, and health care).
           Before the project, the quality of electricity supply was so poor that people could

       not use it for their domestic needs, leave alone for other purposes. With the
       improved grids and increased substations’ capacity, the network meets the
       demand for socioeconomic development of the project provinces in the period
       2010–2020.
      Increasing safety for users. A large number of the grids were poorly designed and
       constructed with substandard materials. In addition, there were often no funds for
       rehabilitation or in some cases, even for routine operations and management. This
       led to unsafe conditions for network operators and electricity users. It is reported
       that hundreds of people died every year because of electric shocks. The improved
       network therefore helped increase safety and reduce the number of deaths.
      Reducing technical losses. The rehabilitated systems have significantly reduced
       losses from 30–40 percent to 10–12 percent, on average, and in some communes
       to 7 percent.
      Improving profitability of the LDUs. Because of the reduced losses and improved
       capacity provided by the project, almost all the LDUs have become profitable.
       The financially weak LDUs that could not survive because of increasingly low
       margins have been transferred to the PCs.
      Reducing retail tariff. Before the project, the cost of electricity varied
       considerably across communes. Overall, rural consumers paid much higher tariffs
       than their urban counterparts, with tariffs roughly two to three times the nationally
       prescribed residential tariffs. Rural households even had to pay additional
       amounts for fixing problems in the network. After the project, the tariff has
       become more affordable because of reduced losses. Since 2009, a uniform
       national tariff has been compulsorily applied and no charges are imposed on users
       for repairing and maintaining the systems.
      Contributing to early fulfillment of the National Target Program on New Rural
       Development aimed at providing key infrastructure for rural development, of
       which electricity is one of the key factors.
      Providing capacity building for the PMU staff of 29 IAs through strict
       requirements for high responsiveness to a large number of project issues and daily
       interactions with Bank staff.
Implementation Issues
      The project was designed to be implemented in parallel by the PCs and provinces
       for MV and LV components, respectively. The project can only achieve
       efficiency when the two components are implemented and completed at the same
       time. In many localities, the implementation progress of the two components was
       synchronous, while it was asynchronous in others because of reasons such as poor
       coordination between two IAs, delay in construction in one of the two
       components due to rebidding of contract packages, financially weak contractors,
       and difficulty in land acquisition. Through a series of enhanced implementation
       support missions and progress review meetings, the Bank team and the MoIT
       tried to remove obstacles that caused asynchronous progress between the two
       components.



                                            48
   Land acquisition, particularly for the components implemented by the PCs, is
    difficult in some provinces. Land acquisition in the distribution projects is
    normally marginal but the project still faced some difficulties. For the LV
    component implemented by the provinces, the issue was solved more easily
    because the provinces can exert power over the lower levels, namely, the district
    and commune levels. For the MV component implemented by the PCs, the issue
    became harder because compensation and acquisition was still required to be
    made through an intermediate agency, the district’s compensation council, and the
    PCs had to request for coordination from the PPC.
   The project was mostly implemented during the 2007–2008 global economic
    crisis. Inflation was so high that many contractors, especially financially weak
    contractors, could not continue the fixed-price contracts which had largely been
    applied in this stage. A large number of contracts were terminated and rebids were
    required. This caused serious delays to some packages and cost overruns to the
    project. The AF was partly designed to bridge this financing gap.
   The Bank’s safeguard policies and guidelines are quite complicated to follow.
    Normally, rural electrification projects are simple in terms of social and
    environmental impacts. Initially, preparation of safeguard documents, hiring of
    independent monitoring consultants, and procurement of ICB contract packages in
    accordance with the Bank’s instructions and procedures were difficult for the
    provincial PMUs since they were new to Official Development Assistance
    (ODA)-financed projects. The Bank and MoIT provided training and the
    problems have been gradually solved.
   All provincial PMUs were new to IDA-financed projects. The RE2 was their first
    project. The PMUs were established with core staff from the Provincial
    Department of Industry and Trade. They were neither experienced in project
    management nor knowledgeable enough on the subject. During project
    implementation, the MoIT, as coordinator of the project, conducted numerous
    intensive training sessions on project management. With on-the-job training by
    the Bank, the capacity of the PMUs’ staff improved and met the donor’s
    requirements.
   The project was implemented over a long period. During that time, there were
    several changes to the government’s policy, provincial power development master
    plans, and land use planning. Design and cost estimation of subprojects therefore
    required several revisions and it took time to get approval from a competent
    agency. This, in turn, contributed to prolonged project implementation.
   Arrangement of counterpart funds was not sufficient in a number of provinces.
    Although commitment for counterpart funds was one of the selection criteria for
    project participation, project provinces were mostly the poor ones whose
    expenditures mainly depended on the state’s budget. This was a major difficulty
    for a number of IAs.
   At least half the communes were located in geographically disadvantageous areas,
    which caused difficulty for construction. Although the PMUs and communities
    made considerable efforts to help contractors, the construction in these areas was
    still delayed.

Assessment of Bank’s and Borrower’s Performance
      The project consisted of a large number of subprojects scattered across large areas
       and implemented in different phases. In addition, the project was required to be
       implemented synchronously by both the provinces and PCs. It therefore required
       close coordination among various agencies. The IAs made a great effort to
       successfully complete the project.
      Except for three PCs and the MoIT/PMB which had implemented several Bank-
       financed projects and were acquainted with the Bank’s guidelines and procedures,
       this type of project was completely new to the 25 provincial PMUs. The Bank’s
       team closely coordinated with and supported the IAs during project design and
       implementation. The capacity of the IAs’ PMUs has improved through a series of
       training sessions and daily interaction with the Bank’s team.
      The Bank team is very experienced in anticipating and solving issues raised
       during project implementation. Their quick response to the borrower’s queries
       and requests significantly contributed to successful implementation of the project.
Lessons Learned
In the preparation period
      There should be a clear definition of the roles of each party involved through wide
       consultation with all related government organizations, from the central to local
       levels; the implementing agencies; and the local communities.
      System designs should be strictly monitored and reviewed to avoid changes at
       sites.
      Rural energy projects should be phased and medium-sized. A province-level
       project should comprise of not more 20–30 communes in a phase because
       distribution projects typically spread across a wide geographical area and involve
       tens of thousands of households.
      Good dissemination of information among stakeholders is crucial to get local
       authorities to coordinate and to get the community’s consensus and support for
       the project.
      Issues that might appear during project implementation should be anticipated as
       early as possible, ideally during project design, by taking into account all the
       related regulations of the government and guidelines of the Bank to prepare
       countermeasures.
      Organization and capacity of the IAs should be carefully assessed. The PMUs
       must be equipped with full-time qualified staff. The PMUs themselves should
       have specialized and professional units in project management.
      The entities that receive and manage the system should be involved from the
       project design stage to facilitate the handover of works upon completion.
      A clean site should be prepared as soon as possible to enable contractors to start
       their work as scheduled.



                                           50
In the implementation period
      Land acquisition needs close coordination with and early involvement of the local
       authority.
      Close coordination between the MV and LV components is required to
       synchronize implementation progress.
      Implementation of the project should be as quick as possible to avoid the risk of
       cost overrun due to inflation, change of policies and regulations, and change of
       land use planning.
      Price-adjustment contract should be applied for all goods and works contracts to
       avoid termination of the contract by contractors due to price escalation.
      The state’s regulations and the donor’s guidelines should be strictly complied
       with from the beginning of the project because fixing problems related to non-
       compliance (if any) is time-consuming.
      Selection of qualified contractors is one of the key criteria for ensuring timely
       implementation and quality construction.
      Close community supervision during construction and reservation of budget for
       this task is required.
      Reporting mechanism should be strictly followed to keep related agencies
       informed about implementation-related issues and request for their cooperation
       and solution (if required) in a timely manner.
      Technical assistance should be carried out ahead of time to prepare resources for
       the LDUs before receiving the assets.
      When there are indications that the contractors are not capable of continuing their
       contracts after several efforts to facilitate their works, prompt termination of
       contracts and rebidding is required.
C. Technical Assistance Component
Assessment of Bank’s and Borrower’s Performance
Borrower’s performance
      Because a number of regulations in Vietnam are complex and inconsistent with
       the Bank’s regulations, there were some difficulties at the beginning of the
       implementation process. However, there was significant improvement in the
       implementation of the AF of the RE2 project.
      Because the training courses were conducted simultaneously and in a short time,
       the EVN units had difficulties in scheduling work and sending their staff for these
       training courses.
      There were difficulties in collecting data for the survey and assessment on rural
       electrification to propose policy and mechanism recommendations for rural
       electrification up to 2020. Because the implementation time was limited and
       implementation locations were spread across the country, along with difficulties
       in coordination between the consultants, the local units, and power companies, it
       was quite difficult for the consultants to collect data on rural electrification.


                                           51
Bank’s performance
        During the RE2 project preparation and implementation, the Bank provided
         whole-hearted guidance in all procedures and conditions of the project agreement.
         The Bank, in collaboration with the MoIT, conducted training courses in capacity
         building for project managers. The PMB effectively performed project
         disbursement in accordance with the Bank’s regulations. Submission of the
         monthly and quarterly reports (via email) was convenient for reporting,
         monitoring the implementation and disbursement progress, and immediately
         addressing the problems arising in the implementation process.
        The MoIT has always received the attention of the Bank and always supported the
         PMB in project preparation, implementation, and completion. During the project
         implementation process, the PMB actively reported difficulties and issues to the
         Bank, who quickly recommended solutions in accordance with the laws and rules
         of Vietnam and the Bank.
Lessons Learned
        The selection process for consultants and goods and equipment providers should
         be implemented according to prevailing regulations and with transparency. The
         consultants and providers must have enough human resources and sufficient
         financial capacity and experience to meet the requirements of the developers and
         ensure quick and effective project implementation with ensured quality.
        PMU for an ODA project is typically established when a project starts and
         dissolved when project closes. Because of a large workload required to be done in
         a short implementation period, this category of agency should be equipped with
         qualified and experienced staff who have in-depth knowledge of the State’s
         regulations on ODA management and donor’s policy and guidelines.
        Make reasonable allocation of funds for activities to use the loans effectively and
         bring high benefits for the work.
D. Future Recommendations
        The GOV approved the overall program of power supply for unelectrified rural
         households from the national grid and renewable energy sources in the period
         2014–2020 with the investment capital needs of VND 30,000 billion equivalent to
         $1.5 billion.19 The MoIT could request the Bank to consider providing IDA funds
         for Vietnam to implement the program, which includes (a) project coordination,
         supervision, management, and investment; (b) human resource training; (c)
         capacity building of management; (d) consulting services to assist state
         management and project management; (e) developing policies and mechanisms,
         investment strategies and operational management of rural electricity network;
         and (f) propagate to save energy, use electricity efficiently, safely and protect
         environment.
