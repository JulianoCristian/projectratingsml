particularly in strengthening coordination between the\n            various agencies, through adequate staffing, equipment, and\n            technical assistance, specially where implementation\n            capacity was weak. However, the issue of persistent local\n            budgetary shortfalls, should have been proactively pursued.\n            The performance of the borrower is likewise satisfactory, in\n            particular, that of the implementing agency, which can be\n            rated as highly satisfactory. The key lessons convey the\n            need for long-term commitment by donors, and borrowers for\n            supporting this kind of operation, which requires increased\n            outreach, and effective future programs, and, suggest a\n            planned series of follow-up projects. To an extent, the\n            success of the project is attributable to one Project\n            Director being responsible during the project period, thus\n            reinforcing staff continuity. If seasonal activities, or\n            community participation are involved, planning ahead for\n            timely release of funds becomes critical, or a year's\n            loss due to late forestry planting, or pasture development\n            will occur. The withdrawal of subsidies for a free\n            environment, is welcomed by beneficiaries, provided those\n            are preceded by support services, reinforcing that natural\n            resources conservation, succeeds upon the assumption of\n            community protection, and responsibility, who value\n            training, and management practices knowledge."}, "docdt": "1999-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
