MEMORANDUM AND RECOM1==DATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVEWPMNET ASSOCIATION
TO THE EWXCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A NORTHERN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR
20.4 million, US$28.8 million equivalent, on standard IDA terms, with a
maturity of 35 years to help finance a Northern Resource Management Project.
2.        countrylsector, Back   tud.  Pakistan has a fragile environment
which is sensitive to misuse. Rapid growth of human and livestock populations
in recent decades has put increasing pressure cn the country's natural
resources. The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has recognized the growing
importance of resource conser-xation, and has recently prepared and endorsed a
National Conservation Strategy (NCS). The NCS stresses the need for policy
and regulatory reforms, and strengthening of resource management institutions,
especially community based institutions at the village level
3.          The project area, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), is located in the
foothills of the Himalayas. Per capita income is low at about US$280 compared
to US$410 for Pakistan. AJK is undergoing serious natural resource
degradation, mainly loss of soil cover and wildlife habitat because of
deforestation of the hillsides. There is a close interaction between poverty
reduction, agricultural productivity and environmental degradation and
appropriate government services and policies are necessary to minimize
degradation.
4.         The institutions resronsible for natural resource management in
AJK, the Departments of Agriculture (DOA), Animal Husbandry (DOAH), and
Forestry (DOF) are weak and ill-equipped to effectively address land
management problems in a comprehensive manner. Unsuccessful attempts have
been made since 1974 to restructure these institutions. Staff of DOA, DOAH
and DOF are poorly trained and are primarily involved in activities which are
better handled by the private sector. This has resulted in a diversion of
resources away from the core activity of technology dissemination -
demonstration and promotion of sustaiiable land management techniques. These
institutions also lack skills in group participation, agro-forestry and soil
conservation techniques. The staff strength in livestock services is
extremely limited and is further constrained by the lack of operating funds
for equipment and preventive treatments. In addition, DOA and DOAH have no
capacity for planning and economic analysis, or for evaluation of policy
actions or programs.
S.        The policy framework also needs reform.  There is an excessive
involvement of government in production and input distribution activities
which could be undertaken by the private sector and for which the private
sector has shown interest. In addition, inputs are heavily subsidized,
leading to inefficient use of these resources. AJK also has weak transport
inf.rastructure, which limits access to agricultural inputs and sale of output
6.        Strategy.  The strategy for hill area development pursued under
this project is consistent with the overall Bank country assistance strategy
for Pakistan, which is to: (i) expand the provision of basic social services;



-2-
(ii) diversify and expend the productive base; (iii) improve the management
and use of the country'  natural resources; and (iv) overcome severe physical
infrastructure bottlenecks. Within this overall strategy, the project aims
to: (i) increase the productivity and incomes of the local farming community;
and (ii) develop and use natural resources in AJK in an economically
sustainable and ecologically sound manner. The strategy under the project
emphasizes: (i) developing and strengthening human resources and local
institutions; (ii) reorienting the policy framework through transfer of
activities to the private sector and subsidy removall (iii) formulating
extension and adaptive research programs; and (iv) focussing on community
groups and adaptive research aimed at introducing environmentally friendly and
profitable farming techniques.
7.        LesngnS Learned from Preu_ Bank/IDA Involvemnt. The strategy
takes into account the lessons learned from earlier Bank projects, and the
experi-inces of other donors oporrating in AJK and of the Agha Khan Rural
Support Program (AXRSP), especially in group formation and community
participation. These include: (i) local conmumnity involvement in the planning
and implementation of projects; (ii) early establishment of managerial and
technical staff to ensure adequate focus on project problems; (iii) provision
of improved technical packages for the upper watersheds, including natural
forests and rangelands; and (iv) clear identification of activities where the
market mechanism could cause an efficient allocation of resources and where it
cannot do so because of market failure or externalities. Furthermore, road
improvement designs should incorporate features and mechanical structures to
minimize environmental damage.
8.        The proposed project would benefit from the availability of
technical staff and of economically and financially profitable technical
packages. Adaptive research trials and demonstrations would be required to
ensure modification of packages to emphasize resource management practices and
replicability over a wider area. Local comunity involvement would be
supported through local technical assistance to help in group formation. The
project draws on experience in Pakistan including AIRSP in community
involvement.
9.       URtSona2e for IA lInvolvement. The current roles and functions of
key institutions responsible for resource management need to be realigned to
meet redefined objectives. Past government's efforts to restructure these
institutions have not been successful. Through this project, IRA would assist
AJR in restructuring of key institutions and reorienting of programs and
policies: restructuring with emphasis on core services of technology
dissemination and working with communities; introducing policy changes aimed
at a phased elimination of subsidies; and transfering public sector activities
to the private sector. IDA would also support the introduction of hitherto
untried environmentally sound and sustainable resource management programs.
Moreover, IDA would support AJR in testing, on a pilot basis, programs whereby
commmnities would take management and financial responsibility for planning
and implementation of activities covering resource management. IDA is well
placed in coordinating the efforts of donors involved in AJR, working in close
collaboration with AXRSP.
10.       Prolect ObhectiVes. The primary objective of this five-year
project is to provide for the sustainable and economically efficient use of



-3-
land resources in one of Pakistan's poorest and most environmentally
vulnerable areas through: (i) improving the policy framework (including the
respective roles of the private and public sectors) that influences the use
and conservation of land resources; (ii) restructuring and strengthening
public institutions responsible for land management resources; and (iii)
piloting testing programs where communities take management and financial
responsibility for planning and implementation of activities for sustainable
resource management.
11.       Project Description.  The project would include the following:
(a) Policy reforms. The input production and distribution activities
which are carried out by DOA, DOAR and DOP would be phased out, and
staff would be re-deployed in core activities of technology
dissemination to farmers. Associated with the transfer is a
program for the phased elimination cf subsidies on inputs. The
specific activities for transfer to the private sector and subsidy
removal are: (i) seed potato, vegetable seed, fruit tree and forest
tree seedling production; (ii) field crop seed (wheat, maize and
oats) and fertilizer distribution; and :iii) poultry vaccination;
(b) Institutional restructurinq and strencrthenincr. Project support
would be for restructuring and strengthening DOA, DOAH and DOP.
DQA would be reorganized into two directorates - extension and
training, and technical support. The two Directorates would
concentrate on core Jupport activities. Extension and adaptive
research activities would be strengthened. The Planning and
Economic Services would be moderately expanded. DOAH would be
restructured along functional lines, one to cover extension,
research and development and the other, animal health. Research
capability would be enhanced to enable research on fodder, breed
improvement and nutrition. A Social Forestry Wing would be added
to DOP in line with the project's support for community-based
reforestation and soil conservation programs. The Planning and
Development Department (P&DD) of AJK would also be strengthened to
assist in project formulation, and monitoring of resource
maagement and conservation programs. The Land Use Planning Unit
would be moved from DOF to P&MD, and strengthened to play a more
central and active role in resource management planning;
(c)  Basic Technical Services.  The project would support root stock
propagation, production of foundation and pre-basic seed, extension
of facilities for research, training and communal forestry
programs;
(d)  Pilot Proarams.  Project support is for setting up pilot programs
in community management of natural resources in five sub-watersheds
covering several villages. The project would also assist in setting
up community based institutions, and provide for the drawing up and
implementation of resource management plans, incorporating
agriculture, livestock, soil conservation, and forestry activities;
and



(e) Rural Road ImnrovemMet. Twelve roads in the vicinity of the pilot
areas would be improved to fair weather standard to support the
economic viability of the pilot schemes.
12.       The project's cost is estimated at US$ 36.0 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$ 9.4 million, and taxes and duties of US$ S.4
million. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are presented in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement are in Schedule B. Schedules
C and D respectively give a timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan. The attached map shows the
project area. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.11751-PAK dated May 24, 1993 is
being circulated separately.
13.       IDA would retroactively finance project costs incurred after April
1, 1993 to a limit of SDR 1.5 million (7O of the credit). These expenditures
include consultant services, designs of road improvements, initial nursery
costs, and other preparatory activities.
14.       PXoject Iniementation. The project would be implemented by the
DOA, DOAH, DOF, Public Works Department (PWD), and local community
erganizations, both formal and informal. A Privatization and Reorganization
Unit (PRU) under P&DD, with assistance from the Pakistan privatization
Commission, would monitor the phased. transfer of activities, subsidy removal,
re-deployment and training, and provision of information and advice to the
private sector.  The program of applied research would be linked to the
Agricultural Bconomics Research Unit (AEPU) set up under the Bank assisted
Agricultural Research Project. Mass awareness programs would be closely
coordinated with extension activities.
15.       Pilot schemes in community management involve planning, execution
(including maintenance and protection), and benefit sharing in both communal
and private lands. A Village Development Committee (VDC) would be set up in
each participating village with assistance of the Social Mobilization Unit
(SMU). The rural road improvement activities would be executed by the PD,
while implementation would be through private contractors. This Unit would
ensure that designs incorporate features and mechanical structures to minimize
environmental damage.
16.       Proiect Sustalnability.  The project emphasizes the strengthening
of the permanent institutions that manage natural resources in AJK through
technical assistance and training with a view to building local capacity at
both the government and local organization level. Building up of local
organizations for community participation, and cost and benefit sharing would
help fill an institutional vacuum at village level and enhance community
participation in operation and maintenance of completed works. It would also
relieve the fiscal burden of government.
17.       Actimns to be "oreed.  At negotiations, agreements were reached on
the following: (i) a time-phased implementation plan for transfer of
production and input distribution activities, elimination of subsidies and
staff re-deployment; (ii) that the Agricultural Training Institute (ATI)
Diploma would be a prerequisite for recruitment as Field Assistant positions
in DOA by September 30, 1996; (iii) setting up a revolving fund in DOAK for
deposit of vaccination fees and purchase of subsequent vaccine supplies;



-5-
(iv) that project account would be audited by auditors acceptable to IDA; and
(v) Bxecutive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNBC) approval of
the project and provision of budgetary funds prior to credit effectiveness.
18.       h'tironmental ARgRaS.  The project is aimel specifically at
improving the environment through the introduction of sustainable resource
management practices,
19.       Projcot Objective Categorfiss.  This is a resource management
project. The project also focusses on poverty alleviation as it aims to raise
the incomes of subsistence farmers. The project also supporto private sector
development through the phased transfer of fertilizer and seed distribution,
seedling production, and poultry vaccinations to the private sector.
20.       lenefjjj.  The overall economic rate of return for the project ic
13*. Farmers crop yields and incomes would increase through adoption of
technically proven and profitable packages. Significant institutional
benefits are expected, but are not readily quantifiable. These include the
empowerment of rural communities and creation of local management
capabilities, and an enhaaced role for women in the management of resources.
In addition, government institutions would be strengthened through
restructuring and training of staff. The road improvement program would open
up remote agricultural areas and induce higher production. Project activities
would minimize illegal cutting of trees, reduce water run off and erosion and
reduce reservoir siltation.
21.       Risks. A possible risk is that the local community may be slow in
forming community participatory groups. However, it is expected that the
experience already gained by the community, the active involvement of the SMU,
technical input from government extension and technical services, and mass
education and training would contribute to a high level of farmer incerest.
Another risk is that the time phased transfer of activities and subsidy
elimination program may be delayed. However, adequate safeguards have been
built into the project such as the PRU, technical assistance, staff for
monitoring and annual evaluations of the program, which would ensure that the
program remains on track.
22.       The proposed project would be carried out in AJK, an area over
which India and Pakistan have been in dispute since 1947. By financing the
project under the proposed credit, IDA does not intend to prejudice the
determination of the claims of the parties.
23.        ecommendation   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
