Project for Burkina Faso were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was medium/moderate; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: excessive\n            optimism in decentralization and de- concentration\n            commitment. Focusing on studies, training and Information\n            Technology (IT) equipment in a context of serious budget\n            constraint means that some studies recommendations will not\n            be implemented. A demand-driven project is not a panacea for\n            a good design. Public sector reform requires flexibility,\n            which can be resource-consuming in the context of a grant.\n            Civil servant training and IT equipment do not necessarily\n            lead to civil servant behavioral change. Lack of impact\n            evaluation for cross-cutting public sector reforms, such as\n            decentralization and de-concentration, hampers impact improvement."}, "docdt": "2012-04-13T00:00:00Z"}
