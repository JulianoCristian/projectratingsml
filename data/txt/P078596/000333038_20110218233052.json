This\n            restructuring paper seeks for the extension of closing date\n            for the project to August 31, 2011. This will be the first\n            extension of the project closing date.  The project\n            achievements to date include: i) the implementation of HR\n            management de-concentration; ii) the increase of civil\n            service performance, through implementation of the 1998\n            evaluation policy; iii) the restructuring of the ministry of\n            economy and finance to improve its internal efficiency; and\n            iv) the strengthening of public expenditures management\n            de-concentration. The extension is necessary to complete the\n            extension of the computerized HR management system to line\n            ministries in the capital city and to extend the\n            computerized pay system to the regions. With the completion\n            of these activities the processing of the administrative and\n            financial decisions on staff careers will be done on a\n            timely manner and the staff located in the provinces will no\n            longer have to leave their work place for administrative\n            reasons. This extension will also be used to elaborate the\n            decentralization strategy."}, "docdt": "2011-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
