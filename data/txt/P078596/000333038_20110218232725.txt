1.  This restructuring paper seeks your approval for the extension of closing date for 
Burkina Faso Administration Capacity Building Project (P078596) from February 28, 2011 to 
August 31, 2011. This will be the first extension of the project closing date
.
2. 
Overall, the performance ratings of the project have been Moderately Satisfactory (MS), 
both in terms of probability of achieving Development Objectives (DOs) and Implementation 
Progress (IP). As at January 25, 2011, the project has disbursed USD 5.22 million, about 74.6 
percent of the original amount of grant approved by the Board. 
The project was subject to a 
first order restructuring which was approved by the Board on June 29, 2010. unchanged
 
The project achievements to date include i)
 
the implementation of HR management
 
de-
concentration (main activities: establish various responsibilities for human resources 
management, update and improve the HRM computerized system and de-concentrate it to line 
ministries); ii) the increase of civil service performance, through implementation of the 1998 
evaluation
 
policy (main activities: prepare guidelines for evaluation and train staff in
 
evaluation 
policy, assist public
 training 
institutions such as the ENAM
 
and ENAREF
 
to strengthen their 
supply of professional training and assist
 
ministries to prepare
 
training strategies); iii)
 
the 
restructuring of the ministry of economy and finance to improve its internal efficiency; iv) the 
strengthening of public expenditures
 
management de-concentration (main activity: expand
 
the 
computerized expenditure processing in seven more regions).
 
3. 
The proposed extension is necessary to complete the extension of the 
computerized HR management system to line ministries in the capital city and to extend 
the computerized pay system to the regions. With the completion of these activities the 
processing of the administrative and financial decisions on staff careers will be done on a 
timely manner and the staff located in the provinces will no longer have to leave their 
work place for administrative reasons. This extension will also be used to elaborate the 
decentralization strategy. These three activities  
4. 
The implementing entities are compliant with the Bank's financial management 
requirements; and there are no overdue audit reports
