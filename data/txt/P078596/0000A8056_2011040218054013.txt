                         Implementation Status Overview
                         After the completion of the restructuring of the project on June 29, 2010, an implementation support mission visited the country during the period from September 13 to 30. The
                         mission noted that the implementation of the project did not proceed as was anticipated during the last mission because the procurement activities that were launched at the
                         beginning of the year could not be completed as scheduled. the main reasons are (i) the recruitment of consultants by the ministry of finance was suspended because the financial
                         proposals made by the selected firms were well above the estimated costs, (ii) the extension of the computerized pay system to the regions was delayed because the procurement

                         committee of the ministry of finance took too much time to incorporate the comments made by our procurement colleagues, (iii) the recruitment of the consultant for the preparation of
                         the decentralization roadmap also took too much time because (a) the first consultant selected was no longer available when the final decision was made, and (b) the second one

                         who started his assignment in August did not perform well and the ministry was about to put an end to his contract when the mission was visiting the country. For these reasons, the
                         implementation of the project in 2010 was very slow.

                         There are some improvements in 2011 : the ministry of finance has decided which activities they will implement until the end of the project, the computerized pay system was
                         extended to all regional directorates of budget and will be put in use soon, the ministry of decentralization is about to complete the recruitment of the consultant who will prepare the
                         decentralization roadmap.

                         The effectiveness of the devolution of the responsibility for processing HR decisions to ministries has reduced significantly the time it took to process these decisions centrally. The
                         time was reduced from an average of 70 days in 2009 to 49 days in 2010 (target was 52 days).

                         before the project closing date. The mission received and processed the request for the extension of the closing date of the project to August 2011. This extension was requested
                         because of the delays incurred for (i) the recruitment of the consultant who will prepare the decentralization roadmap, (ii) the selection of the contractors who will extend the
                         computerized systems for the processing of pay data in the regions, and the processing of HR decisions in line ministries and central institutions. The six month extension will allow a
                         full completion of the works.
