         recipient in improving the rationality, transparency,\n            accountability and performance of its administration, by:\n            (i) implementing decentralization and de-concentration of\n            responsibilities and services, and (ii) building up\n            institutional and legal infrastructure. This paper proposes\n            the following changes in the project: (i) revision of the\n            project's results monitoring framework by reformulating\n            the Project Development Objective (PDO) and streamlining the\n            number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used in the\n            project; (ii) reduction in the number of project components\n            from six to three; and  (iii) re-allocation of grant\n            resources across the new components to ensure efficiency in\n            the utilization of grant resources and to reflect the\n            changing priorities of government."}, "docdt": "2010-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
