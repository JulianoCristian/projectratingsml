                                       Proposed Changes
This paper proposes the following changes in the project: (i) revision of the project's Results
Monitoring Framework by reformulating the Project Development Objective (PDO) and
streamlining the number of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used in the project (ii) reduction
in the number of project components from six to three (iii) re-allocation of grant resources across
the new components to ensure efficiency in the utilization of grant resources and to reflect the
changing priorities of government. Consequently, the project has been updated along the
following lines:

    a Changes to the Development Objectives

As part of project restructuring, the project's original development objective, " to assist the
Recipient in improving the rationality, transparency, accountability and performance of its
administration, by (i) implementing decentralization and de-concentration of responsibilities and
services, and (ii) building up institutional and legal infrastructure" would be changed to:

"Strengthen the Recipient's Central Government resource management capacity and enhance the
Recipient's capacity in the planning, organization and monitoring of the implementation of the
decentralization process."

    b. Changes to scope of the project

The original project had six project components as follow:

                    r the
Com~onent S u ~ ~ oto t Ministrv of Civil Service and State Reform NJSS0.7 million)
        1:

Under this component, the project was to finance activities to (a) rationalize structures and
administrative procedures; (b) develop tools and procedures to support policy formulation,
monitoring and evaluation; and (c) improve human resource management (including staff
evaluation policy) and de-concentration of key hnctions of human resource management towards
sector ministries.

Such activities included: i) the strengthening of the ministry's role of guiding the de-concentration
process of the administration, in light of the decentralization; ii) the implementation of HRM de-
concentration (main activities: establish various responsibilities for human resources
management, update and improve the SIGASPE system and de-concentrate system to line
ministries and possibly to regions); and iii) the increase of civil service performance, through
implementation of the 1998 evaluation policy (main activities: prepare guidelines for evaluation
and train staff in evaluation policy, assist public institutions such as the ENAM and ENAREF to
strengthen their supply of professional training and assist ministries to prepare training
strategies).


                     r Ministrv of Finances and Budpet (US$2.3 million)
Com~onent2:S u ~ ~ oto t

Under this component the project was to finance activities to: (a) Rationalize structures and
administrative procedures, including without limitation, with respect to the General
Directorate of the Treasury and Public Accounts (Direction Ge'ne'rale du Tre'sor et de la
Comptabilite' Publique), the General Directorate of the Budget (Direction Ge'ne'rale du
Budget), the Central Directorate for Financial Control (Direction Centrale des Contrdles
Financiers); and (b) improve: (i) public expenditure management by, inter alia,
strengthening program budget management and reporting capacity, control systems, de-
concentration of financial functions in the ministries and the provinces, and tax
collections, and (ii) human resource management.
Such activities included: i) the Ministry's restructuring efforts to improve internal efficiency
(main activities: implement the Directorate General of the Treasury and Public Accounts
(DGTCP) audit and finalize the Directorate General of Budget (DGB) and Central Directorate for
Financial Control (DCCF) organizational audits; ii) the strengthening of links between budget
programming and PRSP process; iii) the strengthening of public expenditures management de-
concentration (main activity: expand the CID in seven more regions); iv) the strengthening of
accountability mechanisms (notably through strengthening of the internal audit capacity through
support to Internal Audit Office (IGF)); and v) the strengthening of revenue collection.

        3:          rt                                   (US$0.68 million)
Com~onent S u ~ ~ oto the Ministrv of Economic Develo~ment

Under this component the project was to finance activities to: (a) rationalize structures and
administrative procedures and clarify the respective responsibilities of DRED;
(b) rationalize processes for elaborating, monitoring and evaluating sector and local
policies; (c) strengthen human resource management and staff training; and
(d) strengthen economic modeling capacity.

Such activities included: i) the focusing of the work of the Ministry on a few key products and
the establishment of procedural manuals for these productions, in order to use more rationally the
Ministry's limited capacity; ii) the establishment of a single methodology for elaborating,
monitoring and evaluating sectoral and local policies, preparing procedural manuals and training
staff in their use.

           4:     to
Com~onent Su~port the Ministrv of Territorial Administration and Decentralization
(USS0.75 million)


Under this component the project was to finance activities to: (a) develop and improve tools,
structures and procedures for the implementation of the decentralization policy; (b) rationalize
structures and administrative procedures, clarify the responsibilities of the MATD, and strengthen
coordination and monitoring capacity; (c) strengthen policy formulation monitoring and
evaluation; (d) develop a legal and institutional framework for an effective inter-ministerial
coordination; and (e) prepare a coherent national strategy of capacity building for local
governments.

Such activities included: i) the restructuring of the Ministry to better adapt its structure to its
mission (adoption and implementation of a new organizational chart); ii) the strengthening of the
leadership role of the Ministry in establishing and implementing basic guidelines for the
implementation of the decentralization policy (main activities: drafting, adopting and
disseminating the Decentralization Code implementing decrees, developing adequate financial
resource transfer mechanisms for local governments, and developing a conducive framework for
dialogue involving all key actors of decentralization); and iii) the strengthening of local
governments' capacity to hlfill their role by preparing, adopting and implementing a capacity
building strategy for local governments.
Under this component the project was to finance activities to implement the decentralization
strategy and strengthen the Ministry's role as regulator and planner, and to: (a) Rationalize
structures and administrative procedures to support decentralization, clarifling
responsibilities of the regional offices (Directions Gbnbrales) and local structures
(Districts Sanitaires) of the MH, and strengthen management capacity and coordination
with donors and other partners; and (b) develop contracting policies with the private
sector.

Such activities included: i) the support to health districts by clarifying rules for transfer to local
governments, clarifling the role of local health committees and helping health committee
members understand those roles, and periodically updating the health map; ii) the support to
contracting with the private sector and among the public sector entities (evaluating existing
contracts and how they help improve health care coverage, equity and quality; and providing
technical assistance to improve the existing contracting mechanisms); and iii)the strengthening of
the management capacity of the MS (short-term support on procurement, a study to make
recommendations to improve the efficiency of the training system, a study on health financing to
ensure national coverage of medical care through a sectoral approach, the design of the hospital
master plan, the update of the computerization plan for the MS to harmonize the management
information system between all levels, including the sanitary information system).

Comvonent 6: Suvvort to the Prime Minister Office (SGPM) (US$0.68 million)

Under this component the Project's was to finance activities to improve internal efficiency and
inter-ministerial coordination. The main activities for the Prime Minister's Office focused on
improving internal efficiency and interministerial coordination through implementation of the
recommendations of an organizational audit.

In the proposed restructuring, it is now proposed to center the project's activities around three key
components and to reallocate the remaining funds to such components as follow:


Component I: Strengthening central government efficiency and controls. (USD2.5 M
equivalent, of which IDA US$2 M equivalent)

In many instances resource management modalities have proven to be too complex, obscure or
ineffective to provide the government appropriate level of confidence in its own systems. In much
the same way, procedures occasionally appear to be highly complex and cumbersome, and
consequently the processing times are unacceptably long.

Support in this component would be provided to: (i) strengthen the capacity of different ministries
to undertake longer term planning and evaluation of policies. This will include, for example,
finalizing the development of the MALT model, so as to enable improved formulation,
monitoring and evaluation of public policies and ensuring its mainstreaming to all concerned
institutional agents; (ii) improve de-concentration of human resource management through
deployment of the IT tool already developed to support the work of various directorates at the
ministries' level; (iii) improve the pay management system through the delegation of the
processing of pay changes to the regions within the context of the ongoing decentralization
efforts.

Component 11: Strengthening policy formulation, coordination and monitoring in key
ministries responsible for decentralization. (USD 560,000 equivalent, of which IDA
USD140,OOO equivalent)

The proposed component, consistently with the recommendations of the 2006 decentralization
ESW and the 2009 PER, will strengthen the government capacity to develop a decentralization
charter (feuille de route) as well as a medium term (3-5 years) decentralization implementation
plan. The proposed component will assist the authorities in (i) appropriately defining policies
and procedures required to bring about decentralization in Burkina Faso; and (ii) subsequently,
planning all the steps, assign responsibilities for their implementation and costing each of the
activities in terms of both human and financial resources. At the end of the process, key issues
surrounding decentralization, such as financial viability of local government institutions, ensuring
appropriate financing and staffing of local governments, ensuring proper controls of local
governments, will have been addressed, debunked and properly taken into account in preparing
the implementation plan.


Component 111: Project Management (USD 1 million equivalent, of which IDA USD 410,000
equivalent)

The project will continue to support project implementation through the financing of the technical
staff of the PCU and the completion of some studies.

The three proposed components have a total IDA allocation of US$2.55 million whereas the
remaining IDA balance is $2.1 1 million. The difference is covered through the SDR exchange
rate.

the permanent Secretaries of participating ministries while a Technical Committee composed of
the PCU staff and the focal points from the participating ministries will support the steering
committee on technical matters, monitor progress and handle pending issues.

As part of the restructuring, the PCU, which currently includes four staff members contracted by
the SGPM, would be further strengthened with the addition of a part time monitoring and
evaluation specialist, whose job will be to maintain a careful eye on program monitoring
indicators.

The government will continue to contribute US$l M equivalent per year as counterpart funds to
the project. These funds, will be allocated to operating costs, as well as the financing of other
activities relevant to the Project.

       the time needed for processing HR decisions by line ministries, compared to the
       time previously taken for this processing by the ministry of civil service, and (ii)
       the reduction by 50% of the time needed to modify payroll data by the regional
       directorates of the ministry of finance, compared to the time taken to make the
       same modifications at the central level.
       Improved monitoring of decentralization through the design of a decentralization

                                          exit opportunities by structuring TA activities
                                          on decentralization around a series of "gates",
                                          where the technical team would go back to the
                                          political authorities for reporting and
                                          authorization to proceed to the next stages. In
                                          the event this support will not be available,
                                          the Bank would withdraw support.
                                          Additionally, the project has maintained its
                                          original closing date thus ensuring that the
                                          totality of the preparatory work for full
                                          fledged decentralization will occur over the
                                          remaining period of the project.
