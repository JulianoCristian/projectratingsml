to the extent required to meet the estimated shortfall, proceeds
of the Credit which are then allocated to another Category and
which in the opinion of the Association are not needed to meet

drawals under such Category may continue until all expenditures
thereunder shall have been made.

procurement of any item in any Category is inconsistent with
the procedures set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no
expenditures for such item shall be financed out of the proceeds
