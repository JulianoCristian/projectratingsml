STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE SETTING
A. The Economy
Background
1.01      Senegal has suffered a steady deterioration in per.capita GDP
since 1970. From 1970 through 1978, growth in GDP has been 2.2% per annum,
outstripped by a population growth rate of 2.6% per annum. In 1978, GDP
per capita was US$430 for a total population of about 5.4 million. The
natural resource base of Senegal is meager; it includes phosphate, cotton,
groundnuts, fish and some other agricultural products. Exploration for petro-
leum is underway in southern Senegal but has not yet resulted in commercially
viable discoveries, and Senegal has been badly hit by rising oil prices. (The
1980 oil import bill, estimated at more than CFAF 50 billion is 40% of total
export receipts and will not even be covered by all groundnut exports, Sene-
gal's main commodity.) Virtually all of Senegal's phosphate output is expor-
ted but exploitable quantities are not large and Senegal is a high-cost
marginal producer. Senegal is the world's second largest exporter of ground-
nuts which have been the mainstay of the agricultural sector. Output is,
however, subject to large fluctuations from year to year depending on rainfall;
it fell from 900,000 tons in 1978 to less than 200,000 in 1980. Groundnut oil
prices are also dependent on international competition from soy beans, corn
and palm oil. As for other agricultural products, cotton (28,000 tons in 1979)
is of good quality, but low producer prices and poor rainfall are not encour-
aging production. Fish, livestock and other foods (fruit and vegetable) could
provide a base for further processing and export. However, their potential,
inhibited by poor sector organization and management, deserves greater atten-
tion and support. The latest economic report for Senegal was circulated in
December, 1979. 1/
Development Policy
1.02      The Government of Senegal has followed a policy of active inter-
vention in the economy. In agriculture, crop marketing and input deliverj
were entrusted to a Government monopoly (ONCAD); extension services have
been gradually passed on to Regional Development Agencies 2/ while in the
mid-1970's, groundnut sales and exports were finally taken over by a

Government-controlled mixed enterprise, SONACOS. In utilities, industry and
services, state intervention gradually picked up in the 1970's. It took the
form of extensive equity participation in firms, regulation of prices and
protection of local industries. Thus, the output of 102 public sector
enterprises accounts for about 40% of GDP. Owing to the poor performance of
several enterprises, costs to the budget (and the economy) have increased
and the Government has now decided to disengage itself gradually from
direct intervention and rely more on private initiative and investment.
This new orientation is welcome, but it will be difficult to dismantle over
time the bureaucratic structure and to resuscitate private initiative.
Moreover, the industrial potential of Senegal is fundamentally limited, and
the immediate priority is to improve productivity of existing enterprises and
develop unrealized potential in agro-allied and service-related industries.
B. The Industrial Sector
Description
1.03      Past Performance.  Since Independence in 1960, manufacturing has
grown at an annual rate of 5.7% and its share of GDP grew from 19% to 24% in
1980. After Independence, firms in Senegal which previously serviced the
entire region were faced with a drastically reduced market and a lower rural
purchasing power. Thus, between 1964 and 1971, industrial output only
increased 2.2% per annum. As a result, the sixties were a period of difficult
adjustment: firms obtained import protection but their plant and equipment
gradually became obsolete as there were few incentives for modernization and
expansion. Demand began to pick-up selectively after 1971 and industry
reached an average annual growth rate of roughly 10% in the 1970s. Groundnut
oil processing, consumer durables, agricultural inputs (fertilizers and
implements) and construction materials led this growth but textiles continued
to stagnate.
1.04      Economic Impact.  Although industry accounts for 24% of GDP, its
contribution to developing the economy could have been greater:
-    First, domestic industrial linkages are relatively underdeveloped:
45% of the value of output is represented by imports. Except
for agro-processing industries (oil-mills, fisheries and textiles)
most manufacturing firms process imported materials. Similarly,
although the Senegalese industry exports almost 50% of output
(mostly peanut oil, phosphate and fish), these products have a low
degree of local value added.
-    Second, industrial employment is limited.  The sector employs
30,000 workers (1.5% of the country's active population), and
offers roughly 70,000 seasonal jobs. Industrial investment has
been relatively capital intensive (averaging about $30,000 per job)
owing to the relative importance of expansion/modernization projects
in existing firms, which, at best, maintain existing employment.



-3-
-    Third, most industrial firms are located around Dakar (90% of
all enterprises, 70% of total sales and 80% of total industrial
employment). Despite fiscal incentives, decentralization of
industrial investments to Thies (14% of total sales), Kaolack
(8%), St. Louis (3%) and Zinguinchor (3%) has made little headway,
owing to Dakar's concentrated population and relatively well-
developed infrastructure.
1.05      Subsectoral Composition.  A 1977 study on industrial sector linkages
used 1974 data on 1600 modern sector firms in Senegal. 1/ Based on this
survey, subsectoral distribution of sales and value added was as follows:
Table 1.1:  STRUCTURE OF INDUSTRY
Subsector                  Sales (%)                Value Added (%)
Mining                          14.5                       30.9
Food Processing                 37.2                       20.7
(Oil milling)               (24.2)                     (15.1)
Beer and Tobacco                 5.1                        6.9
Textiles                         9.7                       12.1
Paper/Chemicals                 18.3                      11.8
Mechanical                       4.1                        8.5
Energy                           5.7                        8.5
Other                            5.4.                       4.8
100                       100
Four main activities contribute the bulk of output: (1) food processing; (2)
chemicals, including refining; (3) mining and (4) textiles. Three of these
are extremely vulnerable to external forces. Mining sales and profits fluc-
tuate with the unstable world price for phosphate; oil milling is, of course,
dependent on the groundnut crop which, in turn, is subject to weather condi-
tions. Finally, the textile subsector (second in terms of employment) stag-
nates while imported products have seized more than two-thirds of the local
market.
1.06      Size and Ownership Distribution.  The modern industrial sector
(roughly 400 firms) can be broken down between (i) a small number of large,
foreign or state-owned firms; (ii) a moderate number of medium size, mostly
foreign-owned firms; and (iii) a large number of small Senegalese-owned
firms. In the survey, firms with total investments below CFAF 25 million
(US$119,000) were considered small, those with investment between CFAF 25
million and CFAF 250 million ($1,190,000) medium, and all those above large.
Reflecting Senegal's ties to France and the active interventionism of the
Government, ownership of major firms is roughly evenly divided between
1/   "Les activites du secteur economique moderne au Senegal en 1974," a
survey by Societe Nationale d'Etude de Developpement (SONED).

foreigners and Senegalese. For instance, among the 25 largest firms in
Senegal in 1977, slightly under 50% of equity was foreign-owned (usually
French), and 70% of the Senegalese-owned shares were held directly or
indirectly by Government.

Employment              7      23        70     100
1.07      Informal Sector.  Detailed surveys of urban artisans have been
carried out in Senegal, both by Government 1/ and external consultants. 2/
Of an economically active population of 1.9 million, about 700,000, or 37%
belong to the informal sector, of which 227,000 in cities. In 1977, the
artisan sector contribution to GDP was roughly estimated at CFAF 5.6 billion
(1.2%). The census distinguishes three categories of artisans: artistic
artisans (20% of the total), productive artisans (50%) and service artisans
(30%). Among artistic artisans, jewellers and weavers represent a majority;
tailors, wood workers and leather workers represent 83% of productive artisans,
and general mechanics and barbers are most important among service artisans.
Linkages between artisanal firms and the modern sector are minimal and markets
for the two types of firms rather clearly segmented.
Industrial Policy
1.08      Industrial policy in Senegal is developed and implemented in a
number of government agencies. Conceptually, the policy is described as
"'guided liberalism"; practically, it has resulted in extensive state interven-
tion in the ownership, management and operations of large firms in the key
sectors (transportation, utilities, banking, groundnut marketing and phosphate
mining). With regards to new investments, Government-s attention has concen-
trated on large scale, capital intensive projects (Dakar-Marine, Faleme Iron,
Sotexka and phosphoric acid plant). The Tariff and Investment Codes have
tended to favor import substitution firms and discourage backward linkages.

Recently, however, because of budget constraints and a growing recognition of
the importance of the private sector, active intervention in the financing and
management of new businesses has been reduced. Simultaneously, investment
incentives to import substitution firms are granted less easily while the
Investment Code is being revised to link benefits to local value added. An
export incentive system was introduced in August 1980 for textiles, shoes,
processed fish, fertilizers and agricultural products (other than groundnuts),
which represent one third of Senegal's traditional exports. This shift to a
private sector, export-oriented and better integrated industrial development
remains hampered, however, by extensive administrative controls affecting
prices, market shares and subsidies.
Industrial Sector Organization
1.09      Policy making responsibilities for the industrial sector rest with
the Ministry of Industrial Development and Artisans, but in practice many
different agencies promote policies which impinge on industrial development.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the fiscal, tariff and price
policies which affect industrial firms;  the Ministry of Trade is concerned
with the marketing and pricing of industrial products; the Ministry of Rural
Development exercises technical supervision over food processing firms; and
the Ministry of Plan monitors the overall investment program and administers
Investment Code benefits. Other institutions directly concerned with sector
management include: (1) SONEPI (Societe Nationale d'Etudes et de Promotion
Industrielle), which provides technical assistance and loan guarantees to SME;
(2) SOSEPRA (Societe Senegalaise pour la Promotion de l'Artisanat), which
provides advice, workshop rentals, supplies and marketing channels to artistic
artisans; (3) The Free Trade Zone (FTZ), located outside Dakar, which was
designed to stimulate export industries; and (4) Centre Senegalais du Commerce
Exterieur (CSCE), which was created in 1971 to assist Government in promoting
exports.
Constraints and Prospects in the Industrial Sector
1.10      Senegal is depending on industrial growth to generate employment,
increase export receipts and improve regional balance. Although industrial
production has grown faster than that of other sectors, further industrializa-
tion will be difficult to achieve rapidly. First, the level of investment has
been insufficient to maintain the industry's competitiveness on local and
export markets and a sizeable portion of industrial investment is devoted to
the purchase by nationals of existing foreign-owned assets. Second, the cost
structure of production factors is not favorable to industrial development.
Energy and utilities are very expensive; wages and benefits are high in
relation to productivity; the cost of financing investment reaches 17-20% per
year when taking into account interest rates, banking fees and Taxe sur les
Prestations de Services (TPS). Third, the small size and stagnation of the
domestic market is a problem for many enterprises which cannot maintain
sufficient capacity utilization and are ill-equipped to compete readily on
markets other than the integrated CEAO Market. The CEAO itself requires
substantial paper work before incentives (Taxe de Cooperation Regionale) can
be awarded.



- 6 -
1.11      Government awareness of these problems has, however, recently
improved and the Business-Government dialogue has been restored. Consistent
with its desire to rely more on the private sector for investment, the Govern-
ment has begun to rationalize its administrative structure. Studies to iden-
tify bottlenecks in the present investment review process and to introduce
coherence between industrial policy and related administrative measures would
be carried out under the Ministry of Industry as part of the proposed project
(para 3.09). Moreover, in August 1980, the Government of Senegal introduced
the above mentioned export subsidy scheme. Finally, the Government's recent
commitment to redirect industrial development away from public intervention to
private initiative; from large-scale, capital-intensive to small- and medium-
scale, labor intensive ventures, from marginal investments to directly produc-
tive projects, will create a more favorable investment climate.  The Government
has sought Bank assistance in these efforts.
C. The Fishing Industry
Description 1/
1.12      Since Independence, fisheries has been the sector with fastest
growth in Senegal, and its share of GDP has grown from 1.2% in 1960 to
roughly 5% today. This was made possible because of the existence within
Senegalese waters of sizeable exploitable resources including pelagic (sardi-
nellas, mackerel and tuna) and demersal (sole, red snapper, shrimps, octopus,
etc.) species. In 1978, the total catch of 233,000 tons was as follows:
Industrial Fishing  Artisanal Fishing   Total        x
Coastal Pelagic              21,688               114,000        135,688    58
Tuna fish                     19,384                 -            19,384      8
Demersal                      31,610               46,000         77,610    34
72,682(31%)         160,000(69%)  232,682   100
Artisanal fishing is important in terms of overall catch, employment crea-
tion (50,000 jobs) and protein supply for the local population. Industrial
fishing supplies an important fish processing industry which includes four
tuna canneries and 24 other firms (processing frozen fish, shrimps, fish
meal, etc.). Together these firms exported CFAF 16.9 billion in 1977 (11% of
total export receipts).  Industrial fishing expanded rapidly between 1966
and 1976 and total landing increased by 500% over that period. This growth
has also led to problems, including (i) overf-ishing of certain species, (ii)
fleet obsolescence (more than 15 years on average), (iii) inadequate port
infrastructure, and (iv) insufficient maintenance and capacity under-
utilization of the fleet.
1/   A detailed description of the Senegalese Fisheries sector is included
in the Staff Project Report for the Dakar Fishing Port project, April
5, 1977 (report no. 1260a-SE) and in the "Action Plan for Senegalese
Fisheries," January 1980, commissioned under the above mentioned project.



-7-
Policy and Prospects
1.13      A vigourous effort is currently underway with the assistance of
external agencies (IBRD, EEC and BADEA) to improve infrastructure, reorga-
nize sector administration and improve fleet management. This effort includes:
(a)  construction of a new fishing port in Dakar, a US$24 million
project, to double wharf length and free six hectares of land for
processing industries;
(b)  creation by Government of a specialized fisheries ministry (Secre-
tariat d'Etat a la Peche Maritime) fully responsible for sector
development and administration. One of its most urgent tasks is to
negotiate reciprocal fishing agreements with neighboring countries
(Mauritania, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, etc.) and enforce compliance
by foreign fleets of the 200-mile limit;
(c)  conception and adoption of a fisheries action plan:  the sector
diagnosis was completed in January 1980 and action proposals
were submitted to the Government in July 1980;
(d)  implementation, by SOFISEDIT, of an industrial fisheries credit
scheme to modernize and expand the fleet during the 1980s. 1/
According to the Fisheries Action Plan, CFAF 21 to 29 billion
will be required over the next 10 years to acquire 79 new or
second hand vessels. To enter this field of activity on a large
scale, SOFISEDIT is seeking funds and expertise (see para. 3.07(c)).
1.14      Prospects.  The IBRD-supported study of the fishing and fish
processing industries has revealed the need for additional investments and
better sector management. The sector potential remains important and, as
new initiatives develop, this activity will resume its important contribution
to economic growth in Senegal. As the designated banking partner for the
sector, SOFISEDIT would be in a position to develop a sizeable portfolio in
the fishing and fish processing industries. Its ability to respond rapidly
to the needs of the sector is therefore essential to its coritinued growth.
D. The Tourism Sector
Description 21
1.15      Along with fisheries, tourism is a sector which has developed
rapidly in the 1970s. With its mild winter, sandy beaches, excellent
1/   The 1985 and 1990 industrial catches are expected to exceed the 1978
figures by 39,800 tons and 70,500 tons respectively.
2/   The tourism sector is described in (a) the Staff Project Report for
the Petite Cote Tourism Project (No. 1266-SE of April 12, 1977); (b)
Annex IV of the Parapublic Sector Report (June 1, 1977) and (c) The
Bank's Economic Report of December 1979 entitled "The Economic Trends and
Prospects of Senegal" pp.46-47).



airport and strategic location on the Europe-Africa-South America air routes,
Senegal has significant tourist potential. Whereas about 25,000 tourists
visited Senegal in 1968, 200,000 arrivals were recorded in 1979, bringing
gross earnings of about CFAF 16 billion. This was made possible by the
development of hotel capacity, both in Dakar for business traffic, and south
of Dakar (on the Petite Cote and in Casamance) for winter beach tourism. The
number of hotel beds had reached 5,800 as of January 1979.
Policy
1.16      The development of tourism was one of the Government's priorities
in the fourth and fifth development plans. Its commitment has been demon-
strated by (i) special tax provisions for hotel investments, (ii) the creation
of a separate ministry, "Secretariat d'Etat au Tourisme", and (iii) heavy
Government Investment in hotel construction through equity participation
in 14 mixed enterprises. Now that tourism is past its infant stage, Govern-
ment has decided to limit its intervention to the provision of infrastructure
and to leave hotel construction and management in the hands of private entre-
preneurs. Thus, in the Petite Cote Tourism development scheme, Government has
financed basic infrastructure and common services and left hotel development
to the private sector, while equity and long-term loans are made available to
developers through Societe d'Amenagement de la Petite Cote (SAPCO) and
SOFISEDIT respectively.
Prospects
1.17      Tourism is already Senegal's third largest foreign exchange earner
after groundnuts and phosphate; it also has an important impact on employment
since two indirect jobs are created for every job created in hotels. Finally,
the tourism industry induces activities in areas which are poorly endowed for
manufacturing. The sector is however extremely sensitive to external factors
(international business trends, transport costs, purchasing power in Europe).
Should the occupancy rate be slightly lower, this highly leveraged business
would suffer seriously. It is also crucial for the growth of tourism that
local operating costs be kept under control and that transport costs be
brought in line with those of competing destinations. Finally, if the private
sector is to be responsible for hotel construction, suitable long-term finan-
cing must be made available, and SOFISEDIT must continue to play a crucial
role in providing term resources for further hotel development.
E. The Financial Sector
1.18      Senegal is a member of the Union Monetaire Ouest Africaine (UMOA),
a regional monetary union established in 1962 among Benin, Ivory Coast,
Niger, Upper Volta, Togo and Senegal. The union shares a common currency
(the CFA franc) tied to the French franc, a common Central Bank (Banque
Centrale des Etats d'Afrique de l'Ouest--BCEAO) and integrated credit and
monetary policies. BCEAD is administered by a Governor and a Board of



- 9 -
Directors representing each member state and France. Each state has its own
national credit committee which forms the link between BCEAO's national
branch and national political authorities.
1.19      Credit Policies.  Until 1975, credit was controlled quantitatively
through BCEAO's rediscount system which was the major source of liquidity
for the banks in the UMOA. In 1975, a reform was introduced to curtail
the banks' overwhelming dependence on the Central Bank for liquidity and
direct lending towards "priority" (productive) sectors. Rediscount accommoda-
tions are no longer automatic; they are decided on a case-by-case basis
depending on the applicant bank's liquidity position, and rediscount rates are
also subject to more frequent adjustments to avoid outflow of funds when
foreign interest rates are higher than in the UMOA.  Rediscount is available
for loans of up to ten years, giving all banks access to longer term resources.
Commercial and development banks are now treated equally and all loans above
CFAF 70 million are submitted to the Central Bank for prior approval, whether
they are later rediscounted or not. Central Bank refinancing is limited to
35% of any bank's portfolio, exclusive of agriculture seasonal credits and
government guaranteed loans. Finally, a sectoral policy has been introduced
gradually, forcing the banks to direct a certain portion (66% in the case of
Senegal) of their portfolio towards priority sectors (mainly agriculture,
fishing, industry, tourism, transport and housing).
1.20      Interest Rates.  Interest rates in the Union are controlled by
BCEAO regulations. A preferential interest rate is applied on credits in
priority areas including loans to Government, small-scale enterprises, 1/
short-term crop financing, and private housing. For credits in other areas,
the "normal" rate applies. On April 14, 1980, the interest rate structure
was adjusted upwards by 2.5 points to reflect international market conditions,
and the following rates are now in effect:
Table 1.3: INTEREST RATES
Discount     Allowable      Allowable
Type of Borrower       Rate        Spread        Final Rate
__  ____________(% )…_________________
Preferential
Agriculture            8.0       1.0 to 2.0    9.0 - 10.0
SSE                    8.0       1.0 to 3.0    9.0 - 11.0
Housing                8.0       1.0 to 3.0    9.0 - 11.0
Normal                  10.5       0.0 to 5.0   10.5 to 15.5
Final rates of interest apply whether the credit has been rediscounted at
the BCEAO or is financed from other sources.
1/   Small-scale enterprises are defined by BCEAO to be locally-owned
enterprises with credit outstanding of CFAF 30 million or less.

1.21      Inflation.  Price increases in Senegal have typically been in line
with those in France. Inflation, which had not historically been a major
problem, has recently picked up and, according to the latest data, consumer
prices rose by about 13% in the year through April, 1980. The rate of infla-
tion for calendar 1980 may well reach 14-15%; thereafter, the Bank projects a
gradual decline in inflation over the next three years to 10% in 1983.
1.22      The Banking System.  The financial sector of Senegal is relatively
well-developed, including six commercial banks, two development banks,
one housing bank and several leasing and consumer finance companies.  There
are no stock exchange nor bond market. Although several commercial banks
are controlled by Senegalese interests (most often government) they maintain
close ties with their foreign parent firms or major correspondent banks.
The two development finance institutions are SOFISEDIT and Banque Nationale
de Developpement du Senegal (BNDS). SOFISEDIT is described fully in Section
II of this report. BNDS, which was founded in 1964 and which is 73% owned
by the Government, has concentrated on lending for public utilities and
for agriculture. Banque de lHabitat du Senegal (BHS) was created in 1979
with IFC assistance to attract savings.and develop lending for housing.
Prospects for the Financial Sector
1.23      From September 1976 to September 1979, total credit outstanding in
Senegal increased from CFAF 119 billion to CFAF 210 billion, a 77% increase.
During this period, credit to non-priority sectors (trade and individuals)
have increased much faster than credit to priority sectors. The relative
share of industry has shown a marked decline while that of trade has increased
dramatically. To slow down the surge in bank credit, the Central Bank recently
imposed stringent quantitative ceilings which maintain each bank-s portfolio
at its 1979 level. This policy, justified on macro-economic grounds, con-
strains the ability of the commercial banks to finance new productive invest-
ments as they are unable to reduce their exposure on earlier non-priority
loans. This constraint on commercial banks has placed a higher demand on
SOFISEDIT which draws its resources from external lines of credit. In addi-
tion, the recent interest rate increase will make SOFISEDIT more competitive
vis-a-vis the commercial banks while allowing a larger spread on present and
future borrowings. SOFISEDIT which lends only for productive purposes should
therefore benefit from the stringent policies now in effect.
II. THE INSTITUTIONS
A. SOFISEDIT
The Institution
2.01      Introduction.  SOFISEDIT was created in 1974 as a limited liability
company with active assistance from the Bank and IFC. A specialized develop-
ment bank, SOFISEDIT makes term-loans and equity investments in industrial and



- 11 -
hotel ventures, but may not lend for infrastructure, agriculture, housing or
consumer durables. It was recently designated by the Government to be the
lead bank providing finance to ocean fishing fleets and fish processing
industries.
2.02      Ownership.  SOFISEDIT's initial capital was set at CFAF 650 million.
A capital increase of CFAF 750 million, a condition of Board presentation for
the proposed project, was recently confirmed by SOFISEDIT's shareholders,
changing the ownership structure as follows:

Although Government only has a minority interest in SOFISEDIT, the Bank is
subject to controls by the Government's auditor (Commission de Verification
des Comptes et de Controle des Etablissements Publics) like most mixed enter-
prises. The Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) is a public
French aid agency; BICIS, BIAO, SGBS, and USB are Senegalese commercial
banks; DEG is the Federal Republic of Germany's financial aid agency; Fidelity
International is a private American bank; Societe Financiere d'Outre Her
(SFOM) is BICIS' parent holding company; and Banque Ouest Africaine de Develop-
pement (BOAD) is a regional development bank.
2.03      Board of Directors.  SOFISEDIT's Board of Directors, which meets
about four times per year, consists of twelve members, including repre-
sentatives of IFC, DEG, CCCE, the local commercial banks (6), BCEAO and the
Government (2). The Board takes an active role in overseeing the company;
it approves all loans and investments.



- 12 -
2.04      Organization and Staff.  SOFISEDIT, which has remained a small
institution, is managed by a President General Manager. Its original manager
has very recently been replaced by a former senior adviser to the Presiaent
of Banque Ouest-Africaine de Developpement. Given the small size of the
institution, SOFISEDIT's organization is still relatively unstructured and
most of its eight professionals work either at project appraisal or supervi-
sion under the Operations Manager. One professional is in charge of the
Administrative unit which handles accounting and support services.  SOFISEDIT's
professional staff, which includes a trained engineer, is of high quality but
thinly spread.  Its primary weakness has been in investment supervision, but
help is also needed in the new field of lending to the fishing industry.  In
order to strengthen its capacities, SOFISEDIT has recruited several profes-
sionals, and it has asked the Bank Group for  technical assistance in the
areas of (1) industrial engineering; (2) fishing credit; and (3) financial
management and development strategy (see para. 3.07). In concurrence with the
expansion of its staffing and activities, SOFISEDIT will need to develop a
training program for all staff, covering industry, tourism, and fisheries,
project supervision techniques and financial forecasting. Assurances would be
sought at negotiations that SOFISEDIT would establish such a training program
to be submitted to the Bank before December 31, 1981.
2.05      Policies and Procedures.  SOFISEDIT's policies are described in
its by-laws and policy statement. It cannot commit more than 20% of its
unimpaired capital to any one client, nor finance more than 50% of subpro-
ject cost. 1/ Equity holdings cannot exceed 75% of SOFISEDIT's capital and
each equity participation is limited to 15% of SOFISEDIT's own equity and
25% of the client's capital. Although SOFISEDIT's policies are adequate, its
entry into fishing loans must be prudent and SOFISEDIT would agree at negotia-
tions to maintain maritime credits, at no more than 30% of its portfolio out-
standing. SOFISEDIT's procedures, as set forth in its operations manual, are
adequate. Project appraisals are of good quality, but supervision deserves
more attention (see para 2.11).
2.06      Procurement and Disbursement.  SOFISEDIT's supervision of procurement
is good. The engineer ensures that several quotations are obtained; he
verifies the value and quality of goods purchased, and prices are consistently
compared with those offered by other suppliers to ensure that the lowest
competitive price is obtained. For most projects, SOFISEDIT disburses to the
supplier directly and in the case of civil works, on-site verification precedes
disbursement.
2.07      Audited Statements.  SOFISEDIT's accounts are audited annually
by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and IFC. In 1979, the
Government's auditor (Commission de Verification des Comptes et de Controle
des Etablissements Publics) audited SOFISEDIT's books and policies which
were found satisfactory. In addition to its audited statements, SOFISEDIT
submits regular quarterly reports to the Bank.
1/   SOFISEDIT's management indicated at negotiations that it would seek from
its Board an increase in the exposure limit from 20% to 25% of unimpaired
equity and from 50% to 70% of subproject costs; the latter would only
apply for projects with assets below CFAF 100 million.



- 13 -
2.08      Foreign Exchange Risk.  SOFISEDIT is prohibited by its by-laws
from assuming the foreign exchange risk on any external borrowings. In
the case of previous lines of credit from the Bank, the foreign exchange
risk was borne by the Government. There is no exchange risk on SOFISEDIT's
other resources (BOAD, CCCE and KfW).
2.09       Interest Rates.  Until the recent increase in interest rates by
BCEAO (April 1980), SOFISEDIT's rates were within the range authorized by the
Central Bank, from 8.5% for small- and medium-enterprises to a maximum of 13%
for regular clients. These rates have now been increased by 2.5%. Within
this range, SOFISEDIT faced other constraints imposed by its lenders: BOAD
imposed a final rate of 10.5% on loans refinanced from its line of credit;
in the case of KfW, the maximum rate was 12.3%.
Operations and Finance
2.10      Portfolio.  The following table summarizes SOFISEDIT gross approvals
since inception:

1/   Fiscal year: October 1-September 30.
Although operations have not grown as rapidly as expected at the time of
inception, SOFISEDIT has nevertheless played a key role in supporting invest-
ments in the industrial and tourism sectors and has participated in roughly
25% of all new industrial and tourism investments undertaken in Senegal over
the first five years of its existence. Below are a few highlights of
SOFISEDIT-s portfolio which is fully described in Annex 4.
- Out of 71 projects approved since inception, 35 were for industry,
22 for SME (fixed assets below CFAF 50 million) and 14 for
tourism.
- Among subsectors, tourism is first with 22%, followed by chemicals
(19%), fisheries (12%), food and drinks (10%) and building materials
(9%).



- 14 -
- Two-thirds of the projects are located in Dakar; one third in the
other regions. Decentralization was most significant for tourism
with 10 out of 14 projects located outside Dakar.
- 65% (by number) of SOFISEDIT's projects are fully or majority
Senegalese-owned; 60% are new enterprises and 30% have been sub-
mitted by SONEPI.
- Five thousand new jobs have been created at an average cost
per job of US$27,000. This figure is considerably distorted by a
few large, capital intensive modernization and hotel projects.
In contrast, 26 projects with a total investment of CFAF 100
million or less have created jobs at an average cost of US$7,000.
2.11       Arrears.  Management reports on problem projects at each board
meeting.  At the end of FY79, SOFISEDIT had approved 71 projects of which six
had been suspended and five cancelled for a total of CFAF 742 million.
Thirty-four projects were either under implementation or in operations; eight
of these (CFAF 376.5 million outstanding) suffered from managerial and marke-
ting problems and continue to pose some risk of loss to SOFISEDIT. At the end
of FY79, SOFISEDIT reported arrears of CFAF 295 million. Of these, principal
in arrears represented CFAF 104 million or 5.7% of total outstanding. Invest-
ments affected by these arrears amounted to 413 million or 23% of portfolio
outstanding. Government has however recently honored its guarantee on
SOFISEDIT's loans to Societe Nationale pour la Promotion du Tourisme (26% of
total arrears). Although SOFISEDIT's accounting and follow-up are generally
adequate, some of the arrears could have been avoided by more substantive
supervision and a greater effort to help clients deal with management and
marketing problems.
2.12       Provisions.  At the end of FY79 provisions against loans amounted
to CFAF 110 million, and against equity holdings CFAF 87 million representing
6% and 73%, respectively, of amounts outstanding. SOFISEDIT's auditors are
satisfied with the level of provisions for bad debts and the Bank concurs
with this view.
2.13       Resources.  Other than its equity capital, all of SOFISEDIT's
resources (except for BCEAO rediscounts) have come from external lines of
credit. The Bank has made two loans of US$3 million (987-SE) and US$4.2
million (1332-SE) bearing interest rates of 7.25% and 8.9%, respectively.  The
KfW has extended a line of credit of DM 5 million at 8.3% exclusively for the
financing of SME projects 1/. Banque Ouest-Africaine de Developpement (BOAD)
made a loan of CFAF 700 million bearing a subsidized interest of 7% and CCCE
1/   A differential of 6.3% is earmarked for interest subsidies in favor of
SSE.

has a standing agreement to refinance SOFISEDIT's investment on a case-by-
case basis. So far SOFISEDIT has used this facility for one project (100
million) refinanced at 7.5%. All these resources are now fully committed and
SOFISEDIT has approached donors for renewal of their lines of credit. KfW is
willing to extend another DM 5 million line of credit in favor of SEE invest-
ments. BOAD has also appraised SOFISEDIT for a second loan and expressed
interest in financing fisheries development.
2.14      Financial Situation.  Despite a slow take-off, SOFISEDIT has
been able to generate an operating profit since 1978. Provisions for bad
and doubtful loans and investments have, however, eroded SOFISEDIT's capital
from CFA 650 million at its inception to CFAF 440 million at the end of FY79.
SOFISEDIT's total assets amounted to CFAF 2.0 billion at the end of FY79, and
the debt equity ratio was 2.9:1. As shown in the following Table, SOFISEDIT's
operating profit in 1979 amounted to CFAF 19 million, but, after provisions
of CFAF 165 million, there was a loss of CFAF 146 million. SOFISEDIT has not
yet been in a position to pay a dividend, and will be unable to do so in
the near future.

Past Performance and Prospects
2.15      Performance.  The steady deterioration of SOFISEDlT's financial
position resulted from a lower than expected level of operations, uncompen-
sated for by a sufficient spread. The reasons for SOFISEDIT's slow take-
off are summarized below:
(a) External reasons for SOFISEDIT's poor performance include (1)
the low level of industrial investment in Senegal over the last
five years; and (2) the increased competition from commercial banks
following the 1975 BCEAO reforms.
(b) Internal reasons include (1) SOFISEDIT's statutory exposure limits
combined with its small equity base; (2) the lack of argressive
promotion efforts; and (3) the insufficient monitoring and super-
vision of often difficult and risky projects.



- 16 -
2.16      New Strategy.  Under new management, SOFISEDIT has now defined a
new orientation which should consolidate its place in the financial community
and allow it to capitalize on its position as a term lender of foreign resour-
ces.  The elements of this strategy have been reviewed at negotiations, and
submitted in a coherent strategy paper which was due before Board presentation.
They include: (1) a more active approach to project promotion, including more
promotional equity investments; (2) increased lending for tourism; and (3) new
lending for fishing and fish processing. Externally, this strategy will
benefit from the current restrictions on commercial banks lending and Central
Bank rediscounts, as well as the revised interest rate structure. Internally,
it would be supported by an increase in staff, a move to larger quarters, a
more aggressive stance by management and the creation of a fisheries credit
department.
2.17      Prospects.  Financial projections and the assumption on which they
are based are presented in Annexes 6 to 8. These projections assume approval
of the proposed loan and quasi-equity scheme and a doubling of SOFISEDIT's
capital to CFAF 1.3 billion. SOFISEDIT presently has approved six projects
for a total of CFAF 850 million which are awaiting additional resources in
order to be disbursed. Several other projects are under consideration
and SOFISEDIT's level of approval is conservatively expected to grow by
roughly 10% annually between 1980 and 1985. At this level of operations (and
including earnings from short-term investments) SOFISEDIT is expected to
generate a profit after provisions beginning in 1983. Of the total amount of
GFAF 5.1 billion which SOFISEDIT must mobilize over the next five years, the
proposed loan and quasi-equity would meet CFAF 1.6 billion, or 32%. Additional
resources would come from the capital increase, Central Bank rediscounts, KfW,
BOAD, and CCCE. Based on these assumptions, SOFISEDIT's operational and
financial prospects are satisfactory.
B. SONEPI
2.18      Background.  SONEPI was established in 1972 as a mixed public
company to assist local businessmen to establish and expand their own enter-
prises. UNIDO was instrumental in the establishment and early functioning of
SONEPI and maintains two experts (a management advisor and a marketing expert)
in the organization. SONEPI's assistance takes the form of feasibility and
marketing studies, equity participations and loan guarantees, training and
extension work and management of industrial estates throughout Senegal (two
existing and four planned). Since its founding in 1972, SONEPI has prepared
65 projects, taken equity positions in 29 firms and trained 400 Senegalese
businessmen and professionals. According to its statutes SONEPI must deal
exclusively with Senegalese entities.
2.19      Organization and Staff.  SONEPI is organized into four operational
sections plus two teams at the industrial estates in Thies and Ziguinchor.
The operational departments are (1) Studies; (2) Training; (3) Industrial
Information and (4) Artisanal Affairs. As of June 30, 1979, professional
staff numbered 69, of whom 65 were Senegalese. In addition to the two



- 17 -
experts from UNIDO, two engineers are financed by German aid. By profes-
sion, there are six economists and five engineers among the staff. Although
the quality of SONEPI's staff is satisfactory, and the director dedicated, it
has proven difficult for SONEPI to break out of its bureaucratic style and
raise productivity of its staff. Establishment of an incentive system to do
so would be an objective of the proposed project (para. 3.08).
2.20      Operations.  Since 1972, enterprises promoted by SONEPI have created
or stabilized 1,600 jobs at a cost of about $8,300 per job. Consolidated
sales of these firms amount to CFAF 5 billion per year and value added to CFAF
1.5 billion. Employment generation has been most effective in metal working,
garage and plumbing subsectors.  The pace of operations has picked up under
the new Director and, in FY80, SONEPI prepared 23 projects, of which 16 were
implemented creating about 800 jobs. Since its establishment in 1972, the
Equity Participation Fund has committed CFAF 56 million for 29 projects. A
parallel Guarantee Fund, also established in 1972, has guaranteed 29 loans in
an amount of CFAF 162 million. During 1979 SONEPI gave four seminars attended
by 46 persons; and the artisanal service section established 11 artisanal
cooperatives and provided advice to 24 separate artisanal firms.
2.21      Financial Condition.  SONEPI-s balance sheet and income statement
are summarized in Annex 10. As of June 1979, SONEPI had total assets of
CFAF 230 million of which 80 million for the Equity Participation Fund and
74 million for the Guarantee Fund. Operating expenses of CFAF 156 million
(including 92 million for salaries) were not fully matched by revenues from
services rendered to clients and the Government (CFAF 106 million) and,
despite an operating subsidy of CFAF 38 million, SONEPI showed a loss of
CFAF 10 million. Overall, SONEPI is still very dependent on Government
financing but is increasingly billing its clients for services rendered.
These practices deserve to be encouraged.
2.22      Performance and Prospects.  SONEPI's record over its eight years
existence is mixed. On one hand, it has fulfilled a useful role and has been
instrumental in developing modern sector, Senegalese-owned, small-scale
enterprises. On the other, the Government has too often relied on SONEPI as
an administrative agency, diverting its energy away from its original purpose
of industrial promotion. Moreover, SONEPI has two distinct--and often conflict-
ing--extension services, one for SSE and the other for artisanal enterprises.
The duplication of extension services, if carried out at the regional level,
would result in overstaffing and inefficiency. Finally, from the point of
view of creating viable SME with sound financial management, a reliable
product and a viable market position, SONEPI has not always been successful.
Shortcomings can be traced to some of the following problems (1) SONEPI's
ideal of an SME is theoretical and its extension methods lack flexibility;
(2) its "hand-holding" approach opposed to encouraging self-help results in
the dependence of its SME clients on external assistance, sophisticated tech-
nologies and elaborate management techniques. Despite the above weaknesses,
SONEPI has the potential and the willingness to improve its efficiency and to
move away from its bureaucratic bias. It needs to (a) focus on its core
functions of project identification and assistance and (b) abandon some of
the additional tasks imposed on it by the Government and other agencies.
Accordingly, a specific component has been included in the proposed project to
assist SONEPI to upgrade the quality of its key services (see para. 3.08).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Origin and Objectives
3.01      Earlier Projects.  The Bank Group's association with SOFISEDIT
is a long standing one: at the time of SOFISEDIT's inception, IFC made
an equity investment of US$237,530 (CFAF 50 million) and the Bank a loan
of US$3 million followed by a second line of credit of US$4.2 million in
1976. These lines of credit were for unrestricted use, except for small
amounts allocated for technical assistance to SOFISEDIT and an artisan pilot
project administered by SONEPI. A project completion report, the findin6s of
which were reflected in Chapter II, has recently been circulated 1/. Al-
though commitments and disbursements under the two lines of credit have been
slower than expected, the bulk of the two Bank loans has now been disbursed
and 22 investments have been financed resulting in the creation or consolida-
tion of over 2,000 jobs.  The most difficult aspects of the earlier projects
have been the institution building effort (first loan) and the attempt to
assist artisans (second loan). The second project's artisan component, which
provided advice to 24 artisan enterprises, was successful in identifying the
constraints faced by typical Senegalese artisans. The European Development
Fund is financing the extension of SONEPI's artisan service.
3.02      Project Genesis and Objectives.  Recently, however, the Government
asked the Bank to broaden the impact of its lending for industry by streng-
thening SONEPI and assisting the Government in several aspects of industrial
policy. The design and preparation of the proposed project have been under-
taken in this broader context; the result is a package of financial and
technical assistance which would complement the Bank's Structural Adjustment
Loan/Credit and support the Government's policy of fiscal austerity and
renewed emphasis on productive private-sector investments. Specifically, the
project would:
(1) provide equity and term resources for sound industrial, fisheries and
tourism investments;
(2) strengthen SOFISEDIT, financially and institutionally;
(3) improve SME promotion in Senegal;
(4) identify appropriate changes in Government policy and procedures to
enhance productive investments.

B. Project Description
3.03       The project would be supported by a blend of IBRD (US$6.5 million)
and IDA (US$2.4 million) resources and consist of the following components:
(a) A line of credit to SOFISEDIT (US$6.5 million) complemented by a
quasi-equity transfer (US$l million) earmarked for equity participa-
tions and a technical assistance and training package (US$700,000);
(b) A program to help SONEPI improve the quality of its project pre-
paration and assistance (US$500,000);
(c) Policy-oriented studies and training for the Ministry of Indus-
trial Development (US$200,000).
The project would be implemented over a three-year period.
SOFISEDIT
3.04       (1) The Line of Credit (IBRD).  It would be a standard IBRD loan of
US$6.5 million guaranteed by the Government of Senegal. SOFISEDIT's other
resources having restricted use either in favor of SME projects (KfW) or
regional investments (BOAD), there would be no specific restriction on the
line of credit other than economic and financial viability of proposed sub-
projects in sectors open to SOFISEDIT's interventions (Industry, Tourism and
Fisheries). These investments would typically include hotels, agro-processing,
chemicals, textiles and fisheries which are priority sectors under the new,
export-oriented industrial policy. Based on past experience, SOFISEDIT would
be expected to make about 30 loans in these subsectors. The Bank would
refinance 100% of SOFISEDIT's loans 1/. Foreign exchange costs not covered by
the IBRD refinanced loans (roughly 207% of subproject costs) would be financed
by suppliers credit and/or commercial bank loans.
3.05       Terms and Conditions for all subloans financed under the line
of credit would be as follows:
(a) Maturities: The proposed Bank loan of US$6.5 million would be to
SOFISEDIT for 18 years including 3 years of grace. SOFISEDIT would
repay the Bank according to a flexible amortization schedule based
on aggregate subloan repayments. The terms of SOFISEDIT's subloans
would be flexible with a maximum of 15 years and a minimum of 4
years; terms are expected to average 8 years for industrial projects,
10 years for fisheries projects and 12 years for tourism projects.
The grace period on principal repayment would range from one to
three years.
1/   SOFISEDIT's exposure is limited to 20% of its unimpaired capital and
reserves, and to 50% of subproject cost. These are likely to be revised
upwards to 25% and 70% respectively (para 2.05).



- 20 -
(b) Interest Rates. SOFISEDIT is obliged to comply with the BCEAO
interest rate structure which imposes final rates of 9-11% for SME
with outstanding credit below CFAF 30 million, and of 10.5% to 15.5%
for other borrowers. To give SOFISEDIT flexibility in a competitive
environment and yet ensure an adequate spread on its operations,
SOFISEDIT would agree at negotiations to charge a minimum spread of
3% above the cost of funds or apply market rates whichever is
higher.
(c)   Commitment Fee.  The Bank-s standard commitment fee of 3/4 of 1%
would apply to SOFISEDIT and a similar fee would be charged
to subborrowers.
(d)   Foreign Exchange Risk.  The foreign exchange risk would be borne
by the Government for a 0.5% fee which would be passed on to
subborrowers by SOFISEDIT.
(e)   Free Limit.  The individual free limit would be maintained at
US$250,000 (CFAF 58.7 million) and the aggregate free limit
would be raised to US$2.5 million.
(f)   Economic Analysis.  In line with the Bank-s effort to monitor
investments in Senegal under Structural Adjustment Lending,
the analysis of all subprojects would include, in addition to
the financial rate of return, investment cost per job, local
value added and estimates of foreign exchange earned or saved.
For all projects above the free limit, SOFISEDIT would compute
the economic rate of return, which would be expected to reach at
least 10%, in line with structural adjustment lending criteria.
For subprojects below the free-limit, SOFISEDIT would also calculate
an ERR, except for cases where international prices are not readily
available.
(g)  Debt-Equity Ratio.  SOFISEDIT's term indebtedness would be limited
to four times its unimpaired capital and reserves.
3.06      (2)   Quasi-equity (IDA).  US$1 million (CFAF 235 million) of the
proposed IDA credit would be passed on by the Government to SOFISEDIT to
finance the acquisition by SOFISEDIT of equity shares in majority-owned
Senegalese firms in the industrial, fishing and tourism sectors which would
also normally receive credit from SOFISEDIT. These resources would be onlent
to SOFISEDIT on a subordinated debenture. Interest payments would be tied to
dividends earned annually on the equity investments and principal repayments
to the proceeds of their sale to the promoter or other investors. A portion
of the dividends and sale proceeds would be used to cover SOFISEDIT's admini-
strative costs. This special feature of the project has been developed to (1)
overcome the difficulty of Senegalese-owned firms to find adequate equity,
(2) improve the financing plan of SOFISEDIT-financed subprojects and (3)
stimulate equity investment by SOFISEDIT which, at this stage, cannot afford
to commit borrowed resources in equity investments which normally do not yield
income for several years. SOFISEDIT-s exposure limit for equity investments



- 21 -
(15% of its equity and 25% of the client's capital) would apply to this
component. SOFISEDIT would be expected to purchase equity in 10 to 15 small
or medium size enterprises either starting or expanding their operations. All
equity investments refinanced under this component would be subject to Bank
review and approval.
3.07       (3) Technical Assistance (IDA).  SOFISEDIT is now at a critical
phase in its development. To overcome its initial weaknesses it has developed
a strategy based on active portfolio supervision and assistance, aggressive
promotion in the business and financial community and efforts to develop
fisheries credit. Accordingly, SOFISEDIT has requested renewed technical
assistance and training, and the project would include a grant of US5700,000
to finance:
(a)  two man-years of a senior advisor to the President specialized
in bank organization, financial management and corporate strategy
(US$200,000);
(b)  Two man-years of an industrial engineer, with experience in small-
and medium-scale enterprise management, to strengthen the project
supervision capabilities of SOFISEDIT, monitor its equity investment
portfolio and improve its cooperation with SONEPI. This engineer
would concentrate on establishing, in collaboration with SONEPI,
sound procedures for the follow-up of projects financed by SOFISEDIT
and on technically assisting promoters during the different phase of
their projects conception and implementation (US$200,000);
(c)  Two-man-years of a fisheries credit specialist with previous experi-
ence in setting up fisheries credit programs and exposure to fishing
conditions in West Africa. This expert would be responsible for (1)
reviewing the demand for fisheries credit in Senegal and preparing a
proposal for setting up a fisheries credit department within
SOFISEDIT; (2) implementing the fisheries department after the
proposal has been found satisfactory by SOFISEDIT-s board and the
Bank; and (3) organizing a training program, both in-house and
external, for the professionals appointed to the fisheries credit
department (US$200,000);
(d)  a staff training program, including (1) exposure to financial
and accounting techniques for SOFISEDIT's new recruits; (2) sectoral
specialization in fisheries, hotel and industrial management for
appraisal and supervision staff; (3) economic analysis to help
measure and monitor the contribution of subprojects (US$100,000).
At negotiations, SOFISEDIT would agree to submit the program design
by December 31, 1981.
In order to speed up technical assistance implementation, the cost of recruit-
ment, settlement and two months salary for the senior advisor and the fisheries
expert (US$130,000) would be eligible for retroactive financing.



- 22 -
SONEPI Operating Support (IDA).
3.08      Expansion of private sector investment in Senegal has been con-
strained by SONEPI's inability to play a more active promotion role and to
provide adequate extension services in the SME sector. This inability stemmed
from three main factors: (1) rigid bureaucratic procedures with little
incentive for productivity and efficiency; (2) SONEPI's limited investment
budget which results in poor building maintenance, inadequate furnishings,
transport problems (for client visits) and shortage of supplies; and (3) lack
of specialized technical expertise hindering project identification and
client assistance activities. The proposed IDA support to SONEPI (US$500,000
passed on to SONEPI by the Government as a grant) would address these con-
straints by establishing with SONEPI a program consisting of the following:
(a) Performance Audit: A review of SONEPI's operations and organiza-
tion would be carried out by a qualified firm of management con-
sultants to review SONEPI's past operations, identify bottlenecks
and propose structural and programming reforms. Following satis-
factory completion of this initial audit, SONEPI would adopt a
three-year work program outlining annual quantitative and qualita-
tive output targets (number of projects identified, performance of
assisted enterprises, etc.). Progress in achieving the targets
would be monitored yearly at the time SONEPI's financial statements
are issued. The cost of the component is estimated at US$100,000.
As the initial review conditions the implementation of the whole
program, it should be carried out without delay. Accordingly,
expenditures of up to US$50,000 would be eligible for retroactive
financing.
(b) Budget Support: The project provides US$200,000 for the procurement
of goods and services to enhance SONEPI's operational efficiency.
The IDA allocation of US$200,000 would be by annual tranches. The
first tranche established would be committed on the basis of the
completion of the above mentioned progress review and agreed program
and targets in (a) above and following tranches would be commmitted
on the basis of annual progress reviews. In all cases, IDA-s
approval of the list of equipment and goods to be purchased during
the coming year would be required. Spread over a three-year period,
IDA support would represent an increment of 10% over SONEPI-s
present annual budget of CFAF 160 million. All disbursements would
be made against invoices.
(c) Consultant Services: A consultant budget of US$200,000 (roughly
20 man-months) would enable SONEPI to complement its in-house
expertise with short-term consultants. The consultants would
assist SONEPI's own staff with specialized aspects of project
identification and/or enterprise assistance. IDA would approve the
terms of reference and the qualification of consultants for each
assignment.



- 23 -
Ministry of Industry Studies (IDA).
3.09      Support to the Ministry of Industry would amount to US$200,000
and would enable the Ministry to carry out two important studies:
(1) A critical path analysis of approval of industrial investments.
The analysis would be based on actual case studies and would
identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies with special attention
being given to the Ministry's own practices and procedures.
(2) A review of the coherence between industrial development objectives
and various policy instruments used by the Government to carry out
its economic policies. Using a matrix format, the study would help
the Ministry perceive contradictions and propose desirable changes.
These two studies would be carried out by working groups in the Miinistry
assisted by an external consultant. This method, used in the case of Senegal's
recent tax reform, has proven successful in gathering inputs from various
agencies of Government and the business community. In addition to the studies,
the Minister has also requested IDA support for training the staff in the
Direction de llIndustrie. An allocation of US$100,000 has been earmarked
for that purpose. It would be contingent on the submission of a satisfactory
training program.
C. Project Costs and Financing
3.10      Total project costs are estimated at US$17.9 million, including
taxes of US$2.2 million (12.3%). Foreign exchange costs would be US$11.3
million (63% of total project costs). The proposed IBRD loan of US$6.5 mil-
lion and IDA Credit of US$2.5 would therefore represent 50% of total project
costs. It would finance 80% of total foreign expenditures, the balance of
which would be covered by commercial bank loans and suppliers credit. Some
local costs (US$30,000) related to the technical assistance program would,
however, be financed out of credit proceeds. The IDA credit includes
US$130,000 of retroactive financing to cover the cost of recruiting technical
assistance for SOFISEDIT and US$50,000 for carrying out SONEPI's performance
audit. The Bank loan also includes US$600,000 for retroactive financing on
three subloans already reviewed by the Bank and for which expenditures have
already been incurred. Project costs and the proposed financing plan are
summarized in the following tables (See tables pages 24 and 25):

D. Project Implementation
3.11      The project would be carried out by SOFISEDIT, SONEPI and the
Ministry of Industrial Development for their respective components.
3.12      Monitoring.  In addition to its audited statements, SOFISEDIT would
submit semi-annual progress reports to the Bank in the form presently used for
the second project which includes information on the financial and economic



- 26 -
evaluation of approved projects. SONEPI would have its account audited annu-
ally by an auditor acceptable by IDA. It has agreed at negotiations to carry
out a performance audit (see para. 3.08) by December 31, 1981, and to submit
annual progress reports. For the two studies described in para. 3.09 above,
the Ministry would submit to IDA for approval the TOR, consultant's resumes
and proposals. Conclusions would be discussed with IDA and agreed recommen-
dations would be implemented by the government in consultation with IDA.
3.13      Consultants.  The qualifications, terms and conditions of advisors
and short-term consultants financed under the project would be acceptable to
the Bank. Provision has been made to finance six man-years of advisors and
36 man-months of short-term consultants estimated at an average foreign
exchange cost of US$10,700 per man-month, plus local expenditures and sub-
sistence of US$3,000 per man-month in the case of short-term consultants.
SOFISEDIT would be responsible for local housing and transportation of the
long-term advisors.
3.14      Procurement.  SOFISEDIT is expected to follow its usual procure-
ment procedures which have proven adequate to ensure that goods and services
are suitable and reasonably priced (see para. 2.06).
3.15      Disbursements.  Disbursements would be fully documented and would
be made on the following basis:
(a) subloans and equity: 100% of foreign expenditures and 85% of local
expenditures up to the amount of SOFISEDIT-s subloan or equity
investment as authorized by the Bank;
(b) technical assistance to SOFISEDIT: 100% of foreign costs;
(c) training and short-term consultants: 100% of total costs;
(d) SONEPI: (1) performance audit: 100% of professional fees (including
subsistence if applicable); (2) budget support: 100% of the net of
tax cost of equipment and goods purchased; and (3) for short-term
consultants 100% of total costs.
Annex 12 gives the estimated disbursement schedule for the project.
E. Benefits and Risks
3.16      The project is expected to generate the following benefits to
Senegal:
(a) Productive investments. Under the line of credit and quasi-equity
component, SOFISEDIT is expected to finance about 35 financially and
economically viable subprojects in the manufacturing, fisheries and
tourism sectors. These subprojects would represent an investment of
US$16 million. Although the creation of new jobs under the project
is likely to be limited (700 new jobs at a cost of US$23,500 per



- 27 -
job), the project would make an important contribution towards the
preservation of current employment in industry by strengthening
existing firms through modernization and expansion. These invest-
ments would also increase domestic value added and improve Senegal's
competitive position in a range of processed products.
(b) Institution building. The institutional improvements to be achieved
in SOFISEDIT under the project such as active promotion and super-
vision of subprojects, increased range of financial services for
investors and, improved organization and management, would improve
SOFISEDIT-s overall efficiency and the quality of its investments.
As a result of this project, of its capital increase and of renewed
donors' support, SOFISEDIT will be in a position to play a leading
role in the promotion of productive investments in Senegal.
(c) Investment promotion. By attempting to bring some coherence in
policy and remove administrative bottlenecks in the investment
process, the project would contribute to renewed investor interest
in Senegal. By fostering a greater responsiveness on the part of
SONEPI to entrepreneurs' needs, the project would be instrumental in
increasing SME productivity through improved technical and managerial
skills.
3.17      Risks.  Owing to the small size of the Senegalese market and to the
high cost of its production inputs (materials, energy and labor), investing in
Senegal has always been difficult. The uncertainties surrounding Senegal-s
present economic condition--weak public finances, balance of payments deficit,
credit restrictions--are not inviting to entrepreneurs. However, by focusing
on some of the most promising sectors of the economy, simplifying the invest-
ment process and improving entreprise promotion and assistance, the project
can be expected to contribute to a stabilization of Senegal's present indus-
trial base and to assist Government in carrying out its policy of reviving
productive investments.
IV. RECOMEENDATIONS
4.01      The report recommends a Bank loan of US$6.5 million to SOFISEDIT
and an IDA credit of US$2.5 million to the Government of Senegal. The Govern-
ment of Senegal would (a) pass on US$1 million of this amount to SOFISEDIT as
a subordinated debenture for the purpose of taking equity participations in
majority Senegalese-owned firms and (b) use the remaining US$1.4 million as a
grant to SOFISEDIT, SONEPI and the Ministry of Industrial Development to
finance the program of technical assistance.
4.02      During negotiations, agreement has been reached on the following
points:
(a) The Government:



- 28 -
(i)  approved the outline of the Terms of reference for the two
policy studies and agreed to submit an appropriate training
program for its Ministry of Industrial Development (para
3.09);
(ii)  reimbursed arrears on Government-guaranteed subloans to
SOFISEDIT (para 2.11);
(iii) will assume the foreign exchange risk on the line of credit
to SOFISEDIT (para 3.05(d); and
(iv) agreed to the Loan and Credit on-lending terms and conditions
(para 3.05).
The role of SOFISEDIT in the banking system as a development bank specialized
in the term-financing of industrial, tourism, and fisheries projects was also
discussed.
(b) SOFISEDIT:
(i)  agreed to on-lending terms and conditions to sub-borrowers and
to economic and financial criteria for eligible subprojects
(para 3.05);
(ii) obtained from its shareholders their formal agreement to the
proposed doubling of capital (para 2.02);
(iii) recruited additional staff to strengthen the existing organi-
zation (para 2.04);
(iv) submitted a plan of action outlining the bank's strategy and
financial projections for the next three years (para 2.16);
(v)  will prepare, before December 1981, a three year training
program for its staff to be reviewed by the Bank (para 2.04);
(vi) agreed to limit its term-debt equity ratio to 4:1
(para 3.05(g));
(vii) agreed to limit fisheries loans to 35% of its portfolio out-
standing (para 2.05).
(c) SONEPI:
(i)  agreed to the program described in para 3.08 above.
(ii) submitted the TOR for the performance audit; and agreed to
submit to IDA results of the performance audit, annual progress
reports, and terms of reference and qualifications of
consultants.



- 29 -
4.03      The signing of Financing Agreements between the Government and
SOFISEDIT, and between the Government and SONEPI would be conditions of
effectiveness.
4.04      With the above conditions fulfilled, the proposed project would
be suitable for a Bank loan of US$6.5 million, and an IDA Credit of
US$2.4 million.

FORECAST OF LOAN AND EQUITY APPROVALS
1.      Credit Approvals.  From a base of FCFA 800 million in 1981,
approvals of SOFISEDIT's regular credit operations for industry and
tourism are assumed to grow at a rate of about 10% p.a. This is a
conservative assumption implying little real growth. Although demand
for fishery credits is expected to reach FCFA 1 billion annually,
FCFA 200 million in 1981, 400 million in 1982 and 500 million
thereafter. Cancellationsare projected at 20% of gross approvals
based on historical experience. In addition it is assumed that
approvals on SAPCO managed funds would be about FCFA 200 million
per year.
According to recent agreements with the Government,
SOFISEDIT has also been given the mandate to administer the
portfolio of the Government's past credits to the fisheries sector.
Administration of this portfolio, which amounts to a total of
some FCFA 7 billion, is assumed to yield a net fee of 1% to
SOFISEDIT. Although expected to be completed in two years, the
transfer of the portfolio in these projections is assumed to take
place at a much slower rate.
2.      Equity Participation.  Under its new management, and
with increased resources, SOFISEDIT is expected to increase rapidly
its equity investments as a promotional measure in packaging new
financing.
3.      Commitments.  Consistent with SOFISEDIT's experience,
commitments have been projected as follows: 20% in Year 1, 44% in
Year II, 34% in Year III and 6% in Year IV. Disbursements against
equity are set at 100% in Year I.
5.      Based on the above set of assumptions, approvals and
disbursements are assumed to be as follows (FCAF million):

6.      Standard Loan Terms.  SOFISEDIT's current outstanding portfolio
has an average remaining life of 7 years. Average weighted interest
rate on this portfolio is 11.3%. However, to take account of reschedulings
average life has been assumed 8 years. New loans are expected to average
10 years including 2 years grace and carry an average rate of 13.5%,
consistent with current rates.

7.        Income.  Income from regular portfolio is assumed to average
11.3% for old loans and 13.5% for all new loans. Income from managed
funds is to net 1.5% on SAPCO and 1.0% on fisheries portfolio. Equity
investments are not assumed to generate any dividends.
8.        Operating Expenses.  Reflecting additional needs in staff
and overheads due to expansion in fishing credits as well as managed
fund activities, operating expenses are projected to increase substantially
in relation to previous years.
9.        Provisions.  Taking account of SOFISEDIT's past experience,
provisions are expected to be maintained at the level of 5.5% of the
outstanding credits and 40% of the equity portfolio.
10.       Borrowings.  To reflect higher rates, average cost of borrowings
is assumed to increase gradually from 7.6% in 1980 to 8.0% in 1981, 8.5%
in 1982 and 9.0% thereafter. Repayments on direct borrowings are assumed
to average one fifteenth of the outstanding amount. Managed SAPCO funds
are to be repaid in line with managed sub-loan repayments.
11.       Capital Increase.  SOFISEDIT's capital increase of FCFA 650
mission is assumed to be paid in at the rate of 50% in FY1981 and 50%
in FY1982.
12.       Fixed Assets.  To reflect expenses related to SOFISEDIT's moving
into new offices, fixed assets are assumed to increase by FCFA 50 million
in 1982.
