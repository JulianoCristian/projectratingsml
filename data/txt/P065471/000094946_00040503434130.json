Uttar Pradesh Fiscal Reform and\n            Public Sector Restructuring Project, will aim at reversing\n            the government's unsuccessful reforms, and will\n            support: 1) fiscal reforms, ensuring its sustainability,\n            through the creation of additional fiscal pressures over the\n            medium term, for public investments in high priority\n            development areas, including improvements in the social\n            sector spending; and, 2) public sector restructuring, with\n            the intent to improve the quality of service delivery. This\n            will be achieved by transforming the role of Government,\n            through civil service reforms, which will prod transparency,\n            deregulation, and will strengthen anti-corruption\n            institutions, through decentralization, and improved\n            financial management, and accountability. The credit/loan\n            will be disbursed in one tranche, being the first operation\n            within a proposed sequence of operations. Improved fiscal\n            adjustments, and social services delivery, are benefits\n            which will prod economic growth, while reducing poverty, in\n            addition to the beneficial contributions in the overall\n            reduction of public sector borrowing requirements. However,\n            the possible reverse in the reform agenda due to political\n            opposition, and, the weak institutional capacity, are major\n            risks to be taken into consideration."}, "docdt": "2000-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
