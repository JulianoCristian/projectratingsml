strengthen\n            the country's institutional capabilities and thereby\n            assist its efforts to diversify and increase agricultural\n            production, as well as to formulate, promote and implement\n            an energy conservation program. The project would also\n            contribute to the identification and preparation of further\n            projects for possible external financing. The project would\n            have two components, an agriculture diversification\n            component and an energy conservation component. The project\n            consists of the following: (a) advising the Government on\n            policies and extension methodology, vegetable extension,\n            irrigation, and marketing; the provision of local\n            counterparts; preparation and implementation of small-scale\n            pilot projects; and fellowships; and (b) advising and\n            assisting the Government on the establishment of an energy\n            conservation planning and implementing organization, energy\n            conservation programs, project preparation, and training.\n            The project includes the provision of specialized equipment\n            and library materials."}, "docdt": "1982-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
