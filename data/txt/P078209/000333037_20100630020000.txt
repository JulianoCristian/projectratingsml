                                  Restructuring Paper

1.     The Closing Date for the Kenya Development Learning Centre Project
(P078209), Grant No H065-KE, will be extended from June 30, 2010 until December 31,
2011. As explained below, although the Government is requesting only 12 months of
extension, our review of the progress towards the PDO achievement indicates that 18
months are needed to ensure the successful completion of the project.

2.      The Project supports the Kenya Development Learning Centre (KDLC), a Global
Development Learning Network GDLN Center, through a SDR 2 million IDA Grant
approved on October 17, 2003 and declared effective on February 2, 2004. The Project
faced implementation delays during the construction phase at the very beginning of the
project implementation. Since the completion of Component 1 (construction and
establishment of the Center), the implementation has been moving forward as planned,
although with a two year delay. Following the recommendation from the Mid Term
Review, and in order to re-align the project objectives with the Regional GDLN Program
ones, the Project was restructured on October 19, 2007 and extended to June 30, 2010.
Since its inception, both the project's IP and the "progress toward DO achievement" have
been rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS) or Satisfactory (S) based on the Project
performance indicators value.

3.      The International Development Association (Association) and the Republic of
Kenya, the recipient recently agreed that substantial progress is being made in terms of
overall activity level and outreach/partnership activities. As for any other GDLN projects
in the Africa Region, KDLC needs at least 4 full years of operations in order to break
even. In addition, KDLC is now targeting Bank-funded operations with large capacity-
building components. The additional 18 months of project execution will allow the
Center to: (i) sign mid-term partnerships with other projects, (ii) fine tune their
Monitoring and Evaluation system to put in place a results-based management, and (iii)
define long-term strategy with the government and partners to prepare for the post-project
phase.

4.       In addition, in 2009, KDLC was designated as an implementing agency for the
next Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant (P116472) supporting the Association
of African GDLN Centers (AADLC), on the basis of its effective performance. In
addition, the GDLN Center in Kenya is gaining some momentum working with World
Bank funded projects with significant capacity development components. Compared with
other GDLN Centers in the Region, KDLC's performances are impressive. The
dynamism of the Center's staff has resulted in constant improvement in the level of
activities of the Center. Nevertheless, the project needs at least 18 months to consolidate
                                            4
its performance and become viable on the long term. This will also permit a more gradual
synchronization of the Director's additional role and responsibilities and ensure not only
the achievement of the PDO but also the long term sustainability of the KDLC.

5.      This will be the second extension of the Project. The Project was restructured in
October 2007 and the Closing Date extended from December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2010.
As of June 10, 2010, the project had disbursed SDR 1,565,000, which represents 75% of
the total amount of SDR 2 million. The remaining amount of SDR 435,000 represents
roughly 18 months of KDLC operating costs.

6.      The implementing entities are compliant with the Association's financial
management requirements; and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial
reports from these entities.
