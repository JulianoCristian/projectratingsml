The\n            project supports the Kenya Development Learning Center\n            (KDLC), a Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) center,\n            through a SDR 2 million International Development\n            Association (IDA) grant approved on October 17, 2003 and\n            declared effective on February 2, 2004. The project faced\n            implementation delays during the construction phase at the\n            very beginning of the project implementation. Since the\n            completion of component one (construction and establishment\n            of the center), the implementation has been moving forward\n            as planned, although with a two year delay. Following the\n            recommendation from the mid-term review, and in order to\n            re-align the project objectives with the regional GDLN\n            program ones, the project was restructured on October 19,\n            2007 and extended to June 30, 2010."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
