Thus,\n            the revised PDO will read as follows: \"to improve the\n            capacity of public servants, and private individuals and\n            institutions in specific public sector management areas\n            targeted by the development learning centre\"; (ii)\n            revise the results framework indicators to improve alignment\n            with the proposed PDO and attribution to Project activities;\n            (iii) specify the project years eligible under IDA'S\n            decreasing financing for operating costs, Part B, category\n            4(b), as follows: 80 percent up to June 30, 2008; 60 percent\n            from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009; and 40 percent\n            thereafter; and (iv)  extend the closing date of the project\n            by 18 months from December 31, 2008 to June 30, 2010, in\n            order to allow sufficient time to achieve the Project's\n            objective. This package of measures will help improve the\n            implementation of the Project and help the government to\n            take advantage of emerging new programs that require\n            considerable capacity development in the public sector."}, "docdt": "2007-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
