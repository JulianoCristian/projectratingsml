A. LIL Justification
1. What is to be learned(why the piloting)?
The main purpose is to test the effectiveness and sustainability o f a development learning centre inKenya
as part o f a global knowledge-sharing network to strengthen the capacity o f public, private and civil society
decision makers and implementers to design, plan, and manage social and economic development policies
and programs.

The D L C i s a new concept for Kenya. It offers world-class training, which to date, has only been available
to Kenyans by studies abroad. In addition, through the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN),
the Centre should reach more people in the country at lower cost than traditional face-to-face training, thus
expanding impact and reach.         The Centre's internet services, still rare in the public service, will
complement the video, audio, and data services to deliver course material, to allow virtual discussion and
e-mail, and to provide participants with access to other World Wide Web resources. The Center will strive
to match demand for training to the most appropriate local or international supplier institutions, both in
terms o f content and schedule o f availability. I t also brings into the country a unique regional and global
live interaction amongst policy makers from many countries, disciplines, and sectors, regardless of national
boundaries or time zones. The Government o f Kenya (GOK) is keen to pilot this new knowledge tool as a
means o f promoting capacity building and enhancing regional and international policy and strategy
dialogue.

Training suppliers will include WBI, major universities, private corporations, and technical organizations
around the world. The Government has expressed interest in training courses that support the ongoing
improvement initiatives for the civil service and, in particular, reforms in areas such as health, local
government, legal, and education, as well as in fimctions related to procurement, accounting, service
delivery, restructuring, budgeting, performance management, and M&E. The training needs for the
HIV/AIDS, DARE, PSM and other Bank financed projects cover technical, policy, and management areas
that can also be supported by the D L C without the cost o f travel. Almost all the World Bank funded
projects in Kenya support capacity building efforts at both the project and program or sector wide levels.
One o f the best uses o f the DLC will be to link these teams with other teams in and out o f Amca to share
experiences.

As experience has shown elsewhere, an important segment of the market for the D L C services will also
come from the NGOs, civil society, and the private sector. A detailed Training Needs assessment, covering
the public and private sectors and civil society, will be conducted by the Directorate of Personnel (DPM) as
input for the Centre's business plan. The consultant undertalung the study will have access to similar
studies conducted in other countries, such as Tanzania and Uganda, to give Kenya the advantage o f
experience inother countries.

The draft Public Service Training and Capacity Building Policy and the Strategy for Performance
Improvement in the Public Service provide some guidance on the Government's objectives, approach, and
priority reforms. However, it i s not feasible to incorporate the contents o f these strategies in the project's
design as they do not contain quantitative and qualitative indicators nor detailed training needs information
from government ministries and departments. This shortfall should be addressed by the training needs
assessment study and probably, in collaboration with DPM, negotiated agreements with ministries,
departments, etc., for specific types and volumes o f training that can be provided over a given time.

An important objective o f the DLC is to buildlocal institutional capacity to use the GDLN as a means o f



                                                       - 2 -

delivering activities from Kenya to other members o f the network. One o f the unique strengths o f the
GDLNnetwork is that every DLC can be the source as well as the recipient o f learning activities. Inthe
case o f Kenya, the D L C would play a particularly strong role in helping to meet the learning needs o f
others in Africa (and elsewhere). Nairobi is an exceptionally strong location o f many potential GDLN
providers  - KIA, UNEP, FAWE, AW, and AERC, for example. These institutions would be strongly
encouraged to use the network, and the facilities at the DLC, and their "transmissions" could become a
significant source o f D L C revenue.

2. How are the results goingto be used (vis a vis CAS objectives and any follow-on operation)?
Document number: NO.18391 KE (IDNR98-137)
                                 -                          Date of latest CAS discussion: 09/24/1998

The D L C i s not identified in the most recent CAS as a specific capacity building tool. Originally it was
designed as a component o f the ongoing Public Sector Management Technical Assistance (PSM-TA)
Project but was dropped duringNegotiations when the credit amount was scaled down.

The results o f the project would support the CAS objective o f "a more responsive and effective public
sector" by facilitating increased dissemination and application o f knowledge and cross-country experience
in support of reform. The impact o f the DLC inknowledge sharing and application will be continuously
assessed and shared with government and other stakeholders.

I t is expected that, following the pilot's closure, the Centre will continue to deepen and to expand the
benefits, and in particular its services and reach, especially for those located out o f Nairobi. The learning
gained and shared from the pilot should also help to inform the design and implementation o f public sector
capacity building programs. This information would be o f interest to Government, the Bank, and various
other partners and stakeholders involved in capacity building efforts. An example o f a useful lesson from
the pilot would be the design and management o f a training evaluation process. This is particularly relevant
for D P M during implementation o f its Public Service and Capacity Building Policy and The Strategyfor
Performance Improvement in the Public Service. Other lessons that have future replication potential
include the role and value o f training in capacity building, the prospects o f balancing a public good with
profit concerns, the conditions necessary for successfully building local institutions and participation, and
the mechanics and usefulness o f an institutionalized M&E process.          Furthermore, in establishing the
viability o f the Centre, the project will identify mechanisms and best practices in the context o f a
developing country where resources are minimal, governing structures weak, and training coordination
mechanisms poor, among other constraints.

There are two main reasons justifying the funding o f the proposed project in its entirety by a grant from
IDA. These include overall country situation and the design o f the project, with its objective o f supporting
a more responsive and effective public sector.

First, Kenya is eligible for IDA Grants inFY04 as an IDA-only country with an annual per capita income
o f under US$360. Second, at the project level, there i s expected to be substantial impact towards creating
a more responsive and effective public sector by facilitating increased dissemination and application o f
knowledge and cross-country experience in support o f reform. It i s expected that the learning gained and
shared from the pilot should help to inform the design and implementation o f public sector capacity
building programs.

A new CAS is planned for FY04, and it will present a strategy for the use o f IDA grants inKenya. The
new Government has committed itself to fighting corruption and reducing poverty through economic



                                                     - 3 -

recovery. I t is strategically important to IDA to support the new Government's efforts, and to provide
financing as a grant instead o f a credit would signal the Bank's strong support.

3. Other countries or situations where similar efforts have shown promise.
The GDLNhas completed its second year o f operation with some success in developing programming and
content. Already operational in 8 countries in Africa and in more than 15 around the world, the
Development Learning Centers are today successful learning tools. After only one year o f operation, the
D L C in Dakar has already reached the objectives o f the second year in terms o f operating costs recovery,
the learning program and the number o f clients. The Centers o f Tanzania and Uganda use their facilities
daily and have reached a use rate of almost 80%.

With Mauritania, Guinea, Mozambique and Burkina Faso, Kenya will benefit from this new leaming
network as part o f the third phase o f the GDLN deployment. Moreover, the D L C inNairobi will be part o f
an Anglophone African DL network including Ghana, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda. These four Centers
benefit from a close relationship with the World Bank Institute (WBI) GDLN Services Department in
Washington, DC. The WBI and other World Bank units deliver many learning activities themselves
through the network. The GDLN Services Department, inaddition, facilitates provision o f activities from
many other learning institutions, all over the world. These include other international agencies (such as
UNAIDS and WHO), developing country learning institutions that deliver from other DLCs and
universities inNorth America and Europe.

As the Global Development Learning Network has been operational for only two years, it is very difficult
to assess the impact o f the GDLN curriculum on the trainees in terms o f capacity building.The GDLN i s
setting up a common activity monitoring system to get some qualitative feedback from the trainees. Innew
GDLNprojects such as Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Kenya, the M&E component is part o f the Project
Design itself and will allow a better evaluation o f the impact o f the project o n participants.

The main target audience o f the GDLN comprises of decision makers from the public sector and civil
servants in general. However, due to the limited budget allocations available to governments, the public
sector has not represented a large part o f the GDLN trainees. Nevertheless, the percentage number o f civil
servant trainees i s growing and has reached an encouraging 50% in certain countries. Some GDLN Centers
have now signed agreements with government administrations presenting the D L C and the GDLN as the
main training tool for civil servants.

The courses that have proved to be the most popular among public sector officials in the region include:
"Gender, Health and Poverty", "Sustainable Development", "Public Resources Policies", "Macroeconomic
Management", "Corruption", and "Rural Development and Food Security".

B. Structure of the Pilot
1. How will learningtake place?

The learning will take place through a structured pilot aimed at documenting the effectiveness, efficiency,
impact, relevance, and sustainability o f the Centre. Success will be determined by the achievement o f
critical performance indicators such as the demonstration o f financial viability, training relevance, learning,
and application o f skills. An M&E system using a logical framework, performance indicator tools, and
associated monitoring instruments will systematically measure the extent to which success has or has not
been achieved.




                                                       - 4 -

The D L C i s being created as a public good to share development knowledge and information. It will be
established by D P M and constructed in Nairobi on the Kenya Institute o f Administration campus during
the first year o f the project. Thereafter, the project will support the operations o f the DLC (with costs on a
decreasing basis) over the following three years.

2. Outcome-level test to be conducted
The establishment of the D L C is expected to result in an effective and sustainable global
knowledge-sharing institution that will provide relevant training opportunities and, ultimately, enhance the
capacities o f civil servants and key decision makers inKenya.

3. Steps involved in conducting the pilot

The five-year pilot will be undertaken utilizing the following steps:

      The following key preparatory activities were completed and found satisfactory by the appraisal
      mission: DPM's project management staffing, institutional arrangements and procurement and financial
      management, including the Project Implementation Plan, Procurement Plan and Manual o f Procedures
      documents. Other preparatory activities that are taking place include a market study, architectural
      designs and biddingdocuments, and increased computerization o f the financial management system.
      Prior to negotiations the D L C was gazetted as a legal autonomous entity and the Board made
      operational with a Chair selected.
      Prior to effectiveness: Project Account with initial deposit; Subsidiary Agreement between Govemment
      and the D L C signed; and Attorney Generals legal opinion received.
      During the first year (year 1) of the project, the DLC's construction, installation, and recruitment
      completed.
      With the D L C staff in place, the first year's business planprepared (based on market study findings)
      and DLC/DPM, staff complete M&E training as well as an M&E implementation plan by the end of
      the fourth quarter. A Memorandum o fUnderstanding is to be signed betweenthe D L C and GDLN.
      DLC inbusiness by the beginning o f the secondyear with project support for a total o f four years (year
      2-5).
      Annual business plans prepared, quarterly and annual reviews conducted and recorded in quarterly and
      annual progress reports, and annual financial audits undertaken.
      Mid-termevaluation inthe thirdyear (3rd quarter) o fthe project.
      End-of Project evaluation at the end o f the fifth year.

    Financial            Institutional     Environmental IXI Other

Economic: The project is expected to demonstrate an economically viable method o f delivering training as
compared to the current and expensive practice o f sending officials abroad for specialized training or the
import o f international trainers. In addition, more people should have access to training in a wider variety
o f fields leading to a more effective use o f govemment funds.

Technical: The project will introduce advanced communications technologies to the country. Use, access
and knowledge o f the internet, and to a less extent, email, is currently very limited inthe public service with
video communication practically unknown in both the private and public sectors. Through the project's
training and virtual discussion opportunities, awareness on information technology and its value will be



                                                        - 5 -

enhanced. The Government's Information Technology Department sees the entry o f this project as a means
for 'paving the way' or promoting the acceptance and use o f other forms o f modem technology in Kenya.
The new state-of-the-art video-conferencing facility will provide practical leaming opportunities for local
engineers/IT technicians/instructors on its operations, maintenance, and installation.

Financial: The Center is expected to meet the operating expenses o f the Center (excluding amortization) up
to 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively during the first four years from generated income, and to ensure
at least the financial equilibrium as early as the fifth year o f operation (details inAnnex 13).

Institutional:    The success o f the pilot relies upon building the institutional capacity o f the D L C to
establish an effective, efficient, relevant, and sustainable centre which has impact. Balancing the vision o f
the D L C as a public good and, therefore, not created to make profit, with the need to run the Centre on a
recognized business basis to ensure viability, also presents useful learning opportunities.

In addition, institutional challenges for the project include building the capacity o f project management
within DPM, establishing practical means with Government with which to support implementation o f the
public service training strategy, establishing an effective and well represented Board (consisting o f private
sector, government, civil society representatives) and ensuring satisfactory working arrangements between
the "parent", DPM, and the DLC.

Finally, building the institutional capacity o f local institutions to use the GDLN as a means o f expanding,
improving and delivering training activities provides a valuable learning opportunity for the local
institutions and the recipient clients within and outside the country who will benefit from the locally
provided training.

Participatow: Participation is required at various levels. This includes:
(i)participationoflocalandinternational trainingproviders asusersandinidentifyingtrainingavailable,
availing courses, and developing content. Their participation is also important for the evaluation, planning,
and review processes;
(ii)participationfrom the clientpopulation/agencies
etc. - as                                                 - civil society, civil service, private sector, projects,
         users and intraining needs assessments, market surveys, and monitoring and evaluation;
(iii)participation o f Board members inmonitoring, decisionmaking, and overall support;
(iv) participation o f D P M as users and infinancing, monitoring and evaluation, project management, and in
implementing the public service training strategy;
(v) participation o f KIA inproviding host facilities for the DLC, inactively supporting the Centre through
the Board, in making suitable working arrangements between the two institutions as well as its role as a
training institution; and
(vi) participation o f donors as users o f the Centre and in fund raising, knowledge sharing, and technical
assistance.

Other  - Monitoring,  & Evaluation: The project has introducedM&Eas an important integrated institutional
process rather than as a discrete activity. It is expected that useful information will be documented on the
usefulness o f the M&E implementation plan and where and how the process has changed to improve
evaluation practice and its value to the project.

5. Triggers for a follow-on operation
A traditional follow-on operation is not envisaged. However, it is expected that the Centre will deepen and
expand the benefits, and in particular its services and reach, particularly for those located out o f Nairobi.
Specifically the Centre should: expand the coverage o f clients, training courses and the dissemination o f
information; deepen training programs for previous individual and institutional clients; strengthen bulk
service package agreements to deliver broad training requirements or flagship courses to selected
institutions; and strengthen the training, information sharing, and M&E strategies based on the
end-of-project evaluation. This growth would bejustifiedif

     the pilot attains financial sustainability by the fourth year o f operation;
     the monitoring and evaluation results show that the training program is relevant and meets local
     demand;
     the monitoring and evaluation results show that the Centre training program has improved the
     capacities (knowledge, s l l l s or attitudes) o f trainees to design, plan and manage social, economic and
     development policies and programs; and
     positive feedback on the value and usefulness o f the information shared i s received from DLC, DPM,
     and local and intemational stakeholders.

    Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation System

Institutional Strengthening:        M&E training for the newly recruited DLC team and the D P M Project
Coordinator will be required to ensure adequate institutional M&E capacity in the two key organizations.
The consultant conducting the training will also facilitate the development o f a M&E plan with wider
participation from key stakeholders in World Bank, DPM, and other partner organizations. The training
and the M&E plan should be completed within the first two months o f the Director's appointment.

M&E Scope, Objective and Use: A results based management approach will be utilized and supported
by a practical M&E system that will generate information in the five areas o f performance           - efficiency,
effectiveness, relevance, sustainability and impact.          It should enable an in-depth understanding of key
successes and failures and to allow for the use o f lessons learnt and experiences gained at local and global
levels. It will also provide a means for improving service delivery, planning, and allocating resources,
assessing beneficiary responses, and demonstrating results as part o f accountability to key stakeholders.

The information generated will answer important evaluation questions at all levels o f the project design
hierarchy. I t will be planned in advance and organized in a manner that provides a "road map" for (a)
monitoring and evaluation as an ongoing process throughout the project and (b) end-of-project evaluation
results. A preliminary "road map" or M&E plan has been developed to facilitate and strengthen the design
o f the project. This draft i s presented in Annex 11. It contains a comprehensive list o f what needs to be
evaluated (including the project risks), the M&E information required, as well as when, how, and by whom
it will be used, collected, and analyzed.

Duringthe M&Eplanning session mentionedabove, stakeholders will review the draft M&Eplan to refine:
(a) key evaluation questions, (b) what needs to be monitored, (c) what performance indicators should be
chosen and (d) what data needs to be collected to do that; (e) who will collect it, (f) at what frequency, (g)
and at what levels; (h) whether the institutions have the ability and personnel to do so; (i)         whether the
exercise i s cost effective; and 0) ifthe results will be adequate to determine whether the pilot has or has not
succeeded. The session will also introduce a new column in the matrix that identifies the forms, training,
expertise, information management and resources required to implement the M&E. Finally, the planning



                                                           - 7 -

process will also update, refine, and make use o f the logical framework (preliminary draft in Annex 1) to
measure project impacts, outcomes, outputs and inputs.

Organization and Management: It is expected that much o f the M&E information generation, analyses,
and reporting, which includes critical business information, will have to be conducted by the DLC,
particularly at the operational level. DPMis responsible for ensuring that M&E for the project as a whole,
whether it i s implemented by DLC or DPM, works successfully and produces the desired results. The
M&E plan clearly indicates where, how, and when either D P M or DLC is responsible for a particular task.
Most o f the D L C activities are routine, repeated and less costly then the tasks managed by DPM.
Activities managed by D P M include the processes involved in M&Etraining, the development o f the M&E
plan, the hiring o f consultants and the regular review o f the implementation performance o f the M&E plan.
Business plans and quarterly and annual progress reports, as well as annual audit reports will form the
main reporting mechanism for the project.         A 'fuller description o f the organizational management is
provided inAnnex 2, Component 3, M&E.

2. ImplementationArrangements

D P M will supervise the project preparation and implementation and will consequently be responsible to
IDA for the overall project. Its control over the activities o f the DLC will essentially be o f a legal nature
with respect to the obligations o f the Grant Agreement. Specifically, D P M will be responsible for ensuring
the successful performance o f the project, consolidating the annual project accounts, ensuring the timely
submission o f annual audits, processing the annual GOK budget allocation for the project, promoting
effective linkages with the civil service needs, and for monitoring and evaluation. A Project Coordinator,
from the Human Resources Department o f DPM, supported by an Accountant and Procurement Officer
will manage DPM's responsibilities. Components 1 and 3 are largely the direct responsibility o f DPM.



                                                      - 8 -

DLC's core responsibility i s to set up and runan effective Center that i s self sustaining inconsultation with
the Board. DLC is directly responsible for Component 2 while working in close collaboration with DPM
on Component C. A Subsidiary Agreement outlining the roles and responsibilities will be drawn between
DPM and the DLC.

TORS for all key positions in both D P M and the D L C should have clear performance criteria and
standards, including explicit provisions for the exit o f non-performers.

a. Procurement
The procurement for the activities identified in both the PPF and Component 1 o f the Project (i.e.
construction, purchase and installation o f equipment, Director's recruitment, etc.) are being handled by
D P M led by the Supplies Officer designated for the project. Once the D L C i s inbusiness, the procurement
responsibility as described in Component 2, will be led by the Centre's Administrative Assistant.          The
individual hired for the Administrative Assistant post should have prior procurement experience and will
undergo hrther procurement training with the Bank's guidance. The procurement arrangements required
for Component 3, M&E, which i s managed by the DPM, will continue to be led by the DPM's Supplies
Officer. A close working relationship will be requiredbetween the Supplies Officer and the Administrative
Assistant.

b. Financial Management
The Accounting Unit in D P M was identified for the purpose o f providing financial management services
for Component 1 o f the project. The Unit will also take responsibility for the accountability o f funds
allocated to the M&E Component 3 under DPM's responsibility. The selection and appointment o f key
project staff, particularly the Project Coordinator, Procurement Officer and Project Accountant, was
completed during project preparation in view o f the importance o f their early engagement. The PCU has
documented operational references in the form o f a Project Implementation Plan, a Procurement Plan and a
Financial Procedures Manual which are critical for project implementation.               The Bank's financial
management assessment report o f March 2003 confirms that adequate financial systems and intemal
controls are in place to ensure project assets are safe guarded, and that reliable and timely financial
information and reports are generated for use in decision making. Financial reporting, analysis and
verification o f financial transaction through audits will be undertaken periodically and timely corrective
actions taken where weaknesses are identified. These measures will enable the project management to
comply with statutory requirements as well as with the Bank Financial Covenants.                More detailed
information i s provided in Annex 4, Financial Management, and the Financial Management Assessment
Report o f March 2003.

Activities
The following activities will commence onproject effectiveness:

(a) Construction o f the DLC facility which includes a video-conference room (30-person capacity); a
computer room outfitted for 30 computer stations (hardware, software and Internet hook-up); a technical
and administrative center; and electrical and telephone installations.                                                            D P M will work closely with the
Ministry o f Roads and Public Works to obtain technical assistance inthe design and supervision.

(b) Purchase and installation o f equipment which includes a small aperture terminal (VSAT                                                                                     - satellite
communication terminal); video, telecommunications, and microprocessor equipment; office and classroom
furniture; and various other equipment for operations and security. The procurement responsibility for the
specialized equipment will be handled by World Bank following Government's authorization. The Bank,
through ISG, will provide the assistance and expertise to procure, install and test the video-conferencing
equipment. The GDLN will be built on top o f the existing World Bank satellite network which is managed
and maintained by ISG and the WB Telecom operator.                                                                     The precise method for the procurement and
maintenance o f the specialized equipment i s to be defined and specified inwriting between the Government,
ISG, and the intemational network operator. Part o f the equipment (local connectivity) will be maintained
locally. D P M will seek technical assistance and support from the Information Technology Department in
Treasury as and when needed. A light vehicle will be purchased for the HRD Project Coordination. The
maintenance o f this vehicle will be entirely financed by the national counterpart. A second light vehicle and
a minivan will be purchased for the DLC. The operating costs for the two DLC vehicles will be financed
from the Operating Costs category o f the grant under component 2.


                                                                                                                 -17-

(c) Recruitment o f the Director and other key staff for the DLC. D P M will hire a recruitment agency to
advertise, review and short-list suitable candidates for the Director's position. The Training Coordinator,
IT Officer, Accountant, Office Administrator and Driver will be hired on a competitive basis, following
advertisement, by the new Director, DLC.

2. DLC OperationsSupport:

Objective& Financing
This component aims to assist the D L C begin operations and to become financially viable. The financing
will cover operational costs on a decreasing basis over the first four years o f its operation.

Institutional Arrangements - DLCBoard, DLC management, DPM, KIA
The D L C will be governed by a Board comprising o f representatives from DPM, Ministry o f Finance and
Planning, KIA, academic institutions, the private sector and civil society. The Board will be chaired by an
official elected from among the members. The Board will oversee project implementation, through its
Executive Secretariat. The Board is charged with monitoring management and deciding on development
policy, approving the annual business plan and program o f activities, assessing the Centre's financial
statements and providing recommendations to help it become financially self-sustaining. The Board i s also
responsible for ensuring the maintenance o f a Director throughout the project whose competence and
qualification are deemed satisfactory to IDA.

 Daily management o f the Centre will be entrusted to the Director selected on the basis o f proven
 experience in enterprise management or management o f a similar educational institution. The Director will
be appointed by the D L C Board and will be assisted by a team comprising o f an IT Officer, a Training
 Coordinator, an Accountant and an Administrative Assistant.

 Particular attention should be paid to the interaction between DPM and the DLC. While D P M will preside
 over the creation o f the DLC, once the center i s operational, DPM becomes the primary client o f the D L C
where the latter will offer capacity building activities to D P M itself and to the entire public sector with the
 support o f DPM. The preservation o f these relationships will require strict observance o f the MOUs. The
 Director, DLC, will work closely with the Project Coordinator, DPM, who will provide a supportive role
 and link to D P M as well as to the wider civil service. The Project Coordinator will not be responsible for
 supervising the performance o f the Director o f the D L C as the Director is primarily responsible and
 accountable for the management o f the D L C and will report to the Board. Nevertheless, the role o f the
 Project Coordinator i s important because o f hisher critical oversight function o f the Grant on behalf o f
 DPWGovernment and responsibility to ensure the DLC's positive impact on civil servants. The Project
 Coordinator must also work closely with the Director to carry out DPM's project coordination, auditing,
financial, and M&E responsibilities. DPMwill also fimction as a member o f the DLC Board.

An agreement between the host institution, KIA, and the D L C Board should be adopted as soon as the
Director i s on Board. Lessons from other countries indicate that caution is required to ensure that both
D P M and KIA participate inthe D L C without inhibitingits growth. Thus, while KIA has provided the site
and will execute an agreement with the D L C Board on which it will be represented, KIA can also offer
content for training and paying participants to the DLC. In this regard, KIA is like any other training
institution, agency, or private sector entity that can buy or sell its services to the DLC.

  Business
  Upon taking office, the Director will prepare a business plan based o n a market study identifying training
  needs from the public and private sectors. The business plan, to be submitted to the Board for approval
  and IDA for advice, will include: market data, budget and sources o f financing, training, and other services
  to be provided (lectures, seminars, etc.), source and programming o f training, rates for the different types
  o f training, the monitoring and evaluation plan (including the learning expectations), and financial
  projections in the form o f budget, operating account and market strategy.                                                                                                                  The business plan will be
  updated and approved by the Board on an annual basis. To this effect, the Centre will continue to assess
  demand, identify and program appropriate training courses, market the services o f the Centre, and increase
  its visibility in Kenya and abroad. The Director i s expected to meet the operating expenses o f the Centre
  (excluding amortization) up to 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively during the first four years from
  generated income, and to ensure at least the financial equilibrium as early as the fifth year o f operation.
  The net cash flow (net result increased by amortization) will be used to renew, upgrade, or repair the
  Centre's equipment so as to continuously enhance the value o f the business. Although the Centre must be
  run on a business basis to promote sustainability, it must also take into account that it was created as a
  public good to share development knowledge and information. Therefore, an appropriate balance is
  required between the not-for-profit intention and the need for viability.                                                                                                               Shortly upon taking office, the
  newly appointed Director should visit an established D L C inAfrica on a learning and familiarization study
  tour.

  StakeholdeidTraining Institutionsmevelopment Partners
The Director will build up close relationships with other Kenyan-based institutions involved, or potentially
involved in the provision o f ITC-facilitated distance learning.                                                                                               These include organizations that have
already collaborated in the delivery o f GDLN programs to Kenya (e.g. AERC), organizations that are
likely to wish to use the network in the future (e.g. UNEP) and the African Virtual University (AW),
which i s also supported by the World Bank, whose work and experience will complement that o f the DLC,
and which may sometimes wish to use the DLC's facilities. An important objective o f the D L C i s to build
local institutional capacity to use the GDLN as a means o f delivering activities from Kenya to other
members o f the network. These institutions would be strongly encouraged to use the network, and the
facilities at the DLC, and their "transmissions" could become a significant source o f DLC revenue. The
D L C will make every effort to provide local training providers with instructional design support to build
their capacity to transmit courses usingthe Centre's facilities. Currently many o fthese institutionshave the
contents but these are limitedto face-to-face delivery.




                                                                                                                  - 19-

Early consultations with training institution stakeholders, during project preparation, confirmed their
interest in the Centre. The stakeholders wanted information on how soon the Centre would be approved.
They stressed the importance o f autonomy and the selection and composition o f the Board. They were
clear about the importance o f their involvement inthe ongoing planning, including an opportunity to review
the Legal Notice, as a way to improve and strengthen the proposed project by adding their own highly
relevant experience. The stakeholders were also interested in learning about the experience o f DLCs in
other countries especially on securing content, and its bearing on sustainability. There was clear interest in
the eventual expansion o f the D L C to reach especially rural communities. The participants provided
examples o f ongoing IT-based capacity building initiatives (Economic Democracy Education Initiative,
Kenya Education Network) and urged close coordination for synergy.                The stakeholders noted that
accessibility to KIA may be a constraint; to address this issue a minivan will be purchased by the DLC.
The D L C should continue to emphasize the need for the stakeholders to support the D L C by using the
center to access training that i s not readily available in Kenya, and to provide content for use by the Centre.


Duringproject preparation a few members of the donor community were consulted. These included DFID,
the British Council, the EU, USAID, UNDP, and JICA.               The DLC should continue to expand these
consultations to present the GDLN Program and the D L C project in Kenya. Of interest is the role donors
could play to help the GDLN to develop and how donors can benefit from the GDLN as users of the
network (global communication tool), as participants inDL sessions, or as partners o f the GDLNProgram.
The D L C should maintain a dialogue with development partners with a view towards determining specific
priority areas that the future GDLN Center should target and the services that the GDLN should offer for
greater utilization o f the D L C by donors.

 Training
 A Memorandum o f Understanding between the DLC and GDLN will be signed. Many o f the courses
 offered by the D L C will be sourced from local or international providers.         However, the Centre has
 dedicated funds for developing its own contents for new courses. These funds should be usedto develop
 both content and distance learning pedagogical skills to enable KIA and other Kenya-based institutions and
 local experts to deliver DL activities effectively through the network, helping to meet both Kenyan and
 network-wide demand for learning activities.          The funds also give the Centre flexibility to provide
 programs that are biased towards and related to civil servants' needs as well as an opportunity to promote
 customized, performance related, and demand-driven supply. The funds should also help the D L C to
 respond better to training required but unavailable inthe local or global market.

 The D L C will actively support training requiredby projects and the Public Service Improvement Strategy.
 A strategy paper will be prepared by D P M to define the linkages between the DLC, the national public
 service training and the Government budget. Efforts will also be made, in collaboration with DPM, to
 negotiate agreements with ministries, departments, etc., for specific types and volumes o f training that can
 be provided over a given time. The D L C should make every effort to consider its potential support to the
 Government's PRSP, including the IT component o f the PRSP. It should also, following a review, link
 training programs to ongoing capacity building initiatives in the public sector, e.g. procurement, budget
 management, M&E, etc.

 One possible strategy for the DLC is to negotiate bulk service package agreements with a few large clients,
 probably 3 to 4, that will deliver flagship courses or broad training requirements. For example, courses
 could be identified by the Ministry o f Health for its personnel throughout the country. This systemic
 approach would reduce transaction costs, and increase sustainability, efficiency, and capacity building in
 the long term. A similar approach could be taken with donors (e.g. USAID, BritishCouncil) interested in

 supporting specific training areas through bulk scholarships.

M&E
 As described earlier, inaddition to the business plan, one o f the key tasks for the newly hiredteam will be
 to develop an M&E plan following training with DPM. The M&E system will help the Director to
 evaluate the performance o f the business plan and, in particular, efficiency, effectiveness, relevance,
 sustainability and impact. It will provide a means for improving service delivery, planning, and allocating
 resources, assessing beneficiary responses, and demonstrating results as part o f accountability to key
 stakeholders. It should also enable an in-depth understanding o f key successes and failures and allow for
 the use o f lessons learnt and experiences gained at local and global levels. Relevant information from the
 M&E plan should therefore be incorporated in the business plan and, where necessary, the M&E plan
 adjusted to ensure consistency with the businessplan.

 The D L C will continuously evaluate the design, delivery, contents, relevance, demand, effectiveness,
 learning failures, and barriers to greater participation, and ensure that the information i s used to adjust the
 strategy and to respond to changing needs (e.g. competition from other providers).

 OverallActivities
 In addition to its training agenda, the Centre's activities will also revolve around promoting the efficient

 services, establishing a business model that i s viable with sustainable and effective mechanisms (processes,
 structures, capacities), enhancing the DLC's staff development with training, and ensuring that the pilot's
 objectives are met through business planning and implementation.

 The D L C is expected to hold monthly management meetings with DPM, to administer quarterly Board
 meetings and to initiate regular consultative meetings with training institutions, government agencies, etc.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation:

Objectives & WorkingArrangements
This component provides financing for the processes involved in the M&E training, development o f the
M&E plan and the hire o f consultants required throughout the project. Although the component will be
managed by DPM, a large proportion o f the M&E work, as demonstrated in the M&E plan (Annex 1I),
will have to be generated, analyzed, and reported on by the DLC. An earlier option placing all M&E
responsibilities under D P M was dropped because the distinction could result in an artificial distinction o f
M&E from management and the delay o f critical businessinformation. The M&E component under D P M
remains important because it promotes an external independent assessment outside DLC and provides a
mechanism for the Government's continued commitment and involvement as the primary champion for the
civil servants needs, training quality, and impact. It also reflects DPM's overall responsibility in ensuring

that M&E for the project, whether it is implemented by D L C or DPM, works successhlly and produces the
desired results. The D L C will directly finance the M&E activities under its implementation from
Component 2. Most o f these activities will be routine, repeated and less costly than the tasks financed by
DPM. In some instances, D P M may be financing but the activity would be implemented by the DLC, or
vice versa. Hence, a close and collaborative partnership between the DLC and DPM is needed to ensure
the success o f the M&E system. Not all M&E act.ivities require financing; for example, a major task for
D P M is to review key reports produced by D P M or consultants, and to ensure that the results are or have
been used to outline new directions, policies and procedures with the change processes documented in
subsequent reports. The preliminary M&E plan (Annex 11) clearly identifies either D P M or D L C as
responsible for each specific M&Etask (including how and when).

A snap shot o fthe organization and management flow is also shown inAnnex 11.

     These comments will be discussed during the monthly management D L C D P M meetings and the

Other DPMActivities
D P M i s responsible for organizing the annual supervision missions, the mid-term review and the
end-of-project evaluation.     In addition, DPM, on an annual basis, will consolidate the annual project
accounts and process the annual GOK budget project allocation. DPM, in collaboration with DLC, will
take the lead indeveloping:
(i)a strategy to further integrate and link the DLC with the Public Service Training Strategy and
Government projects' training needs; and
(ii)a contingency planto mitigate the riskof inadequate Government training funds for training.           In
addition, shortly after the appointment o f the Director, D P M will officially encourage all ministries to
examine their current training budget allocations and use the services o f the D L C when practical.

                                    Annex 4: Financial Management
                             KENYA: Development Learning Centre Project

Financial Management Arrangement at the Institution Level

The Project Implementing Agency (DPM) has identified a department, i.e. the Human Resource Division
[HRD], to take charge of overseeing the implementation of the above project in the initial phase. DPM
through HRD will also be responsible for the preparatory phase o f the above project with assistance o f a
PPF advance from IDA. In view o f this, implementation arrangement for the project i s basically in three
tier phases, structured as follows:

         &e                        Accountable Body                   Source o f Funding

     1.Preparatory Phase           by D P M through HRD               usingthe PPF proceeds

     2. Construction Phase         by D P Mthrough HRD                usingthe Grant proceeds

     3. Operational Phase
        (a) D L C Training         by D L C                  usingthe Grant proceeds
        (b) M& E                   by D P M                           using the Grant proceeds

The first two phases and 3(b) will be managed by the HRD and supported by hnctional Units inD P M for
both Procurement and Financial Management services.

The financial management arrangement for the operation, 3(a), o f the project by DLC can only be expected
to come on board during the first two phases, especially because it i s envisaged that D L C will be an
autonomous state owned body, located in the Kenya Institute o f Administration premises, in a separate
specially constructed building. DLC will have a Board o f Directors, and will be legally empowered to
operate independently in administering and safeguarding its Assets and Liabilities with no recourse to any
other body. It i s also envisaged that DLC when operational will be a revenue earning body corporate, inits
own right, to enable it to sustain its operations. Details and scope o f its operations as well as measure o f
risks and its viability will be determined from the outcome o f the market studies to be commissioned during
the preparatory phase.

The financial management arrangement for the first two phases and later part 3(b) will be based on the
existing systems in the DPM. These arrangements will suffice for the purpose o f tracking and monitoring
preparatory, construction and M&E related expenditures. However, funds from IDA will be managed and
accounted for separately from other funds o f DPM. To this end, DPM will undertake to designate a
qualified and competent Accountant from its Accounting Unit who will be designated Project Accountant
for the purpose o f the first two phases and part 3(b) o f the project. The Accountant shall be supported by a
small team o f competent Accounting Technicians/Clerks, who will be vested with the responsibility o f
managing and accounting for the project PPF and Grant proceeds as well as the Government o f Kenya's
own contribution o f counterpart funding. Separate books o f accounts will be maintained in which all
receipts o f monies and expenditures o f the same will be recorded. Due diligence and care will be exercised
by the Project Accountant to ensure the project funds are used only for the purposes for which they were
set aside. The Project Accountant shall ensure the project maintains separate books o f accounts, a sound
internal control environment throughout the life o f the first two phases o f the project based on a credible
chart o f accounts to be developed by the Project Accountant. In this regard, the following accounting


                                                     - 27 -

systems is strongly recommended in the context o f Government Accounting Systems and Financial
Regulations, modified as appropriate to meet the specific needs o f the project.

FinancialPlanningand BudgetaryControl

Absorption o f IDA resources made available for the project either as PPF or Grant proceeds shall be
through the Government Budget under the DPM's Budget Vote. The resources shall be appropriately
designated as Appropriation in Aide (AIA) or Revenue, with Government counterpart funds being
adequately allocated where relevant. Initially, the designated officer o f the HRD in D P M (and later the
Project Coordinator) will be identified and assigned the responsibility o f administering the Authority to
Incur Expenditure [AIE holder] by the Accounting Officer o f DPM, who will ultimately be accountable for
the project funds. Expenditures met out o f the project proceeds shall all be eligible for IDA financing and
approved by the AIE holder. Draw down o f the budgetary allocation for all commitments and expenditures
eligible under the project shall be fully documented and controlled through the vote book control by the
Project Accountant.

ProjectSpecialAccount

The project will have a Special Account established in a reputable commercial bank acceptable to IDA by
the Government o f Kenya. In this regard, the Treasury and the Central Bank o f Kenya will ensure this
account is opened soon after Grant effectiveness has been declared. The authorized allocation will be
US$250,000, representing approximately the four months average o f eligible expenditures to be paid from
the Account.

Flow of Funds

The mechanism put in place over the last two years by the Government o f Kenya and the Bank for
channeling donor funds to the project activity level, have demonstrated enormous improvement in the flow
o f funds. While Bank's Operations Financial Management staff continue to work with our counterparts in
the Accountant General's Deparhnent to monitor the new mechanismand improve on it further, it is evident
that risk o f financial leakage under the project has reasonably been mitigated under the prevailing
arrangements. The project will have a designated project bank account to be opened with a reputable
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. This account will be the operating account for the project and
administered by the Project Coordinator. This i s critical especially inthe post PPF preparatory phase, when
the execution o f the civil works program i s expected to take place. This particular activity poses an added
fiduciary risk and enhanced potential for possible misuse o f project finances. T o mitigate against this risk,
a Project Accountant, preferably fully qualified, will be identified and appointed to work along with the
Procurement Team comprising o f competent and technically qualified staff, to supervise the civil work
program. Establishment o f these two units are critical to the success o f the project, particularly the first two
phases.

Project funds will be drawn from the project Special Account in small amounts to be determined on the
basis o f work plans and cash forecasts, for an agreed period, preferably quarterly, which will be placed in
the project account at the project level. The Accounting Unit inD P M has been assigned the facilitating role
for this operation, and will house the project accountant with full time responsibility for maintaining the
project accounting records and information. The project accountant will ensure the project account is
replenished regularly by initiating the preparation reimbursement claims through the Project Special
Account. External Resources Department o f the Treasury will in turn ensure the Project Special Account i s
replenished at least once each month. To expedite the operations o f the project, it is recommended that


                                                    - 28 -

HRD,the ProjectCoordinator and the Project Accountant be the Authorized Signatories to the Grant,while
the Project Coordinator and the Project Accountant be assigned joint signatory responsibility for the project
account with HRDand Head o f DPM's Accounting Unit as alternates.

Transaction Recordingand Reporting

The project will be basically simple, hence it should adopt `transaction based' disbursement (traditional)
procedure, which the Government o f Kenya is familiar with and also for the reason that the amount o f the
Grant is small. The project will adopt the Cash Accounting Basis practiced by the Government o f Kenya.
Project funds from IDA will be disbursed from the Project Special Account, to be opened by the
Government o f Kenya in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. Where appropriate, direct payment
procedure shall be used as provided for in the legal agreement. All expenditures must be fully and
adequately supported by relevant documentation for evidence, and these shall be placed in secure custody
o f the AIE holder for the purpose o f periodic inspection, review and audit by IDA supervision team and
project auditor respectively.  Similarly, all relevant supporting documents for the procurement process
inclusive o f IDA'S `no objection' letters where relevant shall be properly kept by the AIE holder.
Statement o f Expenditure (SOE) procedure shall be used to seek reimbursement from IDA for expenditures
falling within SOE thresholds as defined inthe Grant Agreement and Disbursement Letter.

A simple but adequate internal control environment will be ensured to mitigate against risk o fproject funds
being used for non intended purposes. The prevailing internal control system, and approval processes inthe
DPM's Accounting Unit are based on the Government o f Kenya Financial Regulations, which have also
been improved inthe recent past. The Government Financial Management Bill 2002 provides the principal
framework, expected to safe guard the assets o f the project as part o f public resources. This Bill i s
expected to be presented to Parliament for debate and enactment into law inthe next few months, which i s
withinthe proposed life o fthe project.

Project financial reporting will basically comprise o f annual project financial statements showing all the
resources received by the project regardless o f the source and method o f disbursement used. The reports
will be prepared on the cash accounting basis and submitted to the Auditor not later than September 30, as
required under the existing regulations. The accounts will be in formats prescribed by the Accountant
General as agreed with the development partners. These shall include a Statement o f Source and Use o f
Funds for each year, ending June 30, Statement of Receipts Expenditures for the same period, and a
Balance Sheet. This project will also be required to present its Statements o f Expenditure based
disbursement record for audit purposes as well as details relating to the Special Account transactions for
audit verification.  The project will adopt Financial Monitoring Report (FMR) format for reporting
purposes within a period not exceeding 18 months after effectiveness. Within this period project staff will
be assisted by IDA to develop capacity and systems capable o f preparing FMRs o n a quarterly basis.

Audit Arrangements

The books o f accounts, financial statements and all other financial reports stated above shall be subject to
audit by an independent and competent Auditor acceptable to IDA. In this regard, the Controller and
Auditor General is the recognized auditor o f the Government o f Kenya under the law, who is acceptable to
IDA in view of the comfort we have with his independence and competence. The Controller and Auditor
General may also appoint a private Auditor to conduct the audit on his behalf and report to him as provided
for inthe law.

Audited Project Financial Statements stated above shall be submitted to IDA within six months following

the end of the financial year to which they relate, i.e. not later than each December 31.

                               Financial Management Capacity Assessment

A Financial Management Capacity Assessment has been carried out based on the system obtaining in the
DPM's Accounting Unit which will be managing the project's financial management matters for the
construction component and the M&E component during the implementation phase. The operational phase
o f the GDLC will be under a new independent institution, with a competent Project Accountant and other
support staff to runthe financial management function o f the Centre. The details for this will be contained
in DPM's Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and the Project Manual of Financial Procedures. DPM,
Project Coordinator and Project Accountant will be responsible for overseeing the preparation o f these two
critical documents, with support and guidance o f the Bank staff.

Overall Risk Assessment

The overall fiduciary risk for the project i s categorized as 'low' based o n country knowledge as articulated
inthe CFAA report of 2001 and the level of financial exposure is low since the amount of Grant is fairly
small (US$2.7 million). The capacity assessment o f DPM's Accounting Unit has been undertaken and
found to meet Bank's requirement based on OP.BP 10.02. The task team is confident that there will be
adequate measures to provide systems that will safe guard the project assets and to substantially mitigate
fiduciary risk o f project funds being used for purposes other than those the Grant has been provided. The
systems and institutional arrangement are also reasonably adequate to protect Bank's reputation as an
institution. Due diligence and care will be ensured in the selection and appointment o f staff, and in their
performance throughout the life o f the project. M&E and regular audits will provide useful means o f
measuring outputs andperformance by closely matching expenditures with physical progress o f the project.
The project task team and their close proximity to the project activities will provide the client and the
project staff with professional support and guidance as needed during the implementation to ensure the
success o f the project.

                            KENYA: Development Learning Centre Project

Procurement

Guidelines

1 .      Procurement o f goods and works will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for
procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits (published in 1995 and updated in January and August
1996 and in September 1997 and January 1999). The Bank's standard bidding documents for goods and
civil works will be used for ICB. Consultant services contracts will be procured in accordance with the
Guidelines for the Selection o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (published in January 1997 and
updated in September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002). The Bank's Standard Request for Proposals
will be used and forms o f contracts as needed as well as the Sample Form o f Evaluation Report for
Selection o f Consultants.

Procurement Notices

2.       It is expected that all contracts under the project will be awarded through national competition.
Therefore there will be no contracts that require publication o f a General Procurement Notice (GPN) inthe
UNDevelopment Business (UNDB). ForNCB, Special Procurement Notices (SPNs) will be advertised in
a national paper o f wide circulation. Individual contracts for consulting firms are estimated below
US$200,000consequently, the request for expression o f interest will be published only ina national paper
o f wide circulation.    However, if foreign firms express interest, they will not be excluded from
consideration.

Procurement ImplementationArrangements

The procurement for activities identified in Component 1 o f the Project (Le. construction, purchase and
installation o f equipment, Director's recruitment, etc.) will be handledby DPM.

Once the D L C i s inbusiness, the procurement responsibility, as described inthe DLC's Component 2, will
be ledby the Centre's Administrative Assistant.

The procurement arrangements required for Component 3, M&E, which i s managed by the DPM, will
continue to be ledby the DPM's Supplies Officers.

A close and supportive working relationship will be required between the D P M Supplies Officers and the
D L C Administrative Assistant throughout the project.

DPMArrangements

The Project ImplementingAgency (DPM) has designated two o f its procurement staff to assist the Project
Coordinator in the management o f procurement processes and implementation o f procurement decisions.
D P M will also borrow from the Ministry o f Roads & Public Works (MORWP), on a secondment
arrangement, a Senior Architect (with some experience inBank-financedprocurement). The Architect will
work closely with the DPM procurement officers on the procurement o f works contracts and the selection



                                                      - 32 -

o f works-related services.    The procurement tasks that the D P M procurement team will specifically
undertake include:

a)       procurement o f contractors for the construction o f the D L C and small works (refitting) at the
Centre;

b)       logistical and managerial support to ensure the procurement and installation o f the communications
equipment with the help o f the World Bank Information Solutions Group (ISG) andthe operator M C I
WorldCom;

c)       procurement o f the DLC's other equipment and furniture;

d)       contracting a management firm that will be commissioned to recruit a Director for DLC;

e)       assisting the Director inthe recruitment o f the other D L C personnel;

fComponent
 )       procurement of various M&E consultancies under the responsibility o f DPM and as described in
             3 and inthe procurement plan; and

g)       providing guidance and support as and when needed to the DLC's management and, inparticular,
the Administrative Assistant.

By the time the recruitment and training o f D L C staff has been accomplished, all major procurements
under D P M will either be complete, nearing completion or inprogress. The main procurement activities for
D P M once the DLC i s operational will be on contracting the M&E consultancies required throughout the
project implementationperiod.

DLCArrangements

Procurement requirements o f the D L C after it starts operating will mainly relate to:

a) office supplies and routine maintenance services;

b) the Centre's personnel who are contracted and maintainedon individual consultancy arrangements;

c) the procurement arrangements for the development o f training contents by the DLC; and

d) procurement for the various training providers neededfor the program.

These procurement functions will be carried out by the DLC's Administrative Assistant. Heishe will work
closely with D P M to ensure the successful implementation o f the M&E consultancies which will be directly
contracted by D P Mbut carried out at the D L C site.

Capacity assessment

4.       A World Bank procurement specialist carried out an assessment o f the implementing agency
(DPM). The assessment was discussed and agreed with DPM. The main findings are as follows:

(a) Overall, capacity o f the team proposed for the implementation o f procurement is "fair" and the


                                                      - 33 -

     associated risks are in the "average" category. The D P M Procurement Officers are conversant with
     the Government procurement rules but have no experience in implementing Bank-financed
     procurement.      Therefore, in order to mitigate the risk and improve their performance, D P M will
     borrow a senior architect with some experience inBank procurement procedures from the MORPW to
     assist with the civil works contracts. The team will also be seeking guidance when need arises from the
     Procurement Officer in the on-going Public Sector Management TA Project (PSM-TA), who has
     substantial Bank procurement experience. The PSM-TA Project is being implemented by the same
     Implementing Agency (DPM).

(b) The selection and procurement decisions o f most consultancy services and goods will be subject to
     prior review o f the Bank.

(c) For small procurements, D P M will be following Government public procurement regulations which
     were prepared and published in 2001 through the financial and technical support o f the Bank, and are
     acceptable to Bank.

 Inthe light o fthe foregoingmeasures, the riskcanbe rated "average".

 To ensure adequate procurement capacity within the new D L C institution, the individual hired for the
 Administrative Assistant post should have prior procurement experience. He/she will also undergo further
 procurement training with the Bank's guidance.

Civil Works (US$0.49 Million)

5.        The project's main civil works will be the construction o f the Development Learning Centre's
facilities including the main building and a room for the generator (Component 1). Small works might be
necessary duringproject implementation for the maintenance and improvement o f the DLC facilities. Given
the low amount o f this component it would not attract foreign contractors. Contracts estimated to cost less
than US$550,000 but more than US$50,000 equivalent would be tendered through National Competitive
Bidding(NCB). Contracts for works estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent would be procured
under lump sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained from three qualified
domestic contractors invited in writing to bid. The invitation shall include a detailed description o f the
works, including basic specifications, the requiredcompletion date, a basic form o f agreement acceptable to
IDA, and relevant drawings where applicable. The awards will be made to the contractors who offer the
lowest price quotation for the required work, provided they demonstrate they have the experience and
resources to complete the contract successfully.




                                                    - 34 -

Goods (US$O.80 Million)

6.       Goods financed under the project would include vehicles, computers, and equipment for the
implementing agency. N C B procedures would be used except for contracts exceeding US$lOO,OOO each,
which should be tendered through ICB procedures. Prudent shopping based on written price quotations
obtained from at least three reliable suppliers can be used for small quantities o f goods, provided that: (a)
these goods are not grouped into packages o f more than US$30,000; and (b) the aggregate amount does not
exceed US$lOO,OOO. The communication equipment will be procured under I C B procedures with the help
o f WB ISG.

7.       The above aggregate values for N C B or other non-ICB procurement methods for goods and works
are limitative and cannot be exceeded without prior no-objection from the Bank. The procurement unit
responsible for the project will maintain a tracking system to monitor the aggregate values and to alert the
Bank shouldthe limitsbe exceeded.

Consulting Services and Training (US$0.50 Million)

8.       The project will finance consultancy services provided by firms to assist the DL Centre to: (i)
organize courses, workshops and seminars; (ii)     purchase and develop training contents; (iii) D L C
                                                                                                   recruit
staff; and (iv) undertake M&E consultancies. Except as otherwise indicated, The Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCBS) method will be used for consulting assignments carried out by firms. The organization o f
consultative workshops and training assignments to be carried out by firms or training institutions,
estimated to cost less than the equivalent o f US$50,000, may be awarded based on Consultant

training. This can only be done when the DLC i s operational and the first trainees are confirmed. Unlike the case in Burkina
Faso, a readily identifiable group is not known in advance inKenya. The requiredbaseline data on their performancewill be
collectedboth from themselves and (most importantly) their supervisors prior to the training. The data will then be compared
to the end-of-training evaluations, i.e. levels 1 and 2, and after six months using level 3 evaluation (described below) to
determineimpact.

Pre-test: It is proposedthat this information includebasic data on at least the first 300 trainees. More specifically the DLC will
collaboratewith the DPMunit to:

      collect baseline data from the first 100 civil servants, 100 private sector, and 100 civil society trainees who request training
and whose job description includes designing, planning, and managing social and economic development policies and
programs.
      Each prospectivetrainee will fill out a survey identifying specific tasks that helshe does as part of designing, planning, or
managingsocial and economic policies or program.
      Eachprospectivetrainee will identify the specific tasks inwhich helshe would like to improve hislher skills.

It is impractical andprobablynot necessary to interview the supervisors o f all the trainees. It is recommendedthat the M&E
unit aim to:

      collect information from a sample comprising 10% of the supervisors of the trainees, or 30 people being, 10 from each
sector (public, private and civil). Suitable sampling techniques will ensure the 30 supervisors are representative of the
supervisors of all the 3,000 trainees.
     Interview or administer questionnaires to the supervisors so as identify the tasks of the trainee that are consistent with
designing,planning, managingsocial, and economic development policies andprograms.
      Identify areas inwhich the trainee(s) need(s) capacitybuilding.

Eachsupervisor will be presentedwith outlines o f the proposedtraining programs andrequestedto:

      assess the relative saliency of the proposedareas of training for upgradingthe trainees' performance.

PostTest: At the end o fthe training the DLC will conduct its own Level 1and 2 evaluationand no earlier than six monthsafter
the training, a follow-up study should be done on the 300 trainees and the sample o f 30 supervisors. Again, questionnaires
would be the simplest tool with questions that mirror what was asked before the training. For example, the trainees would be
asked to:

      identify components of hisherjob dealingwith designing,planning or managingsocial and economic development policies
and programs;
      specify the extent to which skills or knowledgeinthese areas hadbeen addressed inthe training;
      specify the extent to which helshehad acquirednew skills or knowledge inthe training;
      specify the extent to which helshe hadusedany o f the new skills or knowledge; and
      specify the extent to which (and why) designing,managingor planning hadbecome easier or harder as a result of the
training.

A. Financial Projections

1.Capacity UtilizationProjections

The financial projections of the financial model are based on the two assumptions below:

(a) Total Capacity o f the DLC:
number of seats                               30
number of days                               260

(b) Average Price ofa session per day per participants (inUS$):
 pricelday                                     55

The objectives is to reach financial sustainability at the end of the fourth year of operations. The table
below shows that the equilibrium is reached when the capacity utilization ratio equals 64% (i.e. at least
5,000 traineeslday).

The lessons learnt from DLCs in other countries show that some GDLN Centers generate significant
revenues from other activities such as renting their facilities for face-to-face courses, projects supervision,
etc.

B. Cost Recovery

Inthe Senegal case, the DLC recovered about 60% of its operating costs inFY02. As inSenegal,
Africa GDLN Centers are making regular progress. In order to increase their revenues, DLCs
Management Teams decided to improve their work inthree main areas:

(a) benefitting from their institutional anchorages to give the DLC a multi-sectoral focus and
high visibility: the idea would be to make the DLC the "default" capacity building tool for civil
servants. When a trainingheminar i s required, the administration should look at the D L C first and
see what i s possible. The objective here i s to get a long-term agreement between the GOK and the
DLC: part o f the administration funds for civil servants capacity-building could be used by
(reserved for) the DLC. D L C and GOK could define a capacity-building plan for the coming
year.

(b) role of the Bank: GDLN Services and the Wb Africa Region are defining together the
possible use o f this tool for training components in IDA-financed projects: most o f the
IDA-financed projects comprise a capacity-buildinghrainingcomponent. The idea would be to use
the GDLNto broadcast these trainingsheminars (when possible) and organize competition among
content providers. This could be generalizedto all the WB-financed projects.

(c) role of donors/private sectors: the D L C mustbe very pro-active ingetting other donors
involved. GDLN Services inWBI works on partnership at the institutional level while the DLC
management team plays its role inconvincing local donors o f the potential o f such a tool.
