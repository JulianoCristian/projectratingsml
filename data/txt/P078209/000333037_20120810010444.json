the Kenya Development\n            Learning Center (KDLC) Project for Kenya were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the first\n            lesson learned is that a more careful assessment of the\n            conditions on the ground should have been carried out and\n            considered during the design phase. The Kenya DLC was under\n            designed with respect to prevailing needs. The\n            one-size-fits-all approach to capacity and construction\n            design that was used for all other DLCs was unsuitable for\n            the Kenya context, and proved inappropriate, especially\n            since this was an innovative project. Another lesson learned\n            is that the borrower should have been allowed to continue\n            using its own designed Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            module and the Bank task management team should have been\n            more hands-on with the client's M&E module by\n            evaluating and providing direction on the indicators. This\n            will have saved time on both sides. Bank management could\n            also have assigned an Information Solutions Group (ISG)\n            expert to be based in the country office to work with the\n            Government in implementing the project or at least provided\n            adequate supervision resources to enable local hire of the\n            desired expertise. The Bank could have been more proactive\n            in engaging with the KDLC and in using its services to\n            support the implementation of operations, through the use of\n            the different ICT tools provided by the Center and to\n            promote South-South knowledge exchanges."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
