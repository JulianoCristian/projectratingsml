The first component, construction\n            and installation, entails setting up the DLC's\n            institutional, physical, and human resources requirements,\n            during the first year of the project, and prior to the start\n            up of the DLC's operations (year 2-5). The Directorate\n            of Personnel Management (DPM), Office of the President, is\n            responsible for implementing this component under the\n            leadership of a Project Coordinator. Construction of the DLC\n            facility includes a video-conference room, computer room, a\n            technical, and administrative center, as well as\n            electrical/telephone installations. Additionally, equipment\n            for a small aperture terminal VSAT satellite communication\n            terminal, telecommunications, and microprocessor equipment\n            will be supplied. The second component will assist DLC\n            operations, and its financial viability, i.e., financing\n            operational costs on a decreasing basis over the first four\n            years of operation. Institutional arrangements will be\n            established for the daily management of the DLC, with\n            particular attention to the interaction between DPM and the\n            DLC. This will become paramount in the preparation of a\n            business plan, based on a market study, that identifies\n            training needs, and capacity building, and, for the\n            development of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan,\n            to be submitted on annual, and quarterly basis. The third\n            component will finance the processes involved in M&E\n            training, and development plan, supported by consultants\n            whose aim will be to promote an external independent\n            assessment outside DLC."}, "docdt": "2003-09-26T00:00:00Z"}
