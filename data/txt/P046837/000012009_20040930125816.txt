                            PROPOSEDSUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT
                     TO THE UNITEDREPUBLIC OF TANZANIA FOR
         THE LAKEVICTORIA ENVIRONMENTALMANAGEMENTPROJECT


1.           The followingreport proposesa supplemental creditto the UnitedRepublicof
Tanzania, for SDR2.4 million (US$3.5 millionequivalent). The proposedcreditwill be on
standardIDA terms, with a maturityof40 years. It will supplementthe ongoingLakeVictoria
EnvironmentalManagementProject (CreditNumbers 2908-0 and2908-1,and GEF Grant
Number23817). The originalDevelopment CreditAgreement for SDR 7.0 million (USD9.3
million equivalent), was signedonJuly 30, 1996, andbecameeffectiveon March5, 1997, of
which approximatelyUSD9.1millionhave beendisbursedto date. Supplementalfundinginthe
amount of SDR 4.0 million(USD 5.0 million equivalent) was approvedon December 13, 2001,
o f which approximatelyUSD 4.7 million (94 percent) has beendisbursedto date.The GEF Grant
inthe amount of SDR 7.2 million(USD 10.3million) is fully disbursed.

2.           The additionalfinance is considerednecessarybecauseof unforeseencost overruns
associatedwith Projectexecutionwhich were beyondthe borrower's control, giventhat the Lake
VictoriaEnvironmentalManagementProject(LVEMP) is a regional project. Inparticular,
significant delayshave beenexperiencedwith project implementationinUgandaand inKenya
over the course ofthe last two years. Duringthat periodTanzaniacontinuedto implement project
activities ina fully satisfactory manner andper its work plans. It financedthem largelywith its
first Supplemental. Due to the unanticipateddelays inthe Partner countries, Tanzania is now
facinga cost overrun, and ifthe Government o fthe UnitedRepublicofTanzania(GOT) is to
continue implementationalongside UgandaandKenya, additionalresourceswill be required.
The GOT hastherefore requestedsupplementalfundingfrom IDA inthe amount ofUS$3.5
million. This would finance LVEMP work betweennow andDecember31,2005. Note that the
closingdate for LVEMP inUgandahasbeenextendedto December 31,2005, andthat the GEF
Grant inKenyahas beenextendedfrom December 312004 to December31,2005. Ifthe
requestedsupplementalfunding is grantedandthe closingdate is also concurrently extendedas
requestedto December 31,2005, the three Partner countries couldconclude Phase 1ofthe project
inunison.

3.           The projectis beingcarriedout under aJoint ProjectAgreement, dated September
10, 1996, involvingKenya, Tanzania, andUganda.Lake Victoria is the secondlargest freshwater
lake inthe world. The countries' respectiveshares inthe Lake surface are as follows: Tanzania:
49 percent; Uganda45 percent; andKenya6 percent. The Lake also holdsthe world's largest
freshwater fishery, mainly basedonthe introducedNile perchandTilapia. Catchesamountedto
around 500,000 tons annually duringthe late 1980sand 1990s,andthey therefore contribute
enormouslyto the localhationaleconomies includingexports ofthe Partner States. Kenyahas an
estimated33,000 fishers, Ugandaan estimated35,000, andTanzania about 56,000 fishers.
Consideringbackwardandforward linkages includingprocessingand export is it likely that over
one millionpeople benefitdirectly fromthis subsector alone.

4.           The developmentobjectivesunderthe LVEMP-- remainunchanged. They are to:

             (a) maximizethe sustainable benefitsto ripariancommunitiesfromusingresources
                 within the basinto generate food, employment and income, supply safe water,
                 and sustain a disease-freeenvironment; and

             (b) conservebiodiversityandgenetic resources for the benefitof the riparian
                 countries inparticularandthe globalcommunity ingeneral.

5.           The StaffAppraisalReportalso statesthat the projectis the first phase of a longer
termprogram with the broadobjectives as statedabove. It further statesthat the first phasewill:
(a) providethe necessary informationto improve managemento fthe lake ecosystem; (b)
establish mechanisms for cooperative managementby the three countries; and(c) identifyand
demonstrate practical,self-sustainingremedies, while simultaneouslybuildingcapacity for
ecosystemmanagement. These objectives also remain, andthe additionalfinance requested
wouldhelpachievingthem.

I. CountryContextandSectoralBackground
6.           Country Context. Tanzania is one of the poorest countries o fthe world. Per capita
income is estimatedat about $280 per year. Coveringan area of 945,000 square kilometers(i.e.
larger than KenyaandUgandacombined), it has a populationof about 35 million, growingat
about 3 percentayear. The economy is heavilydependent on agriculture (primarily coffee,
cotton, tea, cashewnuts, sisal, maize, rice, wheat, cassava, tobacco, and fish), which accounts for
about 45 percento f GDP, provides 80 percentof exports, and is by far the largestemployer.
From2000 to 2004, agriculturalgrowthhas beenwithin a range of 3.5 to 5.5 percent annually.
Industryaccounts for some 15percento f GDP and is mainly limitedto processingagricultural
products andlight consumer goods. The miningsector has goodpotentialand is beingdeveloped
inpartwith ForeignDirectInvestmentsuchas from SouthAfrica.

7.           A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tanzaniawas approvedby the Bank's
Boardon June 15,2000. A new assistance strategy is inthe processof beingpreparedjointly
with other donors and inline with Government's new PRSP. Basedon the analysis inthe last
CountryEconomicMemorandumfor Tanzania, Tanzaniaat the Turn of the Century: From
Reforms to SustainedGrowth and Poverty Reduction, a consensusexists on the key constraints
limitinggrowthandthe expansionandefficiency of Tanzania's privatesector. The policy
prioritiesto addressthese constraints are improvingeconomic governance, providinga conducive
business environment, andsupportingprivatization.

8.           Inthe areaof economic governancethe focus is to sustainmacroeconomic stability,
improvepublic services deliverythroughimprovedmanagementofthe budget, and lower
businesscosts andrisks associatedwith corruptionandexcessive bureaucracy. Regardingthe
businessenvironmentthe maintarget is to removepolicy-relatedand institutionalimpedimentsto
privateinvestment and efficientbusinessoperations.Inthe area ofprivatizationandregulation,
there is a needto complete the privatizationof Tanzania's commercial, agricultural,and industrial
public enterprises (PES),as well as all that of major infrastructurePES.The LVEMP
complements these thrusts by promotingsustainable rural developmentto improvethe livelihood
of the majority ofthe poor who live inruralareas adjacentto the Lake or in its watershed, which
is one of the four focal areas of Banksupport to the GOT identifiedinthe CAS; it of course also
supports sustainable managementof the Lakebasinand its naturalresources.

9.           Sustainable Rural Development as Promoted through the LVEMP. Most o f the rural
poor rely on subsistence use o f natural resources by farming on land or by fishing inLake
Victoria or by usingwetlands, forest reserves, and satellite lakes o f the Lake. The LVEMP has
been designed to support sustainable management o f fisheries (benefiting the estimated 56,000
fishers and their families), increase productivity on land (while reducing environmental impacts),
and do researchto gather information for improved resource management in Tanzania and the
two Partner countries Kenya and Uganda. The fishery has not only benefited the poor by
providing incomes to fishermen and animal proteinto the local population, but it has also been a
significant earner o f foreign exchange.

11.      The Lake Victoria EnvironmentalManagement Project (LVEMP)

10.          The environmental quality o f the Lake has declined duringthe past several decades.
At the same time fish output increased and remained high, possibly implyingoverfishing and the
risko fa later decline. Duringthe 1990s water hyacinth invadedthe lake, which reducedthe
efficiency o f operation of the OwenFalls hydroelectric plant and blocked access to ports, fish
landings, and watering points.

11.          To address these problems, the three riparian countries around Lake Victoria (Kenya,
Uganda, and Tanzania) initiated regional cooperation in 1994through a Tripartite Agreement to
work together to solve the environmental problems o f the Lake and its Basin. This ledto ajoint
request by the three governments in 1996 for funding assistance from the GEF and IDA.The
resultwas the preparation and implementationo f the LVEMP.

12.          InTanzania, the LVEMPis executedby aNational Secretariat reportingto the Office
o f the Vice President, Environment and Poverty Eradication, which is in charge o fthe
environment and poverty eradication portfolios. The Tanzanian National Secretariat also serves
as the Regional Secretariat for purposes o f coordinationamongthe countries. The Secretariat
works through various implementingagencies that carry out most o f the work.

13.          The Project consists o ften components, including fisheries management, fisheries
research, wetlands management, soil conservation, catchment afforestation, water quality and
ecosystem management, water hyacinth control, industrial and municipal waste management,
university capacity building, and microprojects with local communities. There is also a
significant effort to develop both institutional and staff skills. Natural resource management laws
and regulations have been strengthened and harmonizedbetween the riparian countries. Human
capacity has been built: Over 34 staff have been supported by the project to undertake MSc and
PhD degree programs and 140 staff attended short courses that focused on natural resource
management researchwithin the Lake Victoria Basin.

14.          Inparticular, the following has beenachieved inTanzania:

         0   InFisheries Management, a co-management system has been introducedinto the
             Lake Victoria fishing communities by creating Beach Management Units(BMUs).
             The Fisheries Act o f 1970has beenreviewedand a new one issued, which
             incorporates and legitimizes the BMUs.A fisheries licensing database to help
             monitor and regulate fishing effort has beendeveloped, and an extensive monitoring,
             control, and surveillance programme has been put inplace. Fishingcommunities in
             collaboration with LVEMP and TAFIRI staff, have identified 141new fish breeding
             areas and 53 fish landingsites. A public awareness campaign involvingradio and TV
             programmes as well as seminardworkshopshas helped communities better to



                                                   4

  understand the issues and to reduce illegal fishing activities. Harmonization o f
  fisheries legislations inthe three Partner States has been submitted to the East
  African Community for a decision. A FishLevy Trust Study was completed in2002.
  The study recommends giving some percentage o f the fish royalties to BMUsand
  Local Authorities to enable them to better manage the fishery inthe Lake Victoria
  Basin. Information on fish once feared disappeared has been collected and
  documented. Studies show that Lake Victoria Fisheries contribution to the national
  economy was 1.8% o f GDP in 1998 and that the value o fNile Perch export to total
  exports was 12.7% in 1998. Also, it has been shown that local fish are an important
  source o f nutrition for the local population.

0 The Project has collected data to derive a more accurate water balance o f Lake
  Victoria. The data show that the inflows and outflows are dominated by the rainand
  evaporation respectively. The sum o f inflows from rain is 82% and from rivers 18%.
  Outflows from evaporation are 76% and the outflow through the Nile is 24%.

0 Onnon-point pollution loading studies indicate that the Kagera subcatchment
  contributes the highesttotal Phosphorus and total Nitrogen loads to the lake which
  flow from urban waterways tendto be polluted with domestic and industrial wastes.

0 An industrial directory has been prepared for non-point source pollution loading. An
  assessment o f the treatment efficiency reveals that most industrieshave no treatment
  systems, and the few that have them are inefficient and produce effluents that do not
  comply with national effluent standards.

0 Studies on Eutrophication carried out show that in-shore areas are more affected by
  eutrophication than the offshore areas due to highnutrient inputs from land based
  sources. Inthe offshore water, transparency remains high, but some oxygen deficits
  occur. Inthe near-shore areas water transparency can be very low with strong
  oxygen deficits inthe hot spot areas.


0 The contribution o fthe sedimentation process to the eutrophication o f the lake is
  more significant innear shore areas than in open waters. The average sedimentation
  rate inthe lake is generally low, about lmdyear, showing that the lake is inno
  danger o f being filled with sediment inthe near future.

0 Using integrated manual and biocontrol agents the project was able to reduce the
  amount o f water hyacinth inLake Victoria by between 80% and 90%. Water
  hyacinth quarantine regulations have been prepared and approved by the National
  Assembly and are operational.

0 A National and a Regional Water Hyacinth Surveillance Systems have beenprepared
  and operationalized.

0 The LVEMP has involved Rwanda inthe control of water hyacinth to a some extent.

0 Data has been collected and research conducted on the buffering capacity o f wetlands
  has been collected. The report shows the importance o f usingwetlands to sieve
  effluents. From the study, a Duflow Model has been developed.

            A cost-benefit analysis o fthe Lake Victoria Basin wetlands has been done.

            Training o f farmers on soil and water conservation and other appropriate land
            management practices has enabledthem to increase crop production. Some have
            increasedyield o f maize from 500 to as much as 1000kglha and o f paddy from 450 to
            1350 kg/ha, while at the same time reducing erosionhedimentation.

            Communities in 64 villages inMwanza and Mara Regions have been mobilized to
            conserve 36 forests by preparingmanagement plans.

            A total o f 8.5 milliontree seedlings have been planted with an average survival rate
            o f 85 percent.

            The LVEMP has supported 26 people to obtain Masters Degrees, 8 to obtain PhDs,
            and to obtain Diplomas, while 140 have attended short courses. Many villagers have
            attended sensitization meetingsand workshops.

            A total o f 82 demand-driven microprojects have beenimplementedin 15 districts in
            Mwanza, Kagera and Mara Regions.

              Committee meetings for Lake Victoria, develop data bases, disseminate information,
              assist all components with procurement.

16.           The GOT as well as the Governments o fKenya and Uganda have reconfirmed their
long term commitment to managingthe fisheries resources sustainably and to resolving
environmental and social issues inthe Lake Basin, and they have requested additional IDA/GEF
assistance with a follow-on project. PHRD grant resources are beingused for the preparation of
LVEMP2, and a GEF Medium-Size (grant-funded) Project is supportingthe preparation o f a
transboundary diagnostic analysis and a corresponding strategic action plan, involving also
Rwanda and Burundi.

IV.     Rationalefor a Supplemental Credit

17.           The proposed Supplemental Credit meets the requirements o f OP13.20 on
supplemental financing as follows:

18.           Cost OverrunDue to Exceptional CircumstancesBevond the Borrower`s Control.
The additionalfinance was found to be necessary because o f unforeseen cost overruns associated
with Project execution which were beyondthe borrower's control. Inparticular, significant
delays have been experienced with project implementation inUgandaand inKenya duringthe
last year.

19.           InKenya, the IDA portion closed inDecember 2002, while the GEFportion was
extended. Also, to enhance efficiency in project implementation, the project was moved from the
Ministryo fEnvironment to the KenyaAgricultural ResearchInstitute. The latter has a good
track record, and indeed it has shown duringthe last several months that it can manage the project
well. Butthe transfer from the Ministryto KARI duringthe first half of 2003 took longer than



                                                      7

expected, whichis why the project there almost came to a standstill. A supervision mission in
April 2004 confirmedthat all componentsare now again movingforward with project
implementation as planned.

20.          InUgandathere was a longdelay inthe approval of its Supplemental IDA Credit by
the Parliament. Because ofthis delay there was also a significant slowdown in2003 of project
activities that depend on IDA funding. Parliamentary approval was obtained inNovember 2003,
and the Supplemental became effective on December 17,2003. Work has picked up since then
and was assessedto be satisfactory again by a mission inApril 2004.

21.          Both Uganda and Kenya expect satisfactory project performance from now on, and
they are both keen to see Tanzania succeedingetting additional finance to carry out its part inthe
joint work. Therefore, due to the unanticipated delays inthe Partner countries, Tanzania is facing
a situation of cost overrun, since certain activities, such as monitoring water quality, water
hyacinth control, fisheries managementand enforcement, or working toward an agreement on a
regional fish quality standard, can either not be undertaken by only two of the three Partner
countries, or cannot be considered complete untilall parties have taken the agreedupon actions.
An absence of planned actions inThe Republic of Tanzania would result ina "drag" on the other
two countries ifthey were not undertaken or would hinderboth Tanzania and/or its two partner
countries from achievingprogress, giventhat they all contribute to improved management o f a
jointly-owned resource. GOT is willing to borrow the additional supplemental funds, and Kenya
and Uganda are keento see Tanzania succeed inits request to IDA. The cost for the Government
o f the UnitedRepublicof Tanzania to continue to do its part ina synchronized manner with its
Partner States, is US$3.5 million.

22.          TheLoan is beinaImplemented in Comuliance with Covenants. The LVEMP is
beingimplementedin compliance with all covenants set forth inthe Project's Development
Credit and GEF Grant Agreements.

23.          It is Impossible to Reduce the Sco-ueof the Project to Fit theAvailable Resources. It
is impossible to reduce the scope of the LVEMP to fit the available resources (about US$0.2
million, when annual disbursements have historically beenabout US$4 million) without
significantly impairingthe project's economic viability or capacity to achieve its objectives,
becauseall activities are regionally relevant.

24.          TheBorrower is Unable to Finance the Additional Costs and to ObtainAdditional
Funds from Other Lenders on Reasonable Terms or in Reasonable Time. The GOT continues to
operate under macroeconomic constraints, and local finance is limited. The only other possible
source of finance would be from bilateral donors. All of those participating inthe Partnership
Consultative Committee for Lake Victoria were contacted but were unable to provide the
additional funds.

25.          The TimeAvailable is too Short to Process a Further Freestanding Bank Loan. The
total time to process a freestanding Bank Loan to continue LVEMP activities would take
significantly longer to prepare and be made "effective" than would a Supplemental Credit for the
existing Project. Speedis of the essence, since funds are runningout, while both Ugandaand
Kenya have sufficient funding for operations up untilthe end of 2005.

26.          TheBorrower is Committed to the Project, and the Imulementing Agencies have
Demonstrated Competence in Carwing it out. Government is committed to the Project, and
implementingagencieshave shown capacity to implementthe project fully satisfactorily.

V.       Benefitsof the Supplemental Credit
27.          To manage Lake Victoria, non-performance or hinderedperformance by one country
is a "drag" or cost on the two other countries and theirjointly-owned resource. With the re uested
supplemental funding, such costs would be avoided. Note that the main economic benefits o f the     9
overall LVEMP derive from avoiding the losses that can be anticipated if effective action i s not
taken. The benefits from the supplemental would be a portion o f the estimated benefits for the
overall project.

28.          The proposed Supplemental Credit would help ensure realization o f the expected
benefits of promoting sustainable use o f the natural resources o f the Lake and its catchment.
Successful implementationo f the Project is expected to:

             0    Help avoid a decline in the overall fishery as a result o f overfishing and (to a
                  lesser extent) deterioration o f Lake water quality;

             0    Maintain the water hyacinth infestation at a non-nuisance level o f around 20
                  percent o fthe original coverage (with the exception o f some nutrient-rich
                  hotspots); at that level no or only small amounts needto be removed at Owen
                  dam (to avoid impairingthe electricity generation) and lake transport is not
                  hinderedsignificantly;

             0    Increase productivity on the land while reducingnutrientloss through erosion;
                  this is achievedthrough integrated landand water management as well as
                  agroforestry and/or afforestation;

             0    Complete microprojectsthat support communities around the Lake and in its
                  watershed;

             0    Limit degradation o fthe wetlands so that they can continue to fulfill their
                  function o f buffering effluents; and

             0    Limit loss reductions inspecific fishpopulations and restore uniquefish fauna
                  and other important terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity.


VI.       Activities to be Financed
29.          As referredto inparagraph 15 above, and as specified inmuchmore detailed inthe
agreed work plan with the Borrower, the Supplemental Credit will mainly finance work on
fisheries management and research, water hyacinth control, water quality and ecosystem data
collection and management, wetland management, integrated soil and water conservation,
catchment afforestation, human resource development, community drivenmicroprojects, and
nationalhegionalproject management. Many o fthese need coordinatiodcollaboration o fthe
three countries.

 'A conservative estimateofthe main quantifiable benefits of undertakingthe Project, and costs should the
Project not be undertaken,were done at Appraisal ofthe LVEMP. These include direct positive effect on
sustainablefisheries exploitation, and the costs ofthe water hyacinth infestation assumingno action, and
hrther deterioration ofwater quality. The benefitsto the fishery accruingthrough proper management
were estimatedto be $600 million at a discount rate of 12%of present value of the revenue stream for total
exports. The costs ofnot managingthe water hyacinth infestation o fthe Lake were estimatedto be US$6-
 10 milliodyear, while likely costs attributable to costs associated with additional treatment of domestic
water supply alone from the Lake in general at a minimum of US$3.5 million/year. It was felt that these
estimates of cost and benefit would fullyjustify, alone, the LVEMP cost ofUS$25 million inTanzania.

30.         The following procurement o f civil works, goods, and consultancies/training are
needed, including:

Civilworks:
Constructiono f one weevil rearingunit (facility) at Rubafu;
Museum construction (for fisheries education and information dissemination);
Bukoba Water Quality Laboratory rehabilitation; and
Constructiono f Dar es Salaam University Marine Biology Laboratory in Mwanza.

Goods and equipments:
Replacement o f old office equipment including laptops and computers; and
Laboratory equipment.

Consultanciesand training:
Various local consultancies for biodiversity, water quality, database management support;
Ongoing university degree courses or short courses;
Workshops;
Short courses and study tours;
Printingand disseminating information on stakeholders; and
Regional Policy Steering Committee (RPSC) meetings.

VII.     ImplementationArrangements

31.          The proposed Supplemental Credit does not require additional implementation
capacity beyond what is already inplace. The LVEMP project is executed by the
Regionamational Secretariat reportingto the Office o f the Vice President, Environment and
Poverty Eradication, which is incharge o f environment and poverty eradication portfolios. The
Secretariat has performed satisfactorily and will oversee the execution o fthe Supplemental
Credit. The Supplemental Credit will be subject to the same monitoring and reporting
requirements o f the project. N o changes are needed inthe Project Implementation Manual.

32.         Extension of the existing Credit: As part o f this request for a supplemental credit, a
concomitant extension o f the closing date from November 30,2004 to December 31,2005 was
requestedby Government and is hereby recommended.

VIII.    Project Cost and Financing

33.          The total project cost, net oftaxes and duties, is estimated at US$3.6 million
equivalent, o f which an IDA Supplemental Credit o fUS$3.5 million equivalent is proposed. The
Government contribution is estimated at US$lOO,OOO equivalent, representing about 3% o fthe
total project cost. The breakdown o f the project's costs and its financing plan and disbursement
schedule are shown inAnnex 1. Management o f the Supplemental Credit will be through the
existingNational Project Secretariat for the LVEMP.

34.          The Borrower shall, for the purposes o fmaking available its counterpart contribution
for the financing o fthe Project:

             (a) Open, and thereafter maintain untilthe completion o fthe Project, a Project
                 Account in a Commercial Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
                 Association;
             (b) Deposit into the Project Account an initial contribution o f US$20,000;


                                                 10

                   Thereafter replenishthe said account upto the initial amount o fUS$20,000 at the
                   endof each Project Quarter untilthe completionofthe Project, or whenever its
                   balanceshall be less thanUS$5,000; and
                   Ensurethat amountsdeposited intothe ProjectAccount shall be usedexclusively
                   to makepaymentsto meet expendituresmade or to be made inrespect ofthe
                   reasonablecost of goods, works and services for the Project inadditionto those
                   financed fromthe proceedsofthe Credit.

 IX.      ProcurementAccounting, FinancialReportingand AuditingArrangements

  35.         The Creditwill follow the procurement anddisbursement procedures applied under
 the original Credit. Priorreviewthresholds for IDA/GEFPriorReviewas definedinthe original
 ProjectCreditAgreement will remaininplace.The civil works will be awardedonthe basis of
 NationalCompetitiveBidding(NCB). The SupplementalCreditwill be executedandclosedby
 December 31,2005.

 36.          The LVEMPNationalSecretariathas establishedan acceptableaccounting and
 reportingsystem for the Project, whichwill continue for the SupplementalCredit, includingthe
  SpecialAccount andthe statementso f expenditures. Continuedcompliance is beingclosely
  monitoredby AccreditedFinancialStaffofIDA inthe TanzaniaCountry Office.

  37.           Independentauditors acceptableto IDA will auditthe use of all funds available
 under the Supplemental Credit, includingthe SpecialAccount andthe statements of expenditures.
  Audit reports will be submittedto IDA no later than six months after the endo fthe fiscal year.
 The format andthe frequency of periodicreportingwill be maintainedas definedinthe project
  implementationmanual. An ImplementationCompletionReport (ICR) will be preparedwithin
  six months after Creditclosingfor Tanzaniaas well as its PartnercountriesKenyaandUganda.

 X.       Environmentaland SocialAspects

  38.         As part o fpreparationanddesignofthe Projectin 1995-1996,an Environmental
 Analysis (EA) was conducted, the conclusion o fwhichwas that the LVEMPwas an
  environmentallypositiveactivityandwas not expectedto generateany significantadverse
  environmentalimpacts. A few projectactivitiescouldcause adverse effects, which are readily
  manageable. For example, large-scalecontrolo fwater hyacinthinTanzanianwaters has been
  limitedto biologicalandmanualcontrolmethods, whichhave proveneffective and
  environmentallybenign. An ISDS has beencompleted, reviewedand clearedby ASPEN for the
  proposedSupplementalCredit. The originalEA category "B" has beenmaintained, andthe
  proposedCredithas beenassigneda safeguardclassificationof "S2 -One or more safeguard
' policiesare triggered, buteffects are limitedintheir impact and are technically and institutionally
  manageable". The originalEA remainsrelevant andapplicable andhas beenre-disclosed.

  XI.     Sustainability

  39.         The Governmenthas inthe past few years supportedfisheries management(and
 thereby helpedto reducethe risks of overfishing), andwatershedmanagementinvarious forms,
  andruraldevelopment. It also has made useofthe informationgeneratedby the LVEMP. The
 Project's ability to control water hyacinthinfestations,respondquicklyto the requirementsofthe
 EUto improve the quality and certificationprocessof fish exports to the Community, andto
 providescientificallysupportable recommendationsto GOT queries regardingmanagemento fthe
 Lakehas establisheda strongbaseuponwhichto proceedwith additionalinvestments. Tanzania
