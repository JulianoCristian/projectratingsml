In particular, significant delays\n            have been experienced with project implementation in Uganda,\n            and Kenya over the course o f the last two years. The\n            additional finance is considered necessary because of\n            unforeseen cost overruns, because due to the unanticipated\n            delays in the Partner countries, Tanzania is now facing a\n            cost overrun, and if the Government of Tanzania (GOT) is to\n            continue implementation alongside Uganda and Kenya,\n            additional resources will be required. This supplemental\n            credit would finance LVEMP work between now and December 3\n            1,2005. Specifically, the agreed work program includes the\n            following items: a) Fisheries Research; b) Fisheries\n            Management; c) Water Hyacinth control; d) Water Quality and\n            Ecosystem Management; e) Wetlands Management; f) Integrated\n            Soil and Water Conservation; g) Catchment Afforestation; h)\n            Support to Riparian Universities; i) Micro projects; j)\n            Community Participation; and, k) National Regional\n            Secretariat. The proposed Supplemental Credit would help\n            ensure realization of the expected benefits of promoting\n            sustainable use of the natural resources of the Lake, and\n            its catchment. Procurement will include civil works, goods\n            and equipments; and, consultancies and training."}, "docdt": "2004-09-17T00:00:00Z"}
