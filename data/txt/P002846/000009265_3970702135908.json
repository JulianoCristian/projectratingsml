to achieve two major objectives which include:  (1)\n            improvement of the quality of education in primary and\n            secondary schools as well as; (2) improvement of educational\n            management.  In regard to improving primary education, the\n            project seeks to upgrade the skills of 5,850 primary school\n            teachers by providing correspondence and upgrading courses,\n            seminars and on-the-job support.  Under this component,\n            textbooks will also be provided at low-cost to students.  As\n            for secondary education, the project aims to upgrade the\n            skills of 1,250 math and science teachers through an\n            integrated program of annual seminars, on-the-job support,\n            and preparation and distribution of teacher guides.  This\n            component further includes improvement of science\n            facilities.  To enhance the management of education, the\n            project will provide assistance to the Educational Planning\n            Division as well as the project Implementation Division.\n            This will improve planning and allocation of resources in\n            the education sector; develop a capability for school\n            rehabilitation and preventive maintenance along with\n            strengthening project preparation and implementation."}, "docdt": "1985-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
