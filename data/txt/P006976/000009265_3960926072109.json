It is intended to raise the sustainable\n            growth rate and strengthen fiscal and balance of payments\n            performance. This will be accomplished by improving the\n            incentive framework for investment, and exports, and by\n            enhancing the efficiency of Government operations. More\n            specifically, the credit will support a reform program\n            encompassing: 1) trade, tax and investment policies; 2)\n            agricultural sector policies; 3) public sector investment\n            formulation and monitoring; and, 4) public sector wages and\n            employment policy. This will finance all imports with the\n            exception of luxury items, military goods, alcoholic\n            beverages and tobacco products."}, "docdt": "1987-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
