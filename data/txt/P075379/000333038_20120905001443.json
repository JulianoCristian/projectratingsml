in\n            Productive Landscapes of the North-Northwestern Fluminise\n            (GEF) Project for Brazil was as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: projects seeking methodological\n            change and requiring a strong, committed field presence need\n            careful upstream analysis of the institutional profile and\n            capacity of partners and co-executors. Collaborative\n            monitoring, data-collection and storage need to be\n            negotiated between the executors and partners to ensure that\n            a Bank-supported project co-financed by other programs can\n            access project-related data reflecting the\n            performance/achievements of all players. To secure genuine\n            collaboration on IEM longer-term, mechanisms are needed to\n            create intersection and communication between the\n            Recipient/Borrower and the other co-financing programs or\n            institutions. The qualifications of the technical teams and\n            their adequate presence on the ground, as well as their\n            close and regular contact with beneficiaries, promote farmer\n            confidence and the credibility of the project and its\n            institutions. The project demonstrated that a conjunction of\n            mechanisms and events is needed to mobilize and motivate\n            small farmers to engage with/in biodiversity conservation\n            through their agricultural practices and indeed as\n            activities in their own right, on their properties."}, "docdt": "2012-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
