                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the proposed project is to promote an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach to guide the development and
                         implementation of sustainable land management (SLM) practices in the North and Northwest (NNWF) regions of Rio de Janeiro State. The desired principal
                         outcomes for the primary target group (smallholder families and communities) are: (i) improved capacity and organization for NRM, and (ii) increased adoption
                         of IEM and SLM concepts and practices.

                         The global environmental objectives are to: (i) address threats to biodiversity of global
                         importance, (ii) reverse land degradation in agricultural landscapes, (iii) enhance carbon
                         sequestration, and (iv) increase awareness at all levels of the value of adopting an IEM approach in the management of natural resources. The desired principal
                         outcomes for the global environment are: (i) conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and (ii) increased carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems.
