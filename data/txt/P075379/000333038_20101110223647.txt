7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The development objective of the proposed project is to promote an integrated ecosystem management 
(IEM) approach to guide the development and implementation of sustainable land management (SLM) 
practices in the North and Northwest (NNWF) regions of Rio de Janeiro State. The desired principal 
outcomes for the primary target group (smallholder families and communities) are: (i) improved capacity 
and organization for NRM, and (ii) increased adoption of IEM and SLM concepts and practices.  The 
global environmental objectives are to: (i) address threats to biodiversity of global importance, (ii) reverse 
land degradation in agricultural landscapes, (iii) enhance carbon sequestration, and (iv) increase awareness 
at all levels of the value of adopting an IEM approach in the management of natural resources. The desired 
principal outcomes for the global environment are: (i) conservation and sustainable use of biological 
diversity, and (ii) increased carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems.
