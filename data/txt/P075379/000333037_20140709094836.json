     Sustainable Integrated Ecosystem Management in Production\n            Landscapes of North-Northwestern Fluminese Project for\n            Brazil were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: in this case the plan for\n            monitoring biophysical impacts of the project was designed\n            by an externally contracted firm and the technical agency\n            responsible for the actual monitoring, was not brought on\n            board until after project preparation phase, at too late of\n            a stage to design an alternative plan. Some indictors could\n            not be measured because of flaws in the placement of\n            monitoring stations. Other impacts could not be demonstrated\n            because of insufficient information in the baseline survey.\n            Formulation of global environment objectives should take\n            into account the project time frame and available resources.\n            In this case the project's official objectives were\n            stated in terms of ambitious global environment objectives.\n            But the project was designed largely as a pilot to lay the\n            foundation for a larger program to be scaled up in the\n            future; on farm investments were implemented on a pilot\n            scale more suitable for demonstration purposes than for\n            achieving the ambitious impact implied by the objectives statement."}, "docdt": "2014-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
