A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues
Environmental Issues. The Atlantic Forest or Mata AtZGntica stretches along Brazil's Atlantic
coast, from the northem state o fRio Grande do Norte south to Rio Grande do Sul. It boasts
20,000 plant species, 40 percent o fwhich are endemic. Yet less than 10 percent o f the forest
remains. More thantwo dozen Critically Endangered vertebrate species are clinging to survival
inthe region, including three speciesofliontamarins and six birdspecies. There are also many
unique species including the red-billedcurassow, the Brazilian merganser, and numerous
threatened parrot species.

Long isolated from other major rainforest blocks inSouth America, the Atlantic Forest has an
extremely diverse and unique mix o f vegetation and forest types. The region has been losing
habitat for hundredso f years, first to sugarcane plantations and later to coffee plantations. The
State o f Rio de Janeiro (SoRJ), with a territory o f approximately 44,000 km2and a population o f
14.4 million people, i s uniqueinBrazil for having the highest percentage o f the Atlantic Forest
biome with respect to total area o f all Brazilian states. The project area, the North and
NorthwestemFluminense (NNWF) administrative regions, encompasses 22 municipalities (with
one million inhabitants, 17 percent o f whom are rural, comprising some 30,000 family farms)
and an area o f 15,000 km2,have the largest stands o f remaining forest inthe State. While a few
o f these forest tracts are already being conserved inprotected areas, most are not and are
dispersed throughout the region and locatedmostly on private lands.

Despiteits global importance, the Atlantic Forest inthe NNWFregion is under severe pressure.
Main current threats include: (i)   deforestation relatedto land conversion and charcoal
production, and (ii)  soil erosion causedby deforestation, overgrazing, and inappropriate
agriculturalpractices. Indeed, from 1990-2000the SoRJhadthe highest rate o f deforestation
(16.7 percent) o f all the Brazilian states coveredby Atlantic Forest, most o fwhich occurred in
the NNWFregions.

Agricultural and Socioeconomic Issues. Agriculture i s the main occupation and source of income
for a significant portion o f the NNWFpopulation. The sector has been characterized by
extensive low technology and low productivity cattle raising and by "boom and bust" cycles o f
sugarcane and coffee plantations which have resulted indeforestation and large tracts o f
degraded areas. Pasture degradation, soil erosion, and reduced availability o f water resources
have resulted inlow productivity which, coupled with increased competition from other regions
and countries and the ensuingfalling prices paid to producers, has resulted ina progressive loss
o f competitiveness.

These issues particularly affect the NNWF region because it i s primarily composed o f small
family farms. Inrecent years, both rural poverty and out-migration have increased significantly.
Socioeconomic indicators, such as for those income, education, and infant mortality, are the
lowest inthe State. Most small farms generate very low incomes and are characterized by
dependence on manual labor and little use o f corrective measures to address deteriorated soil
fertility. Inaddition, there is relatively low organizational capacity amongproducers andlimited
use o f technical assistance and rural extension.



                                                   1

Given the existing potential for improved land use systems, the needto significantly increase
carbon storage inthe NNWF agro-ecosystems, the significance the Atlantic Forest biome and
associated agro-ecosystems for the conservation and sustainable use o fbiodiversity considered to
be o f global importance, andthe growing threats to the remaining habitats affected by land
degradation, urgent interventions aimed at integrated ecosystem management (IEM) and
improved sustainable land management (SLM) are warranted.

However, a number o f key constraints impedeprogress toward the adoption o f a comprehensive
and cross-sectoral approach to IEMand S L M inthe NNWF and reduce the potential for the
provision o f environmental services inthose regions. They include:

   i)      Insufficient human and institutional capacity and weak community organizations at
           the local and state levels;
   ii)     Lack o fproducer capital to undertake the relatively heavy upfi-ont investments
           necessary to adopt S L M practices;
    iii) LimitednumberofSLMpracticesadaptedtothespecificagroecologicalconditions
           o f the NNWF area; and
    iv)    Insufficient systematized data and information necessary for decisionmakers to
           incorporate ecosystem-level considerations into production activities.

Nonetheless, despite this context, the NNWFregions are the largest producers o f agricultural
products and, given recent stepped-up efforts by the GoRJ, now receive the largest share o f
agricultural credit (46 percent) and agricultural technical assistance (38 percent) inthe State.
Thus, while it is clear that the NNWF regions are inserious needo f environmentally and
socioeconomically sustainable management o f their natural resources, the State government i s
taking steps to improve this situation, and these steps form the basis upon which the proposed
project would carry out its activities.

GovernmentStratem. Inresponse to the abovementioned concerns, the State and Federal
governments have established a policy agenda that specifically reflects increased agricultural
production and diversification. These include: (i)  the State Credit Program for Agricultural
Productionand Diversification (Moeda Verde), (ii)     the State Microcatchment Program for Rural
Sustainable Development (Rio Rural) which provides rural extension and infrastructure to
rehabilitatemicrocatchment resources (e.g., erosion control for rural roads); and (iii) the National
Smallholder Agriculture Program (PRONAF) which provides credit and assistance for
smallholders to facilitate conditions for increasingproductive capacity. Inaddition, non-
govemment initiatives are beingimplemented to support State ProtectedAreas including: (i)       the
KfW-supportedPro-Atlantic Forest Program which focuses on strengthening protected areas
(PAS) inthe NNWF; (ii)    the GEF-supported Critical EcosystemPartnership Fund(CEPF) which
provides support to the establishment o fprivate protected areas located inthe Serra do Mar
Corridor, andresearch efforts for insitu conservation o f threatened species.

Despite these efforts, much remains to be done, specifically on two fronts. The first involves the
needto foster a comprehensive and cross-sectoral approach to ecosystem management to ensure
ecosystem integrity, inorder to leverage the positive environmental impact o f ongoing activities.



                                                   2

Inthis regard, the project would employ an IEMapproach (which emphasizes the linkages
among people, natural systems, and ongoing activities dealing with NFW issues inthe region) to
theplanning and implementationo fSLM activities.

The second involves fostering increased public awareness o fthe importance o f S L M activities in
the conservation of natural resources, and strengthening the demand for such activities (and for
other "off-farm" activities that would also support the integrity o f important ecosystems) as well
as for the adaptation of S L M practices to the specific agroecological conditions o f the project
area.

GEF support would seek abalance betweenboth fronts through: (a) an enhanced "top-down''
approach that would promote improved support instruments and strengthened institutions to
create an enabling environment for the adoption and long-term sustainability o f IEMand S L M
concepts within a broader local and statewide rural development approach; and (b) a
strengthened"bottom-up" approach that wouldbe focused at the microcatchment level and
would: assist insustainable landmanagement planning activities; provide technical and financial
assistance to the transition to sustainable productive livelihood activities; support adaptive
research for more environmentally sustainable land management techniques; work to increase
community organization and capacity to manage natural resources; and train technical assistance
providers in environmental matters and in a more inclusive, participatory approach to rural
extension, so they may become agents o f change with regardto the public's recognition o fthe
value o f environmental conservation. The project, proposed as a replicable demonstration
project, would strive to leverage the impact o f ongoing efforts and promote the active
involvement o f community organizations to both increase the project's impact and sustainability
givenits limitedfunding, and to build on the promising state, federal, andnon-government
programs underway.

Countw Elinibility. Brazilratified the Convention on Biological Diversity on June 13, 1994 and the
Framework Convention on Climate Change on February 28, 1994.

Project Fit with National or Sector Development Plans. The proposed project's focus on
sustainable land management (SLM), integrated ecosystem management (IEM), andbiodiversity
conservation fits well with national and sectoral development plans for the region, as outlined in
the GovernmentStrategy above. Theproject would contribute to the implementation o fthe
National Biodiversity Policy (Decree No4.339 o f August 22, 2002) and meets the eligibility
criteria for GEF funding inaccordance with guidelines set by the National Commission on
Biodiversity (CONABIO) inDecisionNo12 o fMarch 25,2004, outlined inthe document,
"Brazilian Strategyfor the GEF." The project also fits within the World Bank's broader regional
program that covers South-Southeast Brazil, by continuing and strengthening its current
coordinationwith the ongoing World Bank-supported microcatchment projects inthat region.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement
For many years, rural poverty reduction and natural resources management have been key
elements o f the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Brazil, mainly through the
financing o f specific investment projects as well as economic and sector work. As these themes




                                                  3

have emergedas national priorities inBrazilinrecent years, the Bank has facilitated the
incorporationo f international experience into the design o fpolicies and programs.

The proposed project would complement the strategies o fthe KfW, ongoing GEFprojects, and
ongoing government programs (PRONAF, Moeda Verde and Rio Rural) inthe Atlantic Forest. It
has already beguncoordinating closely with them and would continue to do so bybuilding on the
existing activities o f a number o f them, e.g., by using PRONAF guidelines to determine
subproject beneficiaries and eligible subproject categories;` working with the State Rural
ExtensionAgency (EMATER) for improved rural extension work; andproviding support to the
formulation o f (i) sustainable land management plans for the microcatchments (PEMs), (ii)
IndividualFarm-level Development Plans (PIDs) which could later be submitted as subproject
proposals for project financing, and (iii)    Statutes o f Community Conduct for the Responsible Use
o fNR (ECCs), which would buildon ongoing stakeholder training activities.

The Bank's involvement insupporting the proposed project would provide the S O Nwith greater
access to the broad spectrum o f Bank-supported, community-based naturalresources
management programs. Inaddition, the proposed project would also benefit from Bank
experience inthe preparation and implementationo f completed and current land management or
GEFprojects inother Southern Brazilian states (SBo Paulo, Santa Catarina, Paranh, andRio
Grande do Sul),-as well as projects inother Latin American countries that address issues related
to payments for environmental services. It would also help to ensure broader dissemination o f
results to the extensive network o f Bank-supported rural development programs worldwide.).
Perhaps o f even greater importance, Bank and GEF involvement inthe proposed project would
provide the opportunity to enhance the development, demonstration, and evaluation o f
mechanisms to mainstream a new, sustainable approach to rural development. Inaddition, GEF
support would help secure the protection o f important global biodiversity resources and the
enhancement o f carbon sequestration inthe agricultural landscape through effective management
o f critical ecosystems within the Atlantic Forest biome.

3. Higher level objectivesto which the projectcontributes
Through an IEMapproach to the conservation o f the Atlantic Forest, the proposed project would
contribute to the long-term conservation and rehabilitation o f agro-ecosystems, andwould
include the development and implementation o f sustainable land management (SLM)practices
that provide environmentally sustainable economic opportunities for rural communities.

Fit to the Bank Countw Assistance Stratem. The proposedproject is consistent with the current
CountryAssistance Strategy(CAS), insupport o f"A More Equitable, Sustainable, and
Competitive Brazil," andwould help strengthen one o f the five pillars for development identified
inthe CAS, that of Environment andNatural Resources Management, and is relevant to eachof
the three specific themes identified under this pillar: (1) natural resources management; (2)
environmentalprotection and management; and (3) global environmental extemalities, including
carbon sequestration andbiodiversity. Inaddition, the proposedproject would contribute to more
sustainable land management, one o f the long-term country goals identifiedinthe CAS.
Furthermore, the project is fully consistent with the CAS'S emphasis on the importance o f
coupling conservation strategies with efforts for poverty reduction and sustainable growth.
'See Annex 4, Appendix 2 for a table showing these categories.


                                                      4

Fit to GEF OperationalPvowams and Priority StrateEies. The proposed project is also
consistent with the GEF Operational Strategy and specifically with its OperationalProgram on
IntegratedEcosystem Management (OP 12), inthat it would promote the adoption o f
comprehensive landand ecosystem management interventions that integrate ecological,
economic, and social goals to achieve long-term protection and sustainable use o fbiodiversity,
the reduction o f net emissions and increased storage o f carbon interrestrial ecosystems, and the
conservation and sustainable use o fwatersheds, providing benefits at the local, national, and
global levels. It is also consistent with the Sustainable Land Management Operational Strategy
(OP 15), as it would address land degradation issues and support the adoption o f S L M practices.

Moreover, the project would fit with the GEF Strategic Priorities for (i)             biodiversity (BD-SP2), by
facilitating the mainstreaming o fbiodiversity objectives within production systems and the development
o fmarket incentive measures; and (ii)        sustainable land management (SLM-SPl), as it includes a heavy
focus on capacity buildingfor SLM.

4. Projectcomponents
The project objectives would be achieved by supporting the promotion o f integrated ecosystem
management by means o f the following four components. For details, see Annexes 3 and4.

Component1-Planningfor IntegratedEcosystemManagementActions (US$0.94 million,
6.0 percent o f total project cost): Through studies to be developed and the lessons gathered from
the adoption o f local land management planningand investment activities, this component would
influence policymaking, thus contributing to providing national and beneficiary stakeholders
(especially policymakers inthe SOWand the NNWF farming communities) with a strengthened
framework at the state and local levels to facilitate the adoption and sustainability o f IEM
principles and SLMpractices.

Subcomponent 1,1-Strengthening of IEM Incentive Structure and Ecosystem Planning Systems:
would include (i) design o f a support system for S L M to facilitate financial sustainability
                    the
beyond the project period; (ii)   a study to identify specific actions and institutional arrangements

the creation o f environments favorable to the formation and strengthening o f rural organizations;
and (ii) share project implementation experiences and lessons leamed with relevant stakeholders
at the local, state, and national levels, thus broadening project impact beyond the local level. It
would support training, education, and associated community efforts designed to promote
biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management o f natural resources. It would target
extension staff and residents of project-supported watersheds, including smallholder farmers,
women, youth, and schoolteachers.

percent o f total project cost). The objectives o f this component would be to promote significant
beneficiary and implementationpartners' participation inmanagement and monitoring activities
to leverage implementation impact. It would ensure the effective implementation o fproject
activities and management o fresources, monitor whether or not the project i s achieving the
desiredresults or would needto be adjusted, and disseminate these results and lessons leamed at
the local, state, national and intemational levels.

Subcomponent 4.1-Participatory Management of the Project: would support operational aspects
necessary for the effective implementationo f project activities andmanagement o f resources,
while at the same time mainstreamingthe project approach within the services that project
partners provide to the NNWF's rural population. Inaddition to this core executive structure, and
given the importance o f leveragingproject impact through integrationwith other ongoing
activities, a participatory, consultative extemal project coordination structure (Coordination
Forums) would be established at the state, municipal andmicrocatchment levels.

Subcomponent 4.2-Monitoring and Evaluation: would carry out participatory overall physical
and financial monitoring o f the project, socioeconomic and environmental monitoring inpilot
microcatchments, and overall project evaluation including the development and implementation
o f a monitoring system.

Subcomponent 4.3-Project Dissemination: would support the design and implementation o f the
project information dissemination strategy which would disseminate project implementation
results and lessons leamedto all relevant stakeholders, and provide the basis for knowledge

 transfer, subsequently increasingthe potential for replicating implementation experiences and
 project lessons learned.

 Sector IssuesAddressed in the Project. The project i s designedto address sector issues by: (a)
 supportingthe implementation o f the Serra do Mar Biodiversity Corridor, through the
 development and implementation o f an action plan that would identify specific actions,
 institutional arrangements, and monitoring tools to support the implementation o f the Corridor in
 the project area; (b) promoting the conservation and connectiono fforest remnants inthe buffer
 zones o f existing public protected areas, through provision o ftechnical and financial assistance;
 (c) adopting improved agriculturalpractices that enhancebiodiversity and arrestheverse land
 degradation; (d) promoting the sustainable use o f agrobiodiversity (e.g., medicinal plants); and
 (e) promoting the adoption o f improved land management practices.

 5. Lessons learnedand reflectedin the projectdesign
 The proposed project would build on lessons learned from the implementation o f environmental
 andNRMprojects inBrazil (see Annex 2 for a list o f these projects). Some o f the lessons that
 would be incorporatedinthe project are:

 Past Pevformanceof Projects in the Sector: Besides projects currently under implementation in
 S5o Paulo, Santa Catarina, Parank, and Rio Grande do Sul, inrecent decades the Bank has
 financed a series o fprojects that supported innovative technical approaches to soil conservation
 insouthern Brazil, including the Parank LandManagement IProject (Loan 3018-BR) andthe
 Santa Catarina Land Management I1Project (Loan 3160-BR). Both projects contributed to an
 increase inthe adoption o f improved practices, thereby increasingproductivity and reducing soil
 loss. LM11,whose objective was to increase agricultural production and productivity and which
 concentrated its efforts inareas with the highest susceptibility to soil erosion, also demonstrated

the effectiveness of aparticipatory, community-based approach to project implementationwith
the microcatchment as the physicalplanningunit.Inaddition, it motivated changes inthe models
o f agricultural research and the provision o frural support services toward more environmentally
friendly and participatory approaches.

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The project approach was chosen based on its complementarity with ongoing GoRJ and
nongovernment activities, its potentialto influence adoption o f the project strategy by such
ongoing efforts, and the potential for later replicability and scaling up o fpositive project
outcomes.

Altematives considered centered on addressing two categories o f issues: (i)   limitedhuman
capacity and weak community organization; and (ii)      limitedor nonexistentadoption o f
SLWIEMtechniques associated with the lack ofupfront investments to facilitate their adoption.
Originally, the project concept was designed to address the first set o f issues through GEF OP 12
(IEM).However, the approval o fGEF OP 15 (SLM) openedup additional possibilities to
address both capacity concems and significant barriers to the adoption o f SLM/IEMpractices
within the rubric o f GEF priorities including through on-the-ground investments,targeted
research, and mainstreaming o f S L M practices. Thus, the project team refocusedthe project as
an OP 12proposal with special relevance to OP 15.

The GEFproposalwas initially conceived as ablended operationto complement aproposed
Bank loan. However, due to the uncertain status o f State creditworthiness, the proposed Curta
Consulta to request Federal authorization to solicit Bank financing i s pending evaluation. The
Bank confirmed its unconditional support to the project given its strategic value within the
context o f similar activities supported by the Bank, the GEF, and other partners inthe region.
The Bank has also indicatedthat it would beprepared to negotiate a loan once the State has
secured Federal authorization to seek Bank support. Therefore, the current proposal i s for a
smaller project area than that originally envisioned inthe blendedoperation. However, inview o f
the improved macroeconomic situation and given GoRJ's firm interest ina Bank loan, the
project would emphasize activities that would provide the basis for the scaling-up and replication
o fproject activities, such as development o freplicable sustainable productionmodules, and the
disseminationo f experiences and lessons learned throughout the state.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements(if applicable)

The UnitedNations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) would assist inproject
implementation through the longstanding WB-FA0 Cooperative Program under which the FA0
provides technical assistance during the preparation and implementation o frural agricultural
investmentprojects.

Inaccordance with the World Bank strategy of working on aregionalapproach, all ongoing
Bank-financed microcatchment projects inthe South-Southeast Region o f Brazil are integrated
inan informal/technical manner. The proposedproject was integrated into this network during
thepreparation phase. Furthermore, the project fits well with the strategies o fother agencies



                                                  10

supporting Brazil and, inaddition to information exchanges, would coordinate with their
activities ina number o f concrete ways. These include coordinating with: (i) Pro-Mata    KfW's
Atlbntica Forest Program (PMAP) inthe Desengano Park by implementing S L M activities in
the Park's buffer zone, which i s located intwo o f the project's watersheds; (ii)          SOS/Mata
Atlhtica and CI-Brasil which would provide cofinancing and contribute to project
implementation through a variety o f activities including studies, training, andmonitoring
(including monitoring the change invegetation cover inPermanent Protected Areas); (iii)                  GEF
byworking closely with staff from the FUNBIOProject, bybuildingon the lessons and
experiences o f FUNBIO as a basis for the design o f a support systemfor sustainable agriculture
inthe SOW;GEF's Paran6 and SiloPaul0projects, where specific project activities identified
duringproject preparationcouldbenefitfrom the experience ofthese two projects, which are
also located inthe Atlantic Forest; and the GEF-funded Ecosystem Restoration o f Riparian
Forests in SZo Paul0 (WB as ImplementingAgency) and the Sustainable Land Management in
the Semi-Arid SertZo (IFAD as Executing Agency) on its payments for environmental services
scheme; and (iv) CEPF activities inthe project area.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements(See Annex 6 for details).
Inorder to enhance project impact and strengthen the long-termsustainabilityofproject results,
the design o f implementationarrangements has prioritized the involvement o f agencies and
institutions with a strong presence inthe region inproject-relevant activities.

SEAAPIwould be responsible for overall project management and implementation throughout
the project's five-year implementationperiod. However, it i s expected that municipal
govemments and a broad cross-section o f civil society would play an active role inthe GEF-
supported activities. A Project Management Unit (SEP) would be established through SEAAPI's
Microcatchment Directorate (SMH). Through SEP,SEAAPI, as the project executor, would sign
working agreements, as detailed inAnnex 6, with agencies and institutions with a strong
presence inthe region, for extension andresearch, monitoring, and other implementation support
activities.

Flow ofFunds andAccountabilities (SeeAnnex 7for details). A special account inU S dollars
would be opened for GEF funds. An operational account inReais would be opened to receive
GEF funds from the Special Account and to make the payments for the activities financed by
GEF.The operational account would not receive State counterpart funds, as the State wouldpay
directly from its own Treasury account for its share of the project's costs.

Fundswould betransferred from the Operational Account to FUNDES3to cofinance eligible
subprojects (subcomponent 2.1). These transfers would be made on the basis o f a Conve^nioor
Governor's Decree specifically to finance part o f the project.

SEP would manage and control the investment o f the project's financial resources. All budgeting
and financial transactions would have to be generated and incorporatedinto the State Budget and
Financial system-SIAFEM4.          To this end, SEP would liaise with SEAAPI's

AdministratiodFinancial Department to preparethe budgets and request the recording o f all
official documents requiredto make the payments. Counterpart fundingwould be bothincash
and inkind, and the FMsystem to be usedinthe project would have the capability to capture all
the different counterpart contributions. PRONAF credits to beneficiaries would be accounted in
the Management Information System (MIS) through copies o fthe financing contracts and Banco
do Brasil vouchers received via EMATER,the agent for this type o f financing.

3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results (see Annex 3for details)
The strategy developed for the project M&E systemincludes monitoring and evaluationo f
project impacts (including indicators for evaluation o f achievement of objectives and monitoring
o f outputs and outcomes), and tracking o f the physical and financial execution o f the project
through the installation and implementationo f an MIS. Where no baseline information exists,
studies would be undertaken duringPY1 to gather it. As project implementation progresses,
information drawn from the MIS system, a midtermevaluation, and field reports from the
participatorymonitoring activities would be usedto gauge progress toward achievement o f
project results and provide feedback relatedto the achievement o f desired project impacts, thus
helping improve project effectiveness.

SEP would be responsible for coordinatingmonitoring, with other agencies providing support
and technical assistance as necessary. Key groups o f stakeholders would also participate actively
indata collection and other sampling activities to monitor social andenvironmental aspectsof
theproject as part ofproject capacitybuildingand M&E.

A project portalwould be developed under subcomponent 3.1 to make all project-related
information easily accessible to policymakers on the project steering committees (and to the
general public). Inaddition, the steering committees would beprovided with project updates on a
regular basis which would include M&Einformation. This flow o f information would prove
particularly invaluable to the State Council o f Sustainable Rural Development (CEDRUS), the
project's external coordination forum, inits role infacilitating (i)
                                                                   project integration with the
overall rural development strategy inthe state and the country, and (ii) integration among partner
institutions and, inparticular, among the State and National programs that are relevant for
coordination and collaborationwith the proposed project.

4. Sustainability & Replicability
Indications of borrower and recipient commitment and ownership. Duringpreparation, the State
Government has shown its support through a number of concrete actions including complying
with all issues agreed inthe preparationmissions' Aide-MCmoires; rapidapproval o fthe law
which authorized receipt o f GEF Block B resources; mobilization o f various state agencies'
support; securing cofinancing for project preparation; efforts to systemize existing information;
and preliminary diagnostics and consolidationo f a georeferenced project database, with
resources from the State andpartners involved inthe project; and providing leadership during a
series o fproject preparation meetings and workshops with stakeholders. The GoRJ'ssignificant
level o f counterpart financing (US$6.31M, o fwhich US$4.00M incash) i s a clear indication o f
its commitment to project success.




                                                  12

Sustainability. Inaddition to borrower commitment and ownership, the following elements are key to
ensuring project sustainability over time: stakeholder awareness of, commitment to, and capacity for
improving environmental practices; strong institutions and policies committed to pursuingIEMand
SLM;andsustainable fundingbeyondtheproject's lifetime. Theproject approach would addressthese
elements by: (i)    creating a collective awareness o f global environmental issues and the importance o f
IEWSLMconcepts andpractices; (ii)             contributing to improved policy instrumentsand strengthened
institutions to facilitate future development and adoption o f IEMand S L M concepts and practices; (iii)
contributing to increasingthe incomes o f small farmers and their families by introducing new production
managementmodels, diversifying economic activities, and addingvalue to the production, processing,
and commercialization o f "environmentally friendly" products; (iv) complementing existing financial
mechanisms to cover transition costs from nonsustainable to sustainable livelihood activities as well as
support to the development o f long-term ways to facilitate this transition; and (v) facilitating increased
local empowerment and improvement o f the quality o f life o f smallholders by ensuringaccess to the
support provided by ongoing programs.

Replicability.The project information dissemination strategy would focus on knowledge transfer
and subsequently increasingthe potential for transferring experiences at the state, national, and
international levels and disseminating project lessons learned. Subcomponent 4.3 (Project
Dissemination) and activities insubcomponent 3.1 (Community Organization) specifically
address this issue. They would support the sharing o f information bothwithin and outside the
project area, involving those beneficiaries, people, communities, and institutions, govemmental
or not, who are interested inthe project and who could learn from and make use o f the
experience, expanding it and making the idea useful to the public throughout the Atlantic Forest
region and beyond, particularly to other countries in Latin America.

D.APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.Economicand financial analyses (SeeIncremental CostAnalysis in Annex 15)
Given the relatively modest investment o f GEF funds proposed, the project does not aim to
finance the actual large scale implementation o f IEMinthe project target area. The project
would be implementedas a pilot/demostrationproject, and would emphasize on-the-ground
actions that can be replicated, thereby providing the basis for scaling up project results and
promoting improved policymaking. Thus, while an Economic and Financial analysis would not
be applicable, the design initselfincludes cost effectiveness considerations to promote


                                                         14

maximumimplementation effectiveness, and replication and impact o fproject results bothwithin
and outside the project area.

The goal o f achieving cost effectiveness and maximum impact underlay the decision to fully
integrate project activities with complementary ongoing public and private efforts, including
those to supply financial support for improved production systems, and supply o f technical
assistancethrough well established mechanisms that would be supported by counterpart funds.
Cost effectiveness considerations also influenced the decisionon how to distribute the target
number o fpilot microcatchments for development o f environmentally and financially sound
demonstration models with maximumrepresentation o f the diversity found within the five
interventionwatersheds.

Financial sustainability. Project preparation included extensive discussions and studies on the
development o f strategies to ensure the long-term sustainability o fproject-financed activities. It
examined the existingincentive legislationand identifiedthe most appropriate mechanisms to be
usedfor the provision o fthe financial support proposed under Component 2 (Le., through the
State Social andEconomic Development Fund- FUNDES), which may provide the basis for
long-term support to overcome the financial constraints to the adoption of financially sustainable
IEWSLMpractices. The projectwould initially support practices that haveprovento be
financially sound and to provide win-win opportunities to beneficiaries and the environment, and
support adaptive research for new ones. A preliminaryanalysis shows that while selected crops
such as banana, passion fruit, pineapple, and tomatoes may yield an average 5 percent highernet
income under environmentally friendly production systems,they command an average 38
percent higher production cost which represents a significant constraint to the adoption o f the
enhanced production system.

The project would also support (under Component 1)the development o f a proposal for the
creation o f a PES scheme to enhance financial sustainability beyond project implementation.

2. Technical
The project's technical design is based on the foundationprovided bythe socioeconomic and
environmental studies undertakenduringpreparation. The methodology adopted by these studies
identifiedthe relevant environmental issues, their consequences, andkey constraints to be
overcome, inorder to design the most appropriate way for the project to address them. Key
issues inthis regard inthe Brazilian context, relevant to the NNWF, center on the relationship
among smallholder agriculture, environmental concerns, and rural poverty. Key constraints and
theproject activities that address each one are outlined indetail inAnnex 4.

3. Fiduciary(SeeAnnexes 7 and 8for more information on the Financial Management and
Procurement Assessments, respectively)

InMarch2002, a financial management risk assessmentwas carriedout for the PDFBlock B
Grant. This FMAssessment was reviewed and expanded inDecember 2004 andMarch 2005 with
the objective of determiningwhether the financial management and disbursementsarrangements
proposed by the Grantee-the     State o fRio de Janeiro-through   its Implementing Agency would
be acceptable to the Bank once they are inplace and fully operational.



                                                 15

The FMassessment concluded that the proposed financial management arrangements for the
project would satisfy the Bank's minimumrequirements and that the proposed financial
management systems would effectively control andmonitor the project andprovide with
reasonable assurance, accurate andtimely information on the progress o fproject implementation.

The FM assessment rated the Financial Management risk associated with the project as
substantial and recommended that project implementation and counterpart funding be closely
monitored in order to mitigate this risk. It further recommended that audit o f project accounts be
procured following Bank guidelines and that audit costs be included in the Bank's financing
portion. The implementation o f the Action Plan and the Procurement Plan discussed inAnnex 8,
along with the centralization o f financial management and procurement activities within SEP,
would help minimize existing risks.


4. Social (See summary of social assessment in Annex 18)
While environmental awareness and concem have been growing incommunities inrecent years,
a major challenge for the project would be to overcome traditional resistance to the introduction
of new technologies and practices, which inturn i s derivedfrom cultural factors, risk aversion,
and previous, less than positive experiences with more traditional top-down models o frural
extension. However, it i s important to work with communities to overcome this challenge
especially in light o f the social assessment's conclusion that many traditional productive
activities have destructive effects on the environment due to inadequate soil preparation and poor
land management techniques. The project would seek to overcome this traditional resistance by
utilizing a highlyparticipatory and agroecological approach to extension, which would
emphasize the strengthening o f local organizations, equality o f leaming exchanges with farmers,
and empowerment.

Stakeholder Participation. Stakeholders would include national andbeneficiary stakeholders.
National stakeholders would comprise the following: state institutions (Environment,
Agriculture, Water Resources, Public Defender's Office, and Universities); federal institutions
(EMBRAPA,National Water Agency, Ministries of Environment andAgrarian Development,
and universities); municipal organizations (Sustainable Rural Development Councils, Municipal
Secretariats o fAgriculture and Environment), national and local NGOs; and the private sector.
Key beneficiaries would include small- and medium-size farmers, rural youth, school teachers,
and community leaders.

Duringproject preparation, national andbeneficiary stakeholders were identified and
participated innumerous consultations associated with the Socioeconomic and Environmental
Diagnostic Studies and the Social Assessment. Inaddition, the project team organized a series o f
project preparation meetings and workshops with key state, municipal, and beneficiary
stakeholders. Duringproject implementation, national stakeholders would participate through
representation on the Project Steering Committees (external coordination forums) to be
established at state, regional, municipal, and microcatchment levels (see Annex 6). Inaddition,
participation o fkey municipal and beneficiary stakeholders and NGOs would be ensured through
project support for two major activities: (i) participation inthe review and updating o f existing
Watershed Management Strategies (WMSs) which were prepared, with stakeholder involvement,


                                                  16

duringproject formulation; and (ii)   preparation and collective implementationo f PEMs. The
preparation o f PEMs and endorsement o f group and individual PID-based subproject proposals
stemming from the PEMswould be carried out by new or existing microcatchment groups,
consisting o f local stakeholders.

Participation of Civil Society. Key stakeholders (national and state agencies, producer
representatives, NGOs) were involved inthe discussion and preparation o f the initialproject
concept, consultative workshops, anddevelopment o f criteria for selection o fproject areas.
Further collaboration withNGOs andproducer groups organizations wouldtake place: (i)        as
intermediaries between govemment and beneficiaries inimplementation o f field activities; (ii)   in
M&E activities; and (iii)  through the existing coordination mechanisms that would be capitalized
upon by the project, particularly the State and Municipal Rural Development Councils
(Municipal Councils are the advisory bodies o f the PRONAF project). Inaddition, two NGOs-
SOS MataAtlAntica and CI-Brasil-which        participatedinthe preparationo f the Socioeconomic
and Environmental Diagnostic Studies and related Watershed Strategies, are proposedinthe
project management structure as project executors/partners.

Social Issues Important in the Project. There will be some differential access to project benefits.
Based on the type o fproducer (e.g., size o f landholding, market-oriented or family farmer) as
well as the category o f subproject chosen, the maximum amount o fproject support would vary.
These guidelines have been adopted to ensure support to individuals who most needit (thusthe
decision not to provide financial support to larger farm holdings), while at the same time,
through the capacity-building, proposal, and selection processes, ensuring that grantees have the
capacity to develop and implement successful, replicable subprojects. Nonetheless, all those
living inthe selected microcatchmentswould benefit from the project inthe form o f improved
management o f the microcatchments' natural resource base and through the eventual scaling up
o f the project strategy and activities.

Monitoring of Social Impacts. The proposed approach for the project M&E system includes
measurements o f impacts on people and on institutional performance. Social and economic
baseline informationhas beendeveloped for the MIS for purposes o f periodic tracking and
monitoring. Local stakeholders would participate incarrying out some aspects o f monitoring and
analysis.

Inaddition, theproject's Annual OperatingPlans (POAs) wouldbepreparedbySEP and
submittedto the Bank for no objection. Semi-annual progress reports would be preparedand
submittedto the Bank inadvance o fBank supervision missions andwould be combined into a
single Annual Progress Report. A MidtermReview (MTR) and ImplementationCompletion
Report (ICR) would be carried out, at which time stakeholder workshops would be heldto share
and review project progress and outcomes/impacts, including social outcomes. When necessary,
modifications based on monitoring and evaluationrecommendations would be made to the
Project Operational Manual.

5. Environment
Environmental Issues Important in the Project. Enhancing livelihoods o fthe poor through
improved management o fnatural resources i s an integral element o f the project design. The

project's organization and capacity buildingcomponent i s designed to increase community
organization and the ability for self-management o f natural resources. Through this component
as well as through the adoption o f sustainable SLMactivities plannedunder the PIDs,
beneficiaries would be trained inimproved management and acquire on-the-ground experience
inactivities designedto conserve natural resources while simultaneously improving livelihoods.

Environmental Rating: B-Partial Assessment
The Project is designated a CategoryBproject, based on the above assessment o fpotential
impacts. OnJuly 24,2003, the Bank PCD (which forms the basis for this document) was
reviewedby the QAT, which agreed with the proposed environmental Category B and S2
safeguard ratings, and confirmed that the project designdid not trigger any o f the Bank's social
safeguards. The QAT also agreed that the project would be highlypositive from an
environmental standpoint ifimplementedas planned. For details regarding the triggering o f
safeguard policies concerning Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats, Pest Management,
andForests, see Annex 10. All relevant QAT documents can be found inthe project files.

Proiect Compliance with applicable safeguard policies
Environmental Assessment. The project was classified as a Category B. It was designed to
ensure compliance with the requirements o f the Bank umbrella policy on Environmental
Assessment (OP 4.01). Despite the largely positive or neutral project impacts anticipated,
submission o f an EA and EMPwas considered prudentto ensure conformity with OP 4.01. The
GoRJsubmittedthe final draft EMEMPreport inNovember 2004. This draft was then submitted
to the LCSES QAT for review on January 21,2005.

Natural Habitats. The project would support natural habitat conservation and improved landuse
by integrating the conservationo fnatural habitats and the maintenance o f ecological functions
into regional development programs and bypromoting the rehabilitation o f degraded natural
habitats. Project activities would not significantly modify or degrade natural habitats. Interms o f
policy dialogue, the project would assist the GoRJinincorporating an analysis o f any major
natural habitat issues into its rural development strategies, including identification o f important
natural habitat sites, the ecological functions they perform, the degree o f threat to the sites,
priorities for conservation, and associated recurrent funding and capacity buildingneeds.

   BRAZIL: Rio de JaneiroSustainableIntegratedEcosystemManagementin Production
                     Landscapes of the North-NorthwesternFluminense(GEF)
Bio-Phvsical Characteristics of the Project Area
The Atlantic Forest is one o fthe five biodiversity "hottest hotspots" among the world's 25 top
priority conservation areas, and the State o fRio de Janeiro holds the highestpercentage of
Atlantic Forest with respect to total area among all o fthe country's states. Within the State, the
most threatened fraction o fprimary vegetation can be found inthe North and Northwestern
Fluminense administrative regions (NNWF). Together these two regions encompass 22
municipalities and an area o f 15,000 km2, with an altitude ranging from sea level to 1,750 mas1
which inpart contributes to the diversehabitats and richbiodiversity o f the regions, which are
characterized by a number o f distinct natural aquatic and terrestrial habitats, endemic
biodiversity andthe occurrence o fthe Brazilian Coastal Atlantic forests and the Brazilian
Interior Atlantic forests, two o fthe 55 ecoregions inthe L A C region designated as maximum
prioirity for biodiversity conservation. Several species o fplants, birds and fishare endemic to the
NNWF regions.'
Two major typologies o f forest formations are found inthe NNWF regions,
dryldeciduouslseasonal and humidlombrophyle forests. Seasonal deciduous formations include
fragments o f tableland forests inthe NorthFluminense, with the best preservedbeingMata do
C a w l o inthe municipality o f S5o Francisco do Itabapoana, whose drainage constitutes one o f
the watersheds targeted by the project. This areawas identifiedas being ofhighbiological
importance byNational Program for Biological Diversity (PRONABIO) due to its populations o f
the red-browed Amazon parrot. The last tableland forest within the territory of the State, this area
is considered the boundary for the distribution o f Amazon rainforest plant species, with wood
species such asperoba beingimportant for conservation purposes. This classification also
includes semi-deciduous dry forest to the North/Northwest o f the edges o fDesengano State Park,
inthe municipalitiesofCampos and S2o Fidklis, runningalongthe boundariesofthe statesof
Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo. Formations to the Northwest inLaje do Muriak and Miracema
were listed by PRONABIO as being highly important because they are home to the globally
endangered speciesplumbeous antviveo and the buffy tufted-ear marmoset.
Humidformations encompass the edges o fDesengano State Park to the south inthe watersheds
of the ImbCandMacabu Rivers.The region also contains the variations inaltitude existing in
this typology, encompassing marshy (alluvial) forest and lowland forests up to cloud formations
and altitude "fields." The amount o f area covered i s residual at low altitudes, increasing as the
terrain becomes dynamic and unsuitable for agricultural use. These areas are o f extreme
biological importance, with over 18 species o f globally endangered animal species6.The
watershed o fthe Doce River is a plant mosaic o f small marshlands and forest regenerations o f
vestinga and dry forest. Waterlogged areas form part o fthe lagoon complex o f the North


 For example, a number o f endemic fish species which survive inthe dried mud for long periods o f drought,
endemic species of orchids, bromeliads and other plant species, endangered birds, endemic and endangered species
o fprimates, arboreal species o f Amazonian genera distributed throughout Brazil, andrare endangeredplant species,
including the Brazil wood (after which the country i s named), as well as five o f the seven mangrove species
occurring inBrazil.
 This includes the maned three-toed sloth, the wooly spider monkey, the red-browed Amazonparrot, the black-
headed berryeater and the solitary tinamou.

Fluminense, important as a restingand feedingplace for northern migratory birds such as
maqaricos (shore birds) and marrecas (wild ducks). Inaddition to forest habitats, this region
holds one o fthe best-preserved restingas o f Brazil (Jurubatiba),which also supports important
endemic populations. The Jurubatiba National Park i s considered a refuge for species already
extinct inother regions o f Rio de Janeiro state where restingas are degraded or have already
disappeared.
Inadditiontowildanimalandplantbiodiversity, theregion's smallholderagriculturesector
constitutes a rich source o f agro-biodiversity insubsistence crops such as manioc, sweet potato,
corn, beans and rice. Due to tradition and their relative geographic isolation, some rural
communities maintain rare varieties o f such crops that may be resistant to emerging pests and
diseases.
The Atlantic forest also plays an important role inthe global carbon cycle. The total land area
under the remaining Brazilian Atlantic forest i s about 8 million hectares (of which 841,000 ha
are located inthe Rio de Janeiro State). The protection o f this forest would serve to store a
significant amount o f carbon and thus reduce the net emissionrate o f C 0 2 into the atmosphere.
Inadditionto the forest, other naturalsystemsandproductivelandscapes(e.g., landssubjectto
such sustainable agriculture practices as crop rotation, mulching, no-tillage, etc.) and improved
agro-sylvo-pastoral systems, can make substantial contributions to carbon storage. According to
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the net annual gain incarbon
sequestration from e.g., improved grazing land management, or from land-usechange to
agroforestry, exceeds the potential gain from other improved land management or land-use
change options, including forest management and rice paddies.
Biodiversitv Threats
Considered one o fthe three most threatened ecosystems on Earth, Brazil's Atlantic Forest has
beenreduced to less than 7.5 percent o f its original area o f 110millionha. The major threats to
Brazil's Atlantic Forest are deforestation (for logging and charcoal production) and agricultural
expansion. A recent study carried out by the FundaqEo SOS MataAtlsntica (the mainNGO
acting for the protection o fthe forest) in collaboration with the National Institute for Space
Research (INPE), identified an area o f deforestation amounting to an estimated 1,000,000 ha
between 1990 and2000. Duringthis time, the State o fRio de Janeiro had the highest
deforestation rate (16.7 percent) o f the nine states studied, almost 40 percent higherthan that o f
the second-ranked state. Moreover, the NNWFare the State's administrative regions that suffered
the most deforestation over this period o ftime.

Despite the characteristic richness o fthe region's agrobiodiversity, the smallholder agricultural
sector also poses a threat to the biome's biodiversity. The major threats associated with the
smallholder agriculture are: (i)  deforestation o f the floodplain forests and grasslands attributable
to the introduction o f conventional monocropping agriculture (mainly sugar cane), and
consequent loss o f soil fertility and soil erosion; (ii)deforestation o f the remaining tropical semi-
deciduous forests associated with the advance o f the agricultural frontier into marginal areas
(slash and burn, fuelwood and logging), and subsequent erosion o f agricultural lands (mainly due
to overgrazing); (iii)unsustainable and illegal forest exploitation (fuelwood, logging and
extraction o f ornamental species andherbs) and poaching (as a means o f complementing the diet
of rural families) inthe remaining tropical moist broadleaf forests and montane grasslands; (iv)
deforestation o frestingas (sand formations) andmangroves and subsequent advance o f the



                                                   21

agriculture frontier into these and other coastal ecosystems, through the introduction o f irrigated
horticulture by small farmers; and (v) inappropriate agricultural practices leading to loss insoil
biodiversity.

Socioeconomic Consequences
One major factor which has contributed to the present situation are past rural policies, which
were historically aimed at assigning priority to mono cropping o f coffee and sugar cane and
extensive cattle-raising. Smallholder agriculture inthe NNWF i s suffering the effects o f these
policies that have significantly increased rural poverty inthe region.

With its decline, the environmental andsocioeconomic consequenceso fmonocropping became
clearer. This situation i s evidenced by the precarious nature o fbasic infrastructure, highdegree
o f erosion, lack of rural sanitation, progressive decline infamily income, persistent illiteracy, and
intensification o f the rural exodus. The incidence o fpoverty among rural households inthe State
o f Rio de Janeiro i s about 27 percent (440,000 people), or about 2.5 times the poverty levels
found inurbanareas. This percentage increases to 35-39 percent insome municipalities inthe
NNWFregions ofthe State, levels similar to those found insome ofthe poorest parts ofthe
country (e.g., the Northeast). With regard to environmental degradation, the Northwest region in
particular exhibits dramatic environmental degradation, with generalized removal o f forest cover,
even in a large part o f the mountain areas, a situation that i s aggravated by the insufficient and
irregular rainy season, which causes severe water deficits. It shouldbe noted that 80 percent o f
this region's landhas suffered amoderate to severe degree of erosion, with frequent occurrence
of deep rills andmoderately deep gullies throughout the rural landscape.

The loss o fthe original vegetation cover inthese regions and unmanaged occupation o fland
have resulted inmillions o f hectares o f impoverished soils. It has also resulted inthe loss o f
habitat for native fauna and has disrupted the water flow levels inwatersheds, which i s thought
to have contributed to an increase inflooding, changes inthe dynamics o f water springs and
alterations inthe local climate. Another effect o f deforestation has been the decrease incarbon
stocks inthe soil and the biomass. Soil fertility has fallen abruptly, and consequently so has
productivity, generating a movement to clear additional forested area to increase productivity
rapidly, ifunsustainably. Slash andburn, which is unsustainable inlight o f land fragmentation
and diminishingforested lands, i s the only "technology" adopted by rural communities as a
means o f compensating for soil acidity and low fertility.

SEAPPi i s focusing on reverting the environmental and social consequences o f past
developments efforts through new instrumentsthat focus on diversification and enhanced
economic sustainability o fproductive endeavors. Although issues o f sustainability and natural
resources management are explicitly identified as significant elements o f SEAAPI's rural
development projects, the activities undertaken so far have generally targeted the farm or sub-
community levels, with little effort to link these activities within a broader planning framework
based on an ecosystem approach. However, based on experience gained from natural resource
management projects inother regions inBrazil, the State Government recognizes the need and
the value o fusingintegrated and cross-sectoral approaches that would lead to sustainable
landscapes and support the implementation o f sustainable rural development activities, adopting
the microcatchment as a physical unit for planningpurposes.



                                                   22

The strategic focus o fthe proposed project would beto develop mechanisms that would
complement specific components o fprojects already underway. These incremental activities
would introduce a broader, ecosystem-focused approach to development. Because it i s expected
that many o f the investmentactivities have the potential to produce local as well as global
benefits, GEF fundingwould be limited to developing the enabling conditions (information,
experimentation, collective action, access to technical assistance and inputs, monitoring and
evaluation) that would allow farmers to make more informed decisions on management systems
capable o freducing biodiversity loss and land degradation.
 Project interventions would take place at three levels:

(0      Watershed level: including: development o fwatershed management strategies; support to
       the implementation o f the Serra do Mar biodiversity corridor inthe NNWF; and
       monitoring and evaluation andproject dissemination;

(ii) Municipallevel:wherethefollowingactivitiesareproposedforthe24municipalities

       an support system for SLM;

(iii) Microcatchmentlevel:inPY1approximately50pilotmicrocatchmentswithinthefive
       project watersheds would be selected (covering 15 percent o f the total watershed area).
       Within these target microcatchments, on a demonstrative basis, activities would include
       the development and implementationo fMicrocatchment Development Plans (PEMs) and
       Individual/Farm-level Development Plans (PIDs); and financial support for the adoption
       o f improvedmanagement practices; applied research to support the adaptation o f existing
       soil management practices and technological solutions to local agro-ecological
       conditions; training o fproducers and other local stakeholders. The provision o f financial
       support (credits and grants for technical assistance and small investments) would be
       demand-drivenand a consequence o fthe PEMs andrelated individuaMhematic plans.


Selection of target watersheds and microcatchments. Targeting o f project watersheds and
microwatersheds i s based on the application o f criteria that combines social and environmental
considerations.
Watershed selection criteria include: environmentally sensitive or critical areas, particularly
those which are highly vulnerable to erosion; land use patterns; presence and size o f sites
considered national conservation priorities; presence of Protected Areas; natural vegetation
cover; rural poverty; percentage o f rural population; and the percentage o f small producers
among all producers.
Microcatchment selection criteria include: significance o f the microcatchment's biodiversity;
presence o f springs or other sources o f surface or ground water critical to the protection o f the
microcatchment; concentration o f small producers; existing level o f community organization;
and land use and soil management aspects.

                        Monitoringand EvaluationAspects of the Project
Theproject's M&E systemwould use participatory mechanisms to enable stakeholders to share
their feedback. SEP would beresponsible for coordinatingmonitoring, with EMATERandother
co-executing agencies providing support and technical assistance as necessary. Key groups o f
stakeholders, particularly those small farmers living inthe pilot microcatchments, would also
participate actively indata collection and other sampling activities to monitor social and
environmental aspects o f the project.

Inadditionto supporttomonitoringandevaluation ofresultsandimpacts, theprojectwouldalso
include the installation and implementation o f a Management Information System (MIS) to track
the physical and financial execution o fthe project. To facilitate interfacebetweenthe project,
service providers and beneficiaries, the project M I S would be web-basedand designed to be
performance-oriented and user-friendly.Inaddition, given the decentralized nature o f the project,
and to ensure timely budgetaryand expenditure information to the Bank and other stakeholders,
the MIS would incorporate internal controls, records o fproject assets, procurement, accounting,
auditing and means to reconcile the project's Special Account that would conform with the
Bank's Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing Handbook (1995), the Bank's Operation
Policy and Procedures 10.02 (July 1996) and revised financial management standards as in
OP/BP 10.02 (August 1997). The MIS designwould also include the following capabilities:

    0   Reporting from project staff (particularly extensionists) who would monitor the
        implementation o fproductive, social, and environmental improvements;
    0   Reports from beneficiaries, inparticular communities and rural producers;
    0   Recording o f all planned and executed activities (physical, financial, andprocurement
        information), in accordance with the directives inthe Operational Manual, at all levels
        (state, regional, municipal, and microcatchment);
    0   Financial Management Reports (FMR) from periodic audits and other relevantPMRs;
        and
    0   Partner and independent institutions that would undertake project impact evaluations.

Monitoring results would be inserted into the MIS, thus allowing a real-time tracking o f
microcatchmentplans and related subprojects beingimplemented on the ground.


Giventhat Component 2 constitutes the bulk o fproject expenditures (US$8.80 million), with a
GEF contribution o fUS$2.92 million, the monitoring o fthis component would bemore detailed
and intense. Based on input and output indicators, the monitoring activities would track a number
of features related to the implementation o f subprojects financed under this component. Progress
reports specific for the support system would be available for the various features that may be
deemed necessary, e.g., by geographical distribution, land surface, etc.

Inadditionto physicaVproject-based and financial monitoring andrelatedMIS,the M&E
subcomponent (subcomponent 4.2) would also support the continuous qualitative monitoring o f
socioeconomic and environmental aspects inpilot monitoring microcatchments. It would include
monitoring o f (i)water quality and quantity; (ii) other environment-related indicators:
vegetation cover, pesticide use reduction, soil-water content, soil biodiversity, and adoption o f


                                                 35

agriculture conservation practices by farmers; (iii)socioeconomic aspects (see Appendix 1to this
Annex for social indicators): effective participation and empowerment o f communities in
project-related decisionmakingprocess, farmers' perceptions o f environmental issues,
improvement infamily living conditions; and (iv) additional qualitative and quantitative
parameters to compute the economic value o f external impacts o f S L M (both national and global
impacts), such as the value of increased C02 stored, reduced sedimentation, reduced threats to
biodiversity, reduced pesticide runoff and other environmentalimpacts on downstreamusers.

Moreover, M&E would involve two levels: intemal and external. At the first level, rural
communities andproducers organizations within each o fthe selected microcatchmentswould
assess the implementationo fproject activities at the microcatchment level, and evaluate the
achievement o f objectives and environmental impacts (on water and soil quality, presence o f
wildlife, etc.).

At the second level, progress reports (or PMRs) would beprepared at least twice a year as an
input for the project manager's supervision. This external evaluationwould include:
determination o f benefitsprovided by the project interms o f quantity and quality, effect o f the
project on community organizations, the level o f awareness o f sustainable land management (and
global environmental issues) and adoption o f new technologies.

In addition, specific input, output and impact indicators would be reviewed by the benefited
communities upon selection o fmicrocatchmentsinPY1.However, a number o f social
development indicators have been identified duringproject preparation (see Appendix 1to this
Annex). They are the basis for measuringthe broader indicators o f social impact o f the project
specified inthe Results Framework.

Finally, project impact evaluations would complement the above-mentioned monitoring
activities (which would allow the measurement o f actual performancewith expected
performance) by measuring the effectiveness o f actual performance (Le., impact), hence
providing feedback and helpingimprove the effectiveness o f the project.

M&Ewould include ex-ante (year l),mid-term (year 3) and ex-post (year 5) evaluations and
Bank supervision missions, the latter o fwhichwould review project implementation at least
every six months on the basis o f approved annual operatingplans and semi-annual progress
reports.

                          Annex 3: Appendix 1:Indicators of SocialImpact

Specific input, output and impact indicators would be reviewedby the benefited communities
upon selection o f microcatchmentsinPY1. However, the following monitoring indicators are
recommended, as a result o f consultations made duringproject preparation. They are the basis
for measuringthe broader indicators o f social impact o f the project specified inthe Results
Framework:

        Numbero f farms adopting socio-environmentally suitable naturalresources
    management practices and productions systems (changes inthe pattem o f soil use
    and production techniques);
        Number of "demonstration units"implementedand intensityo fthe process o f
    locally replicating these endeavors;
        Increase inthe marketing o fproducts with certifications o f origin;
        Changes inagricultural and livestock yields;
        Income generated by on-farm (agricultural and livestock) and off-farm activities;
        Changes inaccess to and demand for technical assistance;
        Changes insocially-shared perceptions regarding rural areas (from a view that
    these areas are experiencing decay, lack o f opportunities to earn a living, and
    abandonment, to a view that that they are good places to work and live);
        Changes insocially sharedperceptions regarding environmental protection
    policies: (a) from a perception that government agencies are punitive, to one in
    which they are educational and collaborative; and (b) from a view that local
    stakeholders are hurtby environmental protection policies, to a view that
    stakeholders can take an active role inthese policies;
        Increase inlocal populations' participation ingrassroots community organizations
    (size o f institutional network, quality or intensity o fparticipation, engagement in
    community activities related to decisionmaking and social control o fpublic policies,
    etc.).


Inaddition, a specific set o fmonitoringindicators7hasbeendevelopedfor M&E ofthe
strengthening o f local organizations for improved sustainable self management o fnatural
resources (see Subcomponent 3.1). It includes a series o f monitoring indicators focused on
environmentalperceptions and actions, socioeconomic indicators, economic viability o f
activities, degree of participation, self-management and collective action, and decisionmaking.
These indicators are included to allow for relatively frequent and close monitoring o f the process
o f social change, specifically attitudinal and socioeconomic and environmental related
behavioral change, that would intum provide feedback allowing for adjustments and
modifications inproject activities as specific challenges or obstacles are identified, and for

  BRAZIL:Rio de JaneiroSustainableIntegratedEcosystemManagementinProduction
                   Landscapes of the North-NorthwesternFluminense(GEF)

Project components have been designed to directly address, as outlined below, each o f the
following constraints which limit or prevent the adoption o f improved SLM approaches thereby
affecting the integrity and stability o f the Atlantic Forest ecosystems and associated agro-
ecosystems: These constraints and project strategies to address them include:

(i)insufjcient human and institutional capacity and community organization to create the
enabling environment needed to support IEM and SLM to address land degradation at the local
and state levels: the capacity to overcome this knowledgebarrier would be built through education
and training o fproject executors (subcomponent 3.2) andbeneficiaries (subcomponent 3.3) which
would also be directedtoward the provision o ftraining and technical assistance necessary for
effective on-the-ground investmentsinconcrete projects inthe community (component 2);
institutional and community-level capacities would be improvedthrough various project
interventions: under subcomponent 1.1,the project would develop studies to enhance the incentive
framework andcarry out detailed planning for specific IEMactivities (e.g., a biodiversity corridor
and updates to watercatchment plans to improve them and align them with an IEMapproach); also,
through subcomponent 3.1,the project would seek to foster community organization through
training and the application o f an innovative multidisciplinary methodology (incubation) designed
specifically to strengthen local organizations; the project would also assist rural extension agents to
mainstream an IEMapproach into EMATER's extension work (subcomponent 1.2).

(ii) ofproducers'financialcapacitytoundertakeheavyupfrontinvestmentsnecessaryto
    lack
adopt the existing, but limited, S L M pilot experiences that, ifexpanded, could promote
permanent public policies to support IEM/SLM inthe Atlantic Forest ecoregion: To overcome
this financial barrier, the project would support the strengthening of the existing incentive
structure (subcomponent 1.1)' including designinga Payment for Environmental Services (PES)
proposal for one or more environmental services identified inthe project area for possible future
implementation; under subcomponent 2.1,the project would provide matching grants to small
farmers and other eligible ecosystem managers to move from conventional, unsustainable
smallholder agriculture to sustainable livelihood activities (SLM practices) which enhance
biodiversity and carbon sequestration inthe agricultural landscape;

(iii) numberof IEM/SLMpracticesadaptedtothespecijkagro-ecologicalconditionsof
     limited
the NNWF area: On a demand-driven basis, the project would support the development o f
farmers' adaptive field research trials (subcomponent 2.2) to tailor the existing stock o f cost
effective technical solutions for IEM/SLMpractices to the specific conditions o f the region
while at the same time lowering the relative weight o fupfront investments.




                                                    39

 (iv) insufficient systematized data and information necessayfor decisionmakers to incorporate
ecosystem-level considerations intoproduction activities: The project would address this
constraint through the implementation o f a systemto monitor and evaluate project impacts,
including GIS tools to support planning and monitoring (subcomponent 4.2); it would also
implementa strategy to disseminate project results and lessons-learned (subcomponent 4.3) and
implement a communication system for community networking, to allow exchange and
dissemination o f project information and coordination with ongoing programs at the state,
regional and local levels (subcomponent 4.1).

 Component1-Planningfor IntegratedEcosystemManagementActions(US$0.94 million,
 6.0 percent o f total project cost)

 This component is intendedat providing national stakeholders (state institutions) and
 beneficiary stakeholders (producers and rural communities at large), with a strengthened
 framework at state and local levels to support IEMapproaches aimed at promoting sustainable
 rural development andthe protection o f critical ecosystems.
The main subcomponents and activities foreseen (described below) cover support for a
strengthenedsupport framework andplanning for IEM,the former as studies and the latter as
action planning o f IEM/SLMactivities to be carried out inComponent 2. Activities o f ongoing
programs insupport o f this component would include those by the State Rural ExtensionRegular
Program (executed by EMATER) and others inbiodiversity conservation, protected areas,
environmental legislation enforcement and environmental monitoring.

 Subcomvonent 1.1:Strengthening of IEMIncentive Structure and Ecosystem Planning Systems
 (US$O.lS million, 0.9 percent o f total project cost). SEP would have overall responsibility for
 the implementation o f this subcomponent. It would support studies and workshops to provide
 inputs to develop the basis for strengtheningo f existing incentive and planning structures for
 sustainable landand ecosystem management inthe NNWF. Specifically, it would support the
 development o f the following activities:
a)       Design of an enhancedfinancial support systemfor sustainable land management to
facilitate sustainability o f financial support systems beyond the project period. It would promote
alternative sustainable funding options for selected services bybuildingupon existing financial
mechanisms, as well as by developing new ones, to channel funds to farmers for the adoption o f
on-and-off-farm practices which enhance the conservationand sustainable use o fwatershed
resources, foster biodiversity and increase carbon sequestration.

At one level, enhancement o f supply and demand of financial support for IEM/SLMthrough
ongoing programs would be sought. Buildingon project on-the-ground participatory planning
activities (subcomponent 1.2), a higher, more rational demand for credit and other sources o f
fundingto support the implementation o fIEM-related SLMpractices would bepromoted,
Buildingonproject experiences with current govemment financial services and credit lines such
as PRONAF, Moeda Verde, andRio Rural, development o f guidelines for improved institutional
and technical arrangements for the long-term support o f IEM/SLMpracticesby those and
possibly other programs would be carried out.




                                                    40

On another level, an option identifiedduringproject preparation is the design o f a Payment for
Environmental Services (PES) proposal for one or more potential services identified inthe
project area, including a PES for biodiversity protection, carbon sequestration and/or for water
protection services, for possible future implementation. Such a system might include: i)a
mechanism to disburse financial incentives related to the level o f environmental services
provided by sustainable landuse practices which address land degradation, water and/or
biodiversity issues; and ii)on a pilot basis, support to the preparation o f selected carbon projects
on a demand drivenbasis, inline with preparation guidelines o f the potential carbon buyer
(predominantly international private sector and NGOs); and iii)market assessment studies for
developing commodity markets for indigenous (medicinal plants) and organic products.

b)      Development of a study to identifi specijk actions, institutional arrangements and
monitoring tools to support implementation of the Serra do Mar Biodiverisity Corridor in the
project area. The implementation o fthe resulting plan, to be carried out by Conservation
Intemationa1,would be supported by project activities inother subcomponents, including:
training by CI-Brad o f about 180project technicians inbiodiversity conservation strategies,
with a specific module for biodiversity corridor and connectionof forest fragments; and
providing training ,technical assistance and grants to beneficiaries in support o fbiodiversity-
related activities inmicrocatchments located at the Corridor area, including activities to
rehabilitate degraded riparian forests, hilltops to connect fragments, and to protect water
springs. Inaddition, through the support to the preparation and implementationo f Statutes o f
Community Conduct for the Responsible Use o fNR - ECCs (subcomponent 1.2), the project
would promote full compliance with environmental legislation, including those regulations
related to control o f illegal poaching andforest fire.

 The project activities insupport o f the corridor would complement the above mentioned Pro-
Atlantic Forest Program and the CI-Brasil executed CEPF, which provide technical assistance to
establish private protectedareas, and support studies and research for in-situ conservation o f
threatened species.

c)      Update andfine-tuning of Watershed Management Strategies (WMSs) in theJive priority
watersheds. Five W M S s developed duringproject preparation would be updatedbased on the
outcomes o f the 20 Microcatchment Development Plans (PEMs) to be developed duringPY1
(Subcomponent 1.2); and

d)       Land suitability analysis at the microcatchment level as a contribution to improve
livelihoods and to protect ecosystem stability, functions and services. This studywould be
carried out intwo microcatchments with existing Agrarian Reform Settlements.


Subcomponent 1.2: Local Land Management Planning. (US$0.78 million, 5.1 percent o f total
project cost). This subcomponent, to be implementedby EMATER and the Public Defender's
Office, would orient intervention efforts and the adjustment of conduct by rural producers
regardingpreservationo f natural resources and ecosystem management. Implementation of these
activities would be done with ample participation o f rural communities, seeking their
involvement inall phases o fproject execution. Activities under this subcomponent would cover
50 microcatchments and would include: (i)     formulation o f Microcatchment/Community


                                                  41

Development Plans (PEMs); (ii)      preparation o f Individual/Farm-based Land Use Plans (PIDs), a
number o fwhich will be selected for implementationas subprojects undertheproposed project;
(iii)participatory preparation and implementation o f Statutes o f Community Conduct for the
Responsible Use o fNatural Resources (ECCs) to promote community participation inlegislation
enforcement by implementing ECCs inten o f the project selected microcatchments.

Responsibilities for preparation, approval and implementation of PEMs. For each
 microcatchment, a draft PEMs would beprepared by the 1ocaVmicrocatchment EMATER
 technician, and presented to COGEM for discussion and endorsement. The endorsed PEM
 would be submittedby the local EMATERoffice to the concerned SER for analysis and
 consolidation o f the plan. SER would submit the consolidated PEMs to COREM for review and
 approval. Approved PEMs would be sent to SEP for inclusion inthe pipeline.PEMs would be
 collectively implementedby the microcatchmentbeneficiaries, and monitored by SER. With
regardto PIDs developed underthe PEMs, responsibilitiesfor their selection and approval are
presented below (subcomponent 2.1)

Responsibilities for theformulation of ECCs. The formulation o f ECCs (and related capacity
building)would beunderthe responsibility o fthe Public Defender's Office inclose coordination
with the COGEM.and technical support from the local EMATERtechnician responsible for
facilitating the PEMformulation process. The ECCs would be formulated with and validated by
the microcatchment stakeholders, who would commit to adopting these actions over time. The
ECCs would include, e.g., measures to improve biodiversity conservation, adopt sustainable land
management and prevent and control water pollution. These measures would be initially
identifiedby the communities duringthe PEMprocess, and would be legally regulatedthrough
the adoptiono fECCs.

 Component2 Support Systems for the Adoption of IEM/SLMpractices(US$8.80 million,
                 -
 57.4 percent o f total project cost)
 This component aims to provide technical and financial support to small farmers and other
 relevant ecosystem managers at the microcatchment, municipal and watershed levels to move
 from conventional, unsustainable smallholder agriculture to sustainable livelihood activities
 which enhance biodiversity and carbon sequestration inthe agricultural landscape. It would
 support demonstrative investments to facilitate the adoption o f IEMprinciples and SLM
 practices inat least 40 microcatchments. It would finance technical assistance, investmentsand
 targetedresearchdemands identified inthe WMSs, PEMs, IndividuaVFarm-level Development
 Plans (PIDs) and the PID-derived subproject proposals. GEF would finance incremental
 resources to support this transition. It i s expected that once the transition has been achieved with
 the help o f GEF resources, outputs from activities would contribute to ensuring ongoing
 financial support to sustainable activities which create significant environmental benefits at the
 local, regional and global level without further GEF involvement (GEF funds would not be used
 on a recurrent basis, but would helpjump start the enhancement o f current financial support
 systems and provide the basis for other possible self-sustaining financial mechanisms, e.g.,
 PES). About 70 percent o fthe cost o f this component would be financed (and earmarked) under
 the ongoing stateprogramsRio Rural andMoeda Verde and the federal programPRONAF(for
 cofinancing details, see Incremental Cost Matrix inAnnex 15).

Subcomponent 2.1: Financial Supportfor Sustainable Natural Resources Management (US$8.43
million, 55.1 percent o f total project cost).
 This subcomponent aims to provide technical and financial support to small farmers andother
 relevant ecosystem managers at the microcatchment, municipal and watershed levels to carry
 out subprojects which would assist them to move from conventional, unsustainable smallholder
 agriculture to sustainable livelihood activities which enhance biodiversity conservation and
 carbon sequestration inagricultural landscapes. The support provided would be the vehicle to
partially share costs to farmers o fcomplying with environmental legislationwhile at the same
 time achieving the project's global environmentalbenefits. This subcomponent would finance
 subproject proposals requestingsupport services and environmentally appropriate investments
 identifiedinthe PEMs and PIDs.

The GEF-supportedportion o fthe financial assistancefor the transition to sustainable agriculture
would operate under the existing incentive legislation(State Socio and Economic Development
Fund-FUNDES) underwhichMoeda Verde operates.

Sources of funding. This subcomponent includes the implementation o f two activities financed
bytwo major types offunding: i)Activity 1would be financed underthe ongoing state and
federal credit and other incentive programs. It would encompass implementation o f small
infrastructure (such as erosion control inrural roads and small sustainable irrigation schemes)
andproductive systems on farms and inmicrocatchmentssupported bythe project; and ii)
Activity 2, to be supported by GEF funds, would provide financial support to the transition from
non-sustainable agriculture practices to sustainable livelihood activities within the IEM
framework (See Annex 4, Appendix 2 for examples o f subprojects proposed for GEF funding).

 Categories of subprojects eligiblefor grants. Proposals eligible for GEF-financing through
 FUNDES (Activity 2) would fall under the following five categories: (i)conservation or
 sustainable use o fbiodiversitv, such as reforestation for protection o f ground water recharge
 areas, protection and development o f existing agro-biodiversity resources or other schemes to
 increase biodiversity, includingreforestationwith native species followed by forest
 management; (ii)rehabilitation o f degradedlands, such as green and organic manure, zero and
 minimumtillage, contour planting and crop rotation; (iii)water resources management and
 protection, such as rehabilitation o f degraded natural riparian forests, protection o f water
 sources, biological control o fpests and integrated pest management practices to reduce pesticide
 use and encourage animal waste treatment and disposal (the latter as compost); (iv) redirection
 o fproductive systems toward those that are sociallv and environmentally-friendly, such as agro-
 forestry, bee-keeping and pasture management; and (v) commercialization o f environmentally
 and socially sound products, such as handicrafts, certification o f "ecosystem-friendly" products,
 and post-harvest value-added from environmentally-friendly agricultural products (honey,
 marmalades, etc). A complete list o ftypes o f subprojects for each o f these categories has been
 included inthe Project Operational Manual.

 All activities supportedunder the financial support component would have a demonstrative
 effect and would be representative o f one or more o f the four major ecosystems o f the project
 area.




                                                  43

Number of subprojects (PIDs). Use o f grants would be demand-driven, and stem from the
microcatchment/community development plans and individual plans developed by beneficiaries
with the participation o f the municipal and regional decisionmaking bodies. It i s estimated that
about 1,900 subprojects or PIDs (comprising 4,400 specific individual and group investment
proposals, benefiting 1,900 families) would be supported under this subcomponent, within the
five categories and respective types o f financial support mentioned above: (i) proposals
                                                                                     980
funded to recover land degradation; (ii)    510 for conservation or sustainable use o f biodiversity
purposes; (iii)1,340 for water resources management and protection purposes; (iv) 420 for
redirection o f productive systems toward socially and environmentally-friendly ones; and (v)
1,150orientedtoward the commercialization of environmentally and socially sound products.

Technical assistance. Technical assistance would be provided mostly by EMATER, or by hired
technicians where necessary, to microcatchment groups to prepare PEMs and PIDs through the
funds allocated to Subcomponent 1.2, inparticular to target group members (see below). While
EMATER would fund infrastructure, staff salaries, vehicles, and similar costs, GEF would
cofinance operational costs.

Responsibilitiesfor selection, approval, implementation and monitoring
Grant applications (up to R$6,000 per beneficiary smallholder family and up to R$4,000 for
other types o f beneficiaries) would be assembled and evaluated initially by COGEMs. Endorsed
proposals would be consolidated at the municipal level (by the local EMATER office and
CMDRs) and submitted to SEP through the SER for final approval and processing o f grants.
Disbursement would normally be against submittedreceipts (payment modalities "reembolso na
proposta" and "reembolso pds-proposta"), although regulations would allow pre-financing o f
small amounts (20 percent o f total proposal cost) for the poorest applicants (modality "liberap?es
parceladas"). The component would be coordinated by a grant administrator in SEP. Once
awarded, grant funds would be transferred directly to beneficiaries. COGEMs and staff from the
             offices at municipal, regional and state level would be responsible for monitoring the
use o f the grants.

Requirementsfor eligibility and subsequent selection of grantproposals

Proposals for financial support should follow the project guidelines and be geared toward the
carrying out o f environmental services by farmers with a consequent improvement inthe quality
o f life o f the beneficiaries and the community. To be eligible, specific investment proposals in
subproject proposals must correspond to activities designated as priorities in the PEM and PIDs
and fit under the categories o f subprojects (e.g., crop rotation, forestry management, organic
disposal and compost, etc.) deemed eligible in the Operational Manual. For a detailed list o f
those activities to be financed by this component under the eligible subproject categories, see
Appendix 2 o fthis annex.

Subproject Beneficiaries
Within microcatchments, all residents (and grassroots associations with officelsede located in
microcatchments) would be encouraged to participate, with the support o f the project's TA, in
the development of PEMs, PIDs and the individual and community subprojects stemming from
them.



                                                  44

In most cases, the grant would finance between 50 percent and 80 percent of investments
included in the GEF portion o f the subproject. Grantees would provide in-kind contribution to
cover the rest.

Criteria for elinibilitv o f beneficiaries. Grant beneficiaries would be eligible for grant support
either individually or ingroups based on the following broad criteria:

 1. Individuals
They would comprise family farmers and market-oriented farmers, as definedby PRONAF, who

        the production o f a minimum o f 70 percent o f the prime material required by the
        undertaking.

SubcomDonent 2.2: Support to Adaptive Management Practices (US$0.38 million, 2.4 percent o f
total project cost). This subcomponent would support the adaptation o f existing soil
management practices and/or adequate technological solutions to unsustainable land use issues
identified by the farming community at the microcatchment level. The activities foreseen under
this subcomponent include: (i)    improvement and validation o fpractices for the integrated
management o fnatural resources; (ii)   adaptation and validation o f cropping, agroforestry and
pasture management systems to increase carbon stocks andbiodiversity; and (iii)
implementation o fpilot units to improve the use o frural space inenvironmentally fragile and
vulnerable areas or inthe buffer zones o f Conservation Units.
Demand for adaptive researchwould be identified during formulation o f the PEMs and
respective Annual Operational Plans (POAs). Under this subcomponent, GEF funds would
support technical assistance, equipment and studies for the identification and adaptation of
existing appropriate technologies and systems to respond to different land uses, consistent with
improved ago-ecosystem management. An estimate o f at least 10 adaptive research trials i s
foreseen under this component.
Research demands would be submitted to COREM for review andprioritization, and
subsequently, sent to SEP for TOR preparation and contracting (for such, a PESAGRO officer
would be outposted at SEP). UponBank non-objection o f TORs, SEP would proceed with the
contracting o fresearch services. Depending on the characteristics o f each demanded research,
adaptive researchwould be carried out directly through PESAGROinareas where PESAGRO
has an identified advantage/expertise or, where this i s not the case, may be contracted to
PESAGRO inassociation with a university, NGO or other similar institution.
Component3 -OrganizationandCapacityBuildingfor IntegratedEcosystem
Management(US2.47 million, 16.0 percent o ftotal project cost)
This component would include training, education and community engagement efforts to
facilitate the formation and strengthening o f rural organizations for self-management o f natural
resources. They would complement productive and commercialization group activities



                                                 46

encouraged by the ongoingRio Rural and PRONAF programs. Direct beneficiarieswould be
approximately 6,000 intersectoral technicians, smallholder farmers, rural youth andresidents o f
project-supportedwatersheds, which would be trained inmanagement o f natural resources and
participate inthe implementation o frural pilot collective undertakings to promote the
 socioeconomic development o fbeneficiaries, based on the production and deliveryo f
 environmentally sustainable goods and services.
Initiatives for the capacity building and organization o f the local rural populationwould
generate: empowerment o f communities and increased, more effective participation inlocal
management decisions; higher adoption o f sustainable environmentaltechniques; improved
 smallholder producers' organizations for purposes o f self-management; and pursuit o f increased
income-generationopportunities.
Capacity building and rural organization are beingimplementedthrough the ongoing programs,
Rio Rural and PRONAF. The GEF would finance the incrementalcosts associated with work to
 support rural organization, which would place emphasis on the integrated management o f
natural resources, particularly dealing with issues related to biological diversity, climate change,
and land degradation.
Subcomponent 3.I: Community Organization (US$0.43 million, 2.7 percent o f total project
cost). Underthis subcomponent, qualified professionals ina variety o f fields would be
mobilized to undertakediagnostic studies o f the existing community organizations and to
 facilitate the development and implementation o fpilot community self-management activities
 focused on the production and delivery o f environmentally sustainable goods and services.
This subcomponent would support the application o f an innovative multidisciplinary
methodology (incubation or incubagem) for strengthening local organizations through collective
action and self management for socioeconomic betterment andimproved management o f natural
resources. The activities would include special training and support for extension agents (training
of trainers or multiplieragents) inhow to more effectively assist beneficiaries inthe formation
and strengthening o f local organizations such as associations, cooperatives and microcatchment
committees with emphasis on participatory techniques for diagnostics, planning, implementation
o f activities and monitoring and evaluation. Under the project at least two rural incubator centers
would be established, one ineach region, likely to be physically locatedwith the two planned
InformatiodCommunicationCenters (see next paragraph on the Communication Plan), which
would serve as resource centers. The methodology, fine-tuned to the objectives o f this specific
project, i s based on World Bank-award winning programs developedby ITCP (Technology
Incubator for Popular Cooperatives) at the Federal University o f Rio de Janeiro that have shown
considerable success inestablishing viable and sustainable collective enterprises and networks.
Inadditionto itstraining aspect, this subcomponent would also support the application, by
trained extension agents, o f the incubation methodology inat least 14 microcatchments inPY1
and inan additional 16 inPY2.

Additionally, this subcomponent would support the development and implementation o f an
interactive project Communication Plan that would both collect and diffuse socioeconomic,
environmental and monitoring information. The specific monitoring plan for this subcomponent,
whose social impact indicators are briefly outlined inAppendix 1o f Annex 3, would be designed
for continuous feedback to and the fine-tuning o fthe incubator initiatives allowing for the
delivery o f enhanced targeted support to local and regional organizations as challenges arise. As


                                                47

resources for the general public, a project portal would be established on the web, andtwo
InformationlCommunicationCenters would be established, one ineach region, that would
provide access to multimedia resources and the internet and would support distance learning. In
addition, direct community access to and dissemination o f relevant environmental and project-
related information would be supportedon a pilot basis. Inthis regard, five project
microcatchments would be selected to pilot community-based computers for broader access to
the portal and the internet. Once the pilots are evaluated, it i s expected that community-based
internet access would be expanded. Inaddition, five existing community radio stations would be
strengthened interms o fthe content o fprogramming for dissemination o f environmental issues
andequipment (computer with broad-band).

 Subcomuonent 3.2: Training of Project Executors (US$0.41 million, 2.7 percent o f total project
 cost). Through training and environmental awareness efforts (including national, and a few
 international, fieldtrips) for relevant intersectoral and extension staff, this subcomponent would
 implementmanagement andtechnical capacity buildingprograms, involving about 420 staff. It
 would also carry out specific capacity training to support the implementation o f socio-
 environmental actions, on-farm, and inmicrocatchments. It would also provide technical
 training on project-related issues and general project awareness trainingto memberso f the
 project steering committees (COGEM, CMDR, COREM, CEDRUS).

 Subcomponent 3.3; Training and Environmental Education of Beneficiaries (US$ 1.63 million,
 10.6 percent o f total project cost). Underthis subcomponent, training and environmental
 education efforts would be carried out among beneficiaries to enhance local capacities and
 increase support for sustainable naturalresources management. Training would be oriented
 toward makingenvironment-related applied technical and scientific knowledge available inan
 integrated manner to diverse groups o f rural producers and residents o fproject-benefited
 watersheds. It would complement training carried out by the base programs on agroprocessing,
 improvedcropping, animal health and aquaculture systems.

 Insupport ofenvironmental educationefforts foreseen under this subcomponent, the project
 would also train one schoolteacher from each o f the project supported microcatchments in
 environmental issues relevant to the project area. With the support o f this teacher, each school
 would thenprepare an environmental education subproject proposal to submit for project
 support (e.g., a photography kit for documentation o fbiodiversity and cultural heritage o f the
 community, organic horticulture, water monitoring, plantingo f seedlings inthe school area, etc.)

This subcomponent would also provide technical training on a demand-driven basis inthe five
broad areas foreseen for grant support under subcomponent 2.1 mentioned above.


 Component4 -ProjectManagement,MonitoringandEvaluation(US$2.74 million, 17.5
 percent o f total project cost)
 Subcomuonent 4.1; Participatory Management of the Project (US$1.8 1million, 11.5 percent o f
 total project cost). This subcomponent would support technical assistance, office equipment,
 administrative and operational aspects necessary to ensure the effective implementationo f
 project activities and management o f resources. The structuring and implementation o f a Project

Management Unit (SEP) under the aegis o f SEAAPI, i s proposed through its Directorate o f
Microcatchment Development (Superintendencia de Microbacias - SMH).Inaddition to this
core executive structure, and giventhe importance o f leveragingproject impact through
integrationwith other ongoing activities, aparticipatory, consultative extemal project
coordination structure (Coordination Forums) would be established at the state, municipal and
microcatchment levels.
Subcomponent 4.2: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.72 million, 4.6 percent o f total project
cost). This subcomponent would be under the responsibility o f SEP and would be implemented
through overall physical and financial monitoring o f the project, socioeconomic and
environmental monitoring inpilot microcatchments and overall project evaluation. To
complement the Rio Rural impact monitoring program inpilot microcatchments, the GEF would
support the development and implementation of a monitoring systemwhose objectives would be
to: (i) continuous monitoring the results o fproject actions, through previously
       provide
established indicators; (ii)evaluate, with the assistance o f CI-Brasil and SOS MataAtlilntica, the
positive impacts o f the integrated management of ecosystems on the increase inregional
biodiversity and carbon stocks inagricultural and livestock; (iii) support planning, andwhen
necessary reorient actions; (iv) provide information necessary for the intermediate and final
evaluation o f the project; and (v) form a database that shows the program's evolution and
improvement.
Continuous project monitoring would measure trends over time which would provide the basis
for a series of adaptive and systematic project evaluations, and for two overall project
evaluations, These evaluations, along with a baseline study to be carried out, would provide
feedback to adjust boththe project interventions and future management interventions. The
project's M&E system would use participatory mechanisms to enable stakeholders to share their
feedback.

Subcomponent 4.3: Project Dissemination (US$0.21 million, 1.4percent of total project cost).
This subcomponent would support the design and implementation o f the project information
dissemination strategy, providing the basis for knowledge transfer and, subsequently, increasing
the potential for transferring experiences and disseminatingproject lessons leamed. It would
include the sharing o f information bothwithin and outside the project, involvingthose people
and institutions who are interested inthe project andwho can leam from andmake use o fthe
experience, expanding it and making the idea useful to the public throughout the Atlantic Forest
region and beyond, particularly to other LatinAmerican countries.

Implementation period. The proposedproject would be implementedover a period o f five years.

 ProjectManagementStructure(see Figure1below).
Prqject oversight, management, and interagency coordination. Project management and
 implementation would be the overall responsibility o f SEAAPI.A Project Management Unit
 (SEP) would be established through SEAAPI's Microcatchment Directorate (SMH); the latter
would be responsible for the preparationo f general guidelines and procedures for project
 implementation while SEP would oversee, coordinate, administer, and monitor the project.
 Through SEP, SEAAPI as the project executor would sign working agreements with
 implementationpartners with a strong presence inthe region. These arrangements would serve
 the dual purpose o f leveraging the operational capacity o f the project execution structure, while
 at the same time mainstreaming the project approach within the services the partners provide to
 the NNWF's rural population.

Given the importance o f developing broader community consensus inthe development and
implementation o fwatershed andmicrocatchment development plans and consistent with
SEAAPI's current programs, it i s expected that municipal governments and a broad cross-section
o f civil society would play an active role inthe GEF-supported activities.

The project's execution would be decentralized and supported through the regional and local
offices o fthe aforementioned implementation partners.Inaddition to this core executive
structure, given the importance o f leveraging project impact through integration with other
ongoing activities, a participatory, consultative project external coordination structure
(Coordination Forums) would be strengthened or established at the state, regional, municipal,
and microcatchment levels.

Project Management Unit (SEP).The SEP would carry out overall project oversight,
coordination, administration, and monitoring. Relatedresponsibilities range from generating
budgetaryand financial resources to coordinating the COREM andproviding financial
statements o f accounts to the state government and the Bank. SEP would have two small
departments dealing with technical management and administration (financial management and
procurement), andthe operation o f the Financial Support Program. Through SEP, SEAAPI as
the project executor would sign working agreements with implementation partners with a strong
presence inthe region. These arrangements would serve the dual purpose of leveraging the
operational capacity of the project execution structure while at the same time mainstreamingthe
project approach within the services the partners provide to the rural population.

SEP would be staffed mainly by secondment from the implementation partners' organizations
(particularly EMATER)but technical assistance would behired to strengthenSEP's capacity.
The executive branch o fproject management would also maintain small multi-institutional units
consisting of teams from EMATER and PESAGRO,one in each o f the two EMATERregional
offices inthe NNWF (SER-North and SER-Northwest).-EMATER's regional and municipal
offices would serve as the project's executive units dealing directly with microcatchment
stakeholders. These unitswould be responsible for project monitoring at the municipal and
microcatchment levels, and would prepare and systematize information and reports requested by
the project, and execute and monitor project activities at the microcatchment, municipal, and
regional levels.

Implementation partnersinclude: EMATER, PESAGRO (SEAAPIagencies) for extension and
research; EMBRAPA-Soils (a federal agency), FEEMA (a SEMADUR agency) and DRM(a
S E N E agency) to supportmonitoring activities; the Public Defender's Office (DPGE), and two
NGOs (SOS-Mata Atliintica, and ConservationIntemational/CI-Brasil). COPPETEC, a private
foundation, will carry out community organization and communication activities.

TechnicalManagement Unit at State Level. The project's Technical Manager would be the
overall coordinator of project components 1,2, and 3, as well as the M&E subcomponent o f
component 4 (each component would also have a person responsible for its day-to-day
operation). Under the coordination o f this manager, a small technical department represented by
about six professionals would be established and would work infull coordination with local-
level project implementers.

Administrative and Financial Management Unit. The Administrative and Financial Manager
would be responsible for project administration and for procurement, disbursement, and special
account keeping. The unit would incorporate staff with experience infinancial, procurement, and
disbursement matters, and would hireone administrative assistant and two consultants,
specialized inprocurement and financial management matters, respectively.

Project Steering Committees. To provide external coordination to facilitate the integration o f
project activities with those beingcarried out by other projects and programs, overall guidance,
and address potential conflicts, the Project would have the support o f the following project
steering committees at the various levels o fproject implementation: (i)     the State Council of
Sustainable Rural Development-CEDRUS             (state level); (ii)
                                                                  the Regional Microcatchment
Committee-COREM          (at the North-Northwestern regional level); (iii)   steering committees in
each o fthe municipalities selected for project implementation, constitutedby one existing
municipal council, the Municipal Council o f Sustainable Rural Development-CMDRS
(municipal level); and Microcatchment Management Committees-COGEM                  (local level).

These Steering Committees would play an important role inthe project. They would bringtheir
collective expertise o f sectors (at the state, regiona, and municipal levels) and stakeholders to
helpensure that project implementationproceeds toward its objectives, andwould also work as
channels for the dissemination (back into the sectors and stakeholder groups represented there)
o f experiences and lessons generated by the project.

State Council of Sustainable Rural Development-CEDRUS.             At the state level, the choice o f
CEDRUS as project steering committee (consultative) i s based on: (i)       its mandate to guide and
oversee the sustainable development o f the state's rural areas; and (ii)   its composition, which
includesrepresentatives from project-relevantkey.State Secretariats, civil society, and
representatives o f farmers and other natural resource users. CEDRUS would oversee general
project implementation progress and would facilitate: (i) project's integrationwith the overall
                                                               the
rural development strategy inthe state and the country; and (ii)    the integration among partner
institutions and inparticular among state and national programs relevant for coordination and
collaboration with the proposedproject.

Regional Microcatchment Committee-COREM. At the regional level (NNWF), the COREM
(deliberative role) would monitor and evaluate progress; review and endorse project
implementationpolicy, priorities, and annual operational plans; and approve fund allocations
proposed by the SEP for each microcatchment. It would also seek to resolve conflicts among
stakeholders andendorse subprojects/grants, and ensure coordination and collaboration among
partner institutions.

Municipal Sustainable Rural Development Councils-CMDRs.             The existingCMDRs (created
underPRONAFand functioning inthe 24 project municipalities), composed o frepresentatives
from the municipal government, rural communities, NGOs, ruralworkers' trade unions, small
farmers' associations, and rural extension institutions, would endorse the proposedpriority
microcatchments to be supported under the project. CMDRs would be regularly informedby
local executing agencies (EMATERand muncipality) on the implementation o f the
Microcatchment Development Plans (PEMs) and the selected municipal microcatchmentsto be
benefitedby the project. They would also contribute to the dissemination o fthe project's
objectives and results and mediate any potential conflicts among local stakeholders.



                                                    61

Micvocatchment Management Committees-COGEMs. The COGEMs (one for each benefited
microcatchment) would be represented by members selected by new or existingmicrocatchment
groups o f the local stakeholders (small producers, women, youth, rural workers, etc.). This
committee would beresponsible for local planning, management, and actions to achieveproject
objectives. More specifically, the COGEMs would be responsible for the approval o f the PEMs,
which would be prepared by the microcatchment groups incooperation with the project
executing institutions. The committee would also approve POAs and ECCs, endorse PIDs, and
manage, monitor, and evaluate PEM implementation.

A. FinancialManagementAssessment

A financial management risk assessmentofthe project was carried out inaccordance with
OP/BP 10.02 and the Guidelines for Assessment o f Financial Management Arrangements in
World Bank-Financed Projects issued by the Financial Management Sector Board on October
15,2003.

The overall objective o fthe assessmentwas to determine whether the financial management and
disbursementarrangements proposed by the Grantee-the          State o f Rio de Janeiro-through its
Implementing Agency-SEP       inSEEAPI, are acceptable to the Bank. These arrangements
include, but are not limitedto, its capacity to: (a) properly manage and account for all project
proceeds, expenditures, and transactions; (b) produce timely, accurate and reliable financial
statements and reports, including Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) for Project Management
and other Bank purposes; (c) safeguard the project's assets; (d) provide timely engagement o f
independentauditors acceptable to the Bank; and (e) disburse Bank funds inthe most efficient
manner, inaccordance with applicable Bank rules and procedures.

The assessment addressed: (a) the financial management system to be usedfor project
accounting, financial administration, controlling, and reporting, as well as a review o f the TOR
for the software developer to be engaged for its development; (b) financial staffing, Le.,
manpower to be engaged and organizational set-up, including training and qualification
requirements; (c) review o f funds flow mechanisms; (d) review o f internal control mechanisms
and administrative procedures; (e) the disbursementmethodology to be used; (0reporting
requirements, including format, content, and frequency o f FMR submission to the Bank; (g)
internal audit procedures; and (h) external audit arrangements and submission o f yearly audited
financial statements.

The FMassessmentconcluded that the proposed financial management arrangements for this
project would satisfy the Bank's minimumrequirements and that the proposed financial
management systems would effectively control and monitor the project and provide, with
reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the progress o f project implementation.

The Financial Management risk associatedwith this project is rated as substantial, and adequate
mitigating measures would have to be implemented. The Risk Assessment Matrix below
summarizes the degree o f risk o f each o f the items related to the FinancialManagement o f the
project and shows steps suggested to mitigate these risks.

Project implementation would have to be closely monitored inorder to mitigate FMrisks. The
higherrisk is relatedto flow o f funds (see paragraph below). The major component, which
represents some 57 percent o f total project costs, i s financial support: US$8.4M to which the
Grant would contribute US$2.5MYandthe State would contribute US$4.1M through FUNDES.
Grant funds would also be deposited inFUNDESto finance small agricultural entrepreneurs and
farmers participating inthe subprojects under subcomponent 2.1. The counterpart fundingwould
have to be closely monitored. It i s recommended that the audit o fproject accounts be procured
following Bank guidelines and that audit costs be included inthe Bank's financing portion.

Other executing agencies would receive small amounts o f funds from the Project. The biggest
one would be to EMATERwhich would receive US$958,000. PESAGRO and EMBRAPA Soils
would receive approximatelyUS$l 00,000 each. All executing agencies would be treated as
service providers and would be paid on a cost and billing basis. Moreover, no cash advances
would be made from GEF funds.

Project Imdementation Unit & Staffing
Project implementationwould be under the responsibility and coordination o f SEP within
S E M I . SEP would be formally created through a Governor's Decree and would articulate and
liaise with all entities participating inthe project. SEP would manage all resources, control and
monitor Project execution inall its phases, report back to the State Government and the Bank, do
the accountingand financials, coordinate disbursements o fBank and counterpart funds, prepare
the financial reportingthrough FMRs, andprepare disbursement documentationto submit to the
Bank.SEP would include anExecutive Secretary supportedby a Technical Manager anda

FinanciaVAdministrativeManager. The Technical Manager would supervise the technical and
operational coordination of the implementationo f all components, and the
Financial/AdministrativeManager would be responsible for financial functions, procurement
coordination and administrative support for the entire Project. Two regional Secretariats, one for
the North Region and the other for the Northwest Region, would beresponsible for local
implementation. Beginning inthe second year o fproject implementation, these Regional
Secretariats would undertake procurement and certain financial functions, as well as
responsibility for the implementationo f subcomponents 1.2 and 3.3. The
FinanciaVAdministrativeManager under SEP would have a staff o f five professionals, one o f
whom would be a certified accountant, plus a number o f consultants to assist primarily with
control of expense reports to be received from the executing agencies. All the staffto be hired
would have a financial background. The SEP consultants would be hired for the first 18 months
of the project, and those inthe Regional Secretariats would be hired for the second and third
project years, SEP would also have logistical and operational support from SEAAPI.

Flow ofFunds and Disbursement
Total Project cost is US$14.95 million, and the contributions by donors and respective
investmentsare summarized as follows (inUS$ thousand):




     (')FUNDES:Incentive transfers. FUNDESis a state fund createdto finance various State Investment
     Programs,For this project, FUNDES would finance the subprojects under Subcomponent 2.1 using
     GEF and State funds.
     (*)Contribution from PRONAF Program
     (3)Contribution from EMBRAPA
     (4)Inlabor

The flow of funds is shown inthe attached flow chart. A special account inUS$ would be
opened for GEF Funds.An operational Bank account inR$ would be opened to receive GEF
funds from the Special Account and to make payments for the expenses financed by GEF. The
operational account would not receive State counterpart funds, as the State would pay directly
from its own Treasury account for its share o f project costs.

Fundswould flow as follows:
       GEF-US$6.7 million: US$6.7 million to the OperationalAccount for payment o f Goods,
         Consultants, Services, and Operating Costs to be made by the project, o f which: (a)
        US$2.5 million would be transferred from the Operational Account to FUNDES to
         cofinance subprojects eligible for financing under the project; and (b) US$4.2 million

      SoRJ-US$5.7 million: (a) US$4.1 millionwould be transfers made to FUNDES to
        finance the State's share o f subprojects under the project; (b) US$0.7 millionwould be
        transferredto the Operational Account for payment o f goods, consultants, and services;
        and (c) US$O.9 million would be paid directly by the State for operating costs related to
        the p r ~ j e c t . ~
      Federal Funds -US$1.2 million: (a) US$1.O milliono f the State's share o f the PRONAF
        Federal Program would be procuredby project beneficiaries (small farmers) to cofinance
        subprojects eligible for financing under the project; and (b) US$0.2 million out o f the
        federal agency EMBRAPA's budgetwould be used for direct payment o f EMBRAPA's
        recurrent costs relatedto the project.
      Project beneficiaries and NGOs would bepaid mostly inlabor and small contributions for
        their ownrecurrentcosts.

Transfers o f GEF Funds to FUNDESwould be made on the basis o f a "convtnio" or Governor's
Decree specifically to finance part o f the project. The project would be under a "Budget Unit" or
a "Cost Center" called PT'' within the SoRJ's budgetary/financial system.

Withdrawals from the Operational Account would be made for: (a) payments to the final
beneficiaries (suppliers, consultants, training and workshop costs) for goods supplied and
services rendered; (b) payments to other implementingagencies such as EMATER,PESAGRO,
and EMBRAPA Soils, on the basis o f reimbursement o f costs incurred; (c) transfers to FUNDES
for financing activities o f Subcomponent 2.1 (Financial Supportfor Sustainable Natural
Resources Management). Management and control o f the investment o f the project's financial
resources would be carried out by SEP. All budgeting and financial transactions would have to
be generated and incorporated into the State Budget and Financial System-SIAFEM."                       To this
end, SEP would liaise with SEEAAPI'sAdministrative/FinancialDepartment to prepare the
budgetsand request the recording o fthe Commitment Bills (Notas de Empenho),Disbursement
Programming(PD-Programap7o de Desembolso), and Payment Bills (Notas de Liquidqa"o),
which are the official documents requiredto make the payments. Counterpart fundingwould
generally be incash and would come from different sources. Insome instances, as for NGOs,
counterpart would be represented by labor and own recurrent costs. The FMsystem to be usedin
thisproject would have the capability to capture all these different counterpart contributions. The
share o fPRONAF to be commited by beneficiarieswould be accounted inthe MIS through
copies o fthe financing contracts and Banco do Brasil vouchers received via EMATER, which i s
the agent for this type o f financing.




 Alternatively the amounts under I1b) and I1c) totaling US$1.6 million would be paid directly by the State from its
Treasury account.

  Disbursement would use the transaction-based methodology-SOE.           The SoRJ would advance a
  limitedamount of its own funds for the start-up oftheproject. Documentationof SOEs would be
  as follows:
      a) Goods, consultants, training, and other services, and other operation costs: Bills, receipts
          and invoices committed, processed, and paid through SIAFEM;
      b) Subprojects financed from FUNDESwould be documented bythe financing contracts
          approved and paid, eligible under the project inthe agreedproportion o f financing
          between GEF and State funds.

  The usual initial allocation o f 10percent would be made to the Special Account.

AccountingPoliciesandProcedures,FMsystem, Internalcontrols
  The Project's and SEP's budgetingand accountingwould bepart ofthe overall State FMsystem
  andtherefore all transactions would go through the public State accountingsystem-SIAFEM.
  All payments would follow the official commitment (empenho) andpayment (liquidapTo) and
  PD "Disbursement Programming" routine. These functions are performedby SEAAPI's
  Administrative and Financial Department. Individualproject transactions are usually performed
  under a Work Plan (PT'*) within SIAFEM, which is a Cost Center specifically designated for a
  givenproject. All project costs are recordedaccordingto the State Code o f Accounts which
  enables a comparison and reconciliationwith each project's own controls. The project would be
  included in SEAAPI's PT. The subprojects eligible for financing under the project's terms would
  be recorded inthe MIS. It must be noted that SIAFEMi s not a Project Management System, and
  therefore it cannot beused for monitoring and controlling the project, nor can it produce the
  requiredfinancial reporting.

  Considering that this i s a multi-donor project, with some non-cash contributions and even
  contributions from entities outside the State BudgetarySystem, such as the FederalProgram
  (PRO"),       EMBRAPA, andNGOs, andwith several different money outflows, aparallel
  tailor-made FMsystem (MIS) would have to beprocured to manage, account, andmonitor the
  project's physical and financial execution. All these "outside" contributions would be
  documented and relevant data capturedthrough inputs into the MIS.There are systems already
  implemented for projects with similar characteristics and demands for the MIS. The system to be
  acquired would be an adaptation o f the one usedfor the Sao Paulo Microcatchments Project (Ln.
  4238-BR), which i s very similar to this one. The Bank reviewed and assessedthe system used in
  that project and rated it as satisfactory. The M I S would do the budgeting, accounting, financial
  reporting, and monitoring o fthe project, and control counterpart contributions and investments.
  It would be accessedvia the Internetby all implementing agencies for direct data input,
  accounting, preparationo f cash forecasts and reports. The system would have a code o f accounts
  specifically for the project on the basis o f the expenditures to be incurred ineach component,
  subcomponent, and activity. The basic code o f accounts for primary costs (insumos) would be
  the State's SIAFEMcode of accounts. SEP, through its FinancialDepartment, would be able to
  consolidate all data for purposes o f disbursement andreporting to the Bank. At Appraisal the
  procurement o f MIS was somewhat delayed due to State bureaucracy. The Financial Manual,
  which i s part of the Operational Manual, would contain detailed procedures and guidelines for
  disbursements, payments, approvals, commitment andpayment bills, andFMRpreparation.

Financial Repovtina fFMR). SuDewision
According to the Bank's financial reporting requirements, all projects should be monitored
through three sets o f FMRs: Financial, Physical Progress, and Procurement. The following
FMRswere agreed to duringthe FMAMission:
         0  FMRl - Source and Application of Funds. Sources by donors and applications by
            cost categories as per the Grant Agreement. This report would include opening and
            closing balances o f the Special and Operational Accounts.
         0  FMR2-Application of funds by Components and Subcomponents.
         0  FMR3 -Reconciliation Statement with the Bank's Client Connection site.
         0  FMR4 - Reconciliation Statement o f Special and Operational Bank Accounts.

All reports would be denominated inR$ and preparedon a quarterly basis, containing forecasts
andactual figures: (i) each quarter, (ii)
                       for                     accumulated for the year, and (iii)
                                                                                accumulated for the
project life.

It is recommended that at least one FMsupervisionmissionper year be carried out duringproject
implementation.

Internal Audit
The proiect would be subject to internal audit by the State General Auditor's office, which i s part
o fthe Finance Secretariat Organization, and externally by the State Court o f Accounts (TCE").
However, the SoRJ's TCE is not accredited by the Bank to certify Project Financial Statements;
thus the project would require an external audit by an independent, qualified audit firm.

External Audit -Audit ReDorts
An external audit would follow the Bank's new audit policy and guidelines issued by the Financial
Management Sector Board on June 30,2003. The project's accounts and financial statements
would be audited by an independent audit firm, selected from a pre-approved shortlist o f three to
six candidates, and under Terms o f Reference previously reviewed and approved by the Bank.
Audit costs would be included inthe cost share to be financedby the Bank and follow Bank
guidelinesto ensure the necessary qualifications o f auditors. Inaddition, the hiringprocess should
beginimmediately followingthe signingo fthe Grant Agreement. The audit report would include a
single opinion on the Project's Financial Statements. As part o ftheir work, the auditors would
prepare a management letter identifying any internal control weaknesses and areas of improvement
and recommendations thereof. Fourth-quarter FMRcumulative financial reports, ifacceptable to
the World Bank, would provide the basis for the annual financial statements on which auditors
would express their independent opinion. The auditors' report would be submitted to the World
Bankno later than six months after the closing o f each fiscal year.

Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out inaccordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May
2004, and the provisions stipulated inthe Grant Agreement. For N C B and contracting o f
consulting firms, the Project Management Unit (SEP) would use the standard procurement
documents issued by SEAN, and for shopping, a standardformat for this purpose. The various
items under different expenditure categories are described below. For each contract to be
financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the
need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior reviewrequirements, and time frame have been
agreed betweenthe Borrower and the Bank project team inthe Procurement Plan. The
Procurement Plan would be updatedat least annually or as requiredto reflect the actual project
implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.

Goods, Works, and ConsultantServices for Subprojects:Represent 57.1 percent o fthe
project cost. The GEF contribution and current lines o f financial assistance would provide
financial support for sustainable naturalresources management. Fundswould be disbursedby the
Banco do Brasil. SEAAPIwould interact with the Bank for disbursements and monitoring.
Procurement to be carried out for works, goods, and services requiredby farmers and groups o f
farmers indispersed project areas would be carried out under the assistance o f EMATER,
through shopping. For purchases costing over US$5,000 equivalent, the presentationof at least
three responsive offers would be required.

Procurementof Goods: Represents 2.8 percent o fthe project cost. Goods include the purchase
o f information equipment, other equipment, and vehicles. Procurement would be done using
shoppingprocedures.

Selectionof Consultants:Represents 11.7 percent o fthe project cost. Assignments to be
contracted with firms include community organization and training as well as studies. Includes
eight contracts, four by QCBS, and four sole-source as outlined inAttachment 1to this Annex.
Individual consultants would be selected on the basis o f their qualifications. Consultant
assignments with shortlists including international firms are not required. Shortlists o f
consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$500,000 per contract may be entirely
composed o fnational consultants inaccordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the
Consultant Guidelines.

The project does not requirethe use o f ICB. The methods would be: N C B over US$lOO,OOO for
goods, same for eventual civil works, and same for services. The thresholds for consultant
services and for firms would beUS$lOO,OOO and US$50,000 for individual consultants. The
Bank would carry out a prior review o f all NCBs, first two shoppingprocedures for goods and
services, and all consultant assignments with firms.

B) Assessment of the Agency's Capacityto ImplementProcurement

Project management and implementation would be the responsibility o f SEP, and would include
an officer with training inBank-financed procurement to be responsible for overall procurement
supervision and assistance to executing officers. This officer would coordinate with EMATER
and SEAAPI's procurement division inthe Administration Department. SEAAPI's procurement
division would be directly incharge o f carrying out the procurement processes under the project,
with the exception o finvestments made by farmers, through lines of financial support, who
would be assisted and supervised by EMATER.

Duringpreparation, an assessment o f SEAAPI's capacity to implement the project's procurement
was carried out. This assessment determined that while SEAAPI appeared to be experienced in


                                                 71

procurement implementation (according to Law 8666-93) and consistent inthe application o f
rules and handlingo f documents, the project i s rated as highrisk for procurement, because o f (a)
the planned decentralization ofprocurement decisions, (b) lack of the required
administratiodinformation system, which i s not yet inplace, and (c) SEAAPI staffs lack o f
previous experience with Bank-financed procurement.

The implementation o fthe following Action Planwas recommended to help minimize the risks
identified:

            DEscRIPTIoN                                                     TIME-FRAME




However, since the aforementioned procurement capacity assessment was carried out, it has been
confirmed (duringappraisal) that all procurement other than that involved inthe implementation
o f subprojects under Subcomponent 2.1 would be carried out by SEP, thereby ensuring the
centralization o f procurement decisions. This arrangement, along with the additional training
foreseen for SEP's Administrative and Financial Management Unit,would substantially mitigate
the risk for procurement.

C) ProcurementPlan.SEP hasprepared aproject implementation schedule covering the period
2005-2009. Onthe basis o f the implementationschedule, SEP prepareda procurement plan
which identifies packages, categories, and methods o fprocurement, with estimated amounts, and
which was found acceptable to the Bank during appraisal.

D) Frequency of Procurement Supervision. The Bank would carry out ex-post procurement
reviews once a year. The Bank would also review and approve annual procurement plans.

Economic and financialanalyses


Giventhe relatively modest investment of GEF funds proposed, the project does not aim to
finance the actual large scale implementationo f and IEMinthe project target area. The project
would be implemented as a pilot/demostrative project, emphasizing activities that could be
replicated and also provide the basis for scaling-up o f project results. Thus, while an Economic
and Financial analysis would not be applicable, the design initselfincludes cost effectiveness
considerations to promote maximumimplementation effectiveness, replication and impact o f
project results both within and outside the project area.
The goal o f achieving cost-effectiveness and maximumimpact underliedthe decisionto fully
integrate project activities with complementary ongoing public and private efforts, including
those to supply financial support for improvedproduction systems, and supply o f technical
assistancethrough well established mechanisms that would be supported by counterpart funds.
Cost effectiveness considerations also drove the decision on how to distribute the target number
of pilot microcatchments, for development o f environmentally and financially sound
demonstrative models with maximumrepresentation o f the diversity o f situations within the five
interventionwatersheds,.


Financial sustainability. Project preparation included extensive discussions and studies on the
development o f strategies to ensure the long-term sustainability o f project-financed activities. It
examined the existing incentive legislation andidentified the most appropriate mechanisms to be
used for the provision o fthe financial support proposedunder Component 2 (Le., through the
State Socio and Economic Development Fund- FUNDES),which may provide the basis for long
term support to overcome the financial constraints for the adoption o f financially sustainable
IEWSLMpractices. Theproject designwould support practices which havebeen, or proveto
be, financially sound and to provide win-win opportunities to beneficiaries and the environment.
A preliminary analysis showed that while selected fruits and crops such as banana, passion fruit,
pineapple and tomatoes may yield an average 5 percent higher net income under environmentally
friendly production systems, they do command an average 38 percent higherproduction cost
which represents a significant constraint for the adoption o f the enhanced production systems.      ,

The project would also support the development of a proposal for the creatidn o f a PES scheme
to enhance financial sustainability beyond project implementation (under Component l),       as well
as the adaptation to local conditions o f adequate technological solutions to unsustainable
productionpractices, which may yield a decrease inup-front costs (under Component 2).

Environmental Rating: B PartialAssessment
                               -
The project is designated a category B,based on the above assessmento fpotential impacts. The                               ,
Bank PCD (which forms the basis for this document) was reviewed by the QAT on July 24,
2003. The QAT members stated that they "concur with the proposedenvironmental Category
"B" and [safeguard screening] "S2" ratings, andnone ofthe Bank's social safeguards are
triggered by the project as currently designed". The QAT also "agree(d) that the project would be
highlypositive from an environmental standpoint, ifimplementedas planned.'4" According to
the QAT review, "the [Environmental Management Plan], part o f the EA report, should indicate
the eligibility criteria and screening procedures which theproject would use to ensure that the
financial incentives program (Component 2) would support only those rural activities which are
environmentally beneficial or relatively benign."

Project Compliance with applicable safeguard policies
EnvirortmentalAssessment. The project was classified for a Category B designation. It i s
designed to ensure compliance with the requirements o f the Bank umbrella policy on
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). Despite the largelypositive or neutral project impacts
anticipated, submission o f an EA and respective EMPwas considered prudent to ensure
conformity with the aforementioned Bank policy. The GovRJ submittedthe final draft ErVEMP
report inNovember 2004. This draft was submitted to the LCSES Quality Assurance Team
(QAT) for review on January 21,2005.
FollowingQAT review recommendations, mitigation measures have been integrated into the
screening, evaluation, approval, and monitoring procedures for small investments/subprojects
supported under Component 2 (see ENEMPreport). The EMP also included specific
responsibilities for EA and institutional arrangements, as well as provisions for strengthening EA
capacity within S E M I and to establishing mechanisms to monitor implementation and

Natural Habitats The proposed project would support natural habitat conservation and
                    -
improved land use by integrating the conservation o f natural habitats and the maintenance o f
ecological functions into regional development programs as well as bypromoting the
rehabilitation o f degraded natural habitats. Project activities would not significantly modify or
degrade natural habitats. Interms o fpolicy dialogue, the project would assist the GoRJin
incorporating an analysis o f any major natural habitat issues into its rural development strategies,
including identification o f important natural habitat sites, the ecological functions they perform,
the degree o f threat to the sites, priorities for conservation, and associated recurrent-funding and
capacity-buildingneeds.
The proposed project would take into account the views, roles, and rights o f groups, including
local non-governmental organizations and local communities, affected by the project, and would
involve these stakeholders inplanning, designing, implementing,monitoring, and evaluating the
project.
Forestry The proposed project primarilysupports environmentally protective activities and
          -
those which are supportive o f small farmers (e.g., farm and community forestry).

Pest Management - The project does not require a separate Pest Management Plan, giventhat
there are no significant pest management issues, and procurement o f substantial quantities o f
pesticides i s not foreseen. Whenever possible, the project would adopt IPMmeasures.
Nevertheless, ina few very specific situations, the short-term use o f small amounts o f pesticides
may be necessary, where allowed by Brazilian legislation, to implement subprojects under
Subcomponent 2.1 inrelation to: (i) o f leaf-cutter ants duringthe first two years o f
                                        control
seedlingestablishment inseverely degraded riparian areas, and (ii)      control o f invasive grasses in
riparian areas under restoration, especially areas previously converted to pastures (however,
manual weedingwould be the preferredoption, instead o fherbicides); (iii)        inproductive areas,
control o f invasive grasses duringthe implementation of zero tillage systems (with "capina
manual" as the preferred option, instead o f herbicides). The above mentioned relevant pest and
pesticide management issues have been identified and are addressedinthe Operational Manual,
and specific mitigation measures associated with the use o fpesticides would be adopted. The
hazards associated with the storage, handling, use, and disposal o fpesticides were identified and
assessed, and the project Operational Manualincludes measures (incompliance with Law
7802/89) to reduce these hazards to a level that can be managed by the users o f such products. In
addition to the adoption o f IPMandcompliance with the above law, the Operational Manual
establishes that the use of pesticides, whenever needed, should be limitedto low toxicity
products according to Class IV o f Decree 98816/90, which i s equivalent to WHO Class "U"
(unlikely to present acute hazard innormal use) or, ifappropriate "U"products are not available,
use o f Class I11products (slightly hazardous) may be necessary.

     BaselineScenario
The calculation o fthe baseline was based on an initial screening o f on-going and future
programs/projects (scheduled for implementation inthe next 3-6 years) relevant to the proposed
project objectives. Once identified, their activities relevant to the proposedproject objectives
were evaluated, costed and and included as part o fthebaseline. Identified fundingincluded: (i)
public resources (national and state); (ii)bi-lateral financing, and (iii) Baseline activities
                                                                          NGOs.
bycomponent are outlined below.

I,Planning for IEMActions
Although not part o f the baseline scenario, the KfW-supportedPro-Mata Atldntica (US$6.9
million) would finance technical assistance and other investments to protect the Desengano Park
andMata do Caw60 Reserve's biodiversity and their ecosystem services. CI-Brasil and SOS
Mata Atltintica would carry out studies to assist inthe design o f the implementation strategy for
the Serra do Mar corridor inNNWF.Underthe baseline scenario, some enforcement and
monitoring (financed by GoRJ) would be undertaken under the State Environmental and Forestry
institutions FEEMNIEF's regular programs. The baseline costs for these activities are calculated
at US$35,000.

2. Support Systems-forthe Adoption of IEM/SLM practices: Three on-going initiatives are
relevant to introduce sustainable improvements inthe rural landscape: the Moeda- Verde,Rio
Rural and PRONAF. Rural infrastructure, credit for on-farm and other investments at community
level would be supported under these programs to increase productivity and commercial values
of agricultural products. The baseline costs for these activities are calculated at US$28.55
million.

3. Organization and Capacity Building for Integrated EcosystemManagement
Some local organizational capacity would be developed inthe Rio Rural project-supported
microcatchments, and training inagro-business would be supported under the PRONAF.
Training o f Park field staff would be provided under the Pro-Mata Atliintica. The baseline costs
for these activities are calculated at US$250,000.

4. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
Management andmonitoring activities would be undertakenby SEAAPIfor the implementation
o f the Moeda Verde,Rio Rural and PRONAFprograms, as well as by FEEMA to undertake its
regular program o fwater quality monitoring. The baseline costs for these activities are calculated
at US$75,000.

                                                   90

BaselineCosts. Inthe absence of additional GEF funding, the implementationof the
aforementionedon-going and planned programdprojects would contribute to the project goal.
The estimated costs o f baseline activities amount to US$29.74 million. Sources o f assistance
vary and consist o f State Government funds (incash, inkind and as financial assistanceto
producers providedbyMoeda Verde andRio Rural), Federal Government funds (as financial
assistance to producers providedby PRONAF Credit and Infrastructure), private sector
(Coppetec) and NGOs (CI-Brasil and SOS Mata Atlantica) .

BaselineBenefits.The baseline programwould mainly achieve benefits at the national level
including the adoption o f more sustainable landand water management practices that would
translate into reduced degradation o fnatural resources for productive purposes, and increased
beneficiary incomes. It would finance technical assistance, rural infrastructure, support for land
regularization and credit for initial capital, small infrastructure and services to small farmers.
However, the baseline would not address more far-reaching interventions funded by global
transfers, as it would not support e.g., the generation o f global benefits by increasingbiological
diversity o f soils, enhancing carbon sequestration inproductive lands, conservingbiological
diversityinPAS,the rehabilitation and restorationo fnon-productive fragile lands within the
watersheds, and the connection o f fragments o fnatural forest across the landscape.

GEFAlternative

The Project would achieve significantly greater protection o f endangered biodiversity o f global
importance in selected watersheds representative o f the four major ecosystems o f the Atlantic
forest inthe NNWF.Increased community participation and organization which supports SLM
objectives and compliance with environmental legislation fostered by the alternative strategy
would inturnincrease sustainability o f interventions. The benefits o f supporting the transition to
livelihood options built on biodiversity friendly activities increased carbon sequestration in
terrestrial ecosystems, and enhanced protection o f ecosystems o f global importance, occur
predominantly at the global level and therefore warrant GEF funding. The Project would reorient
the agriculturalbaseline through the introduction o f a cross-sectoral approach insupport o f
sustainable land use practices definedwithin an ecosystem framework. It would include i)the
rehabilitation and restoration (with native species) o f non-productive public and/or fragile lands,
ii)theimplementationofcarbonsequestrationstrategiessupportingtheprotectionofwhole
watersheds containing remnants o f Atlantic forest, andiii)the concept o f an integrated system of
connected large natural areas to protect biological diversity.

GEFresources would cover the incremental costs associatedwith: (i) development o f
                                                                          the
appropriate strategies for the adoption o f integrated and cross-sectoral approaches that would
lead to sustainable landscapes and promote integrated ecosystem management; (ii)        the inclusion
o f climate change and biodiversity issues inthe microcatchment planning process, and
consequently inthe small farmers' routine activities; (iii)   education and community engagement
efforts to facilitate the creation o f environments favorable to the formation and strengthening o f
rural organizations for self-management o fnatural resources; (iv) buildingo f increased capacity
among technicians and local leaders, project managers and executors, focusing on the
internalization o f global environmental concepts; (v) the design o f a financial support system for
SLM, andprovisionofincrementalresourcesto supportthetransitionto sustainable livelihood

activities financed by the program; (vi) applied research for the identification and development
o f alternative and appropriate technologies and systems to respond to different sustainable land
uses, consistent with improved ago-ecosystem management; and (v) monitoring and evaluation
activities which demonstrate results andbenefits to local as well as regional, national and global
stakeholders.

Costs. The total cost o f the Project i s estimated at US$43.87 million, detailed as follows: (i)
US$0.94 million for the Planning for IEMActions; (ii)       US$38.54 million for Support Systems
for the Adoption o f IEM/SLMpractices; (iii)     US$2.47 million for Organization and Capacity
Buildingfor IntegratedEcosystem Management; and (iv) US$2.74 million for Project
Management, M&E.

Benefits.Underthe Project, the GoRJ would be able to undertake a challenging program
encompassing bothnational and global benefits. It would enhance protection o f vulnerable and
globally important ecosystems and assist the country with the effective implementation of its
existinghevised sustainable rural and environmental policies. Benefits generated from this
comprehensive approach would include national benefits such as increased sustainability and
                                                              -
improved management o f aquatic and terrestrial resources, and improved information flow from
project and other rural landscapes located inthe BrazilianAtlantic Forest (see complete list o f
national benefits inthe Incremental Cost Matrix below), as well as to other South American
countries - as well as global benefits.
Global benefits include: (i)  increased carbon sequestration interrestrial ecosystems, which would
beprimarily achieved through the adoption o fimproved landmanagement (to a lesser extent,
carbon would also be sequestered through the restoration and further protectiodconservation o f
degraded natural forests, and hence increasing forest biomass, particularly degraded riparian
forests); (ii)conservation and sustainable use o f biological diversity, by (a) supporting the
implementationo f the Serra do Mar Biodiversity Corridor through the adoption o f IEMand
S L M in selected watersheds; (b) promoting public andprivate protected areas and conditions for
their sustainable management insites containingremnants ofthe Atlantic Forestbiome; (c)
adopting improved agricultural practices that enhance soil biodiversity (non-till systems, legume
crop rotation, mulching, and other conservation agriculture practices); and (d) promoting
conservation o f agrobiodiversity; (iii)  protection o f watersheds inareas o f global importance; (iv)
improved funding for controlling land degradation, hence reducing pressure on ecosystem
integrity inareas of globally significant biodiversity, and enhancing carbon sequestration and
storage inthe agricultural landscape; improving sequestration o f soil carbon and reduction o f
dioxide emissions; (v) increased opportunities for generating income while at the same time
reducingpressure on biological resources; and (vi) transition to more sustainable livelihoods by
supporting pilot activities inago-ecosystem management and outreach and involvement o f civil
society andthe private sector inthe planning, management and sustainable use o f natural
resources. The funding from NGOs (CI-Brasil and SOS Mata Atlgntica) and private sector
(Coppetec) would partially cover incremental costs o f technical assistance, training, workshops,
equipment, and subsistence allowances insupport of project Components 1, 3 and 4.

IncrementalCosts

The difference betweenthe costs o f the Baseline Scenario (US$28.92 million) and the GEF
Altemative (US$43.87 million) i s an estimated US$14.95 million (including taxes andphysical
and price contingencies). The matrix below summarizes the baseline and incremental
expenditures during the five year project implementation period. Cofinancing o f this increment
has been mobilized as follows2: (i)          US$6.3 1million from the State Government o fthe Rio de
Janeiro (US$4.10 million from Moedu Vevdeprogram); (ii)                     US$1.11 million from the Federal
Government (from the PRONAFCredit and InfrastructureandEMBRAPA Soils, the latter as in-
kindcontribution o fUS$0.09 milli~n)'~; (iii)        and       US$0.02 million from NGOs (CI-Brad and
SOS Mata AtlAntica) and private sector (COPPETEC); and (iv) US$0.76 million from project
beneficiaries/producers.

The total requested GEF contribution amounts to US$6.75 million (excluding the Block B
donation). Out o fthis total US$0.64 millionwould contribute to Planningfor IEMActions inthe
NNWF region; US$2.92 millionwould contribute to Support Systems for the Adoption of
IEM/SLM practices infive watersheds representative o f the four major ecosystems o f global
significance inthe Atlantic Forest biome situated inthe NNWF; US$1.62 million for
Organization and Capacity Buildingfor Integrated Ecosystem Management; and US$1.57
million to support Project Management, M&E.The aforementioned GEF-support would cover
incrementalcosts o ftechnical assistance, training, workshops and other services such as public
awareness media campaigns, small infrastructure, minimumequipment and travel and
subsistence all0wances       .




l5 Based on the GEF Cofinancing Guidelines (GEF/C.20/6/Rev.l),          the project team determined that a small part o f
the financing for baseline activities under Moeda Verde,Rio Rural andPRONAF,could be included as cofinancing
(i.e., incremental), given that they are essential for achieving the GEF objectives. The total amount coming from
these three programs which remains as baseline has been estimated at around US$29 million, mostly applied inrural
infrastructure (road construction, etc.), rural credit inorder to increase productivity and commercial values o f
agricultural products, and about US$5.1 million has been "re-directed" as cofinancing (US$4.1 million from Moeda
Verde andRio Rural, and U S $ l.O million from PRONAF), and would include support to more sustainable land
management systems (such as zero tillage) inthe project area, on a demand-driven basis.

Introduction
The Project Developmental Objectives are: to promote the sustainable management o f natural
resources and to improve the subsistence level o f the family based rural communities inthe
regions North andNorthwestern o f the State o fRio de Janeiro.

The Project Global Objectives are: (i)   to address threats to biodiversity o f global importance (ii)
enhance carbon sequestration and (iii) land degradation inpublic and/or fragile lands.
                                          reverse
The project presents Socioeconomic, Environmental & Legal Diagnostic related to the process
which through centuries gradually contributed to the deforestation o f the Mata Atlantica inthe
State o f Rio de Janeiro; not different from what has taken place inother eastern States; to the
point that from 110million hectares, the Atlantic Forest i s now reducedto 7.5 percent o f this
original area, around 8.5 million km2. Many activities contributed to this actual level o f
ecosystem degradation: uncontrolled agriculture and animal husbandry expansion, logging for
lumber, charcoal and other products, urbandemographic pressure andlack o f adequate legal
enforcement are amongst the most significant ones. To have a historical view o f this process we
recommendBiodiversidade Populaqio e Economia - Uma RegiZo de Mata Atltintica
(Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais ,Julho, 1997).

Strong;Aspects o fthe Project
The objectives are consistent with the Convention o fBiological Diversity(CDB), UN
Framework Convention on Climate Changes (UNFCCC) and GEF Operational Strategies,
particularly its OperationalFramework on Sustainable LandManagement (OP19, irrespective o f
the maximum world priority givento conserve the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, recognized as one
o f the richest biological diversity regions o f the planet. The State of Rio de Janeiro is uniquefor
having the highestpercentage of Atlantic Forest with respect to the total area among all country
states (841,000 hectares) and simultaneously the most threatened fraction o f the remaining
primary vegetation, encompassing an area o f 15,000 km2 and a population o f 1million
inhabitants.

Despite o f all ongoing efforts inthe State o f Rio de Janeiro, from 1990 to 2000, deforestation
was particularly aggressive and estimated by the National Institutefor Space Research (WE) to


                                                    98

be o fthe order o f 1million hectares, the highest deforestation rate (16.7 percent) amongnine
case studies analyzed, almost 40 percent higher thanthe second ranked. Associated and at the
root o f this problem i s rural poverty. The project mentions that 440,000 people, 27 percent of the
total rural State population, are poor (twice the level verified inurban areas o f the State) and in
the Project areas considered this percentage rate rises to almost 40 percent. Reduction o fpoverty
can be an important instrument to revert deforestation.

So, it i s unquestionable the needfor an urgent, innovative, financially, sustainable action to
address this issue, which i s believedby the authors to be approached by this Proposal. The
project aims to apply and overall US$14.59 million during five years (from 2005); US$6.73
million o f this total, proposed as a grant from the Global Environment Facility.

The Annex 1-Project Design Summary -properly presented in a Log Frame format, has its
highesthierarchic Goal: Rural poverty and inequality reduced through a selective focus on
environmental sustainable development. The Project Development Objectives would, according
to the authors, be accomplishedthrough: integration, monitor & evaluation o f ongoing State
actions (extensively described inthe Proposal), capacity building, incentives and education.
Planningo f Sustainable Land Management i s basic for this strategy, translated inthe Outputs o f
the Project.

Although these activities are necessary on a longterm basis to revert the deforestation process o f
the Atlantic Forest we believe and will argument nextthat they are not innovative and financially
sustainable and as such they are insufficient to revert the deforestation process andreduce
poverty inthe region, major goal o f the project, and as such the strongest element to accomplish
the Project Development Objective.

Weak AsDects o f the Project
Biological Diversity Conservationi s extremely expensive and it i s unfortunate to verify that the
world i s gradually losing the battle that leads to deforestation o fthe planet. A clear indication of
this fact was the effort by the BiologicalDiversity Convention after 1992which emphasized the
term sustainable implyingthe need for long term strategies to revert this scenario. This i s
demonstrated by the pilot scope o fthe project which will cover only 100,000 hectares, 15
percent o fthe total 5 watersheds. The NNWFregion as mentioned covers an area of 15,000 km2,
with apopulation o f 1million inhabitants. This pilot effort will be applied to 4,000 rural
families; 16,000 people: a demonstrative strategy.

The poverty o fthese families result from the fact that they essentially depend on crops that have
no aggregate value: cassava; sweet potato; corn; beans and rice. These are subsistence crops
which will never constitute a solid financial means to revert the poverty situation experienced by
these families. Unless there i s an alternative to additionally aggregate value to the products
coming from the populations residinginAtlantic Forest, deforestationcan not be reverted.
Incentives and education are important but are not enough.

which might be considered by the project. One i s honey and sub products. The city o f Picos, in

the State o fPiaui, became a largehoneyproducers exporting extensively. Organic honey i s very
appealing inEurope and Brazil i s benefitingfrom the fact that insecticidewas found inhoney
coming from other market suppliers. The biological diversityrichness o f the Atlantic Forest
opens a good possibility for this area. Another i s mushroom. The Genetic Resources and
Biotechnology (CENARGEN) center at EMBRAPAinBrasilia offers freely courses to train
small family business entrepreneurson the Juncao Technology we introduced from China. A
third one is apalmpopularly knownas "pupunha"which is beingintroducedstrongly inmany
regions o f Brazilparticularly inthe South o f Bahia. It i s a good altemative for the heart o fpalm
produced from Euterpe spp, which i s being aggressively exterminated from the Atlantic Forest
by the "palm hunters".

What however is mostly surprising is that the project recognizes the richness o f the Atlantic
Forest interms o f Biological Diversitybut despite o f mentioning repeatedly the need for
conservation makes no proposal for the use o fthis biological diversity as a major instrumentfor
long term conservation. Infact, one o fthe weakest aspect o f the project i s the almost entire
absence o f science and technology as an instrumentto revert the poverty and deforestation. The
project ignores the historical scientific competence developed inthe State o f Rio de Janeiro in
the area o f natural resources for pharmacological purposes. The national development o f these
areas inBrazil started with Walter Mors who founded The Natural Products Nucleus decades ago
at the FederalUniversity o f Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). Gotlieb and Gilbert, additionally, have
writtenthe history o fusingbio active substances from the Brazilian Biological Diversity. There
are companies, such as EXTRACTA, being established at the Technological Park at UFRJ,
which are specialized inhighthroughput screening o fbio active substances from plant extracts.
Manyother groups are competent inthese areas at UFRJ. Itis essential that the project open the
possibility for a scientific initiative to identify functionally bio active substances from the
Atlantic Forest, to attract the pharmaceuticalprivate sector to invest and generate a fund to
support biological diversity conservation. This brings innovation to the proposal. This idea i s
outlined for the Amazon as a case study in"Sustainable Use O f Biodiversity - Components OfA
Model Project For Brazil" (de Castro, L.A .B.inBrazilian Joumal o f Medical and Biological
Research; 29(6) 688-699; 1996), which suggestshow rural communities can be involved inthis
process. This scientific paper offers additional information about other scientific articles on the
use o fbiological diversity. Bio Keepers Rights a strategy to stimulate "in situ" conservation o f
biological diversity i s described inde Castro, L.A B. (1997) "Workshop On Transboundary
Movement Of Living Organisms Resulting From ModernBiotechnology: Issues And
Opportunities For Policy Makers". Aarhus, Denmark, 1996, July 19-20. Proceedings 215 pp.
Edited byKalemani Mulongoy.47-60. Opportunities for the private sector participation on the
strategy to be built from the project are needed and are the only assurance o f financial
sustainability o f this investment.The proposal Financial Planpresented excludes the
participation o fthe private sector. So, inaddition to thejust mentioned Sc&T project above,
other possibilities should be considered and exist such as: carbon sequestration and ecotourism,
the latter mentionedbriefly inthe proposal.

These are my comments. The project can be reviewed to include the proposed initiatives.

                       Responseto STAP Comments by the ProjectTeam

1.STAP Comment: Financialsustainabilityandinnovativeaspects ofthe project
The reviewer feels that project activities "are not innovative and financially sustainable andas
such they are insufficient to revert deforestation process and reduce poverty inthe region, major
goal ofthe project, and as such the strongest element to accomplishthe project development
objective".

Response by the Project Team: theproject has not been designed to support innovative
technologies (neither to be innovative in the source offinancing). However, it does intend to
bring innovations in the establishment of a participatory strategy to implement existing
/adapted/alternative technologies. I n other words, one of the major project emphases is the
strengthening of an organizational structure aiming at the self-management of natural resources
by rural communities. It is believed that this self-management approach results in addressing
environmental issues (such as deforestation and erosion/lowproductivity) through actions that
go beyond theproductive and commercialpoints of view. Rather, by adopting the
aforementioned approach, theproject intends to broaden the rural communities perception of
the environment (of e.g., water, soils and biodiversity richness), hence improving natural
resources management (and, indirectly, the commercial andproduction management in the
small holder's rural sector).

I n addition, theproject itself is an innovative initiative of the State Secretariat of Agriculture
(SEAAPI), as it has been designed in close cooperation with the State Secretariat of Environment
and two environmentalNGOs (CIBrazil and SOSMata Atldntica), the latter (NGOs) with strong
biodiversity conservation work in the Atlantic Forest. I n addition, theproject introduces global
concerns (such as climate change and biodiversity) into theplanning and implementation of
sustainable rural development activities at microcatchment level (to address land degradation
andpoverty), an approach being successfully implemented in the countryfor more than two
decades. With respect tofinancial sustainability ofproject activities, see also response to
comment 2 below.

2. STAPComment:Needfor long-termconservationstrategiesto address biodiversity
Issues
The reviewer feels that, "despite ofmentioningrepeatedlythe need for conservation, [the
project] makes no proposal for the use o f this biological diversity as a major instrument for long
term conservation. Inaddition, also related to this subject, he noted that "one o f the weakest
aspects o f the project i s the almost entire absence of science and technology as an instrumentto
revert poverty and deforestation".

Response by the Project Team: Thispoint has been made more explicit in the document further
information has beenprovided in Annex 4). The team would like to stress that,particularly two
of theproject elements (Subcomponent 3.1 on capacity buildingfor community organization and
Subcomponent 1.1's activity on the design of a new incentive system) incorporate the
aforementioned view of a long-term conservation strategy.




                                                   101

Capacity buildingfor community organization and self-management of NR will be implemented
through a methodology developed by a private non-profit foundation attached to the Federal
 University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ),who is aproject partner and will collaborate with the
implementation of this activity. This is one of the examples where theproject will i) count on
scientijk and technological (S&T) support (in this case, support to community organization),
and ii) will implement a process of community organization which is not linked to the
government administration period of fours years.

 The new incentive system to be designed under Subcomponent 1.1would ensure ongoing
financial supportfor sustainable activities which create signijkant environmental benefits at the
local, regional and global levels withoutfurther GEF involvement (GEFfunds would not be used
on a recurrent basis, but would helpjump start other self-sustainingfinancial mechanisms.). I n
addition, the incentive system will seek to reducefinancial dependence on government resources,
(and also on government schedules and deadlines).

3. STAP Comment:Needfor increasedpost-harvestvalue-addedfrom agro-ecologicaland
non-woodforest products.The reviewercommentedthat "unless there is an alternativeto
additionally aggregate value to the products coming from populations residinginthe Atlantic
Forest, deforestation can not bereverted. Incentives and education are [important] but are not
enough."

Response by the Project Team: Agreed. Thispoint had already been incorporated intoproject
design but perhaps it was not clearlypresented. It has been addressed and made more explicit in
 the document Cfurther information has beenprovided in Annex 4). Subcomponent 2.1 on
Incentive Systemfor Integrated Ecosystem Management had already included incremental
actions that will include technical assistance, small investment and information needed to
 increase post-harvest value-addedfrom agro-ecological and non-woodforest products. These
actions will complement and improve the currentproduction systems supported by the baseline
programs, which are based on thefollowing systemsprevalent in the region: (i) conventional
systems: sugar cane, coffee, extensive livestock, manioc, corn, beans and rice; (ii) recently
 introduced systems:fruit production and olericulturehegetable growing. The incremental
 activities would support the integration and harmonization of local development andproductive
supportfor theplanning of the samefarms and microcatchments supported under the baseline
programs, aimed at the sustainable management of natural resources. These activities are also
aimed at ensuring thatpractices linked to theprincipal lines of action are effectively
 implemented. They are: a) recovery of degraded lands; b) redirection ofproductive systems
 toward systems that are socially and environmentalyfriendly; c) commercialization of products
 that are recommended in social and environmental terms; d) management of water resources;
 and e) sustainable use and management of biodiversity. For eachpilot microcatchment, these
practices would be defined in aparticipatory way, during thepreparation of the Microcatchment
 (PEM) and Individualyarm level (PID) Plans. For thepurposes of budget and concept
formulation, theproject team hasprepared apreliminary proposal of eligible activitiesfor
support under Subcomponent 2.1 (see Figure 1 on next page). The team consider eligible all the
 examples suggested by the reviewer:for example, incentives to theproduction of organic honey
 wouldfit under organic agriculture type of activity; of `pupunha "palm, under agroforestry
systems; ofpost-harvest value-addedfrom agro-ecological and non-woodforest products, under

                        Landscapes of the North-NorthwesternFluminense(GEF)

Introduction.The project would cover the watersheds o fthe rivers Imb6, Doce/Quitingute,
Macabu, Muriat and Costeira do Entorno da Mata do Carvzo which are mainly inthe
North/Northwest Fluminense(NNWF) regions, and also including a small part o f the Serrana
region which is similar socioeconomically to the NNWF. This annex summarizes the main
findings o f the social as~essment'~

State Context.              Covering an area o f 43,864.3 km2,the State o fRio de Janeiro has 91
municipalities, distributed among 6 meso-regions, with a population o f 14,39 1,282 (2000
Demographic Census); it has a demographic density o f 328.1 inhabitants per km2and one o f the
country's highest urbanization rates, equivalent to 96 percent. Its urban population i s 30,82 1,466
and the rural population i s 569,8 16. Inthe past decade (1991to 2000) the population growth rate
inthe State ofRio deJaneiro was lower thanthat oftherest ofthe country. Although inthe
previous decade the HDIof the State o f Rio de Janeiro improved (from 0.750 to 0.802) there
remains a wide gap between urban and rural areas interms of education, health, housing,
sanitation and income indicators, with rural areas significantly disadvantaged.

The agrarian structure of the State of Rio de Janeiro i s characterized primarily by smaller family
farms - for example, 53 percent of establishments are less than 10 ha insize -but larger
agribusinesses control the majority o f the farmland. Family farms tend to be more dependent on
manual labor, employing roughly twice the people as larger establishments, and have less access
to electricity and technical assistance, lower indices o fthe use o f fertilizer and corrective
practices, and less access to organized institutions (associations and cooperatives) than estate
farms. While agribusinesses show higher profits and are responsible for a more significant
percentage o f gross production value (GPV), family farmers produce more income and profit per
unit area(a difference o f47.8 percent). This suggests that Fluminensefamily agriculture is
competitive inrelation to estate farms.

RegionalContext.The project target area includes the NorthandNorthwest Fluminense regions
as well as part o f the Serrana region. The North Fluminenseregion includes 9 municipalities**
covering 9,767.0 km2with a population o f 698,783 inhabitantswho are 4.9 percent o f the State's
total population but 18.3 percent o f the State's rural population. The Northwest Fluminense
region includes 13 muni~ipalities'~covering 5,385.6 km2with a population o f 297,696
inhabitants who are only 2.1 percent of the State's population but 10.9 percent o f the rural


I6 The complete social assessment inPortuguese and English i s available inthe project files.
17 The social assessment i s based on an analysis of secondary data, as well primary data, including structured
interviews and communities meetings inthe Imbt watershed with a sample o f eleven communities.
'*Municipalities  are: Campos dos Goytacazes, Carapebus, Cardoso Moreira, Concei@o de Macabu, Macai,
QuissamB, SBo Fidtlis, SBo Francisco do Itabapoana and SBo JoBo da Barra.
l 9Municipalities are: Aperibt, B o m Jesus do Itabapoana, Cambuci, Italva, Itaocara, Itapemna, Laje do Muriat,

population. The project target area also includes two rural municipalities inthe Serrana region2'
with atotal populationo f20314.

Values o f socioeconomic indicators - including those for education, infant mortality, and income
- for the project target area are the worst inthe State, and are worse inthe rural than inthe urban
areas. Factors contributing to poor indicators and substandard living conditions are the lack o f
dynamism o f the agricultural sector, use of inadequate technologies, relatively little
industrialization and agro-industrial processing, and the opening o f agricultural markets inBrazil
since the 1990s to competition from heavily subsidized foreign imports. Hence, it i s not
surprisingthat duringthe past decade, the project target areahas experienced considerable
depopulation o f the countryside where living conditions are highlyprecarious, and concomitant
population increases inprovincial urbanplaces.

Regional agriculture, the main occupation and source o f income for a significant portion o f the
population inthe project target area, i s predominantly characterized by: (a) boom and bust cycles
o f sugar-cane and coffee monocropping that stimulates both deforestation duringbooms and
abandonment o f degraded areas during busts; and (b) extensive cattle raising that incorporates
few new technologies, resulting inthe progressive loss o fcompetitiveness due to low
productivity, falling prices paid to producers, competition from other regions and countries, lack
o fpasture recovery, non-introduction of new types o f animal feed, and the effects o fnatural and
environmental factors, especially reductions inthe availability o f water resources2*.

The agrarian structure i s the same as for the State overall (see above) with even higher
concentrations o f small family farms. Many o f these small farms generate very low monetary
incomes, and are characterized by dependence on manual labor, minimal access to electricity,
little use o f fertilizers or corrective measures, and little use o f technical assistance and rural
extension, as well as weak organization through relatively few associations or cooperatives.

The project target area is also characterized by low rainfall andhighevaporation rates and in
places, the annual water balance can even be negative, with more evaporation than rainfall. The
terrain i s rugged, with strong slopes, which, due to inadequate planting and soil management
systems, show signs of degradation, with eroded and impoverished soils. Anthropic interventions
such as improper waste disposal, deforestation, improper agricultural practices and excessive use
o f agrochemicals contribute to environmental problems such as pollution o f waterways,
accelerated soil erosion, and contamination, among others.

communities22.Most of the small family farmers interviewedraised a combination o f the
following: bananas, and other h i t , eucalyptus, vegetables, manioc (cassava), corn, beans,
poultry and pigs, dairy and beef cattle, and sugar cane. Coffee and bananas were important crops
inthe past. Insome communities alternative income generation opportunitiesexisted in
commerce, the civil service, and work inthe oil fields. Also, many people work as day laborers,
or cover part o f their subsistence needs from pensionpayments Outmigration, especially by
young people, is common.

semi-intensive dairy and beef cattle, the extraction o f forest resources, coffee plantations (inthe
Serrana region) and sugar cane (Campos dos Goytacazes). At first, coffee and sugar cane were
grown mainly on large plantations usingslave labor duringthe 1gthcentury, although these large
farms coexisted with a social minority o f small farmers who combined coffee crops with the
production o f subsistence goods invarious sharecropping arrangements. Inrecent years, many o f
the old mills have beentaken over by larger mills or closed, so that coffee and sugar production
i s now carried out by a smaller number o f companies. The recent mechanization of the sugar
cane economy helped to increase production capacity, ledto the concentration o fproduction on
large plantations and decreased the number o fpeople who made their living full-timethrough
agriculture as well as subsistence crops, thus increasingthe informaljob sector. Factors
contributing to increasing outmigration include worsening conditions for family farmers,
fragmentation o f holdings due to inheritance, and land conflicts, especially with absentee
owners.

On larger farms, sugar cane and extensive cattle-raisingnow predominate; due to the
mechanization o f the former and the gradual replacement o f dairy cattle with beef cattle inthe
latter, there i s a decrease inthe demand for both hll-time andtemporary labor, thus contributing
to make local living conditions even more vulnerable and unstable, and increasing the rural
exodus, heightened by the possibility o fnewjob opportunities inthe Campos oil fields which are
highly attractive to young, unemployed people from rural areas. The State government's
incentive program for fruit production has had an impact; some large and small land-owners
have beguna process o f diversifying their activities and making them more dynamic.

On small farms, population density i s higher and agricultural production and subsistence
strategies are usually more diversified and combined with a wide array o f other economic
activities and income sources such as dairy farming, poultry raising, fish, beekeeping, h i t
growing, eucalyptus, processing andmarketingo f agricultural products, door-to-door sales,
leasing o fportions of farm lots, employment and temporaryjobs, and pensions. Most small
farms utilize only family labor, and there i s a limitedavailability o f machinery and tools; animal
traction i s often hired or bartered. For commercial purposes, insome areas the main crops are
bananas and sugar cane, elsewhere dairy farming and sale o f milk, and inother areas eucalyptus.


22  Communities included two agrarian reform communities -- Novo Horizonte (comprised of four
communities) and Santo Inhcio (comprised of two communities) and five traditional rural communities

Major concerns inthe countryside are lack o f access to landby colonists and sharecroppers, and
decreasing job opportunities inagribusinesses. People interviewedconcurred that outmigration
has increased since the 1 9 8 0 especially among young people. The proximity o f the oil fields,
                                    ~ ~
with somejob opportunities, i s attractive and insome areas is an essentialpart o fthe income o f
families living there. The importance o fpensions and o f family members working inthe civil
service i s also growing. Insummary, subsistence activities have become diversified, the
importance o f the agricultural and livestock sector has decreased, and the importance o f
commerce, civil service and the income o fresidents working inthe oil fields has increased.

A key social issue is the growing rural exodus. Residentsinterviewed expressed strong desires to
motivate their young people to stay but social and economic forces combine to spur
outmigration. Some older residents interviewed felt their way o f life was dyingout.

Nonetheless, the populations o fmost o f the communities studiedtend to think that there has been
a recent improvement inthe quality o f life at local level, particularly interms o f improvements in
infrastructure and public services. There is greater access to electricity; services improved inthe
areas o f education, health, transportation and communications. These were accomplishedin
manycases at the initiative o fthe communities (e.g., rural electrification, home improvements,
drainage works), or with the support o f government programs (e.g., pest control and adult
literacy courses). The main continuing deficiencies identified are insanitation and support to
productive activities, both o f which would be addressed inthe project. Inall areas studied, basic
sanitation remains substandard, with few residences having septic tanks and waste being dumped
directly into streams. This situation places serious pressure on natural resources and i s
exemplified by the situation inthe urban area o f the municipal seat o f Trajano de Moraes, which
dumpsits waste directly into the headwaters o fthe ImbCRiver.

Another key social issue, relevant to the project, i s the relative weakness o f most organized
community associations inthe project target area. Strengthening local organizations i s a central
activity for the project (subcomponent 3.1).

Environmentalissues. An existing study o fthe impact o ftraditional productive activities on the
environment inthe area o f influence o f the ImbCRiver highlightstheir harmful aspects.23For
example, the study noted that the continued cultivation o f manioc on hillsides, sugar cane in flat
areas, cattle raising, the over-exploitation o f areas used for livestock, and soil preparation and
management techniques (utilization o f animal traction with oxen and aiveca plows, frequent
grading and hoeing so that crops remain "clean") contribute to soil erosionbecause they lead to
heightened soil degradation and exposure, decreased filtration and increased surface runoff.
Deforestation and extensive cultivation were also thought to be contributing to the dryingup of
springsandstreams. However, these soil degradationproblems could be amelioratedby
diversifying commercial crops (introduction o f vegetable and fruit crops) which would use more
labor and generate greater yields per unit area.

However, inrecent years environmental awarenesshas been growing. In2003, these
communities have undergone an effective process o fbecoming aware o f the need to protect
forest resources and adopt soil and water conservation practices (protection o f springs, incentives
for reforestation, utilization o fbio-fertilizers and new cropping and soil management techniques,
etc.). For example, the agricultural practices usedinone community recently were transformed
with the replacement o fintense use o fherbicides, burningand limitedsoil correctionpractices
bythe use o fnatural defenses and soil protectiontechniques, leaving soils fallow, crop rotation,
associating different crops, and green manure.

Inother communities there is increasingconcernwithregardto the reductioninwater levels,
which local residents associate with deforestation as well as drainage works inthe past, andto
soil fertility which they associate with the long-term use o f land for sugar cane. For example, in
one community, residents have noted a major reduction inwater levels and an increase insoil
degradation which they associated with the replacement o f bananas by pasture in 1985. In
another community, concern regardingthe reduction inwater levels was seen to be contributing
to leading large land-owners to invest in fish farming, with two complementary objectives:
raising fish and retaining water. Ingeneral, observers agree that deforestation andburninghave
decreased, and there i s growing interest inreforestationandpreservationo f existing forests.

Perceptions o f local residents with governmental environmental agencies i s mixed. Federal
agencies, such as IBAMA and the forest police, are viewed as beingprimarily enforcement
orientedwhereas residents expressed great interest ingaining environmental and agricultural
technical assistance, an area to be directly addressedby this project.

A major challenge for the project would be inovercomingtraditional resistance to the
introduction o fnew technologies andpractices, which inturn i s derived from cultural factors,
riskaversion, andpreviouspoor experiences with more traditional top-down models o frural
extension. The project seeks to overcome this challenge byutilizing a highlyparticipatory agro-
ecological approach to extension, an approach that emphasizes strengthening local organizations,
equality o f learning exchanges with farmers, and empowerment.

Monitoring and Evaluation.

The proposed approach for project Monitoringand Evaluation system includes measurements o f
impacts on people and on institutional performance. Social and economic baseline information
has beendeveloped for the MIS for periodic tracking and monitoring. See Annex 3 for the
project participatorymonitoring and evaluation system and Annex 3, Appendix 1for a list o f
social indicators.
