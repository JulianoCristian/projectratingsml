Global Environmental Objectives
Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the proposed project is to promote an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach to guide the development and
implementation of sustainable land management (SLM) practices in the North and Northwest (NNWF) regions of Rio de Janeiro State. The desired principal
outcomes for the primary target group (smallholder families and communities) are: (i) improved capacity and organization for NRM, and (ii) increased adoption
of IEM and SLM concepts and practices.
The global environmental objectives are to: (i) address threats to biodiversity of global
importance, (ii) reverse land degradation in agricultural landscapes, (iii) enhance carbon
sequestration, and (iv) increase awareness at all levels of the value of adopting an IEM approach in the management of natural resources. The desired principal
outcomes for the global environment are: (i) conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and (ii) increased carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems.

o Implementation Status Overview
b   The Project closed on November 30, 2011. Substantial progress was made in meeting the project's targets, with several targets exceeded. Some key targets include: 1,938
5   producers have adopted IEM practices (102% of project target); 48 rural community organizations have been created and strengthened (120% of the project target); and technical
0   assistance and investments for the improvement of agricultural practices have been provided to 1,292 rural producers (89% of project target). With regards to capacity building and
0   environmental training, most targets have been met or exceeded. The project management team is now placing emphasis on the completion of the final evaluation of the project.
-5"  Follow-up activities to the Project include the implementation of the Rio de Janeiro Sustainable Rural Development Project which builds on the central and local institutional structures
-   established under this Project and will, in addition: promote the adoption of sustainable agricultural production systems and improve competitiveness of small producers through the
provision of technical assistance and financial incentives, and strengthen rural institutions and their coordination mechanisms.
