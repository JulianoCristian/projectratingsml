development\n            impact as substantial, Bank performance satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance as satisfactory. Key lessons learned\n            from the project implementation include: There should be one\n            Basic River Management Authority responsible for the overall\n            planning and management of flood protection and water\n            resources. Effective coordination with governments and\n            government agencies is important to avoid project delays. If\n            a flood control project involves substantial amount of land\n            acquisition and resettlement, a well-prepared Resettlement\n            Action Plan and Implementation Plan are prerequisites.\n            Widening and deepening of major river channels by dredging\n            involved disposal of large quantities of spoil materials\n            dredged from the river channels. Suitable types of dredging\n            machinery should be carefully reviewed and determined based\n            on river conditions to ensure efficient performance of\n            dredging work by contracts. Adequate and timely counterpart\n            fund is critical. Procurement training by the Bank and the\n            Basic Management Authority is important. A longer\n            implementation period should be planned for if the project\n            works cover wide area with large quantity of earthwork\n            carried out under water in major river channels."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
