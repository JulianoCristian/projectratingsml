The objective was to plant 900 ha of cinchona trees.\n            The project was implemented smoothly, but its success was\n            seriously undermined by sharp decreases in world cinchona\n            prices over the implementation period. An ounce of Quinine\n            Sulphate was selling at US$6.50 during project preparation\n            but, by 1977 the price had fallen to US$4.50 per ounce and\n            kept falling thereafter to US$2.30 per ounce. The decline of\n            quinine sulphate prices has had a major impact on the rates\n            of return and there are major risks of further deterioration\n            in world prices of quinine sulphate, which, again, might\n            disrupt the purchase of cinchona bark. Farmers may also be\n            unwilling to plant cinchona seedlings again once they have\n            uprooted their trees and harvested their crop."}, "docdt": "1988-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
