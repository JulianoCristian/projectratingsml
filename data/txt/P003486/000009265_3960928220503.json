technology and\n            advanced materials in the maintenance and rehabilitation of\n            track, and to meet the shortage of critically-needed items\n            of material, components, and equipment for rehabilitation of\n            locomotives and rolling stock; (b) two capacity expansion\n            components, to complete double-tracking of the 944 Km Zhegan\n            line, and to expand capacity at the Xuzhou marshalling\n            yards; and (c) an action plan for the implementation of the\n            Railway Traffic Costing System leading to formulation of\n            recommendations for tariff restructuring. In addition, the\n            project will rely heavily on five studies which were started\n            as part of the project preparation, focusing on track\n            maintenance and rehabilitation, an integrated system plan\n            for electrification, an integrated system plan for\n            telecommunications, and a railway investment study."}, "docdt": "1991-08-28T00:00:00Z"}
