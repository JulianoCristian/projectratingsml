PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GHANA - ACCRA/TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT II
(CREDIT 499-GH)
PREFACE
1.        This report presents the results of a performance review of the
Accra/Tema Water Supply Project - Second Stage for which Credit 499-GH of
US$10.4 million was made to the Government of Ghana in June 1974. The
credit was fully disbursed and closed in June 1981.
The report consists of Highlights and a Project Completion Report
(PCR) prepared by the Western Africa Regional Office. In preparing the PCR
from a review of Bank files, the Region took into account the findings of a
project completion mission carried out in September 1982, at which time a
draft report was discussed with Government. A draft completion report pre-
pared by the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC), the Government-
owned entity responsible for implementing the project was also utilized.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED).
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the PCR were sent to
the Government, the beneficiary (GWSC), and the co-financiers - the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and the African Development Bank -
for comments. Comments were received from CIDA and they have been taken
into account.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GHANA - Accra/Tema Water Supply Project II (Credit 499.GH)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       This project was an essential part of the second stage of implemen-
tation of the long range master plan for water supply and sewerage for Greater
Accra/Tema Area (ATMA).  The IDA credit of US$10.4 million financed the con-
struction of 16.8 m high earth dam on the Densu RIver at Weija, together with
limited expansion of the distribution systems in Greater Accra and adjacent
rural areas.  Leakage detection and training programs did not materialize.
2.       Although parts of the distribution system extensions were not built,
primarily for lack of local funds and materials, the basic physical objective
was met, thereby providing the water resource capacity to meet existing and
future needs for potable water to some 800,000 in the Accra Tema Metropolitan
Area. The dam was completed in 1978 and had been capable of limited utiliza-
tion before then, but its full exploitation is dependent upon completion of
the CIDA and AFDB parallel-financed treatment plants and transmission mains.
These are1 ot expected to be completed until 1983, about four years later than
expected.-
3.       The estimated total cost for completion is US$51.5   million which is
167A/ -above the appraisal estimate of US$44.7 million. This cost overrun has
been kept small by reducing the scope of the project and fortuitious devalua-
tion of the currency of the contractor.
4.       The country shortage of foreign currency for procurement of essential
spare parts, motorfuels and chemicals has completely undermined the opera-
tional performance of GWSC primarily through a lack of transportation which
affects servicing of remote locations, leakage detection, mains repairs, meter
reading, bill delivery and system surveillance. Shortage of spare parts is
already having an effect on the Bank financed structures.
5.       The rate of return on operational assets was being met during the
early period of project execution. But the delayed tariff increase due in
1979 (implementated in 1981) and rampant inflation have created a negative
rate of return for ATMA, and a concommitant failure to meet internal cash
generation requirements for the proejct as well as seriously impairing its
liquidity. It has therefore defaulted on the major financial covenants in the
agreements.
1/   The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) reports that the
treatment plant and transmission mains are presently scheduled for com-
pletion in January 1984, by which time the treatment plant would have
passed through a one-year maintenance period. The McCarthy service
reservoir (Map 2) probably will be completed by mid-1985.
2/   Total may not include all of Cd4.1 million grant aid by CIDA for
engineering supervision.
3/   However, CIDA contributions to the project increased by about 36%
expressed in US dollars, or about 45% expressed in Canadian dollars.



v
6.        The very high turnover of GWSC's top level officers, the scarcity of
qualified and experienced staff, lack of managerial autonomy from Government
and staff redundancy at the lower levels have militated against any real
institutional development through this project. The need to strengthen GWSC
has long been recognized and a follow-up project has been accordingly pre-
pared. It envisages a management improvement program, substantial technical
assistance and funds for spare parts and rehabilitation works.
7.        The benefits of the project, as completed, equate to a negative rate
of return which is less than the appraisal forecast of 6% due to project time
overruns and higher costs than anticipated. However, if a tariff increase is
implemented in 1983 to restore (in part) the real value of the tariff level,
the rate of return will be raised to 2.5% (50% increase) or to 5.6% (100%
increase).



GHANA
ACCRA/TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT STAGE II (CREDIT 499-GH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report reviews the Second Ghana Water Supply Project (Credit
499-GH), for which an IDA credit of US$10.4 was signed in June 26, 1974.
Parallel financing is provided by the African Development Bank (AFDB) and the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).  The Borrower was the
Government of Ghana with onlending to the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation
(GWSC).  The objective of the project was to increase the capacity to meet
existing and future needs for potable water to some 800,000 people in the
Accra/Tema metropolis and to extend water supply to some 170,000 people living
in adjacent rural areas. Although the chief IDA-financed components were com-
pleted by mid-1980, overall project completion will be delayed until 1983,
about four years later than originally envisaged, due mainly to local mate-
rials and skilled labor shortages resulting from the generally poor economic
situation of Ghana during the period of project implementation.1/
1.02     National responsibility for the overall planning, development and
operations for public water supply and sewerage in Ghana is entrusted to GWSC,
established as a wholly-owned Government corporation under the Ghana Water and
Sewerage Act of 1965. GWSC operates under the general direction of the
Ministry of Works and Housing. GWSC's policies during project execution were
determined by a seven member Board of Directors appointed by the Government,
and the chief executive is the Managing Director.
1.-63    GWSC's operating responsibility is divided between its headquarters
and nine area/regional organizations which have primary responsibility for
operation, management and development in their respective areas/regions. The
Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area (ATMA) has operations almost as large as the rest
of GWSC's activities combined.
1.04     GWSC was created as a result of a study of water supply and sewerage
needs of Ghana by WHO consultants in 1961 and a UNDP project in 1963 which re-
sulted in a master plan for water supply and sewerage for ATMA. This plan
identified short and long-term needs, and served as the basis for the first
Bank Group support of the sector (Credit 160-GH).
1.05     Credit 160-GH was approved in 1969 for US$3.5 million.  It assisted
in expanding the water s7upply distribution network in Accra/Tema and construc-
ting a sewerage system in central Accra. The project was completed in 1973 at
a cost overrun of about 32% and a delay of the completion of the water supply
and sewerage components of six months and two years, respectively. The OED
1/   OED Note:  Another factor contributing to delays was the suspension of
foreign exchange payments to the Ghanian civil works contractor financed
by AFDB because the Government failed to meet its debt repayment schedule.

concluded that, while the major physical objectives of the water supply com-
ponent had been met, that of the sewerage component had not.  Failure of pot-
ential users to connect to the system for lack of appropriate compulsory sewer
connection legislation and high costs of connection were cited as reasons.
The audit report also noted that institution building and financial objectives
of the project were not implemented as expected at appraisal.
1.06     The Bank has intended to continue in the development of the sector in
Ghana.  During the latter stages of the Second Project, which was a logical
corollary to the First, the Bank prepared a Technical Assistance Project
consisting of a management improvement program and an updating of the Accra/-
Tema master plan for water supply and sewerage. Negotiations for the proposed
US$3.2 million technical assistance credit were delayed to allow Government
opportunity to examine their priorities. Through reappraisal the proposed
credit has been increased to US$10.0 million. The proposed credit, which
includes a substantial rehabilitation component, may be approved late in
FY83. Thereafter a third water supply project is envisaged for the next round
of extensions, again most likely to receive co-financing.
1.07     GWSC was not obligated to prepare a completion report under the
Credit Agreement. However, by letter of July 7, 1981, the Bank did request
GWSC to prepare a draft report and guidelines for its preparation were sent.
The draft was received in March 1982, and a brief mission in June reviewed
with GWSC the needs for some additional information. In its final version,
back-to-office reports and correspondence form the basis of this PCR. A
review of this PCR was held with the borrower in September 1982.



II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01     Ghana underwent a phase of rapid urbanization and industrial growth
in the immediate years after independence in 1957. The bulk of this develop-
ment occurred in the towns of Accra and Tema whose combined population rose to
about 500,000 by 1965. Envisioning further rapid development, the UNDP com-
missioned a master plan study for water supply and sewerage for the Accra/Tema
area to supply the needs of this area until the year 2000.
2.02     The study commissioned in 1963 and completed two years later, recom-
mended four stages of development, the initial one of which--a package water
supply scheme drawing from the Volta River at Kpong--was completed with con-
tractor/supplier financing in 1966.  In 1969, an IDA credit of US$3.5 million
was approved to finance the first stage of the sewerage system and construc-
tion of the extensions to the water distribution system in Accra/Tema. At
that time the Government also requested IDA to finance a second stage project.
2.03     GWSC retained the master plan consultants to assist in preparation of
the Second Project, and initially the Bank was presented with a proposal for a
water supply project totalling 082.375 million (US$71.2 million) with a
foreign exchange component of US$53 million, and a sewerage project of similar
proportions. This proposal was prepared by GWSC by extraction of relevant
items from the master plan.
2.04     The master plan was reviewed by the Bank in 1966 and substantial
changes in design criteria, concepts and phasing were recommended to reduce
costs in light of available financial resources. First Project was based on
these recommendations. However, the initial GWSC request for the Second
Project required considerable updating, as it included reconstruction of the
Weija dam, which was destroyed in the 1968 floods. GWSC retained the master
plan consultants to assist in project preparation.
2.05     The project was initially appraised in November 1971 to cost about
US$16.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$10.0 million. Main
components of the project proposed at that time included:
a)   a new dam at Weija with intake and pumping station;
b)   improvements and expansion of the Weija treatment plant to increase
capacity by 111,000 cu.m/day (24.5 mgd);
c)   7.8 km (4.7 mi) of transmission main and 36.6 km (22.7 mi) of
distribution main;
d)   a 227,000 cu.m (5 mg) service reservoir; and
e)   for rural supplies in the metropolitan area, about 160 km (100 mi) of
pipelines and ancillary works.



2.06     With the change of Government in Ghana in early 1972, processing of
the project was deferred until the new Government's investment policies and
its economic situation were clarified. Meanwhile the cedi was devalued and
later the US dollar underwent devaluation, creating uncertainties in cost
estimates.  The Green Cover SAR was released in September 1972, but continuing
concern over the validity of the cost estimates led to revisions in February
1973, indicating project costs of US$19.9 million including US$11.8 million in
foreign exchange.
2.07     In succeeding months various proposals to deal with ever-escalating
project costs were considered, but eventually, with Bank encouragement, AFDB
and CIDA agreed in principle to participate in the project. Pending reformu-
lation of project financing and approval of the credit, and with approval of
the Bank. GWSC went ahead with tendering for the Weija dam. Three bids were
received on July 7, 1973, but the lowest bid was considerably higher (30%
overall, 55% on foreign exchange) than the engineer's most recent estimates.
To some extent the apparent cost escalations were caused by the first inter-
national oil crises. Another group of bids for rural water supply works which
were opened in December 1973, were 38.5% higher overall than engineer's
estimates (88.5% higher on foreign exchange).
2.08     The potential involvement of CIDA required a further cost estimate
increase to account for Canadian procurement. In December 1973, it was esti-
mated that CIDA-financed goods and services would add US$5.8 million (20%) to
the then estimated total project cost of US$27.3 million. Agreement by CIDA
and AFDB to participate in the project was reached in early 1974, with IDA
assuming financing of the foreign exchange component of the project components
previously tendered, together with some additional items.
2.09     The credit was negotiated during May 9-17, 1974, and the draft credit
and project agreements were approved by Government on June 5. The Board ap-
proved a credit of US$10.4 million on June 27, 1974 representing 23.3% of
total project costs estimated at US$44.7 million. AFDB agreed to lend 40 mil-
lion Units of Account (approx. US$4.8 million) and CIDA, US$5.5 million. In
addition, CIDA agreed to grant US$2.0 million. Contributions from Ghana, in-
cluding GWSC's internal cash generation, were estimated to be 025.7 million
(approx US$22.0 million).

secondary and tertiary distribution mains.
Covenants
2.11     Few issues developed through credit approval and these were resolved
by insertion of certain covenants. Most of the expected initial issues -
design standards and projections - were resolved during development of the
First Water Supply Project.
2.12     The leading technical issue which arose was in the design of the
Weija dam. A water resource study funded by a bilateral agency seriously
questionned the safety and adequacy of the proposed Weija dam as designed by
GWSC's consultants. Specifically the study, conducted by a highly-reputable



- 7 -
company, indicated that the design flood flows 6hould be four times larger
than projected by the master plan consultant, necessitating major design
changes. Questions on structural safety because of earthquake dangers were
also raised.
2.13     Thus during project preparation, the Bank required that GWSC retain
two international experts (a hydrologist and an earth dams specialist) to
review designs. These experts accepted the master plan consultant's designs,
although the earth dams specialist recommended a few modifications in design
and proposed operation procedures.  Two covenants of the Project Agreement
refer to these recommendations (Sections 3.02 and 3.04) wherein GWSC is to
arrange for expert periodic inspection of the dam, and it is to maintain a
program for gathering hydrologic data.
2.14     A second issue derived from the sewerage system constructed under the
First Project, to which only two hundred and forty buildings were connected.
Section 3.07 of the Project Agreement required GWSC:
a)   to submit to the Bank for comment a program for connection to and
expansion of the sewerage system, and
b)   to implement an agreed-upon program.
2.15      Noting also the large unaccounted-for water demands, Section 3.07 of
the Project Agreement  required a leakage detection program to be formulated
and implemented by GWSC with finance from the credit (after review of the
program by the Bank).  Similarly, to improve efficiency of the Kpong treatment
works, the Project Agreement (Sec. 3.05) required GWSC to retain a consultant
to prepare recommendations for improved operations. The recommendations as
agreed upon between GWSC and the Bank were then to be implemented.
2.16      The Project Agreement (Sec. 3.06) required two additional programs to
be prepared and implemented with approval of the Bank:
a)   a training program funded from the credit, and
b)   an annual mains-laying program to be submitted at least six months
prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.
2.17      The annual rate of return covenanted in section 4.02 of the Project
Agreement required not less that 7% for FY76 and FY77, 3% for FY78 and FY79
and 7% thereafter. The temporary drop to 3% was predicated on the completion
of the project adding significant assets without an immediate commensurate
increase in revenues. the covenant also required GWSC by FY80 to cover
operating, maintenance and depreciation costs for its sewerage services. A
debt limitation covenant (Section 4.03 of the Project Agreement) stipulated
that revenues shall be not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirements.



- 8 -
2.18     As both malaria and bilharzia were endemic to the project area and to
the Densu River basin in particular, the Project Agreement (Sec. 3.08)
covenanted that GWSC would take all feasible measures to ensure that the
project would be carried out with due regard to ecological and environmental
factors. This applied to both disease vectors and water quality. The con-
sultant's report indicated that the disease threat to villagers in the basin
would decrease from resettlement because of improved sanitation facilities and
greater distance from water bodies.
2.19     The design of the Weija dam was established at 55 ft. (16.8 m), or
8 ft (2.4 m) above the height deemed desirable for water supply, in order to
provide for possible future diversions for irrigation. A covenant was
inserted to ensure adequate allocation of the reservoir yield to water supply
needs. Specifically, Section 4.05 of the Credit Agreement required Government
to establish and maintain an allocation policy suitable to IDA. Uncertainties
in low flow data and reservoir sedimentation rates prevented an assessment of
project costs to an irrigation component.
2.20     The Credit Agreement stipulated five conditions of effectiveness:
a)   a tariff increase sufficient for ATMA to meet a rate of return of 7%
for FY75,
b)   CIDA and ADB loan agreements,
c)   subsidiary loan agreement, and
d)   legal opinions.
The necessary tariff increases of 50% were met by August 1, 1974 but the
deadline for effectiveness was extended from October 24, 1974 to January 31,
1975 to allow for delays in the signing of the CIDA agreement and the associa-
ted legal opinion. Credit effectiveness was declared on January 7, 1975.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION AND COST
Parallel-financed Components
3.01     AFDB and CIDA-financed components of the project, scheduled for com-
pletion by the end of 1978, have encountered a number of delays, and these
components are not expected to be completed until 1983.  However, the new
treatment plant at Weija may be sufficiently advanced at the end of 1982 to
allow operation to begin.  The service reservoir will not be completed for
another year at least, but it is not essential to the immediate enjoyment of
benefits from the new plant. Essential new transmission mains should be
completed in 1983.1/
3.02     Full benefits anticipated from Credit 499-GH are dependent on
completion of the parallel-financed components. This PCR has been delayed in
part in anticipation of imminent completion, but in order that it is not
further delayed, it is prepared solely for Credit 499-GH components. However,
a brief review of the main difficulties delaying AFDB and CIDA components is
appropriate.
3.03     Appointment of Canadian consultants for the CIDA/AFDB components and
the CIDA requirement for Canadian procurement led to a delay of about one year
in issuance of tender documents.  First, there were contractual disputes
arising chiefly from the ownership and responsibility for the drawings, which
had been prepared by the GWSC master plan consultant but were to be modified
by the Canadian consultant. The matter was finally resolved by the Canadian
consultant taking responsibility for modified documents, with the master plan
consultant agreeing to check shop drawings as necessary. A second delay arose
from the repackaging of tender documents for a single supply/construct con-
tract into five separate contracts. A number of design changes were also in-
s ti tu ted.
3.04     Procurement of large-diameter pipe for the transmission mains raised
procedural problems. After an earlier tender call for reinforced concrete
pipe had been cancelled because of poor response (one bid, deemed excessive),
GWSC urged procurement by negotiation of asbestos-cement pipe from a local
manufacturer. However, the lending agencies unanimously viewed the reliabi-
lity of large-diameter asbestos-cement (up to 950 mm or 36 inches) with reser-
vations, and AFDB, which was to finance these mains, eventually required steel
pipe for the raw water main but allowed asbestos-cement or alternative pipe
for the treated water mains. AFDB insisted on international tendering, which
was carried out with good response. A contract was awarded to a foreign
supplier (steel pipe) in April 1977, which represented a delay of over two
years and an increase of 200% in (foreign) cost over appraisal estimates, in
part due to the inclusion of 7.0 km (4.2 mi) of 700mm (28-inch) primary
distribution main planned at appraisal to be supplied and laid by GWSC.
However, some savings were realized by reducing the length of the major
transmission mains by 1.5 km (1.0 mi).
1/   The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) reports that the
treatment plant and transmission mains are presently scheduled for com-
pletion in January 1984, by which time the treatment plant would have
passed through a one-year maintenance period. The McCarthy service
reservoir (Map 2) probably will be completed by mid-1985.



- 10 -
3.05     The treatment plant (and service reservoir) civil works contract was
subject to AFDB international bidding procedures. Six bids were opened in
April 1977, but differences arose over the evaluation of tenders. Eventually,
the award went to a Ghanaian contractor but only after stringent assurances
had been provided by Government to provide all necessary support to the
contractor. These assurances included Government guarantees for advanced
payments, performance bonds, payment bonds and insurance. The selected con-
tractor began work in early 1978, but he rapidly fell behind due to lack of
transport and excavating equipment, late payments in cedis, and shortages in
building materials and skilled labor. Completion scheduled for end-1979 has
yet to be realized.  The consequences of this delay was far-reaching and
subject to much analysis, including consideration of cancellation of con-
tract. However, it was belatedly discovered that the performance bond had
never been provided by Government, and it was felt that under the macro-econo-
mic conditions prevailing in the country another contractor could not do
better.
3.06     It was planned that GWSC forces would lay the transmission mains, but
doubts developed early in the project of GWSC's capacity to undertake this
work on schedule, and GWSC agreed to seek tenders from Ghanaian contractors.
The award (Jan. 1978) went to the contractor who had also been awarded the
treatment plant civil works. Anticipated for completion by April 1980, the
laying of the 17.1 km (10.3 mi) mains was handicapped by various difficulties
of the type previously described.  Completion is now scheduled for late 1983.
3.07     Delays in the civil works contracts of AFDB resulted in substantial
delays in the C'IDA-financed contracts, particularly for construction super-
vision and installation of treatment plant equipment. Resultant extra foreign
costs have been financed by an additional Cd$3.796 million of CIDA funds,
bringing CIDA's participation to Cd$10.805 million (approx. US$8.6 million).
AFDB has also increased its finance to the project from the original 4.0 mil-
lion U.A. to 6.4 million U.A. (approx. US$8.2 million).
GWSC-financed Components
3.08     The primary, secondary and tertiary distribution system components of
the project were to be laid by GWSC's labor force.  For the primary system,
AFDB was to finance equipment as well as technical assistance.  IDA was to
finance the pipe and fittings for the secondary and tertiary systems. How-
ever, in November 1974, GWSC stated that asbestos-cement pipe would be used
for the distribution extensions and that it would be purchased from local
producers by negotiated contract. Thus, IDA participation in the distribution
extensions was limited to financing pipeline valves and fittings and other
equipment as discussed later in this report.  AFDB-financed equipment was lent
to the contractor laying the urgent transmission mains project component.
Country economic difficulties led to cash flow problems and a shortage of
pipe. Lack of transport for the construction unit over the last few years has
also prevented any significant progress. Only about 15 km (9.4 mi) of primary
distribution system extensions are expected to be completed by the end of
1982, which represents slightly less than half of the originally planned 32 km



(20 mi). Of secondary and tertiary extensions, perhaps 40 km (24 mi) have
been installed, mainly during 1974-75.
3.09     GWSC also financed the resettlement of villagers from the areas to be
flooded by the Weija reservoir. A Ghanaian university unit prepared the
studies which served as the basis of project appraisal. It was estimated that
2000 people in eight villages would be flooded out with perhaps another 14,000
people in several villages indirectly affected. In fact only six villages
were resettled as two others were later found to be located sufficiently above
the flood waters.
3.10     The traditional farming villages and their lands were tribally held,
leading to property acquisition problems, which were only resolved on a vil-
lage by village basis over several years and at significant cost although it
was originally understood that no land costs-would be incurred. The univer-
sity was hired to prepare detailed designs and tender documents to be let out
to local contractors. Work fell behind schedule for a variety of reasons:
delays in document preparation, shortage of cement and roofing sheets and lack
of funds. Piped water supply has been provided to five of the six resettle-
ments. Domiabra, the largest of the six, is dependent on a 2 m deep dug well,
while awaiting eventual installation of piped water. Domiabra is also without
latrines. Although the resettlement housing is considered an improvement over
traditional dwellings, the new villages are poorly laid out.
3.11     An unexpected benefit of the reservoir has been the establishment of
a significant fishing industry supporting directly over 100 families, and in-
directly, perhaps many more. So attractive is fishing, that it drew away
labor from the treatment plant civil works.  Most of the formal fishing is by
immigrants from Adah, a fishing village at the mouth of the Volta River. This
village has a high schistosomiasis prevalence rate, and it is held responsible
for spreading the disease to Volta Lake and Weija Reservoir. It is now esti-
mated that 50-65% of villagers near the reservoir suffer from this disease,
primarily of the urinary form. The worm load rates are not known. Only a
regular treatment program would seem effective in combating what here is
basically an occupational disease.
3.12     GWSC was also responsible for financing the civil works for rural
water supply which were tendered locally in July 1973. The recommendation for
award went to a foreign contractor, with a local office, who was also the re-
commended bidder of the two who bid for the pipe supply contract to be funded
partly by Credit 499-GH. Delays in Government approval allowed the tenders to
lapse. With the approval of IDA, negotiations were held with two supply
bidders, and a combined supply/lay contract was awarded on June 27, 1974 to
the foreign contractor. This contractor, who based his bid on supply of pipe
from one of two asbestos-cement pipe manufacturers in Ghana, received a 24%
escalation in supply prices over his initial bid. Supply of fittings
(Schedule 3 of contract R/2) was the only IDA-financed component.
3.13     A second Ghanaian asbestos-cement pipe manufacturer who had not bid,
raised objections and insisted on sharing supply fifty-fifty with the other
manufacturer. Government formally directed GWSC to delete the supply of



- 12 -
asbestos-cement pipe from the supply/lay contract, a step wnich resulted in
a breach of contract and claims for damages by the foreign contractor and his
local supplier.  GWSC eventually became the pipe supplier through subcontracts
with the two manufacturers. The IDA-financed imported pipe fittings were not
deleted from the contract, nonetheless IDA raised with GWSC its concerns over
the contract changes in regard to overall costs and reliability of supply. IDA
delayed disbursements for the pipe fittings pending satisfaction of claims by
the foreign contractor and his supplier, which was provided in September 1975.
3.14     Initial progress on pipe supply and laying for rural water supply was
satisfactory although pipe quality became a problem as the inspection pro-
cedures of GWSC at the factories proved inadequate. A shortage of jointing
materials and equipment spare parts also compounded problems. By mid-1977,
when the original contract expired, pipe laying was 63% complete. Progress
slowed thereafter and by end-1978, pipe laying was only 81% complete, of which
65% was tested.  Being only in local currency, the foreign contractor was
particularly vulnerable to the foreign exchange restrictions. At the end of
1979, this contractor abandoned his work. Uncompleted works in the Eastern
and Volta regions were retendered and re-awarded to local contractors in
September 1981. Completion is expected in 1983.
3.15     The contract for construction of reservoirs and maintenance for rural
water supply yards was awarded in 1975 to a government construction company,
but by mid-1977 it had only worked on 2 of the 14 work sites. GWSC refused to
accept a proposed 100% increase in tender rates and the company was dismissed
from all work except for two small reservoirs and maintenance yards at Dodowa
and Larteh where it was active.  The remaining works were retendered and
awarded to seven local contractors in 1978. These contractors faced serious
material, labor and fuel shortages.  In 1979-1980 two of the contracts were
again re-awarded. Overall completion of the reservoirs and yards is about
70%, but future progress is unpredictable.
IDA-financed Components
3.16     By far the major component of the project, Contract W/2-construction
of Weija new dam and pumping station, was advertised for tender in mid-1973.
Procedures were in accordance with Bank procurement policies and three bids
were received and opened on July 31, 1973. The two lowest (and foreign) bids
were virtually identical, their order reversing twice after tender opening due
to exchange rate fluctuations.  IDA approved the recommendation for award on
November 9, 1973 to the then lowest bidder. A contract was signed on
November 26, 1973 for p3,513,089, plus Lire 3,012,917,150 (approx. then
US$4.71 million) and US$150,000. With approval of IDA, the contract was
reassigned to a wholly-owned local subsidiary established for the project.
Work officially began on May 3, 1974 with an anticipated completion date of
July 2, 1977. The delay in signing was primarily attributed to questions on
the performance guarantees. A schematic of the overall construction timetable
for Weija Dam is shown in Annex 1.
3.17     In April 1974, the contractor claimed by letter to the consultant the
right for reimbursement -for exceptional costs.  This was followed by extensive



- 1 3 -
discussions over several years between GWSC, Government, the consultant and
the contractor.  On December 29, 1976 the contractor also claimed for exten-
sion of time of seven months based on factors beyond his control.  This was
rejected but a later request for a two-month extension was approved because of
certain changes of over 15% in the bills of quantities.  Substantial com-
pletion of the project occurred by August 1977, in line with the original
schedule. However, the contractor was notified in November 1978 that GWSC
would impose liquidated damages for delays in contract completion.
3.18      GWSC commissioned its consultants to make a detailed investigation
into all claims. After further discussions GWSC withdrew its claim for
liquidated damages, and agreed to pay increased compensation for work per-
9"rYed beyond the original contract period.  In tuirn the contractor accepted
an award based on the estimated remaining amount in the Credit. In addition
to the Credit disbursement, the contractor received 0944,047.18 converted to
foreign exchange (approx. US$354,000) although payment was delayed for several
months. The amounts disbursed by categories as shown in Annex 2 indicates
that 71% was in respect of the dam and ancillary structures as compared wtih
the estimated 47% at appraisal.
3.19     Apart from the embankment itself and the concrete spillway structure
which have been tested by the formation of the lake, the critical items of the
dam as a whole are the spillway gates and the control valves. Initial per-
formance tests on the gates could not be done according to specification,
which calls for a gate opening to release a design flood flow of 52,000 cu
m/second to give a tail water level of llm (36ft ). This is because the
villages downstream are between elevation 4.6-7.6m (15-25ft ). A flow of only
6,000 cu.m/sec  produces a tail water level of 4.6m.  Another constraint on
full test is the bridge on the main road from Accra to the central and western
regions of the country. Uncertainties over the flood regimes of the Densu
fromn lack of long-term data is acknowledged. The proposed technical
assistance/rehabilitation credit has a component for hydrological surveys to
address this deficiency.
3.20      Even at the low flow tests however, it became evident that the dis-
charge channel downstream of the dam needed protection below the stilling
basin. The high turbulence of water over the cut-off wall created a
depression in the river bed, which should be filled with larger rock to
prevent further erosion.  The cause of this problem may be that the stilling
basin was not long enough to cause energy dissipation before reaching the cut-
off wall or the cut-off wall was not high enough.  Tests also revealed that
the gates tend to vibrate. Operating manuals have been prepared which contain
instruction on mitigating this problem.
3.21      The spillway gates were first closed in October 1977, but construc-
tion of the cofferdams in 1975 already allowed creation of the reservoir and
an increase in dependable yield to the existing Weija waterworks.  In January
1977 the new intake structure was operational.  Strict controls to prohibit
squatters along the shoreline will be necessary to allow filling the reservoir
to the overflow level of 16.8 m (55 ft), but filling to the normal design
level of 14.3 m (47 ft) has been achieved.



- 14 -
3.22     Aquatic weeds, mostly pistia and typha cover a vast area of the
reservoir. Of prime concern is the accumulation of weeds at the spillway,
which could lead to clogging of the gates. The 1968 dam failure at Weija was
attributed in part to this problem. A floating log barrier has been installed
some two hundred meters upstream of the dam, but it has not been maintained
and its effectiveness is minimal. Some weeds are removed manually at the
spillway gates and intake structure.
3.23     Several proposals have been made to control the weeks, including
manual removal, chemical control and importation of weed-eating biota. The
proposed technical assistance/rehabilitation credit initially envisaged
financing a large weed research program and GWSC requested proposals to this
end. However, weed proliferation in the early stages of reservoir filling is
not an isolated phenomenon, and frequently there is a recession of the probelm
with time and stable conditions. The Bank thus now stresses the need to
develop a sound chemical/biological/hydrological monitoring program to
identify changes over the years. A future research study, if still then
needed, could then be developed on a reliable data base. According to most
recent observations (September 1982) there does appear to be a reduction in
weeds from previous levels, and there is hope that the problem will stabilize
at an acceptable level.
3.24     Certificates of Completion of the works, with exception of the radial
gates and appurtenances were issued on July 5, 1978, and that for the gates,
on October 25, 1978. Separate Maintenance Certificates (Final) were therefore
issued for the works and gates after the respective 12 months periods of
maintenance. Based on deficiencies observed during the maintenance period,
the consultant warned in his final report that GWSC would face serious diffi-
culties maintaining the Weija dam particularly in regard to the spillway
gates. He strongly recommended that GWSO consider hiring highly qualified
technical assistance to aid in operations and maintenance. As of September
1982, the raw water trash screen was no longer accessible for cleaning because
of two broken cables. Also, the rationalized pump station was not functioning
because of failed cooling water pumps. Additionally, the spillway gates are
showing rust and lack of maintenance.
COSTS
3.25     Annex 3 indicates the overall costs of the project as estimated by
GWSC at June 30, 1981 for all donors and GWSC after closing of the IDA
Credit. A comparison of the actual disbursements against the appraisal
forecase is set out in Annex 4. It should be noted that portions of the
overall project pertaining to the distribution system will not be built in the
near future. Disregarding such indefinite expenditures, the following summary
of overall costs for completion appears appropriate:

IDA                     023,823,000              US$10,357,000

(US$8,200,000)
GWSC                    025,552,000
Total                       067,448,000              US$27,201,000
(US$24,526,545)
Grand Total                 US$51,727,545
3.26     The above estimated total cost for completion of US$51.7 million is
16% above the appraisal expectation of US$44.7 million. Considering inflation
during the project period, the overrun is surprisingly small. However, as
previously indicated, the project will not complete all planned components.
Cost overruns have also been minimized by the approximately 50% devaluation of
the lire during the project, the foreign currency paid to the Weija dam
contractor.
Project Design and Supervision of Construction
3.27     The same consultant retained by WHO under a UNDP project to prepare a
master plan for water supply and sewerage for ATMA was retained by WHO under a
second-phase UNDP project to prepare detailed engineering designs and contract
documents for certain portions of the master plan, including the projects
financed by the First and Second Water Supply projects. The master plan
consultant was also retained by GWSC for bid evaluation and construction
supervision of the First Project. His statisfactory performance led to his
retention for the Second Project as well, with the exceptions of the CIDA and
AFDB portions of the project, which were the responsibilities of the CIDA-
financed Canadian consultant.
3.28     The master plan consultant provided his services under the name of a
joint venture with a Ghanaian consultant (a government corporation). The
Ghanaian consultant was also retained by GWSC for the Weija reservoir
sedimentation study and the Kpong treatment plant rehabilitation study re-
quired by the project. These were in fact prepared by the joint venture. The
sedimentation study revealed that less than 1% of reservoir storage capacity
would be lost from sedimentation over a fifty-year period. The rehabilitation
study was never implemented for lack of funds.
3.29     GWSC has been very pleased with the performance of the master plan
consultant.  Engineering-related problems of the project such as discharge
limitations from Weija dam (see para 3.19) were possibly the result of the
1/   Total CIDA contributions included Cd$10,805,000 for mechanical and elec-
trical components and Cd$4,100,000 in grant financing for supervisory
engineering services, all of which may not be included in total project
costs.



- 16 -
emergency nature of the design after the original dam failed, and the lack of
reliable long-term hydrological records.
3.30      The project throughout was hampered by serious cost escalation.  The
Canadian consultant, in an October 1975 review report for Contract W/6 (trans-
mission mains), concluded that the 1973 cost estimates prepared by the master
plan consultant appeared to be "considerably too low" even after an allowance
for inflation and cedi devaluation had been made. However, the official
Ghanaian index of prime building costs escalated from 148.0 in 1970 to 212.2
in 1973, and 1,457.8 in 1979. During the same period the consumer price index
grew from 188.5 in 1970 to 255.4 in 1973 and to 3,691.3 in 1979. Both indexes
are based on 1963=100. The difference of the rises of the rates can be
explained by the fact that the building industry index is based on more
materials sold at controlled prices than other goods in the market.
Contractor Performance
3.31     The Weija dam contractor performed satisfactorily and the completed
work is of good quality. GWSC had, of course, maintained that his performance
created unjustifiable delays, hence the GWSC claim for liquidated damages.
This claim as noted in para 3.18 was withdrawn.
Project Office
3.32     An important addition to the ATMA organization was the establishment
of the project office under a project manager. Whereas the project office
employed the resources of ATMA with regard to accounting, general administra-
tion, drawing office and survey personnel, it was insulated from the day-to-
day control of the Area Manager.  The project manager, assisted by a deputy
project manager and a small administrative and secretarial staff reported
directly to the Managing Director. The project manager was also responsible
for the engineering of the proejct. Under the previous credit (160-GH) the
ATMA Manager was also project manager and priorities clashed with those of the
Region's operational and maintenance program activities. The project office
was located at ATMA headquarters, which also hosted the offices of the master
plan and Canadian consultants.
3.33      Initially, the project manager was an expatriate (former chief engi-
neer of GWSC) funded by ODM. He resigned in August 1974 after being informed
that ODM would only fund the post for an additional year. After exploring
alternatives, IDA contracted him as a Bank employee on a 3-year basis
(extended to 5) and seconded him to GSWC. In 1977, he was replaced as project
manager by his Ghanaian deputy, and he assumed the role of project advisor
until his departure in 1979. His contract costs were financed by the
Credit. The duties of the advisor were not properly articulated and little
benefit accrued in this role.
Technical Assistance
3.34      The technical assistant funded by the Credit to assist the sewerage
operations of ATMA left after a few months and he was not replaced. Funds for



- 17 -
technical assistance were utilized for the project manager instead (see
previous paragraph).
Procurement
3.35     Procurement problems arose in several of the contracts, as described
previously in this report. It is clear that Government involvement in the
procurement process contributed to a number of delays, particularly for AFDB-
financed components. For IDA-financed components, international competitive
bidding occurred for only the following contracts:

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Water Produced and Sold
4.01     The following table shows the quantities of water produced and sold
during the last ten years from all sources in ATKA as having increased by 44%
and 48% respectively. significant increases of 20% in production and 29% in
sales were recorded in FY1978 due to the operation of the new intake (see
para. 3.21). Increases to be recorded in FY1983 should be equally signifi-
cant, once the CIDA-financed treatment works are operational at Weija, as a
result of extra sales in western Accra, alleviating the supply problems there.

Unaccounted-for Water
4.02     It was expected at appraisal that the percentage of unaccounted-for
water would fall from 44% in FY72 to about 25% in FY82.  A possible improve-
ment was noted for by FY78 when the figure stood at 35%, but a combination of
events (major problems on the Kpong/Tema/Accra transmission pipeline; lack of
leakage detection equipment; lack of vehicles for mains repairs, meter reading
and bill delivery; computer billing system malfunctioning; lack of meters; and
increasing numbers of illegal connections) has militated against that improve-
ment and unaccounted-for water is presently estimated to be in excess of 40%.
It should be noted that production is not metered (meters are inoperative),
thus all estimates, based on rated pumping capacities, must be viewed with
reservation. Similarly, the many problems existing in the billing system cast
a serious doubt on the water sales figures.
Vehicles, Plant and Equipment
4.03     Of the 85 vehicles managed by ATMA, only 15 were operational at a
recent count. Many vehicles were idle due to lack of basic spare parts such
as tires and batteries, others for lack of small spares that would cost only a
few dollars in the country of the vehicle's origin. In this situation, while



- 19 -
improvisation is sometimes spect;acular, all too cften vehicles or plant stand-
ing idle for some small item have been cannibalised. The country shortage of
foreign currency for procurement of essential spare parts and chemicals has
undermined completely the operational performance of GWSC as a whole. Without
basic transportation, satisfactory operational performance is not achievable.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01     A comprehensive statement of recent operational and financial per-
formance indicators is shown in Annex 5.  The appraisal forecasts and actual
Income Statements, Sources and Application of Funds Statements and Balance
Sheets of the ATMA Region of GWSC for FY74 to FY81 are in Annexes 6, 7 and 8,
and the tariff levels in Annex 9. The comments in this chapter explain some
of the salient features of ATMA's performance.
Rate of Return
5.02     The prime objective in ATMA's performance was to achieve annual rates
of return of 7%, except in the FY78 and FY79 when it was set at 3% (see para
2.17). Based on the historical cost convention of valuation of assets, ATMA
achieved these results up to FY79. However, this performance is misleading
because ATMA has Capital Works in progress relating to the unfinished CIDA and
AFDB components valued at 170% of its existing historically valued asset base
(055.5 million) as at June 30, 1981. The inclusion of these works and the
valuation of existing assets to reflect current values, as required by the
project agreement, would render the rate of return for these years to FY79 to
miniscule proportions. The rate of return for FY80 and FY81 was negative.
Ta riffs
5.03     ATMA has negative rates of return for FY80 and FY81 because its most
recent tariff proposal was delayed by Government from July 1, 1979 until
February 1, 1981. The 1974 and 1977 tariff increases kept ATMA abreast of
inflation, but the serious delays both by GWSC in submitting the next tariff
proposal until May 1979 and then by the new governemnt in deferring approval
devastated ATMA's internal cash generation in FY79 onwards.  The fact that the
Governemnt subsequently agreed to pay ATMA 031.1 million for loss of potential
revenue for July 1979 to January 1981 eased the position and enabled ATMA to
meet its counterpart fund requirements for the project. Nevertheless, the
failure to increase tariffs was not the sole reason for ATMA's poor perfor-
mance. ATMA allowed its billing and collection performance to deteriorate
along with its unaccounted-for water (see para 4.02).  Between 1974 and 1981,
ATMA's accounts receivable shot up from a forecast of 01.3 million for FY74,
to an actual of 016.3 million for FY81; that is, from the equivalent of 25% to
60% of billings. This caused serious liquidity problems and ATMA took longer
credit from its suppliers (accounts payable up from 02.1 million in 1974 to
026.7 million in 1981). Its current ratio in 1981 was less than 1:1 and its
quick ratio was therefore also less than 1 at 0.6:1. At the end of FY81
ATMA's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 07.9 million.
Operating Costs
5.04     The underlying economic problems of the country had a major impact on
GWSC and its ATMA region, especially in FY78. Between FY77 and FY78 ATMA saw
its total operating costs nearly double from 06.3 million to 011.2 million



- 21 -
(appraisal estimate 04.8 million) and with a further near quadrupling to 038.2
million for FY81, mostly all due to price inflation, although there were some
marginal increases in operating costs due to increased water production (see
para. 4.01). Between FY77 and FY81, the most significant cost increases were
in personnel (up 700% to 019.6 million), electricity (up 700% to 07.3 million)
and chemicals (up over 300% to 03.3 million). Depreciation in the meanwhile
had only risen 10%, but debt service had risen by 400% from 00.3 million in
FY77 to 01.5 million in FY81.
Debt Coverage
5.05      Servicing of loans only began to have any impact on ATMA's finances
in FY80 when repayment of the first IDA Credit began.  ATMA only provided the
interest payment to Government, the principal repayments were met by Govern-
ment itself contrary to the onlending agreement. Due to its poor financial
performance ATKA failed to satisfy the revenue coverage of 1.5 times its debt
services whether taken in total or even in interests payments alone.
Internal Cash Generation
5.06      At the time of appraisal it was intended that ATMA would provide 29%
of its total capital investment requirements out of internally generated
funds. The summarized financing plan for the years FY74-FY81 is shown on the
next page.  ATMA generated only 22% from its own revenues and the Government
increased its share from 14% to 23%.  The borrowing requirements were largely
as planned in percentage terms at 55% (SAR forecast 57%), although IDA's share
fell from 21% to 15%; CIDA's share increased to 18% due to the provision of
supplementary credit.
Accounts and Audit
5.07     ATMA's annual audited accounts were covenanted to be submitted to the
Bank within 4 months of the end of the fiscal year and those for GWSC, within
6 months. Neither date has been met during the execution of the project; the
most recently audited accounts for FY80 were received in March 1982 some 21
months after the year had ended. GWSC's auditors, an international firm of
accountants with a local partnership, have commented extensively over the
years on the weaknesses in GWSC's record keeping and internal controls. FY80
was the first year in which neither GWSC nor ATMA has had its accounts
qualified.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization
6.01     Structurally, GWSC's organization since 1974 has changed very little
in its Headquarters and nine Regions. ATMA is one of the Regions, but it
alone accounts for about half of most activities of the Corporation. Within
Headquarters the General Manager position has been replaced by a Deputy
Managing Director responsible for the Regional Organizations. The four Chief
Officers (Chief of Finance, Chief Engineer, Chief of Planning and Research,
and Chief of Personnel) continue to report directly to the Managing Director
(see Annex 10). Until 1982, the Board of GWSC comprised a cross section of
interests, government as well as business. The recently introduced change
whereby the entire Board comprises senior management and staff together with
workers' representatives has not yet settled down for an assessment of its
performance to be made.
Staffing
6.02     In paragraph 5.04 reference was made to the substantial increase in
costs relating to personnel. In 1974, GWSC had 4300 employees of whom 330
were categorized as senior staff; by 1981 these figures had risen to 8,216 and
686 respectively. The corresponding figures for ATMA in 1974 were 1047 and
62; in 1981 ATMA had a total of 1781 employees of whom 165 were senior staff.
Although these numbers indicate a substantial increase in the workforce, the
preponderence are lowly graded and unqualified staff. Many of the senior
staff do not possess the qualifications or experience of the people they
replaced; there has been a general lowering of the level of competence when
simultaneously both GWSC's and ATMA's services have been expanding. The drift
of qualified staff out of the Corporation and out of the country is due pri-
marily to the inadequate compensation arrangements and the particularly
difficult economic conditions of the country.
Training
6.03     The substantial increase in employees has placed an extra burden on
GWSC's training facilities at Weija and Kumasi, which have continued to suffer
under successive budgetary constraints and which lack many of the basic teach-
ing materials and equipment. The development of training which was to have
taken place with other donor assitance failed to materialize due to various
reasons, but principally a long delay in GWSC reaching a decision on the
appointment of an expatriate trainer and then the subsequent withdrawal of
funds by ODM. GWSC did not provide a training program in accordance with
Section 3.06 of the Project Agreement; thus, no project funds were expended
for training.
Technical Assistance
6.04     Apart from engineering consultants for detailed design of the physi-
cal works, the only technical assistance provided under the project was the
financing of an expatriate Project Manager for 5 years (see para 3.33). He



- 24 -
was much more effective in this role, than in his advlsory role to the
Ghanaian deputy during the last two years of his assignment. CIDA provided
some technical assistance on finance and administration to ATMA during the
early years of project execution, but low salaries and high staff turnover
were already an issue at the inception of the project causing the benefits of
counterpart training to be lost due to staff losses. Provision for technical
assistance by the IDA-financed project was inadequate.
Proposals for improvement
6.05     Overall, GWSC achieved very little by way of the covenanted manage-
ment and operations activities in the project.  In part, this is because of
the very high turnover of GWSC's top level officers, lack of managerial
autonomy from Governemnt and staff redundancy at the lower levels. The need
to strengthen GWSC has long been recognized and a proposed project is dedi-
cated to this objective and to the restoration of GWSC's operating and finan-
cial performance, as well as to some immediate rehabilitation works. A
malnagement improvement program comprising a comprehensive review by consul-
tants, with recommendations for improvements of GWSC's organization, manage-
ment, operations, training and financial policies and systems is envisaged.
It will be supported by substantial technical assistance to strengthen GWSC's
higher level staff and to assist in the implementation of the consultant's
recommendations. The appointment of five senior internationally recruited
experts, including a General Manager and a Financial Controller, are
conditions for the processing of the proposed project.

VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Background
7.01     The IDA financed component of the Accra-Tema Water Supply Project was
completed by June 1980. In order to fully assess the total project benefits
and costs arising out of Credit 499-GH, it has been necessary to assume that
the supporting investments in the water supply system, financed by CIDA and
AfDB, will be substantially completed by 1983.
Project Benefits
7.02     The primary objective of the project was to provide an adequate
reliable source of water supply to the Accra-Tema area. With the failure of
the original Weija dam in 1968, the Densu river was no longer able to supply a
sufficient flow to the treatment units at Weija during the driest months.
This led to increased reliance on the Kpong treatment works north of Accra-
Tema, which alone cannot provide adequate flows to the metropolitan area,
particularly in the western areas near the Weija works. The objective was met
when, from 1975 onwards, impoundment was possible due to the erection of a new
Weija dam, creating an additional reliable yield allowing treatment of 45,000
cu.m/day (10 mgd) during the driest months of the year. Previously only a
production of 13,000 cu.m/day (3 mgd) was assured.
7.03     The secondary objective of the project was to increase overall water
production from the Densu river to meet growing water demand, particularly in
the western peripheries of Accra. Improvements to the existing Weija pumping
station raised production from 37,000 cu.m/day to 59,000 cu.m/day, but the
project also provided for additional treatment works capacity amounting to
111,000 cu.m/day (24.5 mgd). This first stage of the capacity expansion will
be completed by 1983. The economic analysis of the project assumes that from
that year onwards additional water production from this capacity expansion
will be obtained but that limitations in distribution system will limit aver-
age output at first to under 45,000 cu.m/day (10 mgd). Although it is
possible to double the newly added capacity with a second phase, consideration
of this increase has been omitted from the economic analysis because of the
relevant costs of expanding the distribution system and the cost of related
investments cannot be accurately estimated.
7.04     The appraisal report anticipated total annual production  would reach
20,300 mg by 1982, an increment of 8,180 mg over 1976 production. By 1981,
forecast production had been revised down to 18,000 mg, which was expected to
be achieved. However, it has not been possible to reduce the ratio of
unaccounted for water to 25% as forecast. The ratio is running at about 50%
in 1982, a deterioration in performance, which has reduced the benefit of the
amount of additional water available for consumption. Whereas incremental
consumption of 5,470 mg in 1980 was forecast, only 1,100 mg was actually
realised. Thus the benefits from the project, as measured by the proxy
indicator of water sales revenue, have been less than expected, even when
consideration is taken of the fact that actual tariff levels between 1974 and
1981 were higher than forecast.



- 26 -
7.05     The appraisal report identified a potential irrigation benefit to be
derived from the capital investment in water supply financed by the IDA credit;
an estimate in Annex 16 of the Appraisal Report indicated a potential rate of
return of 30%. No benefits have yet been forthcoming, but may be anticipated
from the eventual development of 1,500 hectares of irrigated land for vege-
table cultivation. A tentative economic assessment of this component may be
found in the project file. However, it is unlikely that the component will
now generate an economic rate of return more than 13% due to cost increases
and implementation delays. The component adds about 1 - 4% to the total
project rate of return, depending on water tariff level assumptions.
7.06     The impoundment created by the Weija dam has given rise to a small
fishing industry involving possibly 140 villagers. A tentative assessment of
the economic costs and benefits of this activity may be found in the project
file; its contribution to the overall economic rate of return is negligible.
7.07     In summary, the project has met its two main objectives, though some
delay was incurred in meeting them. Quantifiable benefits are less than anti-
cipated because incremental consumption of water has not been as great as
anticipated. However water supply has been extended to a higher proportion of
the Accra/Tema population, and one can fairly anticipate that benefits will
materialise through improved public health and therefore productivity.
Project Costs
7.08     As stated elsewhere in this report, total project costs in U.S. dol-
lars are estimated to be in excess of the appraisal estimate by 16%. This
report has calculated two capital cost streams, one in 1974 Cedis at the offi-
cial exchange rate, and one in 1974 Cedis at the shadow exchange rate. The
latter cost stream is about 60% higher than the former since the official
exchange rate grossly overprices the Cedi and thus undervalues imports, which
form probably 85 - 90% of project capital cost.
7.09     Operating costs have been much higher than forecast, and this has
been a factor in reducing the net benefits derived from the project. The
Appraisal report anticipated cost per 1,000 gallons would rise from 00.25 in
1974 to 00.35 in 1981, whereas in fact actual 1981 operating costs were 02.12
in current prices.
7.10     Therefore both project capital and project operating costs have been
higher than originally anticipated, and this has had a detrimental effect on
the net economic benefit of the investment.
Economic Analysis
7.11     Economic rate of return analyses were performed on a series of costs
and benefits streams, the result of which are set out in fuller detail in
annex 11. The appraisal report estimated the economic rate of return at 6%;
but as the actual realised tariffs (average water rates) were higher than
those assumed in the appraisal report, the benefit stream has been
recalculated to give a higher economic rate of return of 9%. The comparison
of tariff is as follows:



- 27 -
Appraisal estimates          Realised tariffs      (¢/1000 gallons)
1974                  0.64                       0.86
1975                  0.96                       0.92
1976                  0.96                       1.02
1977                  0.96                       1.01
1978                  0.96                       1.43
1979                  0.96                       1.66
1980                  1.34                       1.93
1981                  1.34                       1.93
1982                  1.34                       1.93
The rate of return has been recalculated using realised levels of water pro-
duction and consumption, and the higher revised capital cost and operating
costs data, but the same project life of 50 years. Different assumptions were
used concerning tariff levels (see annex 11). The rate of return assuming a
no increase in tariff in 1983 and maintenance of the real level of costs is
estimated as -3.6%. With a 50% increase in tariff in 1983, which is believed
likely to occur, the rate of return rises to 2.5%, or with a 100% increase in
tariff,to 5.6%. The fact that this is less than the appraisal estimate is due
to project time overruns and higher cost levels that have been discussed
above. It appears also to be the case that the average tariff level, even
with the projected 1983 increase is still below the average incremental cost
of water production. A calculation of the current AIC is given in the project
file, and amounts to 00.39 per cu.m at a 10% discount rate, or 00.45/cu.m at a
12% discount rate (both costs are in terms of 1974 cedis).
7.12     As has been earlier stated the addition of the estimated net benefit
from the irrigation component may add up to 4% to the project rate of return
on the most optimistic assumptions. The'fishing component is too small to
have other than a negligible impact.
Affordability
7.13     Consumption of lower income households in the Accra/Tema metropolitan
area is believed to lie in the range of 10 to 30 liters per capita per day.
It is reasonable to expect these consumers to pay up to 5% of their income for
water supply. For the consumption of a family of 5-6 persons, estimated at
200 liters/day, the monthly bill would be 03.42 for water on the basis of
existing tariffs. The "threshold" income for this group would therefore be
068.5 per month. According to income distribution data derived from a house-
hold survey carried out in May 1980 (see Table A-3-4 of Accra-Tema Water
Supply and Sewerage Project Review of Master Plan, December 1981), less than
2% of the population earn an income less than the "threshold" income. There-
fore it can be deduced that the cost of water is in general not a burden on
the population. However, the conclusion is mitigated by two factors, firstly,
the prospective 1983 tariff increase will raise the real cost of water supply,
and will push up the "threshold" income; and secondly the cost of connection
may impose a burden on a large number of low income families.

VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01     From project genesis in 1969 through appraisal in 1974, the Bank has
insisted on the scaling down of proposed ATMA construction projects to match
with realistic near-term demand projections.  In light of project delays, the
Bank's stance has proven to be financially justifiable on a near-term basis.
However, GWSC is of the opinion that a larger treatment capacity should have
been added at Weija than that provided by the project, in order to have fore-
stalled a follow-up enlargement at Weija as will be needed in the near future
because of demand increases over the last few years. Nonetheless, the extra-
ordinary delays which faced the project and the attendant rise in demands
during delays could not have been foreseen at appraisal.
8.02     The basic project content was reasonable, but the involvement of co-
financing agencies created delays through redesign and redefinition of bid
packages. The inclusion of additional funds for vehicles, equipment and spare
parts would have been most helpful. Throughout the project GWSC requested
funds for these items, but the overruns on the major project components pre-
empted the unallocated funds for any other purpose. For example, the Bank
noted already by letter to GWSC in 1970 that cathodic protection (against
corrosion) of the steel pipeline to Kpong had broken down, for which an esti-
mated US$20,000 in foreign exchange would be needed for repairs. Now in 1982,
US$3.5 million is included in the proposed IDA technical assistance/rehabili-
tation credit for repairs on the corroded sections of the pipeline.
8.03     The project was first listed as having major problems (a "3" project)
in the November 12, 1975 supervision report, and it continued under this list-
ing until credit closing in 1980. The initial major difficulties stemmed from
procurement difficulties for the rural water supply component. In this situa-
tion IDA delayed disbursements on the affected contract, and this procedure
was used in some subsequent case. More substantial reaction by IDA toward
non-compliance with project covenants by Government and GWSC was not forth-
coming. It was believed that suspension of disbursements would be ineffective
at promoting improvements and would only penalize unduly the contractor for
the Weija dam.
8.04     From an overall project standpoint, it appears that the contract
award for civil works of the treatment plant created the greatest difficulty
and unfortunate consequences. However, this contract was funded by AFDB, and
thus the Association had only indirect involvement in the decisions for award.
8.05     The impact of special covenants proved to be of little value in most
cases. Also, many of the usual covenants such as project reporting, financial
reporting and audits were not complied with on a timely basis. Criticism by
the Association had to be tempered by the realities of the problems both
Government and management faced and continue to face. A brief review of com-
pliance with key covenants described in paras 2.13 - 2.19 follows:
1.   P.A. Section 3.02 - expert periodic inspection of Weija dam:  no
compliance for lack of funds.



- 29 -
2.   P.A. Section 3.04 - program for hydrologic data:  no compliance for
lack of funds and transport.
3.   P.A. Section 3.05 - Kpong treatment works improvements:  study
completed but not implemented for lack of funds.
4.   P.A. Section 3.06 - training program: no program was prepared or
implemented - annual mains-laying program: program presented up to
1976 only.
5.   P.A. Section 3.07 - sewer connection program:  legislation compelling
connection was only approved in 1979, but no program has yet been
developed or sewer areas declared - leakage detection program begun
but curtailed for lack of vehicles.
6.   P.A. Section 3.08 - ecological and environmental protection:  no
compliance.
7.   P.A. Section 4.01 (b) - submission of audited accounts untimely.
8.   P.A. Section 4.02 (a) - rate of return objectives not fulfilled.
9.   P.A. Section 4.03 (a) - debt coverage not met in FY80 onwards.
10.  P.A. Section 4.05 - allocation of reservoir yield:  the necessary
sedimentation study was completed but allocations were not
determined.
8.06     In 1978, when over 80% of the loan had already been disbursed, IDA
decided that a new credit for technical assistance to the sector might enhance
opportunities for institutional improvements, as well as address some of the
unresolved problems from the project, in addition to providing some funds for
vehicles, spare parts, and emergency repairs to the Kpong pipeline. Unfor-
tunately delays in meeting conditions for Board presentation have prevented
initiation of the program.  (Refer to para 1.06 for further details on the
proposed credit).
8.07     On average, there were two supervision missions per year by the Bank,
but a number of delays occurred during periods when the country-Bank dialogues
were under reassessment.  Eleven months elapsed between the fourth and fifth
mission, and twelve months between the eleventh and twelfth mission, for
examples. Because of the extended project duration from initial appraisal
onward, there were several changes to the staff involved. Most of the super-
vision missions consisted on one person as a result of staff constraints on
the project division.  Few missions were in conjunction with representatives
from AFDB and CIDA. The Bank's working relationship with GWSC was good
throughout, and the supervision missions were essential to developing a candid
view of project difficulties.

IX. CONCLUSION
9.01     The IDA-financed project component has fulfilled the physical objec-
tive of storing the waters of the Densu River to enhance the reliability of
water supply to the 800,000 inhabitants of the Accra-Tema metropolitan area.
In subsequent years, tnis feat will become yet more significant as the sole
alternative source becomes increasingly jeopardized by continuing pipeline
corrosion. Parallel-financed components to provide additional treatment
capacity have been delayed, but their imminent completion will enhance further
the value of the IDA-financed dam.
9.02     To a large part caused by unfavorable country economic conditions,
the institutional strength of ATMA has been seriously eroded.  Inadequate
tariffs have created an untenable financial situation, resulting in inadequate
maintenance, loss of qualified staff and reliance on Government subsidy, and
concommitant interference by Government into routine affairs of ATMA. The
future for ATMA specifically, but GWSC in general, is bleak unless renewed
efforts at financial viability are made. Already, declining maintenance
standards are threatening the reliability of the more sensitive physical com-
ponents of the project.
9.03     Review of the long history of this project has produced many oppor-
tunities for second-guessing..  A present view might be that the project was
conceived too optimistically, such as in regards to village resettlement,
effectiveness of technical assistance, costs, completion schedules, health
benefits and so forth. However, a proper perspective should consider the
dynamics of the 1970's, including several changes in Ghana's government, the
precipitous decline in its exports, and the unpredicted rise in oil prices.
9.04     The main conclusion of this PCR is that the project is not completed,
and when the physical components funded by CIDA and AFDB are finished, there
will always remain the great challenge to maintain and to operate properly the
project facilities.  Continuing external assistance to GWSC appears necessary
for this end in the foreseeable future.
