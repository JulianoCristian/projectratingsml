SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Introduction
i.        The Government of Ghana has askec. IDA to help finance a
project to increase the water supply to the Metropolitan Area of
Accra/Tema, the country's main administrative and commercial center,
and to adjacent rural areas.
The Sector
ii.       Some 40% of Ghana's total population has access to safe
water supplies. Generally, in communities with more than 5,000
people between 90-100% of the population receive adequate service,
while in communities of less than 5,000 people only 15% receive
such service. The basic objectives of a countrywide water supply
investment program presently under preparation is (a) to provide 60%
of Ghana's population with safe water supplies by the end of the
seventies, and (b) to improve significantly the situation in the
smaller communities. National responsibility for water supply was
entrusted in 1966 to the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC).
GWSC is reasonably well managed but suffers from staffing difficul-
ties. Water tariffs are presently uniform for all urban and rural
areas in Ghana. To cover the financial requirements of the Project
they will be increased by 50% by mid-1974 which, however,
would still leave them at a level comparable with that in other
African countries.
History of the Project
iii.     The Project would be IDA's second operation in the water
supply sector in Ghana. In 1969, IDA provided a creditof us$3.5
million equivalent (Credit 160-GH) to finance implementation of the
first stage of a masterplan, prepared by consultants during 1963-
1970, for water and sewerage for the Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area.
The first phase works were satisfactorily completed and the pro-
posed project comprises part of the second phase of the masterplan.
The project was appraised first in 1971, reappraised in April 1973
and finally updated in February 1974.
Description of the Project
iv.        The main components of the Project concerning the urban
supplies include an earth dam at Weija on the Densu River 14 mire
from Accra, a new intake, a raw water pumping station, a treatment
plant, a service reservoir, transmigisidn and distribution mains and
miscellaneous equipment. Tke rurl component which includes the
laying of 110 miles of small diameter mains, and associated works
will serve about 170.000 people in an area of about 1,000 square
miles. The Project also includes engineering services and a
training component.

Project Execution
v.             As under Credit 16(-GH the Ghana Water and Sewerage Cor-
poration (GNUC) would be the beneiiciary of the Credit and GWSC's
Accra/Tena Metropolitan Area (ATMA) organization would be responsible
for inplementation of the project. ATMA's operations account for the
greater part of all GWSC operations. ATMA has appointed GWSC's former
Chief &igineer, an expatriate, as Project Manager and consultants
will be responsible for construction supervision, ATMA is adequa-
tely organized and managed but requires assistance in the fields
of administration and finance. The Canadian International Deve-
lopment Agency (CIDA) has indicated its willingness to provide
such assistance.
Prjct Cost
vi.            The total estimated cost is US$ 44.7 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$ 22.4 million equivalent or
50%, Estimates are net of duties and taxes. Project cost estimates
are based on actual contract prices, updated consultantst estimates
and experience gained in Ghana. The rural component of the Project
.s estimated to accoumt for about 13% of the project costs.
Financing Plan
vii.           In view of the substantial increase in the forein
exchange cost of the project since it was first appraised and the
limited availability of IDA funds., Government has reached agreements
in principle with IDA, CIDA and the African Development Bank (ADB)
on a parallel financing arrangement.  Both CIDA and ADB have already
authorized their participation. The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 10*.
million equivalent would cover about 23% of the Project costs; CIDA
would contribute US$ 7.5 million equivalent or 17% of project costs;
and ADB has agreed to provide US$ 4.8 million equivalent or 11% of
Project costs. The remaining 49% would be provided by Government
and from GWSC'a own resources. GWSC would contribute an estimated
35% and to permit this would implement tariff increases for its
consumers in Accra/Tema.  Satisfactory tariff increases and conclu-
sion of the convontions concerning CIDA and ADB would be conditions
of credit effectiveness.
A\TTAs Financial Position and Prospects
viii.           Although, GWSC revenues are increasing, it continues to
operate at a deficit, although on an ever diminishing scale,  The
financial performance of ATMA, however, has been much better and ATMA
has been able to earn the 4% rate of return in FY 1973 stipulated un-
der Credit 160-GH.  ith implementation of'the proposed tariff increases,
ATMl is expected to earn rates of return in excess of 7% except for the
last two years of project construction, when they would be about 3%
becalise of the increase in ATMA's asset base and the lag between new
investmentsand new revenues.  Furthermore, projected debt service and
debt/equity ratios of at least 2.2 and 58/h2 respectively are satisfac-
tory. The proposed IDA Credit would be relent by the Government to
GWSC at 7-1/4% p.a. for a term of 25 years including six and a half
years grace,



- III -
In the financial forecasts it has been assuwed that the CIDk Loan
would be relent to GWSC at 2-1/2% p.a. over 25 years including five
years graee. The ADB Loan will be lent directly to GWSC at 7%p.a.
over 22 years including 5 years grace.
Procurement
ix.            The major project elements to be financed by IDk
(Weija dam., supply of pipes and pumping equipment for the rural
water supply project, supply of pipes and fittings for the secondary
and tertiary distribution systems) either have been or will be let
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA Guidelinea. GWSC haa retained consultants for the supervision
of construction of the Weija dam on terms and conditions acceptable
to IDA. Procurement had to be started in aid 1973 to avoid
delays in project execution. The Project elements
funded by CIDk (raw water puwps, treatment plant and the remaining
construction supervision) are to be procured ex-Canada under CIDA
Guidelines, and project elements funded by ADB (civil works of the
treatment plant and the primary distribution system) will be awarded
on the basis of ADB's international competitive bidding procedures.
Laying of the mains financed by ADB will be carried out by GWSC,
with equipment and technical assistance being financed by ADB.
DLsburs_ments
x*             The Credit would be disbursed against the foreign
exchange component of (i) civil works, pipe and equipment supply
contracts amounting to about US$ 8.4 million equivalent and (ii)
engineering and training involving about US$ 2.0 million equivalent.
It is proposed that IDA retroactively finance about US$ 2.0 million
in foreign exchange cost related to consulting services and con-
struction incurred prior to Credit aignature.
Justification
xi.            The main purpose of the project is to meet present
and increasing needs for potable water in Accra/Tema metropolitan
area of some 850.000 people and to extend water supply to some
170.000 people living in adjaeent rural areas. Water shortages
are already being experienced in the dry season and if the project
were not implemented a dangerous deterioration in both the quality
and quantity of supply would arise. The internal rate of return
on the incremental investment excluding duties and taxes would
be 6% with revenues attributable to the project taken as a proxy
for economic benefits. This however underestimates these economic
benefits since tariffs do not capture them all. In particular tariffs
substantially disregard the non-quantifiable health benefits, whose
achievement is one of the main justifications of the Project.
xii.           Subject to the conditions set out in Chapter VII the
project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$ 10.4 million equivalent.

APPRAISAL OF THE ACCRA/TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
I   INTRODUCTION
1.01           The Government of Ghana has requested IDA to help the
Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC) finance a project to in-
crease the water supply to the metropolitan area of Accra, the capital
city, and Tema,the country's main industrial center,and to adjacent rural
areas. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the
African Development Bank (ADB) will participate in financing the project.
1.02           The project appraised in this report would implement part
of the second stage of a master plan for water supply and sewerage for
the Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area. Consultants prepared this master plan
during 1963-1970 under a study financed through a UNDP technical assistance
grant with the World Health Organization (WHO) as the executing agency.
In August 1969, IDA provided a credit of US$3.5 million equivalent (Credit
160-GH) to cover the foreign exchange Fcosts of a first stage project. This
project included the extension of the water distribution system in Accra
and Tema and a new sewerage system in central Accra. These works were sa-
tisfactorily completed.
1.03           The improvements in GWSC's efficiency and financial position
sought under the first IDA project have been essentially achieved, In
particular, there has been substantial improvement in the management and
finances of (WSC's Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area Organization (ATMA)1/ which
was responsible for the previous IDA project and will carry out the pro-
posed Project.
1.0           Tahal Consulting Engineers Ltd. (tahal), of Israel,
carried out the studies on which the present appraisal is based. The
project was appraised first in November 1971, reappraised by Messrs.
Alber-Glanstaetten, Middleton and Bates in April 1973 and finally up-
dated by Mr. Alber-Glanstaetten in February 1974. The project's
potential irrigation component was briefly reviewed in Accra by
Mr. Kanchanalak (CPS) in early March 1974.
J  ATMA is an organizational unit of GWSC and is not a separate legal
entity.



II. THE SECTOR
General
2.01           Ghana has an area of about 92,100 square miles and a
population of around 8.7 million, growing at some 2.5% per annum with
a distinct rural to urban shift. A maJor focus of this migration is
Accra/Tema comprised of Accra, the capital, and Tema, Ghana's principal
port and industrial center. Accra/Tema and the surrounding rural areas
which would benefit from the proposed project have about one million
inhabitants or some 12% of the country's total population. During the
past ten years, the population of Accra/Tema has grown at an averge of
5.6% per annum.
Level of Development
2.02           Elisting public water supply systems in Ghana are shown
in Map IBRD 3761.  It is estimated that some 40% of Ghana's total po-
pulation has access to safe and dependable water supplies   In com-
iunities of above 5,000 people, which account for 30% of the total
population, between 90 and 100% have such access, In the case of the
reaining 70% of the population, only about 15% have access to safe
and dependable water supplies. While dracontiasis (Guinea worm in-
fection) and bilharsiasis have been virtually eliminated by the pro-
vision of piped water, these diseases are prevalent in rural towns
and villages which have no public water supplies. Such communities
are also vulnerable to cholera, which broke out in many parts of the
country in 1970-L971.
Sector Organization
2.03           National responsibility for the provision, distribution
and conservation of water and for the establilshent, operation and
control of sewerage systems was entrusted in 1966 to GWSC, then a newly
formed statutory corporation. GWSC has been concerned primarily with
water supply, but comissioned its first sewerage scheme in November
1973. The scheme serves Central Accra; the only other sewerage scheme
in ahana is operated by the Tema Development Corporation, the body
responsible for Toma's industrial and residential development.
2.O04          GWSC operates about 170 individual water supply systems,
and, finding it increasingly difficult to adminiater these centrally
from Acera, in 1973, created 41 District Management Centers which have
primary responsibility for operations and development in their respec-
tive areas. The 41 diatrict centers are grouped in GWSC's nine regional
organizations, of which the Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area (ATMA) is by
for the largest (see para. 6.05). Provided GWSC can overco its
current staffing difficulties (see para. 5.07), this new anagement
structure should contribute substantially to increasing the efficiency
of the Corporation.

Sector Development Plan
2.05           owSC is drawing up for Government a countrywide
ineatment program for PT 1975-1979. Due to GWSC's shortage of
experienced personnel and other problems (see pars. 6.06), this
program is still in a rudimentary form. Total costs are estimated
at about ¢ 200 million (US$ 174 million) of which about 80-90%
would be for the extension of water supplies to comemunities of less
than 5,000 people. The objective of the program is to provide 60%
of Ghana's population with a safe water supply by 1980. Finance
is to be obtained from the national budget and foreign sources, So
far, about US$ 12 million of bilateral assistance has been granted
by Canada, GerAany, and Denmark for the construction of new water
supply systems and the extension of existing systems, mostly in
rural areas. In addition to water supply the program includes a
sewerage project, to be constructed during 1975-1978, in Kumasi,
Ghana's second largest city. As an adjunct to the program UNDP
has approved a wural water supply and sanitation pilot project.
The UNDP project would provide a basis for the rural water supply
component of the program through training staff, reviewing design
and construction practices, and constructing pilot rural schemes.
Water Supply Tariffs
2.06           In 1973, aWSC sought Government approval for a change
in both the level and structure of its water supply tariff whieh is
uniform for all urban and rural areas in Ghana (Annex 15). GWSC
proposed that tariffs for all consumers with private connections in
major urban areas should be raised, and that in the remaining com-
munities tariffs should be unchanged and in some cases lowered. The
objective of the propoaal was to raise GWSC's income and permit the
Corporation to become financially autonomous by transferring cash
surpluses generated in urban centers to rural areas, less well able
to meet the full costs of service. IDA has supported the GWSC
proposal as having a desirable inter-regional income redistribution
effect. At the same.time, IDA pointed out that for Accra/Tema both
the existing and the proposed metered domestic rate appeared to be
less than the incremental economic cost of supply and suggested a
narrowing of the differential between the domestic and non-domestic
tariff. In order to safeguard the interests of the lower-income
consumer and to make the benefits of a private connection available
to a larger proportion of consumers, IDA suggested the introduction
of a two block domestic tariff 80 that a low charge could be retained
on the first block for a minimum quantity of water consistent with
public health needs.  Wiila Government decided to postpone any
countrywide tariff changes until all connections in urban areas have
been metered, it has now agreed, in view of ATMA's substantial in-
vestment progra- and the commitments made (see para. 3.15) for



- 4 -
construction of the WeiJa dan, to a 50% tariff increase for mtered
domestic and industrial/coxercial conAumers applicable only to
Accra/T.a (para. 6.15 and Annex 15).  The social tariff block,
however, i£ not being implemented at this time due to eapected
administrative difficulties in meter reading and billing.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The project is essentially part of the aecond stage of
implementation of the long-range maater plan for water supply and
sewerage for Greater Accra. It is designed as a continuation of
the water supply facilities provided under Credit 160-GH in 1969-
73. Details of the existing water supply and sewerage installations
in Greater Accra are given in Annex 1.
Description
3.02      The main components of the project are as follows:
I.   Urban Supplies:
(a) An earth dam, with a maximum height of about
55 feet, on the Densu River at Weija, about
14 miles west of Accra, to replace the dam
destroyed by a flood in 1968. The 25,ooo mg
reservoir fcnrmed by the dam will provide a
reliable supply equivalent to 70 mgd.
(b) Improvement of the existing treatment plant at
feija to increase capacity to 13 mgd (Weija ra-
tionalization)e
(c) An intake and raw water puLping station to
withdraw raw water- from the reservoir.
(d) A new treatment plant with a capacity of 20
mgd, designed for staged expansion to an
ultimate capacity of 60 mgd.
(e) A service reservoir of 5 mg capacity (designed
for duplication when required) about halfway
between the treatment works and the existing
Accra distribution system.
(f) About 38,000 feet of transmission mains connect-
ing the raw water intake,the treatment plant,
the service reservoir and the existing distribu-
tion system, together with various connections
to existing mains.
(g) Appruiately 20 miles of now primary distribu-
tion mains to strengthen the existing network
and extend it into newly-developing areas, to-
gether with associated now secondary and tertiary
distribution networks.
(h) Meters and spares necessary to provide 100%
metering of all new connections.
(i)  W3ste water meters and other equipment necessary
for a full-scale program to reduce leakage.



-6-
II, Rural Supplies:
Bitension of rural water supplies in an area of
about 1,000 square miles im_diately to the north
of the Accra/Tema Metropolitan Area, by laying
about 110 miles of small diameter mains, cons-
tructing six small service reservoirs, and other
associated works.
III. Itineering Services and Training
(a) Consulting Services, mostly for construction super-
vision;
(b) Technical Assistance in connecting-up the new
sewerage system, staff training, design of ex-
tensions, and related items;
(c)  tr ig   cilities and   grausj to be defined
when GWSCs overall training program is available
(see para.5.08).
A full description of the Project is given in Annex 2 and locations of
the works are shown on Map IBRD 3762.
3.03           The project is part of a longer-term development of the
Weija systen. On completion of the project works in 1979, the total out-
put of the old and new Weija works will have increased from 8.5 agd to
28 ngd. The distribution sa,tem will be extended and reinforned con-
tinuously to mest the growth of demand throughout this period.
3.o4           The facilities at the We$ija Di include minor works re-
quired to comply with a 1967 request by Government to allow for irriga-
tion next to the Weija site. Thia irrigation project has been reactivated
in early 1974; it presently stands relatively low in the Government s
priority list. A brief field review in Merch 1974 by Bank staff indicated
that the irrigation scheme appears feasible (for full details see Annex 16).
However, its mise and inplementation have still to be defined on the basis
of a full feasibility study,an investigation of potential sedimentation
in the reservoir and within the Goverment's priorities of irrigated
agricultural developmont. During negotiations it was agreed that (a) re-
servoir operating procedures would be established in conaultation with
IDA to determine the allocation between public water supply and other
uses and in the event of water shortages to allocate priority to public
water supply; and (b) no development upstream the Weija site will be
permitted which may adversely affect water supply in both quality and
quantity.
3-05           The project does not irclude extensions to the sewerage
system, primarily because of ATK& 6s financial constraints but also be-
oause A¶DQA needs to obtain experience in comissioning and operating the
works oompleted in 1973, before proceeding to major now developments. It
is expected, however, that during the period of project implementation
ATM& will undertake, out of its own resources, limited extensions of the
sewerage system into adjacent areas, for which provision has been made

3.07           Project coat estimates are based on actual contract
prioe (an pars. 3.15),detailed designs, updated (1974) consultant's
estimates for equipment and materials, and the experience gained in
Ghunm on other works including those funded under Credit 160-GE. The
foreign exchange component has been based on actual contract prices
and the aossuption that foreign contraetors wili win the remining
mjor civil works contrets and that supply items, with the exception
of pipea, will be imported; pipe supply contracts will probably be won
by inufacturers now establishing themselvoe  in Ghana. The foreign
exchange component of the laying by GWSC of the trmnBmission and
primary distribution mains, to be financed by ADB, has been assessed
by ADD on the basis of the necessary overseas technical assistance and
imported equipment.
3.08           Physical contingencies of about 7% have been included,
reflecting allowances on individual items of up to 20%.
3.09           Price contingencies on the local and foreign exchange
components to be financed by ID& and ADB (eoo Annex 3) have been
oalculated on the following bases (a) local price contingencies re-
flecting trends in the local construction industry bave been added
at 15% p.a. decreasing to 10% p.a. in FY 1976 and staying at this
level thereafter; (b) foreign price contingencies have been asumed
at 15% p.e. decreaing to 10% p.a. in 1976 p.a. and 7.5% p.a. there-
after. Price contingencies have been stimated by CIDA as 12-1/2%
p*.* on works to be financed by then. The overmll price contingency
allovmnoe is 2h%.
3.10          In the case of the works financed under Credit
160-GE, aWSC has been exempted by the Govermnent from import daties
and charges an item imported in connection with the projectl it has
been recoefirued during negotiations that it is the Government's
intention to preserve this exemption.
&Moed, Prallel Financing
3.11           In view of the substantial increase of the foreign
exchange component of the project since it was first appraised, and
the linited availability of IDI funds, the Governmnt sought and
reached agrceyent with IDA, the Canadian International Development
Association (CIDA), and African Development Bank (ADD) on a parallel
financing arrangement. IF will finance project elements for which
procurement, which had to be started in 1973 to avoid delays in
project execution, was carried out under IDA international competitive
bidding rules (see part. 3*l5). CIDA's and ADB3s participation has
already been approved by their respective authorities.

3.13           The project elements to be financed by CIDL comprise
(a) raw water paups, (b) supply of treatment plant and (c) con-
struction supervision of all project elements not financed by IDA.
Eased on the estimated foreign exchange component of these item
CIDW's contribution would be US$ 7.5 million of which US$ 5.5 million
is likely to be a loan and US$ 2.0 million, representing consulting
services, a non refundable grant.
3.14           The project elements to be financed by ADB comprise
(a) civil works of the treatment plant and service reservoir, (b)
supply of pipes and fittings for the tranmission and primary dis-
tribution mains, and (c) equipment and technical assistance for the
laying of these mains, Based on the foreign exchaznge component of
these items ADBEs loan would amount to about US$ .8 million.

Construction and Supervision of Construction
3.15           The Project's present status is an follows:
(a) Tenders for the new Weija dam were invited
internationally in mid 1973, to enable
construction to commence in the 1973/74
dry sesaon and to assure the supply to
western Accra by about May 1974. Procedures
were in accordance with IDA uidelines and
the contract was awarded to Salini of Italy
in November 1973. Construction has cowenced.
(b) W&th the agreement of IDI, OWSC has contracted
Tahal for the construction supervision of
the Weija dam# This work is carried out in
association with a newly formed local con-
sulting firm (Architectural and Engineering
Service.).
(c) Tenders for the rural water supply works were
invited in late 1973; thoe for the supply
of pipes and fittings and puping plant
being invited internationally according to
IA Guidelines, and that for the civil works
(not to be financed from the Credit) being
bid locally. GWSC's recommendations on
oentract award were agreed with IDA, but
due to delays in Govr meont approval the
tender validities lapsed, and OWSC has re-
invited bids from the original t nderers
Award of contracts is expected shortly.
(d) Tenders for the reininlng project elements
will be invited during the period 1974-1976
in accordance with the program shown in
Anex 4.
3.16           ATKA, which will have overall responsibility for project
administration, bha appointed GWSC's expatriate former chief engineer
as Project MAnager. During negotiations it was agreed (i) that IDA will
be consulted before any change of project manager is implemented and
(ii) that oWSC will take adequate steps to maintain the Weija dan after
its coustractien, including the possible retention of consulting en-
gineers for regular inspection, and that it will continue the syste-
mtic collection of hydrological data for the Densu RLver basin.



-U-
3.17           Design and construction of the distribution system
component of the project will be the responsibility of ATMA, and
it has been agreed during negotiations that a program
for this work will be drawn up aid implemented in consultation
with IUA.
3.18           The project envisages the use on a stand-by basis of
the Old Kporgfacilities to meet peak demand (see Annex 1 para. 7).
Currently these facilities are on a care-and-maintenance basis.
It has been agreed during negotiations that ATMA will, with
the help of consultants if necessary, undertake a full inventory of
existing facilities and that, as apprepriate, such facilities will be
repaired, upratied and restored to service.
Procurement
3.19           Goods from abroad are generally procured for all
Goveriment agencies by the Ghana Supply Commission. Pbr the previous
IDA Project GWSC was permitted to handle procurement directly through
its consultants. During negotiations, it has been confirmed that it
is the Governmentsa intention to continue this arrangement.
3.20           As described in para. 3.11, the major project elements
to be financed by IDA (Wbija dam and related construction supervision,
the supply of pipes and fittings for the secondary and tertiary dis-
tribution systems, and rural water supplies) either have been or
will be let on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with IDA guidelines. To maintain standardiszation with
existing equipment, some goeda (water meters and equipment for up-
rating the existing Wbija works) amounting to le  than 5% of the pro-
posed Credit, will be bought from provious suppliers.
3.21           Certain contracts--for the installations of the secondary
and tertiary distribution system and for the civil works elements of
the rural water supply scheme--will be awarded by ow8C after local bid-
ding, and will not be financed from the proposed Credit.
3.22           The project elements funded by CIDA will be procured
ex-Canada under CIDA Guidelines, the contracts funded by ADB for the
supply of pipes and fittings for the transmission mains and the primary
distribution system will be awarded on the basis of ADB's international
competitive bidding procedures.
Disbursements
3.23           It is proposed that the Credit be disbursed against the
c.i.f. price of all direct imports under supply contracts, the foreign
exchange component of civil works contracts and of pipe supply contracts,
and the foreign exchange costs of consultants' services, technical
assistance, and training. An estimated schedule of disburements is
shown in Annex 5.



- '2 -
3.24           It is proposed that any credit funds surplus after
completion of the IDA, financed protect elements should be used,
with mIDA  approval, for further emItem.es-ns of the distribution
system and/or additional consulting services.
3.25           It is further proposed that IDA, retroactively flinance
(i) 'US$ 300,000 for consulting bervrices contracted in September 1972
and related to changes in design and procurement and (ii) foreign
exchange costs incurred prior to credit signature in connection with
the dam contract (see para. 3.15 (a)) and construction supervision of
the dam (see para. 3.15 (b)). Assuming that the proposed credit is
approved by the end of FT 1974, total retroactive financing would be
about US$ 2.0 million. As closing date, June 30, 1980 has been agreed.
Rbettlement and Iand Acquisition
3.26           The reservoir formed by the dam will inundate about
12 square miles, of which 7 square miles have already been acquired
by the Goverzment in connection with the existing Wbija works. The
additional land is subject to flooding during the rainy season and
only a small fraction of it is cultivated. There are eight villages
within the area with a population of about 2,000. A detailed socio-
economic survey of the villages carried out by the University of
Science and Technology, Kumasi, in December 1969 showed that the
villages had no infrastructure or social services and that the villa-
gers were willing to sove to new sites where adequate land is availa-
ble for resettlement and faming.  lssettlement should signifioantly
improve the standard of living of the villagers affected by providing
them with better housing, roads, water supply, sanitation, health
facilities and faming opportunitieso There in no indication that
resettlement would have any adverse social or economic, impact. De-
tailed planning and supervision of resettlement will be undertaken
by the University of Kmasi.  flsettleuent costs are included in the
project costs.
BEological Aspects
3.27           The consultants' study of the project included a survey
to investigate possible health hasards that might result from the con-
struction of the new dat. The survey showed that malaria and bilhar-
siasis are endemic in the area; the hasard from these diseases should,
therefore, decrease when the present inhabitants are resettled away
from the iwediate vicinity of the lake and bordering swamps, and pro-
vided with piped water and sanitary facilities.
3.28           G1tC is presently discussing the establishent of a
coinittee of experts to supervise and coordinate investigations into
the envirormental impact of the new Weija reservoir, considering not
only disease vectors but also water quality.

IV. JUSTIFICATIDN
De]ind and Production
4.o1          The main purpose of the project is to met present and
future demand for potable water in Accra/Tema and to extend water supply
to adjacent rural areas.  A supply of piped water is currently available
to all income groups in Accra/Tema but water shortages are experienced
in the dry season.  Without the project, this situation would deteriorate
further in the face of population growth and increasing demands from
industry and commerce. The rural areas adjacent to Accra/Tema have only
limited supplies of piped water and rely mainly on generally polluted
ponds, streams and wells.
4.02           ATMA's production has been growing at an estimated average
of 12.5% per annum over the last decade although the growth rate
slowed to about 9% per annum during the past three years. Statistics on
consumption are unreliable due to the lack of systematic record-keeping
until 1969 and the significant proportion of unmetered consumption which
exigsted until recently lJ.
4.03           The forecasts of future consumption and required production,
detailed in Annex 6, were prepared with the assistance of IDAL They lncorpo-
rate demand studies prepared by consultants, The forecasts are considered
reasonable and are as follows:
(i)       Fbr Accra/Tema., the estimates of consumption are
based on estimates of the main components of demand
(namely industrial, institutions and public authori-
ties, public standpipes, domestic and comercial).
Cocbining these forecasts of individual components
shows a total demand growing at about 8% p.a. in
the five-year period FY 1973-78 and at 6.5% p.a. in
the five-year period FY 1979-83. Total demand has
been converted to required production by assuming
a steady decrease in unaccounted-for-water from the
present 39% to 25% by FY 1982 as a consequence of a
planned leakage detecti n and reduction program
(see para. 5.06).
(ii)      For rural areas  production estimates are based
on consultiats  studies and estimates which employ
appropriate projections of population growth and
per capita deand.
j/ Over 80% of domestic cornections were unmetered until the end of 1971.

Selection of the Project
4¢.04          The site of the Weija dam on the Densu River was
identified for future development as a result of studies carried
out in 1963-70 to determine the least cost source of supply for
Accra.  The only alternative source, the Volta River at Kpong,
was shown to be more costly to develop, mainly because it would
require a 48-mile trnsmission main from Kpong to Accra via Tema,
together with associated pumping facilities, compared to the
approximately 7 illes of tranamission main required for Weija.
Additionally, the dam at Weija will permit continuous use of
existing pumping, treatment and transmision capacity which at
present is under-utilized in the dry season dae to inadequate
river flows.
4.05)g         The design of the lbija dam, deteruined by site
conditions, local seismic activity and high design floods, is
such as to make it more economical to oonstruct the dam immedia-
tely to its maximum height.
Benefits and Costs Attributable to the Project
4.06           Since implementation of the irrigation component
discnsed In pamr  3.04 in still uncertain, the project has been
treated solely as a public water supply project for the purpose
of economic analysis. Thus in the analysis the cost stream
includes (i) the full cost of the Weija dan (no deduction being
mads for a contributin from the Ministry of Agriculture in respect
of irrigation supplies) and of all associated works needed to
treat, convey and distribute water from WbiJa for public supply,
and (ii) the cost of the extensions to rural water supplies in-
cluded in the project. Public water supply revenues attributable
to the project were used as a proxy for benefits and the costa
were adjusted for taxes, duties, depreciation, financing charges
and consumer-financed works. Revenues and costs were expressed
in 19714 prices. (further details are given in Annex 7).
4.07           To take into account the stabilising effect of the
Weija dam in the dry season, operating costs attributable to the
project were calculated by preparing both wet and dry season pro-
duction schedules for Weija and Kpong. Since Weija has lower
operating cost than Kpong, Weija outtput was used to the greatest
extent posoible. Corresponding water #sles attributable to the
project were converted to revenues by applying thepropoed 50%
tariff increase.



- 15 -
4.08           The preceding analysis gave a rate of return of
6%. On the one hand, this rate reflects the fact mentioned in
para. 2.06 that even with the 50% tariff increase agreed upon
the domestic tariff is probably still below the incremental cost
of supply; however the size of the above increase appears to be
at the limit of what the Government can reasonably be expected
to implement at this stage, and, since the social tariff block
could not yet be introduced (para. 2.06), further increases in
the domestic tariff would conflict with a desirable social
objective, by making it even more difficult to extend the be-
nefits of a private connection to a larger sector of the lower
income population. On the other hand, the rate of return under-
estimates the justification of the project because revenues
attributable to the project do'not capture all the benefits.  In
particular revenues due not reflect:
(i) the unquantifiable health benefits
attributable to the project, which
is essential to prevent a progres-
sive and unacceptable decline in
health conditions in Accra/Tena and
which would improve these conditions
in the rural areas it coveras
(ii) the potential irrigation benefits
(par. 3.04 and Annex 16); and
(iii) the unquantifiable benefits of
resettlement, the cost of which
are included in the project costs.

V. THE BORFWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
The Borrower
5.01           The Republic of Ghana would be the Borrower, and
would rolend the proceeds of the credit to (hana Water and Sewerage
Corporatlon (Go1C) en the tervs and conditions described in para.
6.09).
The Beneficiary
5.02           GCw, the Beneficiary, is a statutory corporation
established in September 1966 under the Ghana Water and Sewerage
Act of 1965. aWSC has a oard of seven members including
a represetative of the tinistry ,f Works and Housing., to which
aWSC is responsible. Board msmbe:.s are appointed by the Read of
state.
Organization, Managemnt and Operations
5.03           GWSC is now a relatively decentralized organization
with nine soei-autonomous area organizations headed by area aanager
to whom 41 district manageament units report (see Annex 8). ATNA,
whose operations are as great as the rest of GWSC's activities
combined and which impliaented the project financed under Credit
160-GH, would be responsible for carrying out the project described
in this report. During negotiations it was agreed-as under Credit
160-GH-that any oaterial modification in the structure of GWSC's
organization and operations would be made in consultation with IDA.
5.04           The present managing director of GWSC waa appointed
in late 1973 after serving GWSC in senior positions for mny years.
The ATMA area anager was promoted to his post in early 1973. CIDA
is expected to provide the management assistance in administration
and finance for 2-3 years. To help ensure continued good manageusnt,
it was agreed during negotiation as under Credit 160-GHl, that IDA
should be conulted in connection with future appointmnts to the
posts of anLging director of GWC and mnager of ATMn
5.05           MC Staff total about 4,300 people of whom 330 are in
senior positions. Except at the most senior levels, however, most
of OWSC's technioal staff are recent gradutes with little practical
esperience. For this reason the pace of WSC plamnning, design and
inplem.ntation is slow except where consultants are engaged. Also,
with some exceptions and notably the Accra/Tema system, operations
and maintenance tend to be poor due to lack of trained operating
staff (see paras. 5.07 and 5.08).



- 17 -
5.o6           One particular deficiency of MWSC is its lack of
water leakage control. This applies equally to ATff. In order
to improve the situation, the project would provide ATL with
the necessary equipment for a program, which has recommenced
recently, of sytematic water leakage detection and reduction.
Daring the negotiations, GWSC agreed to submit to IDA, by September
30, 19714, full details of this leakage control program together
with specific water saving targets. ATMlA' system control wil
also be improved by the end of 1974 when full otering will have
been attained.
5.07           GWSC is making efforts to improve its efficiency
but this is being counteracted by both a shortage and a rapid
turnover of qualified staff in key positions. The Chief
Comercial Manager, for example, was promoted to his position
in early 1973, but resigned in Novmber of the sawe year.   e
was the fourth Chief Finance Officer to leave GWSC in the last
five years. The main reason appears to be insufficiently
attractive salaries and terms of service. GWSC is classed as
a Grade II Statutory Corporation, and thereby its salary strac-
ture is inferior to that of, among others, Ghana's two electric
power utilities, which are Grade I. GWSC has asked the Government
to reclassify it as a Grade I corporation. Durin&_negotiations ___
the Government has advised IDA of its own concern about GWSCIs
staffing difficulties and indicated tha% based on an ongoing review,
it expects that GWSC*a employment terms will become coapetitive.
Training
5.08           In addition to in-service trining, GWSC provides
and finances for its staff short courses at its own two vocational
schools, courses at local technical and management institutions,
and post grmduate courses at local and foreign universities. In
FY 1973 sowe 400 individuals benefited from GWSC training programs.
A deputy managing director is responsible for the Corporation's
Personnel and Training Department and a training committee, composed
of some of GWSC$s most senior staff, is charged with advising on
training in general and preparing training programs, budgets and
syllabi. With the aid of a part time training specialint GWSC is
preparing a five year manpower forecast . During negotiations GWSC
agreed to submit to IDA by September 30, 1974 its comprehensive training
program as the basis for employing that part of the proposed IDA
Credit allocated to training.

tanagst Systems
5.09          Procedures are in regular use for collecting and
reporting technical, co_orcial and financial inforuation relating
to the regional organisations, ,anl for its compilation and analysis
at  SC headquarters. GUWC uses , public utility accounting system
which allows the accounts of each region, headquarters, and the
stores division to be kept separately, and financial statements for
these to be prered separately. Management is thus able to reviev
the financial pesition of each division and the position of the
Corporation as a whole.
5.10          GWSC has about four years of computer proeossing
eoerience, and uses the computer for billings in Accra, prepara-
tion of monthly payrlls and for periodic stores inventories.
Audit
5.ln             SC's accounts are subject to audit by the Auditor-
Genersl or by an auditor appointed by hia. 0iSC's present auditor.
are the local branch of the private international firm, lamood
armer Co. This arrangement in satisfactory. In view of past de-
lays, it as agreed during negotiations that (a) ATAK's accounts
be audited eparately and that the audit report will be side availa-
ble to Im within 4 months of the close of the financial year, and wl
(b) the audit of GMC's consolidated accounts will be  ade available
to IDA within 6 months of the close of the financial year.

VI. FINANCE
Introduction
6.01      GWSC's financial management has improved substantially in
recent years not least because of requirements established by IDA in
onnection with Credit 160-GH.  Consolidated deficits after deprecia-
tion have been reduced by 65% from the level of 1969, when Credit 160-GH
was approved; and in the three major urban centers, Accra/Tema, Kumasi
and Sekondi/Takoradi revenues now more than cover operating costs.
ATMA itself achieved a rate of return on net fixed water supply assets
of It% in FY 1973,as required by the terms of Credit 160-GH.
Past Performance and Financial Position
(a) GWSC's Consolidated Finances
6.02      Annexes 10 and 11 present GWSCts historical income statements
and balance sheets for the period FY 1971-73. Between FY 1971 and 1973,
GWSC's water revenues increased by about 21% from % 7.8 million to % 9.4
million, with ATMA, and the two other major systems, Kumasi and Sekondi/
Takoradi, accounting for about 2/3 of total water revenues. In GWSC's
eight other regional systems, Government subsidies were required to
cover cash operating costs. These subsidies have averaged ¢ 1.5 million an-
nually over the past three years. As of end of June 1973, GWSC was
adequately capitalized with resources sufficient to meet its short and
long-term obligations.
6.03      Bofors the esaUbliehuest of MISC, all capital works were
financed by Government grants. The improved financial conditions of
GWSC's major urban areas will permit thee to use increased debt finan-
cing in future. Thus it is proposed that the planned expansions in
Sokondi/Takoradi (water supply) and Kumasi (sewerage) should be largely
debt-financed. Fbr all other systems, including rwual water supplies,
it will probably be necessary for Governrment to continue to provide GWSC
with development and annual operational fundsed Duing negotiations GWSC
agreed - as under Credit 160-GH - not to incur any debt unless its net re-
venues for a particular financial year exceeded 1.5 times the maximum
debt service requirement during any succeeding year.
6.04      Government has directed that G'iSC should eventually take over
all water supply systems that are still operated by local councils. In
connection with this, Government agreed, under Credit 160-GH, to meet
the capital costs and operating losses incurred through such take-overs
Of non-viable systems. These agreements were extended to the proposed Credit.
(b) ATKA
6.o5      As shown in Annexes 10 and 11, ATMA accounts for about half
of GWSC's consolidated revenues and assets.  Between Fr 1969 and F! 1973,



- 20 -
ATMA's water revenuea more than doubled from % 2.1 million to 0
million due to tariff increases (1969), increased water consumption
and better management. The operating ratio of about .50-.60 during
the last three years was satisfactory. ATMA is the only GWSC system
in which revenues exceed operating costs and depreciation. However,
ATMA's liquidity position at the end of FY 1973 was tight and this
is likely to continue due to the delay in obtaining Government
agreement to tariff increases. ATMA's highly leveraged long-term
capitalization includes a 0 20.0 million subordinated Government debt
assumed under a covenant of Credit 160-GH to reflect part of the value
of assets taken over from the Government at its establishment.  Assets
in operation before 1966 were valued in 1971 and this valuation was
subsequently approved by IDA.
Buture Finances
(a) GWSC's Consolidated Finances
6.o6           In view of considerable uncertainties,both about GWSC
requirements and sources of funds, meaningful financial projections
for GWSC as a whole cannot be prepared at this time. This is particu-
larly so as the costs of GWSC's FY 1975-79 invlestment program, (see
para, 2.06) probably are significantly underestimated and so far
sources have yet to be identified for a substantial part of planned
activities.
(b) ATMA
6.07           ATMAts projected operations during FY 1974-1983 are
presented in Annexes 12, 13 and 14.  Related assumptions are discussed
in Annex 15.

6.o9     The Goverment has agreed to relend the proceeds of the
proposed IDA Credit of US$ 104 million to GWSC at interest of
7-1/4% p.a. for a term of 25 years including six and one half
years grace. In view of the long life of the assets the assumed
25 years term is reasonable.



- 22 -
6.10           The CIDA contribution will to be composed of
a non-refundable grant of US$ 2.0 million, equivalent for con-
sulting services, and of a US$ 5.5 million loan to the Government,
at no interest, and repayable over 50 years including 10 years
of grace. It is expected that Government will relend the whole
US$ 7.5 million at 2-1/2% over 25 years including six and half
years grace.
6.11           ADB has agreed to make a Loan of 4.0 million units
of account (US$ 4.8 million equivalent) to GWSC directly, bearing
interest of 6% pluw a 1% statutory coaindion over 22 years in-
cluding 5 years grace.
6.12           It is expeuted that local comercial banks will
jointly ako  available about US$ 7 million to GWSC to cover 13%
of ATMAs investment program.  The term assumed is 25 years in-
cluding five years of grace and interest at 8%. The remainder
of project costs is expected to be met by Government through an equity
contribution currently estimated at % 8.7 million (US$7.6 million) and
internal cash generation of US$ 15.5 million equivalent.
6.13           During negotiations, it wan agreed that the
Government will:
(a) relend the IDA Credit on terms acceptable
to IA
(b) provide OWSC with whatever additional
funds are reqjuired to complete the Project.
6.14&          During negotiations it was further agreed that the
IDA Credit would not become effective before both the CIDk and ADB
grants and Loans and their terms and conditions vis-a-via GWSC would
have been formalized or alternative financing, satisfactory to IDA,
arranged.

Projected FInancial Position
6.15           ATMAla water revenues are projected to increase from
their present level of about 0 5.1 million to $ 12.0 million by the
end of the project construction period (FY 1979). The increase of
135% would result from projected increases in consumption, but more
importantly from a 50% increase, in the average tariff. During
negotiations it has been agreed that such tariff increase  shall be
a condition of Credit effectiveness. I1k wan however assured that the
Government had already app.oved the appropriate increases effective
by not later than August 1, 1974 and that only the imsusing of the
tariff regulation remains outstanding.   A further average tariff
increase of 40% in FY 1980 would be needed to allow sufficient
cash flow for the next phase of ATMAT e3pansion. Such an increase
together with sewer,age user charges now proposed by GWSC are
assumed in the projections of FY 1974-1982. ATMAIs financial po-
sition (see Annexes 11, 12 and 13) is sunmarized below:

6.16           Projected rates of return on average net fixed assets in
service are satisfactory. The teiuporary decrease of the retimn in Fr
1978 and 1979 reflects completion of the project and thus a significant
increase in the rate base, As water supply revenues will have to par-
tially cover sewerzage operating and capital costs for soms time, agree-
ment has been reached during negotiations that the rate base agreed under
Credit 160-GH be expanded to include sewerage assets and that rates wil.
be maintained to yield at least a 7% return except for the final two years
Of proJect construction when the return should not be less than 3%. It
has further been agreed that sewerage charges would cover
ewerage operating costs and depreciation during FT 1980.
6.17           The projected debt/equity ratio of at least 58/42 and
debt service coverage of at least 2.2 are satisfactory. In order to
limit ATMA's debt servicing obligations Government has agreed during
negotiations that it would defer ATMA'. debt service obligation of
0 1.8 million p.a. on its subordinated debt of A 20.0 million (ee
para. 6.05) until the end of the project construction period in FT
1979.

Othr Financial Management Aspects
6.18           AM  has made coniderable efforts to improve
its billing sstem and revenue collection. The ratio of ATMIs
collections to annual billings increased from 65% in FY 1969 to
90 in PT 1973. Further progress will depend on more regular
pa7ments by Governmnt Departments. During negotiations it
has been agzeed that the Government would cause its departmnts
to pay within three mnth their bills for future water and
sewerag  services; bills already outstanding would be sttled
before Jme 30, 1975.

GHANA
ACCRA/TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT-SECOND STAGE
Existing Water Supply and Sewerage in Greater Accra
1.        The Greater Accra area is supplied with water from two sources -
the DssU RLver at WeiJa 14 miles to the W"t of JcLra, and the
Volta River at Kpong some 50 miles to the northeast of Accra. The water
treatment plants are located at Weija and Kpong.
Weija Water Works
2.        The installed capacity is now 8.5  mgd, comprising 4.5  mgd from
the "New Works" constructed in 1954 and 4.0 mgd from the "West German Works"
constructed in 1965. A report by Tahal Consulting Engineers in September
1967 proposed various minor improvements and extensions - the "Weija Ration-
alization" - which would increase the works output to 13.0 'mgd at low cost.
This proposal is to be implemented as part of the Project (slee Annex 2).
3.       The treatment process consists of chemical coagulation followed by
clarification, rapid gravity filtration, pH control and chlbrination. A
laboratory at the works carries out rcutine chemical, bacteriological and
biological tests on the water. A training sohool for waterworks operators
is also operated at Weija.
4.        The water to supply the works is drawn from the Densu river.  A low
dam was constructed across the river in 1952, and the storage increased by
installing spillway gates in 1959.  In 1965 Tahal reported that the dam
foundations appeared unsafe and that the spillway capacity was inadequate,
but no remedial measures were taken and the dam was washed away by a flood
in 1968.
5.        In the absence of impounding storage at Weija, the nominal output
of 8.5 mgd cannot be maintained during the dry season. In 1969 the river
dried up completely for 37 days, and in 1973 the works output averaged less
than 1  mgd throughout February and less than 3 mgd during March. This led
to severe water shortages in parts of western Accra, which cannot be supplied
by water from the Kpong system,
6.        The water is delivered to Accra by four gravity mains - 12-inch (1913),
14-inch (1929), 16-inch (1952) and 21-inch (1959) - with a combined capacity
of about 10  mgd. A booster pumping station was constructed on the 21-inch main
at Odorkor in 1966 to increase the system capacity to 13.0 mgd, but is now out
of commission; as part of the project works distribution system modifications
will be undertaken to restore the conveyance capacity to 13 mrgd (Annex 2).



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Old Kpong Works
7.        In 1954 a 1.5 mgd capacity works was built at Kpong village on
the west bank of the Volta river, some 15 miles downstream of the Volta dan
at Akosombo. It was extended to 7.5 mgd by mid-1966, but was retired when the
New Kpong works were commissioned. The facilities are generally serviceable,
and it is proposed that they should be brought back into at least intermittent
use as part of the project, as explained in Annex 2.
8.        A 21-inch transmission main 35 miles long was constructed in
1958-59 to convey treated water from the works to a terminal reservoir in
Tema. The design capacity of the main was 2.9Imgd, and its present capacity
is thought to be about 2.0 mgd.
New KponR Works
9.        Opposite the old works, a new works (the "New Kpong" or "STEPRI"'
works)was constructed in 1966-67. The treatment process consists of chemical
coagulation, rapid sand filtration, chlorination and pH correction, and a
modern plant control laboratory is provided.
10.      The filtered water is pumped by series high-lift pumps through a
42-inch diameter 34-mile long steel main to a 10 mg terminal reservoir at
Tema.
Tema-Accra Link
11.      From Tema,part of the New Kpong output can be pumped to a 10 mg
terminal reservoir at Accra through a 32-inch diameter steel main 14 miles
long running parallel to the Accra-Tema motorway. The normal capacity of
this main has recently been measured as 19.5 mgd.
Distribution System
12.      A detailed master plan for the distribution system serving the
metropolitan area was prepared under the UNDP/WHO study, and is being
implemented in stages as required. The system is divided into high, medium
and low pressure zones, with appropriate service reservoirs and booster pumps.
Total service reservoir capacity is 33 m;,. about equal to peak daily demand.
ATMA will shortly complete and commission a further 4 mg  service reservoir
in a poorly-served area of western Accra.
13.      Under the First Project, which has recently been completed (Credit
160-GH), the distribution system has been extended and reinforced. About
28 miles of mains from 10-inch to 20-inch diameter have been added to the
primary distribution grid in Accra, and 6.6 miles in Tema. A total of about
76 miles of new mains have been added to the secondary and tertiary distri-
bution grids.
14.      The supply is made through about 37,000 connections, of which about
90% are domestic and about 1% are public standpipes. All connections
except some of the public standpipes and some of the domestic consumers are
metered. In December 1971 ATMA introduced a program to meter all domestic
consumers, and by December 1973 had reduced the proportion of unmetered



ANNEX 1
Page 3
connections from 80 o/o to 45 o/o. Outside the metropolitan area, some
of the smaller rural communities are served by pipeline extensions from
the Accra/Tema system. In the past three years over 20 o/o of the mains
laid by ATMA have been for these rural communities.
Sewerage and Sewage Disposal
15.      Tema has a sewerage system constructed and operated by the Tema
Development Council which is being expanded as new housing and industrial
areas are completed.
16.      At present, Accra is dependent on septic tanks and a night soil
collection system. Under the First Project about 17 miles of 9-inch to
39-inch diameter sewers have been laid, serving the residential and
commercial districts of central Accra. Sewage is being discharged at sea
through three 12-inch and three 10-inch submarine outfalls 4,000 feet long,
constructed from steel pipelines formerly used for the conveyance of oil
and donated to ATMA. The project also included improved arrangements for
the disposal of night soil and septic tank wastes, which will be collected
at a new works and discharged to sea through the submarine outfalls, and
improved sanitary arrangement; in some low-income areas.

ACCRA/TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
Project Description
General
The project includes the construction of a new dam at Weija,
improvement of the existing treatment works at Weija, construction of
additional raw water pumping and water treatment facilities of 20 mgd
capacity at Weija, construction of a 5 Ing  service reservoir, new trans-
Mission and distribution mains in Accra and Tome, water meters and
equipment for leakage detection.
Piped water supply will be extended to 132 coounities in
adjacent rural areas. As part of the project, technical assistance will
be provided to ATNA in the commissioning and operation ot the sewerage
system now installed in central Accra, and in preparing plans for future
extensions.
The project has been designed by Tahal Consulting Engineers
(Tahal) of Tel Aviv (Israel). It forms part of a master plan for water
supply and sewerage for the metropolitan area prepared by Tahal in asso-
ciation with Engineering Science International Ltd.   of Arcadia (Cali-
fornia, USA), under a study financed by the UNDP (Special Fund) with
the World Health Organization (WHO) as executing agency.
Wija Dqa
The new dam will be constructed on the Donsu River at Weija,
about 14 Miles west of Accra, to replace an earlier dam on an adjacent
aite which was washed away in 1968. The maximum height of the now dam
will be about 55 feet above river bed level, or 75 feet above projected
fourndation level. The reservoir formed ly the dam will have a gross
storage of 25,000 mg at normal water level.
The method of constructing the dam will be so arranged that a
aupply of at least 13 mgd will be available for Accra from the 1974 wet
season (i.e. end-FT 1974) onwarda.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
The dam is situated in an area of tectonic activity. In
view of its site, it is designed as a zoned earthfill dan with an
impervious core of compacted laterite and with rockfill armoring to
upstream and dowetream slopes. Site investigations have indicated
that suitable construction material is available locally. The
spillway will be a mas concrete structure constructed in the rock
of the right abutment, provided with 5 radial gates each 19 feet
high and 30 feet wide.
The reservoir is designed to yield 70 zgd. The yield
figures will be revised when a longer time-series of river gauging
records is available.  Studies have shown that it is uneconomical
and technically difficult to construct the dam in stages, and it will
therefore be built to its full height iimediately. Outlet works have
been provided, at nominal cost, for the proposed irrigation scheme.
The original design of the dam was proposed by Tahal in
their Design Report of March 1970. The assumptions underlying the
design, in particular the adequacy of the field investigations, the
allowance made for the effect of earthquakes, and the design spill-
way floods, were questioned by Harza Engineering Company of Chicago
(USA), who formed part of a consortium carrying out a water resources
sector study in Ghana in 1969-70 financed by USAID. Tahalls proposals
were therefore reviewed in 1971 by two international experts, Professor
Fay K. Linsley and Dr. James L. Sherard. Professor Linsley's hydrolo-
gical review confirmed that Tahal's estimates of maximum flood-flows
vere acceptable for design. Dr. Sherard's review of the design of the
dar indicated the desirability of some iinor modifications !I. These
have been incorporated in the present design with only marginal increase
in cost.
A further report to Tahal by Dr. Sherard In May 1973 describea
the minimum instrumentation considdered necessary (settlement, movement,
water table and seepage measurements) to monitor dam performance, and
advises on the necessity for the analysis of these measurements by a
competent engineer, particularly during the early years of reservoir
operation.
Intake Works
An intake tower with multi-level drawoffs will be constructed
in the reservoir and connected by a concrete conduit to the raw water
pumping station. The intake works have a capacity of 70 mgd, and are
designed to supply both the new pumping station and also the existing
raw water pumping station, since the present intake to the latter will
be removed during conatruction of the dam.

ANNEX 2
Page 3
Raw Water Pumping Station
The new raw water pumping station will be constructed on the
left bank of the river immediately downstream of the dam. It is designed
to house four electrically-driven vertical spindle pumps, each with a
capacity of 10,6 mgd against a design head of 371 feet. Three pumps will
be installed under the present project, one acting as a standby unit, to
give a nominal station capacity of 20 mgd. Later addition of a further
pumpeet will increase nominal station to 30 mgd.
Iaw Water Main
A raw water main approximately 5,000 feet long will deliver
raw water from the pumping station to the treatment works. The present
contract drawings and designs show this main as steel, but tenderers
will be invited to offer alternative designs in prestressed concrete.
A German company is currently establishing a factory in Accra to produce
cylinder-type prestressed concrete pipes, and budgetary quotations in-
dicate locally-manufactured pipes of this type will prove more economical
than imported pipes of any type. The main in sized at 32-inch, with a
capacity of 20 agd, to be duplicated in the next stage of development.
Treatment Works
A new treatment works of 20 mgd capacity will be built adjacent
to the existing treatment work on the high ridge forming the reservoir
left bank. Water pumped by the raw water pumping station to the treatment
works inlet will flow from there by gravity through the various stages of
treatment, and down the treated water conveyance system to Accra without
the need for further pumping. The treatment processes will consist of
aeration, coagulation with aluminum sulphate, clarification, rapid gravity
filtration, pH adjustment and chlorination. Complete plant designs and
specifications prepared for the design report referred to above form the
basis for the tender documents, but tenderers are invited to submit alter-
native proposals.
The plant is planned for staged expansion to 60 _xgd (the estimat-
ed yield of the reservoir less the capacity of the existing treatment plan).
It is envisaged that first stage of expansion will be by 10 mgd, to a total
output of 30 mgd, by the construction of one more clarifier and two more
filters, and appropriate provisions have been made in the design.



ANNEX 2

"Rationalization" of Exdsting Weija Works
The existing raw water puxming system and treatment works
at Weija will be uprated from 8.5 mgd to about 13.0 mgd capacity,
following the recommendations in a report dated September 1967 by
Tahal.
Treated Water Transmission System
A 36-inch diameter main about 17,000 feet long will connect
the clear water tank at the treatment works to the service reservoir on
McCarthy hill. A short length of 34-inch main will cross-connect the
service reservoir with the existing transmission mains. A 13,300 feet
long main (10,000 feet 40-inch diaeter, the remainder 28-inch) will
connect the service reservoir to the existing Accra distribution system.
The treated water conveyance system has been designed to convey
19  mg4, (l  jqofrom the new works and 4  mgd resulting from uprating of
the existing worke, permitting one of the elder Weija mains to be retired
except in emergencies and the other to be used for rural water supplies).
It will require duplication once the new works output exceeds 15 mgd, and
the duplicated system will be adequate to serve the headworks expansion
to 30 ugd.
Service beservoirs
A new concrete service reservoir of 5  mg capacity will be built
on McCarthy hill, on the alignment of the treatment water transmission
mains between Weija and Accra. The site is planned for future expansion to
10  mgd.   A steel elevated tank of 10,000 g capacity will be constructed
on the motorway alignoent between Accra and Tema to serve the developing
area of Teshi-Nungua.
I.stribution System
As part of the project, primary distribution mains will be laid
as follaws: In Accra, one 21-inch main 10,000 feet long to serve the
newly developing area of Dansoman, and two 8-inch mains totalling 14,000
feet to strengthen the existing netirork; in Teshi-Nungua, a 19,000 feet
length of 15-inch and 10-inch main to new development zones; and in Tema
37,000 feet of mains between 10 and 15-inch diameter to supply new comu-
nities now being developed. These mains are designed as asbestos cement,
but alternative proposals for uPVC (unplasticised polyvinyl chloride)
mains are invited in the tenders, for the supply of the pipes. The
mains will be laid by ATMA, using equipmsnt financed by ADB and with
technical assistance also provided by ADB.



ANNEX 2
PZge 5
A further major link in the primary network is a main 22,400
feet long over the Kuasiman ridge, which will enable water from the
Accra terminal reservoir to be brought to Weatern Accra.
The associated secondary and tertiary distribution system
mains will be laid departmentally by ATMA using uPYC
or asbestos-cement pipes procured after international coapetitive bid-
ding and financed out of the proposed Credit. Locally-mnufactured
UPIC pipes are more expensive than the imported equivalents, but it
is expected that a factory for asbestos-cement pipes, which is just
being established in Accra, will be able to compete successfully with
imports in all sies.
Water Meters
The current Crash Metering Program will result in complete
metering in the Accra/Teoa area by the end of 1974. Meters will con-
tinue to be installed on all new connections, and provision has been
made in the project estimates for the import of the necessary meters
and spare parts.
LeaLage Detection Equipment
ATKA are currently re-establishing their leakage detection
and prevention service, and the formulation of a campaign to reduce
leakage will be one of the conditions of the proposed credit. The
project estimates include the purchase of waste water meters, pipe
detectors, electronic sounding equipment, and other necessary items.
Sewerage and Sewage Disposal
Financial constraints preclude major sewerage investments by
ATMA in the near future. Moreover, ATMA have at present no experience
in commissioning and operating a sewerage systes, and in the immediate
future will be fully occupieid in making connections to the system in-
stalled under Credit 160-GH and in bringing it into service. It is
therefore also operationally premature to include further sewerage works
in the present project.
It is however essential that ATMA continue to receive technical
assistance in sewerage planning and operations, and the project estimates
include for the provision of the services of the engineer formerly employed
by the consultants for the Credit 160-GH sewerage works, together with a
small allowance for other expert assistance. His duties will include:
commissioning of new works; establishing maintenance procedures; training

of Ghanaian staff; drawing up and supervising implementation of a
connections program; collecting data for tariff studies; design and
execution of experimental community wash-houses and toilets in urban
sub-tribal areas; design and supervision of construction of sewerage
exteneions to be executed by ATMA; drawing up consultants' terms of
reference for future studies and supervising such studies.
Water Supply to Rural Areas
The project area is about 1,000 square miles in extent and
lies between Akosombo and the Volta river to the north, the Atlantic
coast to the south, Sangaw Lagoon to the east and the Weija water works
on the Doenu river to the west.  It contains the area served by GWSC's
Ac¢ra/Tema Metropolitan Area organisation, and also numerous villages
and small townships. One of the objectives of the project ia to pro-
vide an adequate supply of potable water to all the rural population
in this area, which at present partly depends on streams or shaluw
wells which are heavily polluted.
The area contains 132 mmall communitieo varying in sise from
under 100 to about 7, 500 people, their total population being about
170,000. About 50 of the communities are served with piped water dran
from ATMA's existing system, or will be served by schemes now under
construction* Water will be supplied to the remaining cowunities under
the project.
Water from the Wbija works wil1 be used to suply a few commu-
nities in its area, but the main source of rural supply will be the
existing works at Ipong. At present rural supplies from Kpong are given
by transferring water treated at the New Kpong works to Old Kpong, and
pumping it into supply. This pattern of operation will be maintained as
far as possible, with the Old Kpong treatment works being brought back
into service from time to tims to meet peak demanda; no now treatent
facilities will be required for the rursl supplies.
The proJect includes the laying of 110 miles of 4-inch to 8-
inch mains (probably locally-manufactured asbestos coment or uPVC pipes),
the construction of six small service reservoirs with capacities between
0.02 and 0.2  Mg, the construction of seven maintenance yards and the pro-
vision of additional pumpsets at the Old Rpong works and at an intermediate
booster station. Distribution will be mainly by public standpipes. Master
meters will be installed on the main pipelines to measure the quantities of
water supplied to the various communities.

Engineering
ATMA's present consultants, Tahal, have been retained under
a new agreemnmt for supervision of construction of the dam. Tahal
is carrying out this work in joint venture with a newly formed local
consulting firm, Architectural and Engineering Services. This is in
line with the Government'a policy to develop local consulting expertise.
The engineering services for all other project works will be carried out
by a Canadian consultant to be chosen by CIDA.
ATMA will retain Ghanaian consultants for supervision of
resettlement of villagers displaced by the new Weija reservoir.

ACCRA/TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
Demand and Production Forecasts /1
1.        Estimates of water demand for Accra/Tema up to 1983 are built
upon estimates of the following components: industrial; institutions and
public authorities; public standpipes; domestic; and commercial. Corres-
ponding production requirements are obtained by adding to these demand
forecasts allowances for leakage. Estimates for the rural areas are based
upon projections of population and required production per capita. The
results, summarized in Attachment I, are based upon discussions
held with GWSC during the appraisal updating mission in April 1973, ATHA
statistics, and previous demand studies. While the forecasts are believed
to provide a reasonable basis for project planning, the analysis at several
points is conjectural. Apart from the usual uncertainties of demand fore-
casting, ATMA has compiled consumption data on a systematic basis only
during the past 3 1/2 years. Furthermore, a significant component of past
consumption has had to be estimated, since until recently only 20 o/o of
domestic connections were metered. Consequently, the forecasts will have
to be regularly updated in the light of the improved consumption data which
should become available as the percentage of metered domestic accounts
increases.
2.        Over the last decade, the population of Accra/Tema grew at an
annual average rate of 6 o/o, reaching about 700,000 by the 1970 Census.
Over the same period, the rural communities in the project area grew at
2.3 o/o p.a. on the average, and population had reached a total of
160,000 by the 1970 Census. For the purposes of the demand forecasts,
it is assumed that the population of Accra/Tema will continue to grow at
6 o/o p.a. In the rural communities of the project area, however, there is
evidence that the population growth rate is moving closer to the national
average of 2.5 o/o and this is the rate adopted for the future.
Industrial
3.        From the limited information available, industrial consumption
seems to have grown on average at 25 o/o to 30 o/o p.a. over the five-
year period FY 1967-1971, due larg..ly to the rapid industrialization of
Tema, which accounts for over 90 o/o of total industrial consumption.
Demand fell during FY 1972 due to a general fall in economic activity,
but is estimated to have risen again during FY 1973. As a result, industrial
demand grew at an average rate of only 12 o/o p.a. over the past three years.
This rate is believed to be more representative for the near future as
industrialization in Tema slows down. Growth of 12 o/o p.a. in industrial
water demand is therefore projected for the next three years, falling to
10 o/o in FY 1977, 8 o/o in FY 1978, 6 o/o in FY 1979 and 5 o/o p.a. in the
remaining years to FY 1973.
/1 These forecasts were made at the tine of the reappraisal mission
of April 1973. Since subsequent events give no reason to change
them, they have been kept in their original form.

Institutions and Public Authorities
4.        Sales to this category of consumers have grown continually
over the past three years at an average rate of 25 o/o p.a. However,
the available quarterly data show three quite distinct phases, the first
quarter (ending September 30, 1969) being unusually low and the last
four quarters (ending December 31, 1972) being unusually high. Growth
in the middle period (essentially calendar years 1970 and 1971) was at
6 o/o p.a. which is close to the population growth rate and demand is
therefore assumed to grow at this rate up to 1973.
Public Standpimes
5.       Over the past three years the number of public standpipes has
remained virtually constant. Quarterly consumption per standpipe is
estimated by GWSC to be 420,000 gallons (equivalent to about 7.5 hours'
continuous use per day, which is believed to be typical). In the fore-
casts it is assumed that the number of standpipes and the population
served by them will remain at their present levels, and that the total
consumption from standpipes will continue at about 600  mg p.a.
Domestic
6.       In preparing the forecasts of domestic consumption through
private connections, the mission attempted to take into account two
opposing factors: rising standards of living will tend to be reflected
in higher per capita consumptions, but on the other hand GWSC's policy
of increasing the proportion of households with private connections will
tend to reduce the overall per capita consumption as lower-income groups
are connected. The approach adopted was to divide the population into
three categories and to assume that the share of each category in the
total population would remain constant over the forecast period. The
categories are:
(a) Existing metered domestic connections, which accounted for
nearly 60 o/o of total private connections at the end of
December 1972. These were used to represent a higher-income
segment of the community. Future consumption was estimated
by increasing the FY 1973 consumption by 6 o/o p.a. (to
reflect population growth) and a further 1 o/o p.a. to reflect
increasing per capita usage.
(b) Fisting unmetered domestic connections, representing a
middle-income segment of the community. Because, until
the end of 1971, unmetered connections were estimated
arbitrarily and inconsistently, consumption records for
this category are of little value in forecasting. How-
ever, the increasing number of metered connections has
permitted and analysis of the incremental effect of meter-
ing. Over the 6-month period July-December 1972 the con-
sumption of newly-metered consumers averaged 4,600 gallons/
connection/month. This appears low but seems to be con-
firmed by a further analysis of the billings for metered
accounts in Accra for May 1973. Of the 8,300 accounts
examined, the lowest third consumed on average 4,600
gallons/month. Unmetered consuwption for FY 1973 was



ANNEX 6
Page 3
therefore estimated by assuming a oonsumption of
14,500 gallons per month per uvntered connection
and tultiplying by the average number of connee-
tions In 1973 (13,300)  Forecasts wern obtained
by inereasing this estimate by 6% p.a. for
population growth and a further 2% p.a, for
growth in per capita consumption.
(c) Users of public standpipes, representing a lower-income
segment of the community. It is estimated that 330,000
persons, or 40 0/0 of the population of Accra/Texaa, at
present depend on standpipes and consume 5gped. In the
consumption forecasts, it is projected that this number
will continue to rely on standpipes, but private connections
will be provided for the increasing balance. Their consumption
characteristics up to FY 1978 are expected to be similar to
existing unmetered domestic consumers with private connections,
i.e., an estimated 7.5 gpcd. After FY 1978, consumption is
assumed to increase steadily to a level of 10 gped by 1983.
7.       The results of the above analysis showed that overall per capita
domestic consumption would remain constant up to Fl 1978 at about 13.5 gpcd
and increase only marginally thereafter. This level of per capita consuimption
- compared with other countries - seems low for private connections, although
comparisons are complicated by differing circumstances and inadequate data.
Commercial
8.       The number of commercial connections, which had been more or less
constant in Fl 1970, fell sharply in FT 1971 and in the first two quarters
of FY 1972. The fall is attributed to the Government's policy of Ghanaian-
ization of small businesses, as embodied in the Compliance Act of 1969 and
the Ghana Business (Promotion) Act of 1970 which reduced the number of small
businesses. The elimination of the smaller business has led to an increase
in the average consumption per connection. These trends appear to have
stopped,since during calendar year 1972 the number of connections and
consumption per connection have stabilized. The forecast assumes that the
number of connections will return to the FY 1970 level by FY 1976 (with a
corresponding decline in average consumption per connection) and that
commercial consumption will grow at 6 o/o p.a. thereafter in line with
population growth.
Total Sales for Accra/Tema
9a       The assumptions described above led to the water demand forecasts
for each consumer class shown in Attachment I. Total sales are obtained by
aggregation and imply growth rates of about 8 o/o p.a. in the five-year
period to FY 1973-78 and 6.5 o/o p.a. in the five-year period FY 1979-83.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
Required Production for Accra/Tema
10.      Production requirements are obtained by adding to the demand
forecasts an assessment of leakage. Such an assessment is complicated
by the absence of reliable past sales statistics, notably due to the
high proportion of unmetered accounts and the short time-series available.
Values reported by GWSC for FYs 1970, 1971 and 1972 were 32 o/o, 29 o/o and
44o/o respectively of total production. Estimates of water production for
FY 1973, combined with estimates of sales in this year, indicate a current
percentage of 36 o/o (equivalent to over 12 mgd).
11.      ATMA has recommenced with leakage detection work.  It has been
assumed that this effort will reduce the percentage of unAccounted for
water to 30% by PY 1976 (when in absolute terms it will still amount to
11 mgd), and to 25% (13 mgd) by FY 1982.
Rural Areas
12.      Existing information to serve as a basis for demand projections
in the rural communities served by the project is even less reliable than
information used for Accra/Tema. Studies by consultants show that the
132 rural communities involved vary considerably in size and likely per
capita consumption. The latter is due partly to differences in the
proportion of domestic demand, industrial demand, supply through stand-
pipes and supply through private connections. Production for the rural
areas is at present believed to be growing at around 7 o/o p.a. and this
growth is projected up to FY 1977, the first full year of supply under
the project. Consultants estimate production requirements of 11 gpcd by
1985 (growing at 0.3 gpcd annually). Additional provision of 0.8 mg per
annum by FY 1980 is made for industries on which some definite information
exists. Combining these data with population forecasts for the rural areas
gives the production requirements shown in Attachment I.

ACCRA/TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
Rate of Return Calculations and Sensitivity Analysis
Introduction
1.        In view of the (as yet) undefined nature of the recently
reactivated irrigation component, the economic analysis defines the
project as the long-term public water supply development program for
the Weija system, i.e. the proposed Weija dam and all additional works
required to enable full use of the Weija facility, and the extensions
to rural water supplies /1. The project area is supplied from two
existing sources at Kpong and Weija. In the absence of impounding
storage at Weija, the nominal output of 8.5 mgd is available for about
ten months of the year. During the dry season (about two months dura-
tion) output from Weija falls to low levels and frequently dries up
completely (see Annex 1 para 5).
2.        In calculating the economic return, benefits and costs
attributable to the project are taken over an assumed project life of
50 years and defined as the difference in benefits and costs with and
without the project. As explained in para 6 below, the economic bene-
fits of the project cannot be fully quantified and expected revenues at
1974 price levels were used as a proxy. As far as costs are concerned,
under "without project" conditions operating costs alone are relevant.
Replacement costs and terminal values were taken into account but have
little effect on the results since they are either common to both alter-
natives or else reduced significantly by the discounting process. All
costs are expressed at 1974 prices and exclude taxes, duties, depreciation
and financing charges.
"With Projects" Conditions
3.        (a) Production.  Forecasts of production were derived as
described in Annex 6, and partitioned between the dry season (two months
duration with production assumed to be 10 o/o above the annual average)
and the remainder of the year. Since Weija has lower operating cost than
Kpong, Weija output was assumed to be used at all times to the fullest
possible extent.
(b) Revenue. System sales were converted to revenues by applying
GWSC's expected average tariff which is assumed to be valid for 5 years
(see Annex ll) and stating the results in 1974 prices. Beyond FY 1979,
tariffs are assumed to increase with inflation, i.e. to remain constant in
/1 The project will increase Weija capacity on a year-round basis to
13 mgd from FY 1975, 29 mgd from FY 1979 and L3 mgd from 1984.
Reservoir utilization beyond 43 mgd is not credited to the project,
although the design yield of the Weija dam is 7OImgd, as there is
now the possibility that it will be used for irrigation.



ANNEX 7

real terms.  Consumption in the rutial areas (which is expected to take
place mainly through public standpipes) and public standpipe consumption
in Accra/Tema were credited with a nominal revenue of 0100,000 and
0200,000 annually in money terms, these figures being based upon a rough
estimate of the number of households involved and the present house
charge for standpipe consumption.
"jiithout Project" Conditions
4.        (a) Production.  Weija output is assumed to be 3 mgd in the dry
season. Full output (8.5 mgd) is available in the wet season. As in the
"with project" situation, production schedules for Weija ard Kpong were
derived for the wet and dry seasons with Weija output being fully utilized
at all times. System capacity has already been reached in the dry season
(Accra experienced water shortages in FY 1973) and would also be reached
during the wet season in FY 1978. Production thereafter is assumed to be
constant at the capacity of the existing system.
(b) Revenue. System sales were obtained from production and
converted to revenues at 1974 prices as in "with project" conditlons.
Public standpipe consumntion was valued at 0200,000 p.a., as before, but
revenue from the rural areas was reduced to 50 o/o of the "with project"
figure.
Benefits and Costs Attributable to the Project
5.        The benefits end costs attributable to the project resulting
from the above studies are shown in Attachment I and give a rate of
return of about 6 o/o. Analyses were carried out to test the sensitivity
of this return to variations in capital costs, operating costs, and
revenues. The results, summarized in Attachment II, indicate a variation
in the rate of return of about 2 o/o above and below the base case. Since
there is a possibility that the official rate of exchange may overvalue the
Cedi by as much as 50 o/o, an additional test was carried out using a
shadow price for foreign exchange 50 o/o above the official rate. The rate
of return fell to 5 o/o.
6.        The above estimates of the rate of return are minimum values
primarily because any possible irrigation and health benefits of the project
have not been quantified. The nature of the health benefits is different
in Accra/Tems and in the rural areas. Virtually all the population of
Accra/Tema has access to piped water, either through standpipes or house
connections. The health benefits of the project are therefore not mainly in
terms of an improvement in existing health conditions but rather the avoid-
ance of a deterioration in health conditions which would occur in the absence
of the project. In the rural areas adjacent to Accra/Tema, the population
is inadequately supplied with piped water and the majority must rely upon
streams, ponds and shallow wells which are generally polluted /1. The project
is therefore expected to improve health conditions in the rural areas. While
existing information is not adequate to quantify either of these two types of
/1  Over 1,500 cases of cholera were reported in the rural areas affected
bv the nroiect during the last cholera epidemic of 1970-71.

health benefit (and in the case of Accra/Tema would additionally involve
considerable speculation on what would happen under "without project"
conditions) they are likely to be substantial. In addition to omitting
the above benefits, the rate of return calculation makes no allowances
for consumer surplus /J. This element is also unquantifiable in the
absence of any knowledge of the shape of the demand curve for water.
Finally, benefits will arise from the resettlement of villagers living
in the project area, the costs of which have been attributed to the
project.

for what they actually consume.

Notes on the Organization of GWSC
GWSC was originally organized on the basis of recommendations
made by Public Administration Service (PAS), a US firm of management
consultants provided under the UNDP project. A major reorganization of
the headquarters staff was instituted at the end of 1970 in order to reduce
overhead costs and to give a more commercial orientation to operations.
The present organization chart is shown on Page 1 of this Annex.
The engineering department undertakes design and implementation
of all development programs financed by the Government or from the internal
resources of the Corporation. It also provides supporting technical
services to the regions. A self-supporting field section consisting of a
transport unit, two workshops, a meter and instrument repair shop and a
drilling unit, is attached to the engineering department. The central
workshop serve maintenance requirements of the regions. Each workshop
functions as a self-contained field unit under the supervision of the
chief engineer.
The commercial department handles all financial, accounting and
budgetary matters of GWSC and stores management. The financial manager
resigned in November 1973 and recruitment for the position is under way.
At the present time, the finance and stores division function as independent
divisions. GWSC maintains four regional stores in addition to the central
store at Tema. All stores are under the supervision of a general stores
manager. Most of the procurement is done through the central stores which
in turn makes allocations to the regional stores.
Personnel and training aspects have been transfered in 1973 from
the commercial department to a new separate department. With the promotion
of the former principal training officer to chief of personnel, training
aspects are to receive heightened attention.
The position of general manager who acts as the chief executive
in the absence of the managing director is presently vacant. This function
includes supervision of the operations of all nine regions and coordination
of the activities of the regions with the engineering and commercial
departments. The regional Managers are directly responsible to the general
manager for operations in their respective regions.
A separate unit has been established to carry out internal audits
of the headquarters and the regional accounts. A planning and research
unit provides GWSC with economic and statistical support services, collects
data for long range planning and coordinates bilateral aid programs. The
managing director oversees both the internal audit and the planning and
research units.
The reorganization of 1970, while relieving the managing director
from day to day operational problems did not take into account the rapidly
increasing number of water systems under GWSC's control, which is now






ANNEX 8
Page 3
straining the effectiveness of supervision of the Managing Director,
General Manager, other senior headquarters staff and regional managers.
Therefore, GWSC,in an effort to delegate more authority to the lower
echelons of its organization,decided in 1973 to create district management
centers headed by district managers with the first line responsibility to
repair, operate and maintain all water systems and assist in the supervision
of all water development works. 17 urban and 24 rural such centers were
created.
All regional organizations are presently structured alike. In
ATMA which is directly responsible for the project, the area manager is the
chief executive officer. The area manager is supported by an engineering
department responsible for water production, distribution and system
maintenance; a finance department responsible for financial management,
accounting and budgeting; a general services department charged with
administration and personnel matters; and a commercial department respon-
sible for revenue collection and public relation activities. The area
organization has its own budget and retains its revenues. ATMA is presently
considering the combintng of its finance and revenue collection function
as the separation so far has lead to little coordination and weak internal
control. Furthermore, the structure of the engineering department is being
rethought in view of the commenced operation of the sewerage scheme.
For the purpose of billing and revenue collection, ATKA has divided
Accra into five districts, each one of which is further divided into four
cycles. One cycle represents an area that can be covered by a crew of 6-8
meter readers in one day. The Corporation rents an IBM 360/20 computer which
is primarily used for billing for the Accra/Tema area. The computer is also
used to prepare statistics on accounts receivable and ageing of accounts, for
revenue collection purposes. All bills are required to be paid within 28 days
of date of billing. The commercial department is presently responsible for
revenue collection. Although service can be disconnected for failure to pay
the bill within the specified period of time, this power is not widely invoked.
The regularity and quality of mter reading and billing is not satisfactory,
and arrears of accounts continue to be high. ATKA is aware of these problems
and is taking a number of measures such as the use of additional meterreader
inspectors, closer control of the cycle of processing and delivery of bills
and of collection performance.
ATMA has its own transport unit, which is used for stores transport-
ation, distribution system maintenance, new connections, meter installations
and revenue collection. A separate transport workshop is maintained to
service and repair the vehicles and for fabrication of small parts. ATMA has
its own meter shop for repairing and testing of water meters.

ACCRA/TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
1.        All the financial projections in the report cover the
operations of ATMA only.
2.        Figures for income statements and balance sheets for
FY 1971 and F! 1972 are based on audited statements  Audited
statements for FY 1973 are expected to be available by May 197T.
Projected Statewent of Income
Operating Fevenues
3.        Water sales for the current financial year of 1974 were
projected on the basis of this yearts revenue trend. Sales during
FT 1975-1979 are based on the projected quantities of water consumed
(see demand projections - Annex 6) and ATMAs proposed tariff increases
equivalent to a 50% increase of its average tariff to )M.96A, 000
gallons. After FT 1979, the average tariff rate is assumed to increase
further by 40% to allow sufficient cash flow for ATMA&s next expansion.
4.        The provision for bad debts has been calculated at a somewhat
more conservative rate than in the past at about 7% of annual billings.
5.        The forecast of other water supply income of a constant
0 100,000 p.a. includes, reconnection fees, and investment income of
ATMA's liquid assets.
6.        Sewerage-user charges are based on projected domestic and non-
domestic connections and a tentative charging proposal provided by GWSC's
sewerage consultants, as shown belows
(a) Fbrecast of Number of Connections
F! 1975-1976   215 p.a. (30% domestic)
1976-       200 p.a. (100% dcmestic)
(b) Charging Proposals
Domestic connections at D 24 p.a. Non
domestic connections at 80% of water
bill (estimated at f! 1,200 per connection).



ANNEX 14
Page 2
7.        Sewerage connection fees have been estimated by ATMA's former
sewerage engineer at ¢ 850/connection. Connection feea are assumed to
be payable in a lump sum by non-domestic users and over 3 years by do-
mestic users.
Operating Expenses
8.        Basic operating expenses are based on Fr 1973 actulas.  In-
flation allowances have been added to reflect the likely local infla-
tion of 10% p.a. and foreign inflation trends,the latter affecting
chemicals and fuel/lubricants, at 15% in F! 1974 and F! 1975 decreasing
to 10% in FY 1976 and 7.5% thereafter.
9.        The assumptions underlying the different operating cost ca-
tegories are as follows:
Personnel
10.       Present basic personnel coats are shown as increasing at 5%
p.a. on the basis of merit. An additional 12% of basic peraonnel costs
for rent and vacation has been added in each year.  With the codisaion-
ing of the new I'ija ncheoe in F! 1978, further maintenance staff estimat-
ed to cost ¢ 100,000 p.a. has been add d.
Electricity and ahemicals
11.       Historical unit costs have been calculated for ATMAts two source
worka as follows
weija          Kpog
A9 000 g
Electricity                           .0132          .0359

Total                            .0532          .o546
12.       Unit power costs have been increased 25% effective in FY 1974
to reflect the Electricity Corporation's of Ghana recent tariff increases.
Power tariffs were assumed to increase by a further 25% in F! 1978.
Fuel. Lubricants, and Maintenance
13.       The F! 1973 actuals were increased by 50% in F! 1974 to reflect
new recent contract prices for fuels and lubricants.  The presumed addi-
tional maintenance due to the project is, beginning in F! 1979, ¢ 100,000
p.a. which is estimated on the basis of the nature of the new equipment
installed.



ANNEX 14

Administration (Head Office, Office Suppiies)
14.       An increase of 3% p.a. has been assumed.
Other (Inaurance and Miscellaneous pcpenses)
15.       This item Was also assumed to increase by 3% p.a..
Projected Balance Sheets
Fixed Assets
16.       Fixed assets are valued at book cost.  Assets predating 1966
were valued by a Government committee in 1971 and subsequently agreed
by IDA. Depreciation is calculated at 3% on average gross fixed assets
which is considered representative.
Construction in Progreas
17.       Fbr projection purposes, it has been assumed that the dam, and
raw water pump will be brought into service by the end of F! 1977 while
the treatment works and transmission are projected to be in service by
FY 1978. All other Project, other water supply and sewerage works have
been assumed to be in service at the end of each year during which the
expenditure was made.
Current Assets
18,       Accounts receivable are calculated net of provision for bad
debt. During FY 1975-1979, it has been assumed that about 3-1/2 months
revenue will remain uncollected at the end of the year. Thereafter
about 3 months were assumed.
19.       Stores and other current arsets have been assumed to remain
constant at about the level of F! 1973 actuals.
20.       Fbr the Interbranch Accounts Customer Advances and accounts
payable constant amounts have been assumed reflecting ATMK's current
best estimates.
Cash Flow Projections
21.       The capital investment includes
(a) The remaining expenditures on the works
financed under Credit 160-(H;
(b) The proposed Project;
(c) Nominal allowances for sewerage extensions
into areas adjacent to the exiating sewerage
area, and for subsequent extensions into
areas presently undefined;

23.        The eoisting subordinated debt of ¢ 20.0 million to the
Ghana Government atems from a covenant of Credit 160-GH.  The ration-
ale of this covenant was to build up the financial responsibility of
GWSC through at least the partial repayment of assets for which the
Government is servicing previously incurred suppliers' credits. The
principal amount ias determined on ATMA'. projected isproved debt
servicing capability, In view of the substantial requirements of funds
for the Project, the Government is now considering to defer ATMA'. debt
servicing obligation until the end of the construction period.
Government Advances and Contributions
21.        The advance of $ 1.1 million reflects an actual Goveznment
oomdtment to provide ATMA with interim financing towards the foreign
exchange coot of the Weija dam. The Government would be reimbursed by
IDA, once the proposed Credit is effective.
25.     _- In view of ATMA s own tight financial position and the pending
expiration of the rural water supply projects tender validity periods,
the Government has indicated that it will take full financial responsi-
bility to allow the contracts to be emecuted.
26.        The aoverruent contribution for the Wbija Dam's irrigation
component is based on the Ministry of Agriculture's desire to proceed
with the irrigation scheme and its willingness to contribute 20% towards
the capital soat of the dam. The 20% formula had originally been agreed
in 1967 when GWSC agreed to irrigation development in the area.

ACC R TEMA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT - SECOND STAGE
Water Supply Tariffs
EXISTING TARIFFS AND GWSC'S PROPOSALS
1.        The existing water supply tariff is uniform for all urban and
rural areas in Ghana.  Full details on existing tariffs is given in the
Attachment. In early 1973, GWSC submitted to the Government a new set
of tariff proposals for implementation over the period FY 1974-1978.
The important features of the new proposals included:
(i) departure from the present principle of a uniform national
tariff by distinguishing between three types of community,
according to financial viability, as follows:
(a) the six communities deemed to have the greatest
financial potential;
(b) twenty intermediate urban centers; and
(e) rural communities;
(ii) predetermined tariff increases during the five year
implementation period;
(iii) largest tariff increases in the six financially viable
communities and either no tariff increases or even
decreases in the other communities.
2.        After a critical review, the IDA recppraisal mission of April 1973
expressed general sympathy with GWSC's new tariff proposals on grounds of
inter-regional income redistribution and made certain specific suggestions
for the Accra/Tema area. The Government, however, despite its support for
the principles of GWSC's proposals, decided in mid-1973 to shelve the
proposal until full metering had been achieved in the six main communities.
This in effect meant a delay of at least 1-1/2 years for Accra/Tema and
more for the other communities. Towards the early part of 1974 however it
became evident that Accra/Tema's financial position was deteriorating and
that it could not carry out the proposed    pro.ject without additional
revenues. Therefore, although Accra/Tema's system is not yet fully metered,
the Government has agreed to increase metered domestic and couercial/indus-
trial tariffs by 50% effective in mid 1974.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
In addition, GWSC is ezpected to abolish meter rental charge and
to introduce the levey of refundable deposits for new water con-
mrs.  Upon the suggestion of IDA GWC has been considering a
two-block tariff for metered domestic consumers including a pre-
ferential charge for consumption within a restricted first block,
But decided not to implewnt it at this tim  because:
(i) inefficiencies in AT!MAIs billing
system; and
(ii) difficulties in allocating water
consumption in the many multi-
family dwellings in Accra.
On the basis of available evidence, there is a strong presuption
commercial/industrial consumers will continue to subsidise domestic
consumrs in the sense that the average incremental cost of supply.,
estimated at % 0.804,000 gallons, appears to be higher than the
anticipated mtered domestic tariff of $ 0.60/,000 gallons. 1bile
it is questionable whether donestic comnumers am a class should be
subsidised by non domestic consumers, there is a case for subsidizing
lower-income domestic consumers, and the practice of providing water
from public standpipes free of charge to the consumer goes some way
towards meting basic needs.

ACCRA/TEM WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (SECOND STACE)
Assessment of Potential Irrigation Component
Background
1.             Some ten years ago, a group of consulting engineers
identified the possibility of developing irrigation by using water
from the proposed Weija reservoir. In 1967, after modifying the
scheme, the Government requested GWSC to include it as an element
in the Weija scheme. To do so required raising the dam height
proposed by GWSC at the time by 6 feet to gain 8,000 mg V more capacity
for irrigation, and installing an outlet conduit for the irrigation water
release. MWA agreed to bear the additional expense which GWSC claimed
would amount to 20% of the dam cost.
Project Area
2.             Rainfall in the area is erratic and totals about 29
inches p.a., some 65% of which falls during the main cropping season
(April-August). It is not enough to grow two crops, e.g. two crops
of rice grown here would require up to 68 inches of water,
3.             At present, most lands are not cultivated and only a
small number of farmers grow some vegetables and maize, uaing tra-
ditional rainfed methods. Crop yields are very poor due to unimpro-
ved soils and inadequate water supply.
4.             Landis tribally owned, its alloeation and use being
based on tribal custom. Should the Governmen", introduce irrigation,
the allocation of the comand area would becomie the Government's func-
tion, with priority of settlement accorded to farmers on or adjacent
to the area.
The Project
5.             Gsneral Features.  The project is still at an early stage
of study.  Two separate areas are proposed to be served: about 4,800
acres in Block I and 800 acres in Block II (Map attached). Block I
would be served by means of pumping the Weija reservoir water (about
100 ft lift) into the distribution system. Block II, on the other hand,
would receive its gravity flow through the proposed outlet in the Weija
dam itself. The project would include a drainage system and on-farm
development to assist farmers in arriving at the anticipated yields and
benefits.
I/ Imperial million gallon (1 mg - ,500 m3 - 3.65 ac-ft).



ANNEX 16
Page 2
6.        Cropping Pattern.  The project is designed to irrigate, on a
year-round basis, rice, maize and vegetables, which are in great demand
in the area. The projected cropping intensity is expected to reach 150 o/o
ultimately as follows:
Wet Season (April - August)                       (o/o)
Paddy                                              60
Maize                                              20
Vegetables                                         10
Dry Season (October - February)
Paddy                                             30
Vegetables                                        30
150
7.        Water Requirements.  On the basis of a conservative 50 o/o overall
irrigation efficiency, project water requirements would be about 8,000 mg
yearly (16,000 m.3/ha), with the following monthly distribution:
Jan.  Feb.  Mar.  April  May    June   July  Aug.  Sept.  Oct.  Nov.  Dec.  Annual
--___---_--_-___---__-____-- Img -__-------               -__---------------------
960   270    -    600    900    900   1,470  600    -       360   870  1,050  7,980
8.        Pumping Plant and Electrical Charges.  The scheme would require
five 350 HP pumps with 20 cfs capacity each to lift the reservoir water to
meet the peak demands of Block I (77 cfs). The cost of power would be about
060,000 yearly (US$52,000).
9.        Cost Estimates.  Based on the existing pilot farm data and local
prices, both updated to 1973 levels, project costs are estimated to be about
#9.0 million (US$7.8 million or US$3,400/ha), excluding the allocation for
the dam, which is treated as a "sunk cost". Yearly operation and maintenance
costs are estimated at 0555,000 or 0100/acre (US$215/ha), including the
agricultural support services required during the first 10 years to ensure full
agricultural development, as projected. These figures were derived as follows:

12.       Aaricultural Benefits.  These benefits are based upon the following:
Ci) The pilot farm yields and production costs adjusted to
reflect actual field conditions at present.
(ii) The Government controlled price of the import rice
(from Mainland China) for economic benefit assessment.
(iii) The average farm gate price of local rice and other
crops for the farmer benefits assessment.
(iv) The projected cropping pattern (150 o/o cropping
intensity).
13.       Farmer's Benefits.  At full development and taking an average of
5 acre per farm family the project would accommodate at least 1,100 farm
families. Their net revenue from each 5-acre holding would be at the level
of 02,750 (p 550/acre), with a net income (after allowing for annual 0 & M
coats) of about 02,250 per 5-acre holding.

ih.       Economic Rate of Return.  On the assumptions set forth in this
study the scheme's economic rate of return has been calculated at the level
of 30 o/o for the 50 years of economic life. Apart from excluding any
allocated dam costs, the calculation also excludes the investments needed
for a rice mill and the benefits from such investments, as the rice mill
would be a separate entity. The project appears viable even if the cost is
increased to include 03.0 million allocated for the dam, since with this
increased cost, the return would be 23 o/o.
15.       Organization and Management. The Nlnistry of Agricultur, In roapoomi-
blo for national agrioulturaldevelopment, At present, it could not build and run
the project in a way which would achieve the anticipated potential benefits.
Improvement in its organization would therefore be necessary and key staff
would have to be drawn from expatriates. Provision for such a support
service has been included in the estimated annual costs.
16.       Pro.ect Operation, Study and Assurances Required. Initially,
irrigation water available from the proposed Weija storage would be 8,000 Img
out of the reservoirts total capacity of 25,000  mg.  However, it is not yet
known how far the supply of water will be limited by sedimentation and this
question is being studied by the project consultants. If reservoir sediment-
ation is significant, the reservoir capacity is expected to be reduced
progressively after completion of the Weija dam and the storage available for
irrigation would be reduced accordingly. The operation criteria proposed by
GWSC could impose a further constraint to irrigation, since once the storage
capacity falls below a level reserved for urban water supply in case of drought,
GWSC would allow no more irrigation releases.
