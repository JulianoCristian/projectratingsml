stability in the country, and\n            in the greater Great Lakes region. The program will focus on\n            demobilization of ex-combatants, and help support their\n            return into civilian life, and, facilitate the reallocation\n            of Government expenditure from military, to social and\n            economic sectors. It is expected the project will have a\n            significant impact on poverty reduction, by establishing\n            more secure conditions in rural areas, thus encouraging the\n            resumption of productive lives in the rural economy, and,\n            will further free additional national resources for\n            investment in social, and economic sectors. Additionally,\n            investments in human capital development of ex-combatants,\n            will further enhance the implementation capacity of\n            community-based development organizations. The main\n            components include demobilization through specific modules,\n            based on an identification card system, a program benefit\n            card, and socioeconomic profiling, to provide transitional\n            assistance in cash, or in-kind; reintegration, through the\n            provision of counseling, and information for potential job\n            opportunities, and assistance in securing employment, as\n            well as educational, or skills improvements within\n            vulnerable groups; and, institutional, and program\n            development, supervised through a program coordinator at\n            high Government levels, but whose implementation shall be\n            the responsibility of a single civilian agency."}, "docdt": "2003-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
