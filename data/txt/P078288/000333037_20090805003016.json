Reintegration Project for Angola were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:  the creation\n            of a favorable environment was conducive to the political\n            and national reconciliation success. Contributing to this\n            success was: the adoption of an amnesty law, the\n            program's strong emphasis on community participation\n            (civil society, churches), the involvement of various\n            sectors and institutions in the demobilization process, the\n            continued dialogue with the former belligerent groups, large\n            sensitization campaigns, the promotion of citizenship\n            principles, and the promotion of a permanent involvement of\n            National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  (UNITA)\n            into the full Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration\n            (DDR) process. The experience of the project highlighted the\n            importance of locally defining each reintegration support\n            intervention, starting from the local context, the demand of\n            services and the profile of the target group, stimulating\n            the permanence of ex-militaries in rural areas, and\n            reinforcing the skills at various endogenous and exogenous\n            knowledge levels. A strong and permanent involvement of the\n            local authorities also proved valuable for the project.\n            Local authorities were key players into the reintegration\n            process and were widely involved in the Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) of ex-militaries' reintegration\n            support. The involvement of local authorities represented an\n            efficient and permanent follow-up of reintegration support\n            and facilitated the reconciliation and the promotion of\n            peace at the community level."}, "docdt": "2009-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
