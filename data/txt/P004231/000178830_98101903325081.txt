MALAYSIA
APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMKARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the modernization of the
Malayan Railway (MR), with the objectives of enabling the railway to main-
tain its economic role in the transport sector and to reestablish its
financial viability. The proposed loan of US$16 million equivalent would
be the first loan to Malaysia for railway purposes. The project conforms
with the recommendations of the general transport survey of Malaysia com-
pleted in mid-1969.
ii.       MR is government-owned.  The shape of the system, running north
and south between the Thai border and Singapore, was established when
Singapore was the main port of the peninsula. Since the separation
of Singapore from Malaysia there has been a change of emphasis from
Singapore to Port Swettenham as the main port of entry and exit for
the trade and commerce of Western Malaysia. The greatest concentration
of population and economic activity in the country is west of the central
mountain range and particularly around Kuala Lumpur, which is situated
only 27 miles from Port Swettenham. Traffic patterns have consequently
changed in a radical manner, and generally to the disadvantage of the
railway. This factor and the rapid growth of road transport have necessi-
tated rapid changes in railway operating practices and pricing policy.
While much has been done to provide adequate service at lower cost, the
adoption of marginal cost pricing where it has been found necessary and
economically justifiable in order to combat the threat of diversion of
traffic to the roads has for the past seven years involved the railway
in substantial financial deficits.
iii.      The project forms part of MR's Second Five-Year Plan 1971-1975 in
which completion of dieselization plays a major role. Finance for this
purpose has already been secured under bilateral aid and a supplier's credit
from the UK. The equipment and works to be financed by the proposed Bank
loan are complementary to the dieselization program and essential for its
success. They include freight cars to replace over-age, unbraked stock,
strengthening of draw bars, new engines for diesel rail cars, workshops
equipment, and relaying and realignment of track. Interest during con-
struction would be included in the amount of the loan. The project in-
cludes all works to be undertaken in the years 1972-1973 at a total esti-
mated cost of US$23.0 million equivalent, including contingencies. The
proposed Bank loan of US$16 million equivalent would cover the CIF cost of
the foreign exchange component of all works excluding diesel locomotives,
plus US$1.5 million interest and commitment charges during construction.
All goods would be procured through international competitive bidding, with
the exception of engines for existing railcars (2% of the proposed loan)
which would be purchased from the original suppliers.



- ii -
iv.       The focus of the appraisal has been to establish the railway's
role in the transport field and to find means for further cost reduction.
To this end an in-depth cost study has been made, as a result of which the
economic justification of the railway as the least cost mode of transport
over medium and long distances for the great bulk of the country's agricul-
tural, forestry and mining production has been established. The continu-
ation of railway service is vital to the economy, and the financial problems
of the railway can be solved only by enabling it to reduce costs still
further by providing it with the advantages of modern technology and
particularly the means for cost reduction made possible by diesel traction.
v.        In order to ensure that the maximum benefits may be secured from
the dieselization and modernization program, certain supplementary action
will need to be taken by MR, particularly in the fields of planning and
traffic costing. A staff plan will also be prepared indicating the extent
to which it will be necessary to redeploy and retrain staff and to reduce
by attrition the overall labor force commensurate with the economies offered
by the modernization program. During negotiations a Program of Action was
agreed establishing specific targets for operational efficiency during the
Plan period.
vi.       On a conservative basis the weighted average rate of economic
return on the total investment in dieselization and modernization is es-
timated at 20%. The financial benefits will also be substantial. A real-
istic estimate of the cost reductions which the modernization program will
induce indicates that within three years the railway should be able to re-
establish its viability. While the financial rate of return on the incre-
mental investment will be substantial, the overall rate of return, based
on the present day depreciated value of all railway fixed assets, will
probably be not more than 2%. Since this rate reflects the best attainable
balance between the need, on the one hand, to maintain financial viability,
and, on the other, to provide the greatest possible benefit to the economy,
it is considered to be an appropriate minimum measure of future financial
performance.
vii.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan to MR of US$16 million
equivalent for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of five years.



MALAYS IA
APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A survey to establish a proper framework for future development of
the transport sector of Malaysia was completed in mid-1969; it was financed
by UNDP with the Bank as executing agent. A report entitled "Transport
Development in Malaysia" was prepared by the consultants, Robert R. Nathan
Associates Inc. Arising out of recommendations of this report, and action
by Government, the management structure of the Malayan Railway (MR) was re-
organized and a tentative investment program was drawn up. After Bank
identification and preappraisal missions had visited Malaysia in 1970, MR's
Five-Year Investment Plan 1971-1975, which forms part of the Second Malaysia
Plan, was agreed. Total investment during the five-year period is estimated
at M$ 128.7 million.
1.02      The project comprises all railway works to be undertaken in the
calendar years 1972/1973 totalling M$ 68 million (US$23 million). Toward
this, the proposed Bank loan, the first to Malaysia for railway purposes,
will contribute US$16 million equivalent, including interest during construc-
tion of US$1.5 million. As a corollary to the loan, a Program of Action has
been agreed with Government and MR (para. 4.11).
1.03      This report is based on (a) MR's Five-Year Plan 1971-1975, as up-
dated and agreed with the Bank; (b) findings of the appraisal mission to
Malaysia in June 1971, consisting of J. C. Blumstein and F. Tachibana (rail-
way engineers), D. Havlicek and V. Nwaneri (economists), and F. Sander (fi-
nancial analyst); (c) the report "Transport Development in Malaysia" by
Robert R. Nathan Associates, Inc., and (d) data provided by three other con-
sultants' reports to which reference is made in Annexes 14 and 15.
2. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      Malaysia comprises two separate geographical areas, West Malaysia
on the Asian mainland with about 185 persons per square mile and East Malay-
sia (Sabah and Sarawak) with only 19 persons per square mile. West Malaysia
is further separated by a central mountain range into the east and west
coasts, the latter bordering one of the world's most important ocean ship-
ping lanes.



- 2 -
2.02      These geographic characteristics of West Malaysia have determined
the pattern of economic development to be primarily trade oriented. They
have also set a pattern that the greatest concentration of population (82%
in 1970) and economic activity is west of the mountain range, leaving the
east coast states, particularly Kelantan and Trengganu, poorer and less
developed. In 1970, only 8% of the country's full time employees lived in
the east coast states, GDP per head was 22% lower than the national average,
gross value of sales for the manufacturing sector in the east coast states
was only 3.5% and road vehicles 8.4% of the national total. In terms of
agricultural development, estimates in 1966-1967 put only 17% of the coun-
try's total acreage under various agricultural crops in the east, although
over 63% of the total land suitable for development is in the eastern states.
2.03      Another important characteristic of the economy which has bearing
on transport demand is the dominant influence of the export sector. In
recent years exports accounted for 40-45% of GNP with rubber, timber, tin and
palm oil as the leading export products. Agriculture and manufacturing have
been the principal contributors to growth.  The emphasis on these sectors
in the Second Malaysia Plan means that they will continue to contribute to
the country's growth. Real GNP is projected to increase at an annual rate
of 6.8% and per capita income to rise from M$ 1,080 (US$350) in 1970 to
M$ 1,300 (US$425) by 1975.
2.04      The Government's policy of encouraging the displacement of Singa-
pore by Ports Swettenham and Penang as major outlets of the country's trade
will no doubt influence the pattern of transport demand in the forthcoming
years. The Government intends to set up inland container facilities near
these ports to encourage their expansion.
B.   The Transport Sector
(i) Development Strategy
2.05      Nearly 25% of public investment in West Malaysia was devoted to
the transport sector during the First and Second Malaya 1/ Plans (1956-1960
and 1961-1965); i.e., M$ 0.8 billion out of a total of M$ 3.2 billion. Of
this, about two-thirds was for roads and bridges. As a result, West Malay-
sia has today a well developed transport infrastructure with a well main-
tained railway and relatively high standard roads serving adequately the
needs of a vehicle fleet which, in relation to the population, is second
only to Japan among Asian countries. Major developments in the transport
sector since the end of World War II were (a) the reconstruction of the
east coast rail line, and (b) the upgrading of the east coast road and com-
pletion of Federal Route II connecting the east and west coasts.
1/   First and Second "Malaya" Plans were implemented before the creation
of Malaysia, i.e., the unification of Sarawak, Sabah, MIalaya and
Singapore. Singapore separated from the union in 1965.



-3-
2.06      For the First Malaysia Plan (1966-1970), however, Government scaled
down transport development expenditures in West Malaysia to 11% (M$ 0.4 bil-
lion) of total public development expenditure (M$ 3.6 billion) because it
felt that there was need for a new transport investment strategy based on a
comprehensive inventory of the sector's prospective role in the future eco-
nomic development. A general transport survey conducted by Robert Nathan
Associates in 1967-1969 (para. 1.01), recommended that the emphasis of trans-
port policy should be shifted to modernization and rationalization of exist-
ing facilities, improvement of transport coordination (paras. 2.11-2.14),
and development of administrative and management expertise, thus increasing
efficiency in the sector rather than extending the network substantially.
Government adopted this recommendation in its Second Malaysia Plan (1971-1975),
of which the railway investment plan is a part. Allocation of funds for
transport in West Malaysia represents only 13% (M$ 0.8 billion) of total
public development expenditure (M$ 5.9 billion). Bank lending in the sector
so far has been only US$16.1 million for Sabah Ports in 1971 (Loan No. 774-MA).
Two highway projects, one in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area and the other
for the improvement of the main north-south highway along the West coast of
Mtalaysia, are now under preparation.
(ii) The Transport System
(a) West Malaysia
2.07      The Malayan Railway system (1,035 miles) consists of two, mostly
single track, meter gauge lines, and is roughly Y-shaped with the base of
the Y on Singapore in the south of the peninsula. The western main line
(488 miles) extends from Singapore via Gemas, Kuala Lumpur, and Ipoh to
Padang Besar, joining there with the State Railways of Thailand. Short
branch lines provide connections with Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Telok
Anson and Port Weld. The east coast line (328 miles) extends from Gemas
(131 miles from Singapore) in a northeast direction through the states of
Pahang and Kelantan and terminates in Tumpat near Kota Bahru. Railway
freight traffic (discussed more fully in paragraphs 3.11 and 3.12) consists
mainly of medium- and long-haul bulk traffic. Passenger traffic has declined
substantially (para. 3.13). MR also operates railroad services in the Repub-
lic of Singapore.
2.08      Most of the highway construction took place after the development
of the railway. The present non-urban road system, estimated at some 11,000
miles, of which about 86% is paved (Annex 1), is mainly concentrated on the
west coast. The vehicle fleet, excluding motorcycles, expanded from 136,000
in 1960 to 319,000 in 1970 and is expected to grow at an annual average rate
of 5%. Trucks increased by about 103% from 37,000 to 75,000. The road trans-
port industry, largely formed by owner operators, provides fast, reliable,
and flexible service. Competition within the industry and with other modes,
especially the railway, is fierce. Favored by higher speed and door-to-door
service, road transport has been able to capture part of the railway's short-
and medium-distance freight and passenger traffic (para. 5.01). However,



- 4 -
the railway still plays an important role in the Malaysian transport system,
and it is expected to do so in the future with improved quality of service
and a competitive pricing policy.
2.09      Coastal shipping plays a significant complementary part in the
transport of bulk goods, mainly on the east coast. Only the transport of
refinery products to consumer centers on the West Coast competes with the
railway.
(b) East Malaysia
2.10      The Sabah State Railways provides the most convenient access to
production centers in the East through its single railway line connecting
Kota Kinabalu with Malalap, a distance of about 90 miles. Road mileage in
1968 was 2,200 miles, of which 18% was paved. Coastal and inland transport
facilities are concentrated around the six ports in the East. Since MR
serves only West Malaysia and Singapore, this appraisal excludes East Malaysia.
C.   Transport Policy
2.11      Until recently, transport planning, policy making and administra-
tion were dispersed among the Ministry of Transport (MOT), the Ministry of
Public Works (MOP), the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) and the Road Licensing
Board. Following the recommendations of the General Transport Survey,
special planning units were established in the MOT and MOP in order to
arrive at a coordinated system of transport planning and policy making.
However, the activities of these units, as well as those of the EPU, are
hampered by severe shortage of qualified staff.
2.12      Regulation of road transport in the past has been by means of a
complicated system of operating permits issued by a Road Licensing Board
under the Road Traffic Ordinance, resulting in restrictive route and zonal
licensing of carriers. In addition preference has been given to applicants
of Malay origin (Bumiputra policy). The system, as operated, has led to a
disproportionate growth of vehicles permitted to operate for owner's goods
only (the so-called C-licenses) as compared with those permitted to carry
goods for hire and reward (the A and B licenses). As the former permit is
easier to obtain, the C-license vehicles are being illegally used in increas-
ing numbers for hire and reward goods, resulting in an inflation of the
trucking fleet.
2.13      Government set up in November 1970, at the highest Cabinet level,
"The Cabinet Committee on Communications" under the Chairmanship of the
Deputy Prime Minister to examine, coordinate and control the implementation
of transport and communications policies. The program of action includes
(a) review of the road licensing policy, (b) restructuring of road user
charges, and (c) measures to encourage more participation of Malays in the
road transport industry. By the end of the year Government expects to start
implementing proposals for amending the Road Traffic Ordinance aimed at re-



-5-
constituting the Road Licensing Board, under the chairmanship of the Minis-
ter of Transport, from a purely judiciary decision-making body to an economic
and market oriented one. Other proposed measures are simplification and
reform of the route and zonal licensing system and establishment of a na-
tional haulage corporation and a national container road haulage company.
Also, with the assistance of two UNDP advisers, data collection systems
and transport policy work programs are being initiated.
2.14      It would be premature to predict the outcome of these proposed
changes, but a strongly negative impact on MR's competitive position is not
expected. Forthcoming highway appraisals will provide an opportunity for
a detailed review of these matters with the Government.
3. THE RAILWAY
A.   Organization
3.01      MR is owned by the Government and regulated by the Railway Ordi-
nance of 1948. The General Manager (GM4) exercises the powers of administra-
tion, in the capacity of a "corporation sole," responsible to the Ministry
of Transport, and assisted by a ten-man Railway Board acting in an advisory
capacity (Annex 2). Government's approval is required for such items as
investment plans, borrowing of funds, annual budgets and accounts, and maximum
tariff levels. A chart showing MR's present organization is appended as
Annex 3.
3.02      By provisions of the 1958 constitution and amendments to the Rail-
way Ordinance, a Railway Services Commission (RSC) has been established with
authority and responsibility to appoint, promote and dismiss all railway
personnel, with the objective of ensuring racial balance within MR staff.
However, the RSC has now delegated to the GM some of its disciplinary author-
ity and its power to recruit staff of the lower level.  While the RSC retains
the ultimate disciplinary authority over the majority of MR's employees, the
GM has the responsibility for their performance.
B.   Management and Administration
3.03      The General Transport Survey pointed out some weaknesses in the
management and administration of the railway. Most of these have now been
largely overcome by the following actions:
(a) The GM has been relieved of minor decisions by inclusion
in the line of command of three Deputy General Managers
responsible for Operations and Engineering; Finance, Com-



merce and Planning; and Personnel and Industrial Relations.
Day-to-day activities not pertaining to the whole organiza-
tion have been shifted to regional administrative ulits.
(b)  The Deputy General Manager, Finance, Commerce, and Planning
will be assisted by a planning unit responsible for estab-
lishing a corporate plan setting forth MR's goals in the
areas of market analysis, financial planning, operations,
and investment planning and economic evaluations.
3.04     W4hile MR has gone a long way to streamline its management, the
development and planning unit must be strengthened. In order to train
staff, the Government has applied to Canada for technical assistance in
the areas of costing, marketing, planning and modernization of the account-
ing system. In addition, Government will apply for UNDP technical assis-
tance to send three of tR's staff abroad for a year to be trained in trans-
port planning and economics. It is expected that as a result of these two
actions, MR will be able to operate an independently functioning planning
unit within two years; assurance that by the end of 1972 the unit will be
adequately staffed and fully functional was obtained during negotiations.
C.   Accounts and Audit
3.05      Although the accounting staff of MR are competent and well able
to provide management and senior officials of the railway with all the
financial information they require, la's final accounts are still presented
in accordance with an outmoded version of the "Double Account System" which
is unduly complicated and fails to show the true financial position. As-
surances were obtained during negotiations that modernization of the accounts
and establishment of traffic cost accounting will be implemented by the end
of 1973.
3.06      The railway's auditor is the Auditor General, Malaysia, whose
staff perform their work in a detailed and comprehensive manner and in
accordance with standards which are acceptable to the Bank. The printed
Annual Report and Accounts are, at present, very much in arrears. During
negotiations assurance was obtained that MR will submit the audited accounts
for 1971 and later years to the Bank within six months of the end of each
financial year.
D.   Staff
3.07      MR's staff in 1970 numbered 10,850 compared with 12,569 in 1962,
a reduction of 147%. Total staff costs per man employed rose during the
same period by 65% from M$ 2,870 to M$ 4,730. However, this increase was
almost completely offset by a corresponding increase in labor productivity
of 62%.  The present labor force is not excessive, but modernization of



motive power and rolling stock, operation of longer trains and the track
renewal program will enable MR to reduce it to about 10,200 in 1975 and in-
crease labor productivity by 4.6% annually (25.6% over the period 1970-1975).
The main reductions in staff would take place in workshops, pumping stations
and locomotive crews. As an essential ingredient of the Program of Action,
MR will submit to the Bank a time-phased program of staff reduction and
redeployment (para. 4.11).
3.08      Although TIR's pay scales, following a general Government readjust-
ment (Suffian Award), compare favorably with salary levels in private in-
dustry, it is difficult to attract highly qualified manpower for the upper
management level because: (a) there is a general shortage of highly quali-
fied manpower in the public sector and (b) prospects for advancement are
generally better in industry. It is expected, however, that this shortage
will ease once the measures taken by Government to increase the output of
university graduates can become effective. As to medium and lower level
staff, measures will be taken to provide adequate and qualified manpower
through railway training facilities (para. 5.14).
E.   Railway Property
3.09      A brief description of railway track, structures, equipment and
other property is presented in Annex 4. In general, the property is well
maintained and, when modernized, will be adequate to handle all traffic
offering.
F.   Operations
3.10      Annex 5 gives a summary of operating statistics from 1966 to 1970;
it shows that hR is reasonably well operated. As a whole, operating stand-
ards have steadily improved. Net ton-miles have increased by 23% while
freight train miles increased by only 9%. Utilization of motive power is
satisfactory although the predominance of under-powered steam locomotives
tends to keep down the average net freight train-load. With the advent of
new and powerful diesels, the average train-load is expected to increase by
25% or more, thereby inducing considerable operating economies. Productivity
of freight cars has increased by 18% from 1966 to 1970 and, at 217,000 ton-
miles p.a. per serviceable bogie car, compares well with other railways (East
Africa: 288,000; Argentina meter gauge: 100,000; Cameroon: 160,000; Re-
public of China: 250,000). Occupancy of passenger trains is reasonable but
punctuality must be improved. Staff productivity is adequate at 103,000
traffic units 1/ per employee (79,300 in East Africa; 99,100 in India; 75,000
in Argentina (meter gauge); and 80,100 in Cameroon), and has increased by 30%
over 1966. It is expected to improve still further with the full implementa-
tion of modernization and the manpower redeployment plan.

G.   Traffic
(i) Freight Traffic
3.11      Freight traffic statistics for the years 1960-1970 and forecasts
for the years 1970-1975 are given in Annexes 6 and 7. Revenue earning
traffic (excluding iron ore) 1/ increased from 2.1 million tons (313 million
ton-miles) in 1960 to 3.3 million tons (659 million ton-miles) in 1970 - an
average annual growth rate of 4.6% and 7.7% respectively. This compares
favorably with the growth rate of the GDP at factor cost of 5.5% for the
same period. Average length of haul increased from 149 miles in 1960 to
200 miles in 1970, reflecting a change from short-haul to long-haul traffic
caused by increased road competition. The composition of traffic changed
also, shifting from short-haul bulk and non-bulk traffic to long-haul bulk
traffic.
3.12      Over the period 1971-1975, tonnage is expected to increase by
6.2% annually to 4.4 million tons in 1975 and in terms of ton-miles by
6.4% annually to 898 million ton-miles in 1975. The projected traffic in-
creases are realistic and may well prove conservative considering MR's
modernization plans and Malaysiats extensive agricultural and industrial
development projects (para. 2.03).
(ii) Passenger Traffic
3.13      Passenger traffic statistics for the years 1960 to 1970 and fore-
casts for the years 1971 to 1975 are given in Annexes 8 and 9.  During the
period 1960 to 1970, passenger traffic decreased steadily except for 1970
which showed an increase in passengers of 1.6%, and 16% in passenger miles,
reflecting an increase in the average length of journey from 51 to 68 miles.
Increased highway capacity and the greater use of buses, taxis and private
automobiles have, in the past, contributed to the decline in passenger traf-
fic. It is reasonable to assume that improvements in the quality of service,
the expected increase in per capita income of the lower income groups of the
population and the growth of population will contribute to a slight increase
in passenger traffic of about 1.2% annually (1.6% in terms of passenger
miles).
1/ Iron ore traffic has fluctuated considerably depending on export demand.
Since the deposits will be exhausted in the near future, iron ore traf-
fic has been excluded from the long-term analysis.

4. THE INVESTNENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   The Plan
4.01      MR has prepared a Five-Year Investment Plan 1971-1975 which is
estimated to cost about M$ 129 million 1/ (about US$43 million equivalent)
with an estimated foreign exchange component of about US933 million (Annexes
10 and 11); a summary is given below.

B.   The Project and the Loan
4.02      The project consists of the period 1972/1973 of MR's Five-Year
Investment Plan. The total cost of the project is estimated at about
M$ 68 million (US$23 million equivalent). A breakdown of the project and
of the expenditure suitable for finance under the proposed loan is given
below. For further details, see Annex 11.
1/   Railway investment authorized by Government in the Second Malaysia
Plan amounts to M$ 85.7 million. This figure excludes investment items
financed through suppliers' credits negotiated directly by MR, and MR's
own contribution to investment from the Renewals Fund. The Bank's con-
cept of the Plan includes investment financed from all sources and
amounts to M$ 128.7 million.

Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government and MR shall
not make major additions to or deletions from the project without the agree-
ment of the Bank.
4.03      The proposed loan of USS16 million will meet 65% of the cost of the
project. It will finance the foreign exchange component of all the items of
the project, except the diesel locomotives (US$3.1 million), for which fi-
nance has already been made available, and the training school (included above
under "Miscellaneous") on which progress is already well advanced under finance
provided by the Federal Government. The loan would also finance US$1.5 mil-
lion of interest during construction, which, it is recommended, should be
capitalized to help the railway through a period of financial difficulty before
the benefits from the investment can be realized.
4.04      The provision for locomotives is for the balance of about 10 of
the 40 units ordered in 1970 under a loan and credit from the UK. The
majority of the locomotives will be delivered in 1971. It is intended to
purchase 710 freight cars to replace old, small capacity cars not suited
to present-day operations in heavy fast trains; the new vehicles will con-
sist of 250 log wagons, 200 gondolas, 60 tank cars and 200 boxcars.
4.05      Realignment of the Port Dickson line is to increase the capacity
of the 25-mile-long branch line to cope with rapidly growing petroleum
traffic. A consulting engineers' report has shown this to be the best
solution (see Economic Evaluation). Track renewal covers complete replace-
ment of rail and timber sleepers, with the welding of rail joints, on 70
miles of the main line.



- 11 -
4.06      Lesser amounts are provided for (a) coupler strengthening and im-
provement of railcars and rolling stock to improve efficiency of operations
and (b) modernization of works.
4.07      The estimates in the project are based on 1971 prices, and a con-
tingency allowance of about 10% has been added to all costs, excluding the
diesel locomotives the contract price for which is already fixed. Local
costs are expected to rise about 3% per annum over the period 1972-1973,
while prices for imported material and equipment, due to presently increas-
ing labor and other costs in the industrialized countries, may rise by
about 6% per annum.
C.   Financing of the Prolect
4.08      The following table summarizes the financing plan of the project.
It includes, in addition to the cost of the works, interest during construc-
tion and commitment charges on the proposed Bank loan (US$1.50 million or
M$ 4.5 million).

D. Execution of the Project, Procurement and Disbursement
4.09       IR is competent to carry out the project.  The major part of goods
(98%) to be financed from the proposed loan will be acquired through inter-
national competitive bidding (procurement of spare engines will be restricted
to original suppliers - US$220,000 equivalent). Disbursements will be made
on the full C.I.F. cost of all procurement.
4.10      The estimated quarterly and annual rates of disbursement of the
proposed loan are given in Annex 12. The disbursements will extend through
1974 and possibly into early 1975.

E.   Action Supplementary to the Project
4.11      In order that the full potential benefits should be secured from
the investment program, and to enable the railway to fulfill its appropriate
economic role in an increasingly competitive environment, a supplementary
plan has been formulated defining fLt' s relationship with Government, and
outlining ?HR's determination to improve its organization, increase produc-
tivity, reduce staff, introduce a modern costing system as a basis of a cost
related competitive pricing policy, modernize the accounting system and es-
tablish corporate planning. The majority of the lines of action included
in this plan are discussed in the appropriate sections of this report, but
for ease of reference the Program of Action agreed during negotiations is re-
produced as Annex 13. The adoption of this document as an official statement
of policy and action was agreed during negotiations.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   The Railway's Economic Viability
5.01      The railway has played a significant role in the Malaysian economy,
both as a large enterprise and, during the first half of the present century,
as the only form of transport capable of providing sufficient capacity and
adequate service to move the country's traffic. In the past decade, however,
it has experienced mounting difficulties mainly resulting from (a) a rapidly
growing truck fleet and highway system; (b) road transport's advantage in
short-haul trucking and the closer location of production and consumption
centers which have favored it; (c) the limited network of the railroad as
compared to the highway system; and (d) the separation of Singapore from
Malaysia and Government's policy of replacing Singapore by Port Swettenham
as the main port serving Western Malaysia, thus reducing import and export
distances from centers of consumption and production but making access by
rail to and from the east of Malaysia more circuitous.
5.02      However, at the expense of steadily decreasing revenues per unit
of traffic moved, the railway has been able to compete with road transport
in spite of the above-mentioned disadvantages and has continued to contrib-
ute to the economic growth of Malaysia by carrying a steadily increasing
volume of freight which is most suited to rail transport, namely medium-
and long-haul bulk traffic (Annex 6). Although the railway has lost its
dominant role in the transport sector, intermodal cost comparisons reveal
that it still has a significant part to play in the MIalayan transport system
and is still the most important means to move bulk traffic economically on
land over medium- and long-distances (Annex 14). Analysis suggests that
the railway's competitive position vis-a-vis road transport has stabilized
now and that in order to sustain the economy's rapid growth and the extensive
agricultural schemes now being developed or planned by the Government, MR must
remain a vital part of the Malayan transport system (Annex 15).



- 13 -
B.   Evaluation of the Plan
5.03      The major investments proposed in the plan are evaluated in the
following paragraphs.
(i) Dieselization
5.04      In order to complete dieselization, MR has ordered 40 diesel elec-
tric locomotives (2,000 hp each) from the UK to replace 90 steam locomotives.
Delivery is expected to be completed by mid-1972. To convert to complete
diesel maintenance, no significant remodelling is required in Sentul Work-
shops. Minor alterations to running sheds are needed and are incorporated
in the Investment Plan. The total cost of the investment is M$ 41.2 million.
Training of operating and maintenance staff will be organized upon arrival
of British engineers.
5.05      Worldwide experience shows that dieselization is economically
justified. In the case of Malaysia, one diesel locomotive will replace
2.25 steam locomotives. Reduction of maintenance and operating costs from
M$ 3.271 to M$ 1.381 reduces cost per locomotive-mile by 58%.  The expendi-
tures for locomotive spare parts and the modernization of running sheds are
included in the economic evaluation of the dieselization program. Without
allowing for continuing increases in repair costs and increasing difficulty
in obtaining spare parts should the steam locomotives be kept in operation,
the economic return of the dieselization program is estimated at 14%.
(ii) Realignment of Port Dickson Line
5.06      The realignment of the Port Dickson line at a total cost of M$ 9
million (Annex 11) constitutes an integral part of the modernization program.
While the line was adequate for past traffic requirements, the rapid develop-
ment of petroleum traffic from the two oil refineries at Port Dickson has
reached saturation levels on the existing track. In 1970, traffic over the
section amounted to 505,000 tons. Sharp curves, a weak subsoil structure
and steep gradients prohibit an increase in speed or gross train load. If
the line were to remain in its present condition, the new diesel locomotives
and longer trains could not be employed on this section, thus forcing part
of the traffic to higher cost road transport. In addition, maintenance costs
of track and rolling stock for the line are abnormally high and interruptions
in traffic due to derailments are frequent.
5.07      With the objective of minimizing the total economic cost of trans-
port, several feasible alternative alignments of the Port Dickson line and
other modal options have been evaluated against the alternative of complete
deterioration of the existing line and its closure in 1979 with traffic in
the interim shifting gradually to road transport. The realignment of the
line was found to be the most favorable solution economically and technically.
Principal economic benefits are the avoided investment and higher operating
cost of road transport. Under the assumption of a moderate traffic growth



- 14 -
of 4.7% p.a. and favorable cost and operating conditions for road transport,
the economic rate of return is estimated at about 20%, over a conservatively
estimated service life of 30 years. A sensitivity analysis was performed
assuming different operating conditions for road transport, a more conserva-
tive growth rate of petroleum traffic and shadow pricing of labor. Under
these very conservative assumptions, the economic rate of return was found
to range between 14% and 18%.
(iii) Freight Cars
5.08      The project includes strengthening of couplers on existing freight
cars and acquisition of 860 new freight cars, 300 to replace 800 unservice-
able freight cars and 560 to meet the projected increase in rail traffic up
to 1975.  The total cost of the investment is M$ 32.4 million.
5.09      The economic benefits of the replacement program come mainly from
(a) reduced maintenance cost (M$ 1.30 million/year) and (b) savings in train
operating cost as a result of larger trains made possible by the new freight
cars and the program of coupler strengthening (M$ 1.16 million p.a.). The
replacement program is well justified with an economic rate of return of
about 21%.
5.10      As regards the freight cars needed for MR's projected traffic in-
crease, the benefits would come from the railway's ability to carry more
efficiently and economically the long-haul bulk traffic which would other-
wise have to be carried by trucks, at substantially higher cost, even after
allowing for extra railway handling costs. Analysis indicates that rail
costs, as compared with road haulage costs, would result in net savings of
about M$ 9.25 million/year and the economic rate of return is about 36%.
5.11      The weighted average economic rate of return on the whole rolling
stock investment is about 30% over its useful economic life, estimated at
30 years.
(iv) Track Renewal
5.12      Some 120 miles of track will be renewed at a total cost of M$ 23.05
million durincg the Second Five-Year Plan. The track is in poor condition on
the two sections to be renewed and speed restrictions are imposed for safety
reasons. If the track renewal program were not carried out within the Second
Five-Year Plan, severe speed and load restrictions would have to be imposed,
thus reducing line capacity and diverting a substantial amount of traffic to
higher-cost road transport. The economic benefits will be derived from
savings in vehicle operating cost for the diverted traffic.
5.13      Assuming a traffic growth of about 3% p.a., the economic evalua-
tion of the savings mentioned above yield rates of return for the two
sections of 19% and 22%. Assuming no traffic growth, similar returns would



- 15 -
range between 14% and 19%. The weighted average economic rate of return
on the two sections amounts to 19.5% and, with the most pessimistic assump-
tion, the economic rate of return is 15%.
(v) Training School
5.14      In order to increase the efficiency of medium and lower level staff
to the level required by the dieselization program and the expected improve-
ments in operations, MR is already constructing a new and more comprehensive
training school. Training facilities in the past were less than adequate
and MR was frequently forced to send staff abroad, at high cost and in in-
sufficient numbers. The new facilities for training are, therefore, an im-
portant ingredient for modernizing the railways.
C.   Conclusion
5.15      The proposed investment program is well scaled and of high prior-
ity. It fits well into the overall sector objective of providing economic
and efficient transport facilities. Through a program of physical improve-
ments together with the supplementary measures of institutional reforms, it
will be possible for MR to fulfill its economically appropriate role and to
regain a commercially sound position. The key item in the investment pack-
age is the dieselization program. To obtain the full benefits of dieseliza-
tion, new rolling stock and some track improvement are needed. The weighted
average economic rate of return on the investments which have been quantified
(87% of the project) is about 20%.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. Present Financial Position
6.01      Annex 16 presents the balance sheets of WM  in summary form.  The
financial position at December 31, 1970, was as follows:



- 16 -
M$ million
Fixed assets, net book value                                 276.5
Trade investments                                               .6
Current assets:
Cash and investments                     17.9
Receivables                               5.7
Inventories                               9.6           33.2
310.3
Current liabilities:
Creditors and accrued expenses            8.3
Pensions payments outstanding            19.0           27.3
Long-term debt:
Federal Government                       54.1
Other                                     7.9           62.0
Government equity                                           221.0
310.3
6.02      The net value of the fixed assets is taken from the Receipts and
Expenditure on Capital Account, less the balance of the Renewals Fund. It
is not the intention of these accounts to represent the present-day depre-
ciated value of the assets. Nevertheless, when reduced to a value per route-
mile, equivalent to about US$90,000, the balance of the Capital Expenditure
Account, net of the Renewals Fund balance, is in line with the valuation at
depreciated replacement cost of other railways of similar characteristics
(e.g., Nigerian and East African) which have revalued their assets in recent
years. It is probable that a physical revaluation of MR's fixed assets at
the present date would produce a net value somewhat less than the recorded
book value. Pending reconstruction of MR's accounts (para. 3.05), which will
encompass revaluation of assets, the acceptance of the existing net book
value is unlikely to distort the financial picture.
6.03      The considerable sum outstanding with respect to pensions arises
from the following situation. Pensions of retired ex-Government employees,
including those of the railway, in Malaysia are paid by Treasury. Reimburse-
ment is claimed by Government from the railway in arrears. These arrears
have become prolonged and only recently has the Treasury started to overtake
them. The railway is at present able to pay only at the rate of current
accruals. The position will improve in the course of the next two years, at
the end of which the situation is expected to have returned to normal.



- 17 -
6.04      Included in Mr's long-term debt is an item of M$ 54.14 million
described as "Federal Government Loans bearing interest and redeemable over
60 years." These loans, which were provided for railway construction, liave
accumulated over many years. Since 1966, because of the railway's increas-
ing operating deficits and the resultant depletion of its cash resources, a
moratorium has been granted each year on the payment of both interest on,
and redemption of, the Government Loans. The financial projections indicate
that there is no likelihood of the railway being able to service this debt
during the period of the projections, i.e., through December 31, 1976.
6.05      During negotiations an undertaking was given by Government that
no debt service would become due or payable through December 1976 on the old
Government debt, outstanding as of December 31, 1970, and that thereafter
service of such debt would be made only if the net cash generation from MR's
operations should be at least 1.25 times as great as the debt service payable
on all debt, excluding the old Government debt.
B.   Rates, Fares and Costs
6.06      In setting freight rates, MR has realistically applied the princi-
ple of taking as a ceiling the prices charged by competing modes of trans-
port and, as a minimum, the variable cost of moving by rail the specific
traffic under consideration. Reference to Annex 17, page 16, last two col-
umns, will indicate with what success IT has applied its rating principles.
It will be observed that while no rate fails to cover long-run marginal
costs, some rates appear to have been set so low as to make an inadequate
contribution to fixed costs and overheads as, for example, in the case of
clinker and logs. Action has already been taken by MR to increase the wagon
load rates for logs and a 23% increase in the rate for clinker was negoti-
ated when the contract recently fell due for renewal. MR expects to be able
to introduce further selective rate increases which will lead to an overall
increase of 5.5% in total freight revenue in 1975.
6.07      Negotiated special rates apply to about 98% of total freight traf-
fic, producing some 95% of total freight revenue. The great number of
special rates which have been negotiated have resulted in a steady reduction
in average revenue per net ton-mile from an all-system average of Did 8.1 per
ton-mile (USd1.62 per ton-km) in 1963, to Mi 5.3 per ton-mile (USd1.05 per
ton-km) in 1970. Selective rate increases are expected to increase the
overall average to M4 5.7 per ton-mile (USd1.13 per ton-km) in 1975.
6.08      Passenger fares on MR are relatively high although they are based
on the 1956 tariff and have remained unchanged ever since. For over ten
years the average revenue per passenger mile has remained steady around
MN 5.3. Total passenger revenues cover the long-run variable cost of provia-



- 18 -
ing the services and make a substantial contribution to fixed costs. In
1969, for example, passenger train revenues were about M$ 21 million against
M$ 15 million of directly attributable costs. Severe road competition pre-
cludes any increase in passenger fares.
C.   Past and Future Earnings
6.09      The overriding problem of MR is undoubtedly a financial one.  By
pursuing in adverse financial circumstances a skilful and courageous policy
of marginal cost pricing, the railway has attracted to itself all the goods
for which it is the lowest cost mode of transport and by so doing, has made
a considerable contribution to the economic growth of the country. Concur-
rently, MR has been able to increase productivity and to reduce operating
costs but not, however, commensurately with the reductions in rates it has
had to grant. Consequently, since 1964, it has incurred increasing finan-
cial deficits. The solution can be found only in further cost reductions
through increased efficiency of operations and by substantial investment in
modern motive power, rolling stock and plant. The prospects for the future
are favorable.
6.10      Annex 16 (b) shows the income account of MR from 1962 onwards.
In summary, revenues and expenses have evolved as follows:
Net Operating               Net
Operating  Operating      Revenue (or    Interest    Income (or  Operating
Revenue    Expenditure   Deficit)         Charges      Deficit)       Ratio
.. (M$ million).                                                        %
1962      65.28        62.66          2.62           1.42          1.20       96.0
1963      59.83        59.68           .15           1.62         (1.47)      99.7
1964      62.46        64.27         (1.81)          1.99         (3.80)     102.9
1965      68.64        68.18           .46           2.30         (1.84)      99.3
1966      67.14        71.05         (3.91)           .37         (4.28)      105.8
1967      66.45        74.36         (7.91)           .31         (8.22)      111.5
1968      65.12        73.09         (7.97)           .32         (8.29)      112.2
1969      65.25        77.24        (11.99)           .33        (12.32)      118.4
1970      69.19        78.06         (8.87)           .49         (9.36)      112.8
6.11      The increase in operating expenditure during the period was due
entirely to rising staff costs. Although traffic increased by some 40%, other
costs remained static because of economies derived from continued dieseliza-
tion and modernization of operations. The number of men employed has declined
by 14% since 1962 and productivity per man in terms of traffic units has in-
creased by 62%. On the other hand, the cost per man employed has risen by 65%
at current prices, and by 53% in real terms. Two substantial wage and salary
awards were granted during the period - in 1963 and again in 1969, the latter
being the Suffian Award which increased the wages bill by between M$ 5 and M$ 6
million. However, the increase in staff costs has been closely paralleled by



- 19 -
increased productivity; the cause of the increasing deficit arises from the
progressive reduction of freight rates. Briefly summarized, the changes
which have taken place between 1962 and 1970 are as follows:
Increase in traffic handled per annum
(ton-miles plus passenger-miles)             40%
Increase in revenue                             6%
Increase in expenditure                        25%
6.12      It remains now to assess in what manner the situation can be improved.
The income account projection is as follows:
Net Operating
Operating   Operating       Revenue (or   Interest  Net Income  Operating
Revenue   Expenditure      Deficit)       Charges   (or Deficit)   Ratio

1972      77.57        78.78           (1.21)         1.35       (2.56)      101.2
1973      81.18        78.33            2.85          1.85        1.00        96.5
1974      82.98        78.36            4.62          4.61         .01        94.4
1975      34.89        79.26            5.63          5.02         .61        93.4
6.13      Annex 16 (b) presents the projection in detail, together with sup-
porting statistics and financial data. Provision is made for all foreseeable
increases in costs of labor and material, offset by economies which may real-
istically be expected from the completion of dieselization and replacement of
over-aged and uneconomic rolling stock.  Wage and salary levels are expected
to continue their upward trend, at current prices and in real terms. A crucial
assumption is that the introduction of 40 new and powerful locomotives to com-
plete the process of dieselization will result in an overall reduction in man-
power from 10,847 in 1970 to 10,200 in 1975. In the light of experience in
other countries, this should easily be accomplished. Fuel and material savings
will also be substantial. The average net train-load, freight, is expected to
increase by about 40%, thus providing substantially more revenue at no addi-
tional cost. As a result of these and other advantages which the modernized
equipment will provide, the net operating revenue and operating ratio should
dramatically improve.
6.14      On the revenue side, some selective increases in freight rates have
been included, in cases where costs indicate they are needed, e.g. logs and
clinker, or where competitive prices permit (para. 6.06). No increase in
passenger fares is assumed (para. 6.08).
D.   Financial Targets
6.15      MR is expected to be established in a sound cornpetitive and financial-
ly viable condition by 1973. Referring to the cash flow projection (Annex 16
(c)), it will be seen that taking the long view, the railway should be able to
maintain a debt service coverage of about 1.6 and in a normal year contribute
about 50% of the funds required for capital investment, including the timely



- 20 -
renewal of its plant and equipment. In the particular circumstances of MR,
and in contrast to its present financial situation, this prospect must be
considered satisfactory. It is unlikely that the railway will be able to
earn more than a small return, possibly about 2%, on the net value of the
fixed assets in service revalued on a depreciated replacement cost basis
(para. 6.02). However, had Malaysia existed in its present form at the time
when railway construction was started, with Port Swettenham as the major
port of entry and exit for the country's trade and commerce, the railway
system would certainly not have taken its present shape and dimensions. The
book value of the assets cannot be interpreted, therefore, as representing
their economic value. Nevertheless the comparative cost study of road and
rail clearly indicates that the system as a whole is still capable of moving
goods over medium and long distances at the least cost to the economy, and
consequently should continue to be used to maximum advantage for so long as
it can be maintained, operated and renewed out of revenue in the same sound
competitive position.
6.16      In any event a rate of return is a convenient and easily calculable
device for setting a goal for achievement. Ideally, the financial rate of
return which should be expected from a railway, or from any other entity op-
erating in the national interest, should be that which reflects a pricing
policy the objective of which is to produce the best attainable balance be-
tween the need, on the one hand, to maintain financial viability, and, on
the other hand, to provide the greatest possible benefit to the economy. In
the case of MR, the rate of return which meets this test is estimated to be
2% on the net value of the fixed assets in service, valued at depreciated
present day replacement cost, to be achieved not later than 1976. During
negotiations agreement on this test of future financial performance was ob-
tained. Assurance was also given that the borrower shall take all necessary
steps within its power to break even on revenue account in 1973.
E.   The Financing Plan
6.17      In summary form the financing plan for the period of the Railway
Investment Plan 1971-1975 is as shown below. More detail is given in Annex
16 (c), Cash Flow.

6.18      The substantial contribution expected from MR reflects the general
improvement in operating results which should flow from the investment in
more efficient locomotives and equipment. The Bank loan will finance 65%
of the project, as defined, and together with the funds made available by
the UK Government loan and the credit from Millbank Technical Services, Ltd.,
will cover all but an insignificant part of the foreign exchange requirements
of the Plan. The Federal Government loan will provide the balance needed to
close the gap in the cash flow.
6.19      The UK Government loan is to the Federal Government on concession-
ary terms. It will be passed on to MR at interest of 6-1/4% p.a. and repay-
ment over 30 years, including a five-year grace period. The credit from
Millbank Technical Services, Ltd., (a subsidiary of the Crown Agents, London)
is at 5-1/2%, repayable in 12 years. The credit was made direct to the rail-
way administration.

F.   Future Financial Position
6.20      The financial condition of MR is shown in the summarized balance
sheets in Annex 16 (a). There is good reason to believe that on the premise
that MR will take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the modern-
ization program, a sound financial position will be established and main-
tained. MR debt equity ratio is expected to increase to 44:56 in 1975,
but, as mentioned in paragraph 6.15, MR should be able to maintain a satis-
factory debt service coverage provided it does not incur excessive addition-
al borrowings in the future. During negotiations MR gave an undertaking not
to incur long-term debt without the Bank's prior agreement unless net cash re-
venue is at least 1.25 times the maximum debt service requirements.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) a Program of Action (para. 4.11);
(b) debt service limitation on Government loans outstanding
as of December 31, 1970 (para. 6.05);
(c) financial targets (para. 6.16); and
(d) debt limitation covenant (para. 6.20).
7.02      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$16 million for a term of 25 years including a five-year grace period.

ANNEX 4
Page 1
MALAYSIA
MALAYAN RAILWAY
Brief Description of Railway Property
1.        Track and Signalling
The MR system of 1,035 route-miles was constructed between 1885
and 1931. It is laid to meter gauge and is mainly single track, with the
exception of a short section on the main line south of Kuala Lumpur, which
is double. The rnain lines are generally well designed with gradients not
exceeding 1% (except the Taiping Pass which is 1.25%.) and curves of radius
1,155 feet minimum.
Track and structures are in good condition and generally well
maintained.  About one-half of the track is laid in 80 lb/yd rail, the
remiainder being mainly 60 lb/yd.  Considerable sections are long-welded.
Signalling and traffic control equipment is of simple design and
mostly old, although some modern signalling has been installed between Kuala
Lunpur and Tampin (76 miles).  Consultants 1/ liave been retained for a feasi-
bility study, to be finalized by end 1971, of thie modernization of signal-
ling and telecommunications.  As som,e investrient will no doubt be justified,
a tentative provision of USS1.0 million has been included for this purpose
in the Development Plan in the years 1974-1975.
2.        Motive Power and Rolling Stock
Details of the fleet are shown m page 3 of this Annex. The main
components, in sumpmary, are as follows:
90 steam locomLotives
51 main-line diesel locomotives
41 diesel slhunting locomiotives
26 diesel railcars
306 passenger cars
3,600 freight cars
MRl has ordered 40 additional main-line diesel locomotives to
cor,iplete the substitution of all steam locomotives by the end of 1972.
Availability of existing diesel locomnotives and diesel railcars, respectively
at 72%o and 60%, is unsatisfactory, due mainly to a shortage of components
and, in somae cases, unsatisfactory design.  MIR and the manufacturers have
taken corrective measures to reduce failures and speed up delivery of spare
parts in order to improve availability.

ANNEX 4
Page 2
The number of passenger coaches under or awaiting repair, at 8%,
is satisfactory, taking into account their age (one-third over 40 years old)
and their structure; 80% are wooden-bodied.
Out of 5,600 freight cars (of which one-third are bogie vehicles
and the other two-thirds four-wheelers), about 800 (in bogie equivalent)
are over 40 years old, of low capacity and not suited to modern operations
in heavy, fast freight trains. A scrapping program is under way. In 1971,
under a loan financed by the UK Government, 150 new freight cars were
received, and 710 more will be procured in 1972/73 from the proposed Bank
loan. To take full advantage of the possibilities offered by the more
powerful diesel locomotives now on order, which will be able to haul 1,000-
ton freight trains, 40-toln couplers will have to be fitted to about 1,200
freight cars presently equipped witlh weak couplers.
3.        Workshops
There is a central main workshop at Kuala Lumpur for heavy repairs
of motive power and rolling stock. Mlinor repairs are carried out in five
locomotive sheds, four passenger car sheds and one freight car shed. Main-
tenance operations are generally well organized and are satisfactory. To
complete dieselization, it is necessary to modernize some facilities and
equipment.
4.        Other Property
There are five major traffic yards, at Kuala Lumpur, Gemas, Ipoh,
Port Swettenhar,i and Singapore. Traffic through Kuala Lumpur is nearing the
limits of capacity of the yard. Location in the middle of a densely popula-
ted area will make extension difficult and it may well be necessary to find
a new location. It will be necessary to evaluate all feasible alternatives.
The capacity of the other yards appears to be adequate.  The Singapore
Government has recently asked MR to study the possibility of slhifting the
Singapore facilities (station and marshalling yard) to Bukit Timah, seven
miles north of Singapore, to fit within the Singapore urbanization plan.
MR has also been asked to look at the practicabilitv of carrying daily 200
sea containers in both directions between the port and Bukit Timah whiere a
road container terminal is planned.  Mrl is actively studying the matter but
no final decision has been taken as of now.
In general the buildings, stations, offices, and general plant
of the railways are in good condition and adequately maintained.

1971-1975 Investment Plan - "lain Items
1.        Diesel locomotives (35% of total expenditure)
In order to conplete its full dieselization,  WR has ordered 40
main-line diesel locomotives from the United Kingdom, under loans financed
by  the IK Government.  Delivery should be corpleted by end of 1972 and will
enable the railway to phase out steam traction altogether. The new locomo-
tives will consist of uiiits of 2000 hp, as compared with the existing ones
of 1500 hp and 1060 hp, and will be able to haul a 1000-ton, or 30-bogie
car train, which is an improvement on present operations. The new engines
having an axle-load of only 14 tons, as compared to the present 16 tons,
will help reduce track maintenance expenses.
2.        Freight cars and modernization of rolling stock (28% of total
expenditure)
Out of the nominal fleet of about 5,600 freight cars, 1,600 are
over 40 years of age, are not suited to maodern operation in heavy fast
trains (lack of brake equipment and weakness of couplers) and cause heavy
maintenance expenses; they will be scrapped over the next five years. The
modernization of the freight car fleet is essential to 'TR to offer satis-
factory service to the customers, to take advantage of the possibilities
offered by dieselization and to reduce operating costs. MR has already
ordered 150 bogie pallet cars from the UK, iinanced by British Special Aid.
These wagons will provide additional capacity for freight such as rubber
and beer in crates.  A detailed calculation of freight car requirements by
type (page 4) shows that at least 710 more bogie cars are needed to cope
with the projected 1975 traffic. These are to be mostly box cars for
general cargo, flat cars for logs, gondolas for minerals, building material,
and tank cars for petroleum products.
Modernization of railcars and rolling stock comprises: (i) pro-
curement of twenty-two 200-lip engines to replace wornout engines on 11
diesel railcars and (ii) strengthening of couplers on about 1,200 freight
cars still in good condition but fitted wtih 24-ton couplers,which prevents
their use in 1,000-ton trains.
3.        Realignment of Port Dickson Line (7% of total expenditure)
This 25-mile single-track line connects Port Dickson withi the main
line at Seremban.  The main traffic consists of petroleum products and
ammonium (450,000 tons p.a.) and rubber latex (30,000 tons p.a.). The line



ASiNEX 11
Page 2
is at present restricted to 13-ton axle load, has steep gradients (up to
1.25%), soft formation, and contains sharp curves (530'); because of this,
the line causes increased track maintenance costs and has insufficient
capacity to handle the forecast growth of traffic. Consultants 1/, having
considered a number of alternative solutions, have recommended realignment
of the most difficult parts of the line. This recommendation is accepted
by !M and the Bank as the best justified (see economic evaluation).
4.        Track renewal (18% of total expenditure)
In order to maintain the railway in good working order, experience
has shown that it is necessary to renew track at the rate of 20 miles per
year. The pace of renewals has recently lagged behind schedule, and only
six miles were relaid in 1969. It will be necessary to renew 120 miles of
track in the five-year program, 90 miles on the Kedah line and 30 miles on
the main line from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. The renewal program covers
replacement of the existing rail by 80 lb/yd rail, new timber sleepers
(life 15 years), welding of rail joints and the provision of stone ballast.
This work is justified on grounds of safety and the maintenance of adequate
standard of train operations.
5.        Workshop modernization (4% of total expenditure)
This item comprises the modernization of facilities and procure-
ment of machinery for the maintenance of diesel locomotives.  Only minor
remodelling is required in Sentul IWorkshop (Kuala Lumpur) and running sheds.
6.        Signals and telecommunications (2% of total expenditure)
Out of 154 stations, about half are fully interlocked, mechanically
and/or electrically.  Line clear is given mainly by token, but automatic
color lights have been recently installed between Kuala Lumpur and Tampin
(76 miles). MR has appointed consultants 2/ to make a feasibility study of
improvements to the existing signalling and telecormunication systems.  The
terms of reference have been agreed on withi the Bank and require the consul-
tants, inter alia, to determine thle optimum investment required to replace
and improve the existing system having due regard to traffic projections
and modification of operating procedures due to dieselization. The consul-
tants' recommendations should be ready by end 1971 and will provide a basis
for future investment to be planned in this field. As some investment will
doubtless be needed, a tentative provision of US'j1.0 million equivalent is
included in the program.

7.        Other Items (6%  of total expenditure)
This item covers works already in process such as the construction
of a training school at Sentul, works related to the Jengka Triangle and
double tracking of 3 miles in the vicinity of Kuala Lumpur, some minor pro-
jects related to lengthening of sidings, improvement of buildings and
structures, etc. and a tentative sum in 1975 for amelioration of grades on
the Taiping Pass section, assuming that a feasibility study shows the work
to be justified.

APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
Program of Action
I.   Introduction
(1)  The erosion of the role of the 'Malayan Railway Administra-
tion (1R) in the transport systema and the increasing finan-
cial deficits on railway operations have been of concern
to both the iIalaysian Government and MR.
(ii)  It is the aim of the Government to enable and assist m to
retain its economically appropriate share of the transport
market and at the same time to achieve financial viability.
To this end, it will be necessary for 'T to offer higher
quality service and adopt a more co7umercial attitude toward
the marlketing thereof so that M -.-.may continue to fulfill its
economic role in an increasingly competitive environment.
This statement outlines the policies and the organizational,
pricing and operational measures necessary to assure this
role.
II.  Mf's Relationship with the Government
The Covernment shall take such action as shall ensure that
the obligations and ta::es imposed on the railway do not ex-
ceed those -7hich are applied to co.mlpetin- modes of transport.
mR shall bear, so far as practicablc, a fair proportion of
the real costs of the resources, facilities and services Pro-
vided for its use at public expense. Should the Governnent
deem it necessary for -X to maintain certain non-profitable
lines, stations or services, the resultant loss shall be paid
for by the appropriate !!inistry or agency of the Government.
III. Organizational Improvements
(i)  :TM  is at present carrying out an extensive reorganization of
its administrative structure, aimed at managing the railway
according to modern business criteria, streamlining channels
of control, responsibility and authority and increasing inter-
departmental coordination (target date for completion: mid-1972).
(ii)  While much has been done in this regard, the necessity remaains
to strengthen the development and planning organization to en-
sure that future investments will be based on sound technical,
economic and financial principles (target date: end 1972).
Consultants shall be employed to recommend specific actions
required for this Project.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
IV. Improvements in +MR's Productivity
(i) The new commercially orientated objectives of MR call for
continuous effort toward improving the railway's efficiency.
To this end, it is essential that the maximum benefits be
secured from the modernization program.  ;1R shall therefore
prepare a time-phased plan for improving the efficiency of
operations, particularly with reference to locomotive and
freight car utilization (targets: 85% availability for
motive power and 95% for freight cars by 1974) and staff
productivity. In this latter regard, a detailed staff plan
shall be prepared to indicate the extent to which it will be
necessary to redeploy and retrain staff and to reduce, by
attrition, the overall labor force commensurate with the
economies offered by the modernization program (target:
10,200 men in 1975).
(ii)  Wherever they are economically justified and profitable, .MR
shall make increasing use of modern transport techniques
such as containerization, door-to-door service by means of
private sidings or the establishment of an integrated rail-
road transport systerm, improvement of loading and unloading
techniques.
(iii)  MR sthall initiate detailed economic studies of all its
services, stations and lines to determine if economies
can be realized through rationalization or, if this is
not possible, by partially or totally eliminating some
of these services, stations or lines.
V.   Tariff and Rates:  Costina
(i)  SM shall introduce a new costing system to facilitate the
establishment of:
(a) an appropriate cost-based and competitive pricing
policy; and
(b) a basis for the economic and financial evaluation
of 2M's investments.
(ii) As soon as may be practicable after the determination of its
costs, MR shall introduce a new tariff (target date:
mid-1973.)



ANNEX 13
Page 3
(iii)  The Government shall allow MR to set and maintain rates and
fares in such a way that no rate or fare shall be below the
incremental cost of providing the service, or so high as to
divert to, or fail to regain from, other modes of transport
any traffic which the railways can carry at the lowest
economic cost. PIR shall be afforded sufficient flexibility
of price fixing to enable this policy to be fully implemented.
VI. Establishment of Corporate Planning and System of Performance Control
(i)   a shall prepare, in consultation witlh the Government, a
corporate plan for the next five years in detail and for
the following five years in outline (target date:  end 1972).
It shall be based on the policy objectives outlined above and
shall specify quantitative targets and measures wherever pos-
sible. It shall in general consist of the following three
elements:
(a)  plan for improving and expanding MR's share of the trans-
port market by such measures as strengthened marketing
activities, sales promotion, improved customer services,
integration of transport services, etc., implementation
of operational/organization targets, and other produc-
tivity increasing and cost reducing measures;
(b) development of an investment program based on sound
tecmnical, financial and economic studies; and
(c) establishment of financial targets consistent with eco-
nomic utilization of the existing system and having due
regard to future financial needs.
(ii) MR shall also establish a modern system of control that will
permit prompt evaluation of progress in implementing the cor-
porate plan and, if necessary, propose adequate measures for
ensuring timely execution of the targets directed towards the
objectives determined in the corporate plan (target date:
mid-1973).
(iii) MR shall modernize its accounting svstem (target date: end-
1973).

2.   Railway Freiglht Traffic Cost
Two types of cost have been used in the comparison: (i) long-run
variable cost per ton as given in Annex 17, page 16, referred to as finan-
cial cost, and (ii) long-run variable cost, referred to as economic cost,
using a shadow wage rate for unskilled and semiskilled labor which has been
valued at 60% of actual wages resulting in a reduction of the financial cost
of about 11%.
In order to render possible a comparison between road and rail,
total distribution costs have been compared rather than rail transport cost
only. The additional door-to-door cost per ton for rail transport is as

(ii) Interpretation of Results
The figures presented on page 5 indicate the railway's com-
petitive position for each of the major commodities trans-
ported by MR. The comparison takes into account (a) the
economic cost of transport for different commLodities; and
(b) different possibilities - short and long run - of com-
mercial competition. The analysis suggests that the railway
is competitive on all counts over medium and long distances
except for the transport of miscellaneous goods which consist
of such commodities as "Household and Military Store", "Ma-
chinery," and other non-bulk items. These could more eco-
nomically be moved by road.

A.   Assumptions Underlying MR's Freight Traffic Forecasts
This part of the annex explains in some detail the main assump-
tions underlying MR's freight traffic forecasts as shown in Annex 7.
1.        Building Materials - Average annual rate of growth of 3.3%
(tons) and .7% (ton-miles) take into account:
(a) Cement: Comprised over 48% in 1969 and 50% in
1970 of building materials. MR projects an in-
crease of 10% over next five years as a result
of expected 7-10% annual increase in construction
activity in the country and a continuation of the
upward trend since 1967. Road transport plays a
complementary rather than competitive role.
(b) Clinker: Formed about 33% in 1969 and 30% in 1970
of total building materials. The major destination
is Singapore, whose consumption is expected to in-
crease from 190,000 tons in 1970 to 300,000 tons in
1971 and 330,000 tons in 1972 (about 60% of total
Singapore consumption). Nearly 100%-/ of clinker will
continue to be carried by rail.
(c)  Iron and Steel:  Made up about 7%, in 1969 and 8% in
1970 of building materials. Rail will continue to
dominate but rail share expected to rise from about
20% in 1970 to 30% in 1971 as a result of current
negotiations with shinpers. The recent Government
ban on imports of iron and steel led local suppliers
to plan for increased production and they have re-
quested more wagons from Ma to accommodate planned
increases in production.
2.        Petroleum and Mineral Fuels - The projected average annual rate
of growth of 4.9%' (tons) and 6.3% (ton-miles) is based on the followving
assumptions:
(a) On the basis of information from the oil companies,
total petroleum consumption is expected to increase
at the rate of 7.8% per annum.  Coastal shipping will
continue to be the Drincinal competition for Port
Dickson originatini-  traffic (slhiDning 55%, rail 15%,
road 8%).



ANNEX 15
Page 3
(b) Loss of three year contract (1971-1973) with B.P. for
traffic of 40,000 tons a year through Port Swettenham.
(c) Recent 4% surtax and 20% duty on most imported petro-
leum products will discourage imports and thus will
favor rail more than shipping traffic, which benefits
from imported (Singapore) traffic from Swettenham.
(d) Port Dickson line improvements will be completed ac-
cording to the 1971-1975 plan.
3.         Other Minerals - Projected increase reflects:
(a) Illemnite: Lon, terr,m illemnite contract concluded
with Japan.
(b)  Gypsum:  Imported mainly from Thailand and 100% carried
by rail.
4.        Timber and Logs - This traffic is almost entirely logs.  Timber
was only 7% in 1969 and 4a' in 1970. Logs from East Coast to Singapore
will continue to be carried almost entirely by rail but Penang exports to
Singapore will be carried mainly by road. The forecasts assume that much
of the development traffic from the Jenka Triangle projects will move by
rail following recent contracts won by MR.  tiowever, the forecasts do not
take into account possible traffic diversion to roads if the proposed road
construction projects should be started linking most of the north sector
and Pahang sectors of the East Coast with the West Coast.
5.         Food - Sugar is the principal co;mponent comprising 367' (1969) and
38% (1970) of total food. Forecast of food traffic is based on population
growth and expectation that convnetition from road transport (especially C-
license carriers) will be weakened as a result of new road transport regu-
lation (see above). NR's share of flour traffic, for example, has been
drastically eroded by these carriers.  Milk is mainlv short haul traffic
and no significant increase is expected, but sugar is expected to increase
due to increasing number of new factories using sugar as inputs for such
import substitutinr products as chocolates and sweets. Only a moderate
increase in animal feed traffic (4%) is expected.
6.        Rubber and Latex - Drn rubber comprised about 62% (1969) and 58%
(1970) of this group.  Rubber outpult from small holdin%s will continue to
go by road and much of the increase in nroduction in Kedab, Perak and Penang
will be carried bv road, except estates production, which predominates in
Johore, Malaka, and Selangor, where the largest proportion of rubber is
carried by rail with its advantage of long haul. 'R already has the con-
tract for Jenka traffic frort Pasir Besar and this is reflected in the fore-
casts.



ANNEX 15

7.        Iron Ore - The forecast takes into account the phasing out of sev-
eral mines - Tahan mine closed; Bahu not started but still a possibility of
Japanese interest in reopening it: Krambit mine; which will definitely stop
in 1972; but the Jerantut to Jurong, Ipoh to Prai traffic of 90,000 tons a
year is certain to survive up to 1975.
8.         Rice, Bran and Padi - Estimates were revised upwards because cur-
rent performance is already in excess of previous forecasts and much of the
development traffic from the Muda (in the state of Kedah), and Kemubu (in
Kelantan) schemes are expected to go by rail. Mfuch of the Port Swettenham
imports are expected to stop by 1974 when the Muda scheme comes to full pro-
duction. MR will benefit from this shift to Muda.
9.         Chemicals -
(a)  Fertilizers - Is the principal component - 75` (1969)
and 78% (1970).  MR's forecast is based largely on the
levelling off of demand at Muda and the start of in-
creased cropping at Kemubu by 1975.  Traffic from. the
chemical company of Malaysia at Kelang (in Selangor
state) to Prai will continue to go by rail as well as
long haul movements from Singapore or Kuala Lumpur.
Short haul movements from the last two wqill go by road.
(b)  Ammonia:  Largely fror Port Dickson (Tapis Minyak re-
finery) will continue to move by rail.
10.       Tin and Tin Ore - MR's traffic here is almost comnletely tin ore.
No change in present tonnage of traffic is expected as from 1972 due to
stagnation and exnected decline in tin production.
11.       Beer, Cigarettes and Empties - Takes into account loss of short
haul traffic to road transport and hence increased average length of haul.
However, a new contract is expected with a foreign brewing company.  Nearly
all imported tobacco will continue to go by rail. Em'ptier are principally
containers returned to brewing companies.
12.       Other Oils - Tonnage is exnected to nearly double by 1975 reflect-
ing primarily development traffic from Jen-ka Triangle schemes in Pahang for
which MR already has the contract and is negotiatin!gt  for the traffic from the
Bukit Mendi complex (also in Pahan:z) and that from Trolak in Perak.
13.       Other Commodities - Projection of present trend.  Among these,
livestock traffic will continue to decline from the pre--1965 level because
of substitution to imported cold storage meat from Australia (not moved by
MR) which may be offset if the Government encouragement of increased cattle
rearing succeeds.
B.   Supplementary Traffic Forecasts (1975-1985)
14.       The following is an outline of the method of deriving supplemen-
tary traffic forecasts for the oeriod up to 1985.

Regression Analysis
15.       First a linear and loglinear reL,ression analysis was carried out
taking, as two dependent variables, TR's freight traffic in tons or ton-
miles and as independent variables any combination of the following: pro-
duction or consumption (in physical quantities or value terms), exports or
imports (in physical quantities or values), average revenue per ton, and
average revenue per ton-mile.  The data refer to West Malaysia only and
cover the period 1960 to 1970. 1/
16.       Initially twelve equations were tested for each of sixteen com-
modity groups (including the totals) depending on which combination of in-
dependent variables were used for either of the two dependent ones. In
order to be able to compare short run parameters with long run ones, the
analysis was repeated with 1960 to 1965 and 1965 to 1970 data in addition
to the 1960 to 1970 tests.
17.       The Results - On the basis of statistical tests,the most satisfac-
tory results were obtained for six major commodity groups - building mate-
rials, petroleum and mineral oils, timber and logs, food, other oils (mainly
palm oil and kernels) and total goods traffic less iron ore. These accounted
for an average of 61% (tons) and 68% (ton-miles) of total traffic less iron
ore in the period 1965 to 1970.
The Forecasts
18.       The forecasts were based on:
(a)  The results obtained from the re,cression analysis
that had the best statistical tests.
(b) The projection of tihe production variables obtained
from various renorts or studies of West Mlalaysia. 1/
The forecasts of the five commodity groups were then
slightly adjusted to correspond with the forecast
total freig'ht traffic (less iron ore) and to allow
for the most pessimistic estimates of average length
haul for the period up to 1935. Finally, the remaining
goods traffic was forecast as a residual bv deducting
the sum of the five groups from the total. Page 1
presents these supple7ientarv forecasts.
1/   Sources of data include:  Malayan Railways Annual Reports; Department
of Statistics (Stat. Handbook of W. Malaysia 1963 and .1SB of W. MNalaysia
Feb. 1971): IBRD's "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Malaysia"
(1970); "Transport in 11alaysia" by R.R. Nathan Assoc. for UNDP and IBRD;
and "Highway Feasibility Study Route 1" (1971) by Valentine, Laurie and
Davies Consultants for UNDP and ITRD.

19.       Passenger Traffic
The same analysis was made with MR's passenger traffic data 1969/70
(passenger Journeys/miles for first, second, third classes and total) as
dependent variables and population or GDP per capita or both (W. Malaysia only)
as independent variables. However, statistical tests showed that the results
are not satisfactory enough to be used as a basis for forecasting MR's passenger
traffic up to 1985.

Tentative Freight Traffic Costing
Notes
1. Separation of Variable and Fixed Costs
(a)  Track rMaintenance. Chief Engineer estimates 5O, of gang time to
be spent on maintenance and levelling of the track and 50,5 on
jungle clearing, grass cutting, bank and cutting maintenance,
etc. Studies in other countries indicate that the cost of
maintenance and levelling of the track is betwieen 30,O and 40"'
variable with the volume of traffic. Other track costs are not
affected by traffic volume but depend on climatic factors.  For
the present study 40% of 501 of the permanent way labor cost
(i.e. 20'b) has been taken as variable.
(b)  Maintenance of Buildings, Structures and T>orks is not considered
to be a variable cost within the period of the projection, i.e.
to 1975.
(c)  Superintendence, All Departments. There is a tendency for
superintendence costs to rise as the volume of work increases,
but the rate of increase should be much less than directly
proportional to the change in the volume of traffic. For the
pr'esent study it has been assumed that only 5% of superintendence
costs are likely to react in proportion to clianges in traffic.
In certain departments, where the complete dieselization of
operations may be expected to reduce the overall volume of work,
superintendence costs are taken as fixed.
It can be argued that where work is likely to decline,
superintendence costs should be also be negatively variable,
but in the present instance this may be an over-optimistic
assumption and has been disregarded.
(d) Station Staff. Salaries of staff employed solely on booking
passengers and goods (as assessed from the station staff lists)
are taken as variable. In view of the probability that the
greater capacity of the new diesels will enable traffic growth
to be handled without any increase in train-miles, the salaries
of purely operating staff are taken as fixed costs within the
period of the projection.



ANNEX 17
Page 5
(e) Pointsmen. Pointsmen in yards are taken as a variable cost;
pointsmen whose duties consist mainly of setting the line for
passing trains are considered to be a fixed cost.
(f)  Pensions. Pensions costs in 1969 were inflated by the new 55-
year rule for retirement. As the Suffian Award includes a
reduction in the pensions constant to 1/800 for each month of
service, it is considered on the basis of actuarial findings in
other countries, that the variable pensions cost should be about
15% of the total salaries classified under variable cost,
i.e. 15J of about $20 million.
(g) Other Costs. No comment is thought to be needed, as they are
readily susceptible to classification.
2. Depreciation of Fixed Assets
The purpose of the study is to determine the value of all the resources
cor-t ;U' in carrying traffic at any given future level.  Depreciation
is therefore calculated on the basis of equipment usage and replacement
value, as follows:
Rail and Fittings. 80 lb - M$ 96,000 per mile
Service capacity 150 million gross ton
Depreciation M$ .00064 per gross ton-mile (including locomotives)
1969 Passenger 650 m.g.t.m. = M$ 416,000
Freight 1,740 m.g.t.m. =   1,113,600
Total   2,390 m.g.t.m. =    ,39,600
Sleepers.  Timber, 2,200 per mile   total 2,280,000
Cost per sleeper, creosoted, in track MS 6.50
Total replacement value M$ 14J,80,.O0
Estimated average service life - 15 years
% depreciation due to wear and tear under traffic
(engineer's assessment), 10,'
Total annual depreciation M$ 97,O000
Due to traffic             M$  99,000
Locomotives - 1,500 hD Diesel.  Cost D, 800,000
Estimated life 2 million miles
Depreciation per mile M$ 0.4
Railcars. Cost per unit MQ 600,000
Estimated life 1.5 million miles
Depreciation per mile 1$ 0.4

Frcjght Cars. Average cost M$ 36,000

Locomotives - Diesel Shunters.  M$ 360,000
Average life - 133,000 hrs= 665,000 miles
Depreciation per mile M$ .54
3. Division of Variable Costs between Goods and Passenger
(a)  Track Costs.  Divided on the basis of gross ton-miles (including
engines). Goods costs are further divided between line-haul and
marshalling yards on the basis of 2 track-miles in yards (includ-
ing turnouts) = 1 mainline mile, including first and second
loops in crossing stations.
(b)  Locomotive Costs.  As it was intended at the outset to adjust
all costs to reflect complete dieselization of the railway, the
decision was made to assume that passenger services were already
fully dieselize' and to charge all steam costs to goods, thereby
restricting the final adjustnent to the goods service. The
assumption is, of course, not in accordance with the facts as
they existed in 1969, but as we are concerned only with ascer-
taining future costs this distortion of the 1969 actual T'orking
conditions is immaterial.
(c) Drivers and Firemen. Divided on the basis of engine-hours in
traffic and approximate average pay, as follows:
Drivers and Firemen
No.        $ per Annum         Total Cost
Drivers
-FPassenger    101    x      8,500              859,000
Goods        197      x     8,500            1,658,600
Firemen, Passed Driver
Yards         84      x     4,000       =      336,000
Firemen
Passenger     65      x     3,700       =      241,000
Goods        197      x     3,700       =      729,000
3,823,600

A further transfer of $119,000 from line-haul costs to
shunting and marshalling costs was necessary to reflect train-
engine shunting hours, as shoi^m in statistics.
(d)  General. WThere the accounting classification of expenditure did
not provide a ready means of allocating costs, the statistics in
most cases provide a logical basis for allocation. IThere this
source failed it was necessary to make a special study, as in
the case of Station Staff, where it was necessary to analyze the
staff lists to take out the relative numbers of passenger, par-
cels and goods booking clerks.

5. Adjustments for Future Costs
It was necessary to determine historical costs as a basis for
projecting fature costs.  In the case of Malayan Railway two factors
are of prime importance - the -Suffian Award and the imminent complete
dieselization of operations. In the time available the i4ission could
make only broad calculations of the effect of these factors, as
followJs:
