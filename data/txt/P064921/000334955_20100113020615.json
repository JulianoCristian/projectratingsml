"Ratings for the Budget Systems\n            Modernization Project for Algeria were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the instrument was not adequate because of the country\n            context and of the area of assistance. It is reasonable to\n            question the traditional project approach in the current\n            Algerian environment. While Algerian counterparts are\n            tempted to set ambitious goals to create a momentum for\n            reforms, they can eventually satisfy themselves with the\n            achievement of only partial results during the originally\n            planned timeline, provided that the reform is on track:\n            their expectations are more realistic and attuned to the\n            Algerian environment than those of Bank staff. The second\n            lesson is the need to start such program only after a clear\n            comprehensive strategy with a carefully designed road map\n            has been elaborated, discussed between all interested\n            parties and internalized by all those who will implement it.\n            It is also the stage when resistance to change should be\n            carefully assessed and specific incentives and approaches\n            designed to get the entities and individuals concerned to\n            promote or at least accept the reforms The third lesson\n            learned with this project is the same as for other parallel\n            Bank project and other reform programs planned during the\n            same period in Algeria relates to the effect combination of\n            post-conflict civil peace restoration and fundamental reform\n            of State role can have on government capacity. The post\n            conflict situation of Algeria, and the complex and arduous\n            transition from a centrally planned system to market economy\n            create an environment in which reforms are hard and slow to\n            implement, unless there is a wide consensus and strong\n            popular backing, an unwavering political commitment and a\n            modern, highly efficient administration capable of executing\n            the complex reforms at a sustained pace."}, "docdt": "2009-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
