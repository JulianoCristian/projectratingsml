F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project will support implementation of Tanzania's private sector development
strategy, notably through its public enterprise (PE) privatization program, banking
restructuring, and infrastructure and utilities' regulation, which are aimed at improving
economic efficiency through expanded private investment and production in the economy
and reduced drain upon scarce fiscal resources.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       The Privatization and Private Sector Development project was designed in early 1999, appraised
in October 1999, taken to the Board on December 14, 1999, and became effective on July 20, 2000. The
original closing date was September 30, 2004. However, in light of outstanding activities and Credit
balance, the project had two extensions (September 2004 and 2007 respectively, for a cumulative period
of 5 years) and closed on September 30, 2009. The original credit was in the amount SDR 33.3 million
(US$45.9 million equivalent). A total amount of SDR 25.5 million (US$ 36.3 million equivalent) was
disbursed, and the balance of SDR 7.8 million (US$ 9.9 million equivalent) was canceled. The project
was designed to support the strategic CAS objective of enhancing economic efficiency and improving the
quantity and quality of services in Tanzania. Tactically, the operation sought (i) to accelerate the
divestiture of inefficient, underperforming and financially burdensome Tanzanian parastatals a process
started in 1993, (ii) to recover public banks' non-performing assets, (iii) to set up effective
infrastructure/utilities' regulation, and (iv) to foster public-private sector dialogue around private sector
competitiveness issues. The project was meant to be a follow up to the Parastatal and Public Sector
Reform Project (PPSRP, 1993-1999), which supported both privatization and debt collection. It also
supported the structural adjustment program then in place ("Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit",
PSAC, 2000-2004), in the context of which the excessive role of the state in productive sectors (a heritage
of the previous socialist period in the country) was being rolled back.

2.       Prior to the project, between 1994 and 1998, about 150 public enterprises (PEs) out of a portfolio
of 385 PEs were privatized. Even though the process had moved slowly, the project sought to build on
this track record to provide support to the Government of Tanzania (GOT) in addressing key issues that
had arisen during the process, and in dealing with the substantial challenges pertaining to infrastructure
reform. Delays in divestiture of PEs were contributing in a number of cases to deterioration of fixed assets
and created uncertainties limiting private investment in certain sectors. Moreover, in late 1996 the GOT
had taken the decision to expand the privatization program to divest all major utility and infrastructure
PEs (ports, railways, electricity, telecommunications, etc.), banking, agriculture and mining PEs. This
project was intended to improve the quality and accelerate the implementation of the privatization
program to reap the benefits of greater efficiency and more dynamic private investment and economic
growth.

3.       At the same time, the Government of Tanzania, encouraged by the success of the Loans and
Advances Realization Trust (LART) which had been created in 1991 and had succeeded in collecting
non-performing assets (NPAs) of the state-owned banks, decided to extend the provision of debt
collection services to all financial institutions. This would be achieved through the establishment of
permanent commercial courts and by moving LART into the private sector. Specific issues to be
addressed by the project at the time included (i) how to ensure effective handling of the flow of work
resulting from the privatization of National Bank of Commerce, and (ii) how to facilitate growth in
private sector capacity in the debt collection business.

4.       In the area of infrastructure, GOT needed to develop competitive regulatory frameworks and
institutional arrangements (regulatory bodies) in the utility and transport sectors, following adoption (in
1996/97) of a policy to attract private operators and investors into major utility and transport sectors
(telecoms, power, water, ports and railways). Improved legal and regulatory frameworks were needed to
protect consumers from the misuse of monopoly power. Moreover, by creating credible and predictable



                                                     1
rules, private operators would be encouraged to invest in infrastructure sectors with a reasonable prospect
of earning a fair return on investment.

5.      Finally, in order to expand private investment and operations, Tanzania needed to improve the
business environment through removal of regulatory and other constraints particularly in the areas of
investment regulations, business licensing, property rights (land ownership), labor regulation, business
law, judicial training, investment incentives and taxation. To that effect, a public-private sector
consultative mechanism was deemed necessary to facilitate the dialogue leading to improved business
environment so as to boost private investments.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

6.       The PDO, as stated in the PAD, was to "support implementation of Tanzania's private sector
development strategy, notably through its public enterprise (PE) privatization program, banking
restructuring, and infrastructure and utilities' regulation, which are aimed at improving economic
efficiency through expanded private investment and production in the economy and reduced drain upon
scarce fiscal resources". In the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), the formulation was as follows:
"The objectives of the project are to assist the Borrower in carrying out of its privatization program and
private sector development program". Throughout the implementation period, the PAD formulation of the
PDO prevailed.

7.       The project's key outcome indicators were as follows: (i) contribution to growth of GDP through
privatized sectors; (ii) investment in privatized enterprises; and, (iii) post-privatization growth in
employment. These outcomes would be made possible by the achievement of a series of output indicators
detailed component by component and reflected in annex 2 of this report. The privatization component
would allow the divestiture of 180 small/medium public enterprises (PEs) and 20 strategic/large PEs, a 10
percent expansion in employment and a 20 percent increase in revenue flows to the government. The debt
collection component would allow the recovery of a least 90 percent of banks' non-performing assets
(NPAs), and the creation of at least 3 private debt management agencies including privatized LART.
Performance in the area of regulation would be measured by the establishment of relevant institutions, the
training of at least 80 percent of the staff and the resolution of regulatory disputes within 18 months.
Finally, the improvement in the business environment would be measured by at least 100 firms investing
private funds and a cumulative US$5.0 billion of investment.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

8.      The PDO and key performance indicators (KPI) were not formally revised during the
implementation period as there was no formal restructuring. The information reflected in the December
2008's ISR stating that there was an RVP approved restructuring was inaccurate. What did occur is that
in September 2007 there was an extension of the closing date, from the originally stipulated September
30, 2007 to September 30, 2009.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.       Main project beneficiaries were the Government, the private sector and domestic consumers. The
Government would obtain (i) fiscal benefits, consisting of lower subsidies, lower investment expenditures
in areas where divestiture would occur and higher tax revenues generated by a growing private sector, and
(ii) development benefits associated with increased services and efficiency in the economy. The private
sector would benefit from new investment opportunities created by the divestiture program, and higher


                                                    2
competitiveness resulting from lower cost intermediate goods (e.g. electricity, water, telecommunications)
and more reliable infrastructure services (e.g. rail, ports). The consumers would benefit from increased
access to products and services at more affordable prices induced by increased competition, and they
would be protected by regulatory and competition institutions from the misuse of monopoly power.
1.5 Original Components

10. Privatization Support (US$26.27 million): This component aimed at:
    · streamlining the PE divestiture process and procedures in order to facilitate accelerated
        implementation of Tanzania's privatization program and improved efficiency and transparency in
        its execution. This was to be achieved through : (a) more timely policy decisions by Government
        coupled with greater delegation of execution of transactions through the agreed "fast track"
        mechanism, and (b) use of clearer, simplified procurement procedures, based upon outsourcing to
        competitively selected investment advisors, and generally using price as final selection criterion,
        with investor technical capacity and credentials for larger transactions determined through pre-
        qualification; and
    ·   implementing consistent overall policies for PE employee retrenchment and treatment of PE debt
        to ensure fiscal sustainability and equity and expanded stakeholder awareness and public
        communication concerning Tanzania's privatization program.

11.     Debt Collection (US$4.36 million): The component aimed at strengthening repayment discipline
in Tanzania's banking system, through (1) expedited collections from defaulters on non-performing assets
of public sector commercial banks; and (2) expansion of Tanzania's fledgling private market capacity for
debt collection through transfer of LART in the medium term to the private sector as part of an overall
market-based strategy.

12.      Utilities Regulation (US$13.92 million): The component was designed to help (i) create an
institutional framework for private participation in infrastructure (PPI); and (ii) establish an effective
overall institutional framework for infrastructure and utilities regulation across the sectors, supported by
capacity building and public awareness raising efforts. Sectors of focus were: telecommunications,
energy, water, civil aviation, surface and marine transport (roads, rail, ports and seas).

13.     Business Environment Improvement (US$1.35 million): This component was limited to the
creation of a government-private sector consultative mechanism so as to foster policy dialogue on
competitiveness-improving reforms in Tanzania's business environment.

1.6 Revised Components

14.     Project components were not revised during the implementation period. At the time of the second
extension in September 2007, two components (Debt Collection and Business Environment) were closed:
the debt collection component was considered to have largely achieved its objective and the executing
agency had already ceased to exist; and the support to business environment was to be continued under
the new "Private Sector Competitiveness Project". The two remaining components pertaining to
privatization and regulation would continue to be implemented until September 30, 2009.




                                                     3
1.7 Other significant changes

15.     While the project design, scope and scale did not change, the implementation time was doubled,
spanning over a period of ten years as a result of two consecutive extensions of the closing date, the first
one in 2004 for a period of three years and the second in 2007 for a period of two years.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.      Previous sector experience and preparatory studies. Project preparation and design were
influenced by the fact that this project was a follow-up to PPSRP, under which IDA supported both
privatization and debt collection. In light of the Government's decision to expand privatization to
infrastructure, the need for regulation had become imperative. The need to improve the business
environment was also acknowledged. Project design benefitted also from a series of studies funded under
the project preparation facility, which helped articulate, inter alia, modalities for streamlined privatization
retrenchment and PE debt policies, as well as communication with stakeholders.
17.     Adequacy of regulatory reform approach. The PPSDP design promoted many worthwhile
reforms, badly needed in the Tanzanian context:
    ·    Consider "light-handed" contract-based versus full-fledged regulations, with a clear preference to
         start with light-handed regulation given capacity considerations;

    ·    Implement a program of extensive public education and awareness;

    ·    Given the high fixed start-up costs related to the establishment of such institutions, and the
         uncertainty of funding until such institutions gain stronger grounding and demonstrate relevance,
         finance some of the operational costs for the initial years for the nascent regulators; and

    ·    "Focus on the institutional issues", leaving the design of industry-specific regulatory rules to
         separate industry-specific (e.g. Bank, other) projects.

18.      Insufficient consideration of internal and external risk factors. The design failed (i) to address
sufficiently the issue of strengthening executing agencies, particularly the key PSRC, in the wake of the
new type of challenges including utility reforms; and, more importantly, (ii) to define the right sequence
between the creation of regulatory rules and agencies and private sector involvement in infrastructure1.
Also, in the aftermath of the 1997/8 Asian crisis, the Bank could have and should have identified (much
earlier than it did) the risk that the private sector's interest for investment in infrastructure in a frontier
market like Tanzania had largely evaporated.

19.      In the area of regulation in particular, it was quite unrealistic to expect well functioning multi-
sector regulatory authorities to be established in less than a two-year time frame. Due consideration had
not been given to the amount of time that it could take for the relevant legislation to pass through

1
  Ideally, regulatory rules and bodies should be in place and tested prior to the transfer of ownership of a monopoly
or monopolistic infrastructure firm to private hands. In reality, few developing countries have had the time or
resources to enact the ideal approach. Second-best but accepted practice is to put in place a strong program of
regulatory policy and agency development in parallel with private sector participation. The project's attempts to
follow the second path were, in retrospect, inadequate; see para.19.


                                                          4
parliament for such politically and economically sensitive sectors, especially as the institutional structure
(e.g. which sectors would fall under which regulator/ line ministry) had not been previously agreed.



20.      In the area of business enabling environment, project activities were not fully aligned to the
identified business constraints: no specific actions defined to improve investment regulations, business
licensing, property rights (land ownership), labor regulation, business law, judicial training, investment
incentives and taxation.

21.      Poor quality of the log frame and monitoring and evaluation system. The formulation of the
PDO was unclear and was never made consistent in project documentation: the wording of the PDO in the
PAD's main text is different from the one in Annex 1 (log frame) as well as in the DCA; these differences
in PDO wording were never reconciled. The project's logical framework, including KPIs, was deficient as
it defined key outcomes that were somehow beyond the direct influence of the project, such as increase in
private sector contribution to growth of GDP, and increase in labor productivity. No baseline was defined
for the various performance indicators in the log frame. Despite these flaws, this project was timely and
relevant in its different components.

22.       Risks faced by the project were adequately identified and rated; both policy and political risks
and business environment risks were acknowledged as high. However, the measures taken to mitigate
these high risks were insufficient to fully address the issues. For example, while the PAD discussed the
policy, political and governance risks associated with sustainable implementation of the privatization
program, particularly in the area of infrastructure, the only mitigation factor proposed is the adoption of
streamlined and transparent procedures. This was not an adequate response, given the weak technical and
managerial capacity available to handle the large range of new and more complex privatizations about to
be launched, the risk of wavering government commitment to privatization in light of their long-standing
socialist tradition and the opposition to the program of some academics and NGOs, the power of vested
interests among managers, workers and suppliers of the large infrastructure PEs, etc. With respect to the
privatization of utilities in particular, there was little experience of massive private sector participation on
the continent; and general global private capital flows had dwindled as a result of the 1998 financial
crisis, let alone private financing of infrastructure in a frontier market like Tanzania. There were also risks
associated with the establishment of multi-sector regulators as discussed above (para. 18 and 19).

23.     The proposed mitigation measure for the business environment risks was the set-up of the public-
private dialogue mechanism. The project should have taken the thinking a bit further to define more
precisely the kind of business environment issues needed to be tackled and what would be the indicators
of progress.

24.     Given the multiple sectors in which this project had an involvement (e.g. economic management,
telecoms, energy, water, etc.), the PAD should have emphasized the need for cross-project
communication and knowledge sharing; and it could even have specified plans to that effect. This could
have entailed parallel and complementary projects in the financial, transport, energy and water sectors for
instance. These aspects remained salient during project implementation.

2.2 Implementation

25.     A variety of factors affected project performance, including changes in government, disruptions
in implementation arrangements, and insufficient pro-activity on the Bank team's side during some
periods of the project's implementation period.


                                                       5
26.      Government commitment, changes in leadership and discontinuation of executing agencies.
During project preparation and at the beginning of the implementation phase, Government commitment
was strong. However, it started waning with the first attempts to secure private participation in
infrastructure, a trend that continued until 2005 when the President commissioned a report taking stock of
the infrastructure privatization experience. On the other hand, apart from foreseeable changes at the helm
of the Ministry of Finance, the 2005 elections slowed down implementation and new appointments
ensued, including a new manager for PSRC. The mandates of the two main executing entities were
discontinued during the project extension period: LART in June 2006 and PSRC in December 2007. In
both cases, the mandates were transferred to CHC. The substantial effort made under the project to build
the capacity of the PSRC came to naught, as few if any of the trained staff were taken on by the new
privatization authorities.

27.     Failure to set up a Steering Committee. A high-level steering committee, whose composition
was spelled out in the DCA, was supposed to be set up to ensure coordination of all project activities at
the Government policy level. It was to be chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, and
would comprise the Permanent Secretary Planning Commission in the President's Office, the Permanent
Secretary, Attorney General's Chambers, the Executive Chairman of PSRC, and the Executive
Administrator of LART. This steering committee was never set up; and, as a result, PSRC and other
executing agencies did not get organized operational guidance that would have facilitated project
implementation.

28.       Insufficient proactivity on the Bank side. The Bank team was not proactive enough. The flaws
in project design did not trigger the necessary restructuring and even implementation modalities provided
for in the DCA such as the Steering Committee were not followed upon enough. In light of the low
disbursement rates and particularly once the PSRC was dismantled and it was clear that the new
administration would take considerable time to devise a new set of privatization policies, it would have
been better to have attempted a restructuring, or failing that, a partial cancellation of Credit funds. On
another score, while it should be recognized that many of the factors leading to the poor set of results (e.g.
utility reforms) are political in nature and could not be easily resolved by the sole assistance this project
could have provided, it also appears the project had not sufficiently prepared PSRC (and subsequently
CHC) to get the expertise required to handle these complex transactions in case they came under stress.

29.      Lack of candor in project reporting. Although the project lagged in the implementation of its
activities, carried a disbursement flag for most of its life in addition to a country record flag, had no
working M&E system, and failed to comply with the legal covenant of quarterly reporting, it was not
labeled as a "problem project" at any point. In fact, it was systematically rated "satisfactory" from the
start of the operation in 2000 until June 2009. The only substantive corrective action taken was the
revision of the disbursement profile (in June 2006) and reallocations among categories. Even a "mid-
term review" carried out in December 2006, more than two years after the expiration of the original
closing date and less than a year before the end of the first closing date extension period, failed to tackle
key issues at hand.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.     As discussed earlier, the M&E design had weaknesses stemming from lack of clarity and
consistency in both the PDO and KPIs. In the log frame, what appears to be the "main objective"
("reallocation of national resources to achieve development goals and improve the quality of goods and
services") should have rather read "Sector-related CAS goals" to which the project would contribute but
not responsible for. However, the KPIs listed in front "Main objective" should have been put in front of
the "Project development objective". The log frame also provided a long list of performance indicators,
thus promising much more than the PDO in the main text would have required.

                                                      6
31.     The project coordination agency ­ PRSC and subsequently CHC­ were to regularly collect
information on the KPIs and any other progress and produce quarterly reports. However, this practice was
never enforced. The only report which was routinely produced by PSRC was an annual review and an
action plan (for the following year) of the privatization program. This annual report had some elements of
information on the regulatory work, but nothing else on the rest of the project.

32.      It should be noted that some regulatory agencies undertook benchmarking exercises, beyond the
standard project M&E framework. EWURA (energy and water multi-regulator) has initiated a
benchmarking exercise, including collecting performance information on access and efficiency gains.
TCAA (the air safety regulator) established benchmarks to gauge its own performance, although less
information is available on the entities it is regulating. TCRA (ICT regulator) has a good grasp of the
sectors it regulates, and notes the decline in prices for ICT services and an increase in quality, with data
available in its annual reporting and on its website. SUMATRA (surface and marine transport regulator)
has been closely monitoring sub-sector performance (e.g. road accidents, vehicular traffic), and the results
have varied.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33.      The project was classified as category C as it was designed to primarily provide institutional
support to the implementation of the divestiture program, debt collection, regulation, and business
environment improvement. However, the PAD indicated that environmental assessments would be
undertaken whenever there would be a need to do so in the context of PE privatization process. In
actuality, no environmental assessment was conducted during project implementation as such a need
never arose.

34.     With respect to social issues, the PAD discussed the need for GOT to define a coherent
retrenchment policy. The project helped GOT, under the PPF, define a retrenchment policy which was
adapted in early 2000, prior to project effectiveness. The policy called for any severance payments
beyond the statutory allowance to be determined based upon a market-based assessment of a retrenchee's
reemployment prospects and anticipated resulting future wage losses. In practice, due to labor unions'
pressures for generous payments based on old precedents, the new policy was never implemented.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.      Project institutional arrangements were altered on a number of occasions during implementation,
notably the phasing out of both the PSRC and the LART whose functions were passed over to the
Consolidated Holding Corporation (CHC). It appears that most of the institutions in place at the time of
its closure can be sustained. Indeed, CHC has its own income stream that guarantees the continuation of
operations until the Government decides to alter or discontinue its operations.

36.      Currently, both the privatization and post-privatization (i.e. contract monitoring, impact
evaluation) functions lie with CHC. Still, uncertainties about the term of CHC continue to exist, even
though issues pertaining to infrastructure reform and privatization will be around for a long period of
time. The number of experts able to handle these issues within CHC remains limited, however, and with
the closing of the PPSRP there is no ongoing mechanism to strengthen and broaden such expertise.

37.     The debt collection component was closed without transforming LART into a private entity as
planned. CHC still handles the collection of a few NPAs, and some private debt collectors have emerged,
but the expected broad capacity development of a private sector debt collection market did not develop.
LART was shut down; and there are no plans for further work on this objective in CHC.

                                                     7
38.      Sector-oriented regulatory agencies are sustainable inasmuch that they have oversight and
authority regarding the regulation of fees. Agencies dealing with competition issues (FCC and FCT) as
well as the TNBC are more dependent on government resources. The four sector-oriented regulatory
institutions established through the course of this project are functioning in a financially sustainable
manner, with operational costs fully funded through license fees and levies: EWURA, TCRA, TCAA,
and SUMATRA. See Table 1 below, Financial Information for Regulatory Agencies Under PPSDP. It
should be noted that EWURA moved from mostly Bank-PPSDP support of 71 percent of operating costs
in 2007 to largely own funding (e.g. license fees) in FY 2008 and 2009. Operating income support from
the Bank-PPSDP for EWURA, FCC and FCT ended in September 2009 and the agencies moved to own-
funding (EWURA) or GOT budget support (FCC and FCT). As stated above, no operating support was
provided to SUMATRA, TCAA and TCRA, although SUMATRA benefited from initial design support
and TCAA benefited from a costing study. Information on the effectiveness and impact of these agencies
is provided in section 3.2.

(re)appointed Tribunal Members, and so is able to hear cases after almost a one-year lapse. Of all of the
six regulatory institutions, only EWURA, FCC and FCT received staff training through the PPSDP.
TCRA, TCAA and SUMATRA did not receive staff training (nor operating cost support for hiring staff)
from the PPSDP. Training was provided in regulatory issues as well as in competition economics.

40.      At the moment, there is no follow-up operation planned this area in the pipeline. However, some
of the activities may be supported under different sector operations as well as under the budgetary support
instrument, the PRSC. For example, the dialogue on the set up of a Public-Private Partnership unit and
possibly its future operation is continued under the Financial Sector Development project. The dialogue
on the role of the state in various infrastructure areas and the operation of the utilities will have to be
sustained in the context of each relevant sector's engagement with the Government, combining all
instruments available.


                                                                 8
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

41.     The relevance of the objectives, design and implementation is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
While the project objectives were relevant to country and global priorities as well as to Bank assistance
strategy from the lending phase throughout the implementation period, both the design and the
implementation were deficient in supporting this relevance.

42.      The project aimed at supporting the Government's strategy to reduce the role of the State in
productive sectors and to promote private sector development. These objectives were also aligned to
objectives set out in the Government's 2005 development strategy ("Mkukuta") as well as to sector
strategies, particularly those pertaining to utilities and infrastructure (e.g. energy, water, communication
and transportation). Clearly, PPSDP appears to be aligned to Tanzania's development priorities insofar
that the deepening of structural reforms initiated in the early 1990s has been the key driver of the
intervention. The decision to engage reforms in large enterprises, particularly in utilities and
infrastructure, was a bold step to help boost Tanzania's competitiveness. On the regulatory front, the
focus "on institutional issues, leaving the design of sector-specific regulatory rules to separate industry-
specific projects, also funded by IDA...(p.22).", was appropriate and reasonable. The collection of banks'
NPAs through LART and the set up of new institutional mechanisms to interface with the private sector
were relevant objectives too.

43.      In addition to the issues of quality at entry, the project documentation did not point to any specific
action that would have engaged the Government to add new enterprises to the list of those "specified" at
the beginning of the project, even though there were important ones that were not specified (see Annex
9). Since the focus was on support the divestiture of the stock of specified enterprises, even those that got
"de-specified" in the course of project implementation did not trigger an active policy dialogue to
eventually engage a new privatization effort. Overall, the devised KPIs could have been more precise.
For example, "80 percent of staff trained" leaves too much room for "box-ticking", and does not
emphasize the quality and type of training to be provided, nor does it indicate or demonstrate the strength
of the organizational and operational capacity of the regulatory institution.

44.      The lack of proactive implementation, particularly during the outer years of project life, adversely
affected the relevance of this project to Tanzania's development priorities. The role of the State in the
economy was not reduced as much as it could have been; and the project's achievement in terms of
institutional capacity building remained limited. On the private sector development front, the dismal
implementation of the policy recommendations reached in the context of the public-private sector
dialogue is an intrinsic limitation to the potential acceleration of the much needed increase in private
investment levels.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

45.     The achievement of the project development objective was unsatisfactory as it had a number of
shortcomings in achieving the development objective, as well as mixed across the different project
components, with unsatisfactory rating for the two one that are at the core of the PDO, namely
privatization and business environment. Annex 1 provides the full set projected and actual


                                                      9
outcome/output performance indicators. While the momentum for state divestiture was maintained during
the project life, the component fell short of achieving all its objectives: (i) stricto sensu (i.e. not taking
into consideration activities pertaining to non-core assets), the numeric transaction targets were not
achieved as privatization activities involved only 87 PEs (a total of 121 transactions, see table in annex
7); (ii) the privatization outcomes were also mixed as discussed below ; and (iii) institutional capacity to
manage privatization matters was not sustainably built. When looking at the second largest component of
the project ­ the Regulatory Component ­ the project was rather successful in achieving the KPIs, even
though the ultimate rating is slightly less favorable for the reasons described in this ICR.

46.      The evaluation of the overall project outcomes achievement is made difficult by the fact that the
choice of indicators in the log frame was deficient and they was no restructuring to revisit them.
Moreover, the various indicators were not informed during the implementation period. While it is hard to
attribute the aggregate economic indicators to this project, there is a fair assumption that it did contribute
somehow to GDP growth and foreign direct investment (FDI) as well as to investment and employment
(see paragraphs on privatization outcomes below).

47.      While the average Tanzanian GDP growth rate was about 6.7 percent during the project
implementation period, the performance cannot be attributed to the project, even though, overall, most
divested companies experienced an output increase after the private sector took over. Regarding foreign
direct investment (FDI), Tanzania's sustained economic reforms involving privatization allowed private
capital to flow into the country at an annual average of US$424 million a year during the period of 2000-
2007 as shown in the table below.

                                Table 2: Foreign Direct Investment, 1997-2007

FDI US$ Mn
Source: Tanzania Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, Economic Survey 2007, p.97.

48.      Total cumulative FDI during the project implementation period for which date is available (2000-
2007) was US$3.4 billion. Although data is not available for 2008 and 2009, assuming the same historic
average, the total cumulative FDI up until end 2009 would be about US$4.2 billion (though it is quite
likely that FDI significantly declined in 2009 due to the crisis). This estimated amount for a ten year
period, and which is not attributable to the project alone, is still below the original target of US$5 billion.

Privatization Component

49.      The outcome of the privatization component is unsatisfactory because of many shortcomings in
the achievement of the development objectives. While privatization contributed to reducing the role of the
State in commercial activities, its expected impact on economic growth remained limited as issues posed
by key sectors such as energy, water, railways, and even insurance remained unresolved. The effort to
introduce private participation in infrastructure was certainly deployed, but most of transactions
unraveled, as discussed below. In the financial sector, the PPSDP helped the privatization of the National
Microfinance Bank, but failed to make progress on the National Insurance Company and Tanzania Posts
Corporation which has financial services. In other areas, most of the divested PEs in which the
Government had a majority shareholding were small companies (e.g. units in agriculture sector such as
tea and rice, small commercial and transport firms), the sale of which had little impact on the economy as
a whole. Although most of the divested PEs that are still in operation have managed to increase their



                                                           10
productivity as measured by revenue per worker, these results seem to be driven more by the large
retrenchments that took place than by revenue gains.

50.      In retrospect, it can be seen that project results, as measured in terms of privatization proceeds,
were somewhat inflated. Both the PSRC and the Bank reports usually combined proceeds of both
divestitures and sale of non-core assets to produce a total figure. In fact, there was a total of 87 PEs
affected by divestiture operations, partial or complete, covering a total of 121 units (see detailed table in
annex 7)2. There was also a sale of about 600 non-core asset items during the PPSDP implementation
period  warehouses, residential houses and motor vehicles, usually disposed of through auctions.
Technically, this sale of items to private owners can be called privatization, but it was small scale and
tangential to the main thrust of the project.

                Source: Compiled from PSRC and CHC annual reports.



51.     Despite some administrative delays, and public outcry over the sale of firms to foreigners, the
privatization of commercial and industrial PEs was mainly completed and handled in an effective manner.
Post-privatization performance in these sectors has generally been satisfactory. Assistance rendered by
the project can claim some of the credit for privatization successes in the tradables and financial sectors.

52.      Reversals in infrastructure reforms and lack of significant service improvement: The
experience of infrastructure privatization was meant to help the private sector and the consumers access
better, more reliable and more affordable infrastructure services. As shown below, most of the attempts
unraveled. This is the largest disappointment in the project. In a report on infrastructure privatization
produced by the Bank in 2005 at the Government's request3, it was noted that by 2003, five key
infrastructure enterprises (TANESCO, power; DAWASA, water; TTCL, telecom; TICTS, the container
terminal; and ATCL, Air Tanzania) had some form of private participation, with some showing

2
 From the original target of privatizing 200 PEs, 87 PEs were affected by any privatization effort under the Project,
34 are under privatization and 56 PEs are still in the Government portfolio. The difference is due to liquidations
handled outside PSRC and CHC.

    Tanzania Infrastructure : Privatization Impact Assessment, July 21, 2005

operational and financial improvements compared to their dilapidated status prior to reforms. At that time,
it was hoped that this process would deliver the expected results (though even then, as the report noted,
the DAWASA lease had been cancelled, the Air Tanzania privatization was in difficulty, and there were
apparent problems in both the TTCL and TANESCO private participation schemes). Private participation
in the railways, TRC, was also being sought. The report highlighted the fact that weak institutional
capacity was a key factor explaining the slow and complex interactions with private operators which
involve drafting, negotiating, monitoring and enforcing contracts.


53.      To summarize:

         ¾ The 2002 Privatization of Air Tanzania (ATCL), much lauded at the time and directly
           assisted by IFC underwent a reversal and re-nationalization in 2006, when the strategic
           partner (South African Airways) departed after a period of significant losses. Efforts since
           then to secure a new private sector strategic investor have not yielded results. The company
           persistently makes losses and its net worth is negative (about TSh 25 billion).
         ¾ Tanzania Railways Ltd (TRL) is a second case of failed privatization. Following a decade of
           Bank-assisted effort to prepare the firm for private participation, a 25 year lease contract was
           finally concluded with an Indian firm, RITES, in 2006. The private operator has not
           succeeded in meeting any of the major performance targets and the Government intends to
           terminate the lease in the near future. Losses continue and the financial burden on
           government is very great.
         ¾ Partial privatization of the Tanzania Telecommunications Company (TTCL) also produced
           poor results. Once again, preparation of the sector for private entry proved long and tortuous.
           A first partial privatization became mired in a dispute over the actual value of the firm. A
           second partial privatization proved equally unsuccessful as the partner, Zain which owns 35
           percent of the shares is not keen to sustain the partnership. The company is currently making
           losses; considerable funding for new investments is needed. With the withdrawal of the
           Canadian firm SASKATEL from its management contract, the Government has retaken the
           management of the company.
         ¾ A lease contract in the water sector with a private consortium was terminated in 2005, after
           only 18 months of operation. Government called the performance bond and cancelled the
           lease, claiming that the private operators were not meeting performance targets nor paying
           the lease fees.4 Subsequently, a public body, DAWASCO, has been running operations.
           However, it has not succeeded in overcoming the operating problems of the firm, and it is
           faced with grave financial pressures stemming from poor revenue collection.
         ¾ The management contract awarded to Net Group Solutions of South Africa in 2002 in
           TANESCO, the electric utility produced significant financial improvements, but was
           nonetheless terminated in 2005 (against the advice of the donors), for reasons more political
           than technical in nature. TANESCO was eventually "despecified" (i.e., removed from the list
           of firms slated for private participation) and is now once again directly run by the
           Government.       Technical and financial performance following the return to public
           management has deteriorated.
         ¾ The private sector became involved in port operations with a lease contract for the container
           terminal to a private operator (TICTS), for a period of 10 years in 2000. Initial results were

  The principal private operators, Bi-Water of the U.K. and Gauff of Germany, sued the GOT in a British
commercial court (for breach of contract) and the International Court for the Resolution of Investment Disputes (for
expropriation of property). It is important to note that both courts ruled in favor of Tanzania, concluding that the
GOT had not acted illegally.

               highly positive. In the first 5 years of TICTS's management, container throughput doubled,
               waiting times declined greatly, and container transshipments increased significantly.
               However, in 2005, the lease was extended for 15 years, and IDA questioned the transparency
               and terms of the extension. Performance declined greatly in the following years, with,
               however, some improvement being seen in the last 12 months as a result of major changes in
               the management of the storage space and the improvement of equipment. It should be noted
               that the parent Tanzania Port Authority (TPA) plays the dual role of landlord and port
               operator (general cargo and some container handling operations). Overall, the operational
               and financial situations in the port as a whole are very poor and widely seen as a major
               obstacle to Tanzanian development5.

54.      At the closing of the project, there were 34 entities, fully or partially controlled by the
Government, which the Consolidated Holding Corporation (CHC)6 was attempting to divest (see annex
8). At the same time, there is a residual PE portfolio of over 50 companies in which the Government has
invested either with majority or minority control as shown in annex 9. Some of these enterprises were not
"specified", i.e. declared subject to restructuring and divestiture by PSRC for purposes of implementation
of the Public Corporations Act 1992, and the Bank did not seek to get them on the list during project
implementation. Noteworthy is also the Government's decision to "despecify" (i.e. take off the list of

Government ownership. However, there was no consultation with the Bank on this course of action.

55.    Results on other aspects pertaining to privatization revenues, investment and employment,
Tanzanian ownership in divested PEs, reduction of the fiscal burden, and institutional capacity were
mixed as discussed below.

56.     Overall net receipts from privatization during the project life were about US$207 million as
shown in the table below. Heavy debts, poor condition of assets after years of mismanagement and
under-investment (cf. DCDM, 2004) and large retrenchment costs claimed a large share of the transaction
revenues.

          The surge in 2006 is related to the sale of 49 percent shares in National Microfinance Bank to
          Rabobank Nederland in September 2005.

57.     Investment and employment: By the end of the 1990s, GOT was generally unable, because of
financial constraints, to make needed repair or expansion investments in its PEs (and in the few cases
where it did these often proved to be wasteful and ineffective). Post-privatization, the new private owners
generally increased investments in divested companies. While data is limited and firms are reluctant to
disclose information, a survey carried out during this ICR preparation showed that ten divested PEs have
invested about US$100 million since 2000. On the employment front, many divested companies were not
operating when the assets were sold to the private sector. Due to overstaffing, retrenchment occurred in
most PEs (85 percent according to a 2004 DCDM report). Despite data limitations, net employment is
however estimated to have increased in only 11 percent of the firms in total.7

58.      The objective of promoting Tanzanian ownership of divested PEs was largely achieved. As
shown in the table in annex 7, this happened through direct sale of PEs (usually the small ones which
were of little interest to international investors) or through the Dar-es-Salaam stock exchange. It is
estimated that, of all firms divested since the beginning of the privatization program, about 66 percent
were sold to Tanzanians, 21 percent were sold to joint-ventures among Tanzanians, foreigners and the
Government, and the remainder (about 13 percent) to foreigners. It has also been observed that PEs sold
to foreign investors and joint ventures between foreign investors, local investors and/or Government, have

operation. A number of Tanzanians have also participated in public offerings by buying shares through
the Dar-es-Salaam Stock Exchange: four out of 121 transactions completed during the period were done
through initial public offering (IPO).

59.      Reduction of the fiscal burden: Overall, the divestiture program allowed the Government to
reduce the fiscal burden of PEs. The privatization program supported by the PPSDP sought to pursue the
effort of stopping the US$ 300 million annual losses and US$ 100 million subsidies, advances and other
recurrent and capital transfers from the Treasury at the beginning of the 1990s. Progress was made
towards the achievement of this objective. Even though there is still a number of PEs getting Government
subsidies, many divested PEs, which were loss-making before, were divested were turned around and are
now paying taxes instead. As shown in the table below, net fiscal effect of PEs has shifted from a
negative net outflow of US$ 100 a year in subsidies before the project to annual net revenue of US$234
million in 2008.

60.      The above 2008 data is based on information about companies that have paid more than TSh. 1
billion in taxes during the period of 2005-2009, from which it is estimated that the 13 largest tax payers
generated US$1.4 billion in government revenues over a period of 5 years, representing an average of
US$275 million per year. On the other hand however, the Treasury paid in 2008 the equivalent of US$41
million to 13 PEs that cannot meet their debt obligations and/or require recapitalization.

61.     Lack of adequate capacity and institutional arrangements to handle complex privatization,
post-privatization and public-private partnership issues. The plan of project designers was that the
PSRC would complete the divestiture of firms on the privatization list and then transition into a post-
privatization monitoring and evaluation unit, with capabilities to handle PPP transactions. Instead, PSRC
was simply terminated. CHC took over PSRC's mandate and is attempting to manage the issues as they
arise  but its expertise is limited, and only a limited number (two senior staff) of the relatively
experienced PSRC staff were taken on by CHC. The process of creating a PPP Unit has not yet made
meaningful progress. This is a serious obstacle to the prospect of sustaining what modest institutional
progress was achieved under this project.

Debt Collection Component

62.      The debt collection component is rated as moderately satisfactory. This component was
intended to strengthen repayment discipline in Tanzania's banking system through (i) expedited
collections from defaulters on non-performing assets of public sector banks; and (ii) expansion of
Tanzania's fledgling private market capacity for debt collection through the transfer of LART, in the
medium term, to the private sector.

63.     In relation to this latter option, consideration was given at the time of the PAD to the alternative
of privatizing Loans and Advances Realization Trust (LART). However, this suggestion was rejected as
it would have disrupted LART's ongoing collection efforts, in a context in which alternative equally
effective debt collection services in the private sector had yet to be established, and where the regular

court system lacked the capacity to handle such cases as expeditiously as the Tribunal. LART handled
NBC NPAs as well as liquidation of non viable PEs. The good performance observed under the PPSRP
was sustained and most of the unencumbered debts were collected in a timely manner. Although the
future options study recommended that LART be privatized for reasons which are unknown the
Government declined to accept this recommendation. By the time of its phasing out in June 2006, LART
officials were still expecting the Government to extend its mandate.

64.     The component was quite successful until its closing in September 2007, which had been
preceded by the GOT's decision to end the mandate of the Loans and Advances Realization Trust in June
2006, with a transfer of the residual activities to CHC. LART recovered 80.7 percent of non-performing
assets amounting to TShs 21.8 billion - a very satisfactory result by international debt collection
standards. Although LART did not achieve the project target figure of 90 percent, in hindsight that target
was probably unreasonably ambitious. However, once LART ceased to exist, outstanding debt collection
cases fell into a legal limbo, and dismal progress was made under CHC. This detracts from the overall
success of the past performance of this component. LART was not privatized, the LART Tribunal was
not merged into the Commercial Court system that was developed in the early 2000s and the project did
not directly result in the development of a private debt collection industry. While this component
performance can be criticized, it is difficult, however, to assert that LART's recovery rate might have
been higher had any or all of these three measures been taken.

Infrastructure Regulation Component

65.      With respect to utility regulation, the performance of the project in relation to the two original
PDO was moderately satisfactory. Performance of the project on the PDO varies greatly depending on
the regulatory institution in question, ranging from highly satisfactory in the case of EWURA, to non-
existent involvement in relation to TCRA, to mediocre performance in relation to the FCC and FCT in the
last two years of the project when strong implementation support was most needed vis-à-vis these two
competition authorities. The above rating is supported by the actual project achievements under this
component as well as the long time required to implement the project against its design objectives
("efficiency" in relation to achievement of PDO) taking into consideration the total five-year extension.

66.     Due to the delayed enacting of the legislation, regulatory agencies were made officially effective
well into the project, in some cases, only after the first extension in 2004 as shown in Table 5 below.
These delays have partially contributed to the rating attributed to this component, although the KPIs were
achieved.

67.     Although the KPI were met in relation to the TCRA, TCAA, and SUMATRA, the PPSDP project
cannot take much credit for strong performance vis-à-vis the PDO for the regulators  to whom the
project gave very little (e.g. TCAA, SUMATRA) or no support (e.g. TCRA).

68.      It could be argued that TCRA, TCAA and SUMATRA did not need as much support since they
were able to build on the more solid backgrounds (staffing, management, mandates) that existed before
the PPSDP came into force. However, in that case, the extension of the project in 2007 should not have
continued to purport to work with them, for example, requesting training/capacity plans from all six
authorities, to which TCAA and SUMATRA did respond. Further, there are areas, such as in training and
benchmarking of regulated entities, that could have used additional support, as was indicated by the
November 2007 Aide Memoire.

69.      EWURA, FCC and FCT are the three regulatory entities that received the most support from the
project, in particular their initial start up costs (e.g. office space, computers), operating costs including
salaries, and training. The amounts varied from 30 percent of EWURA's operating costs in the initial
years of operation, to 90 percent for FCT. Therefore, the fact that these authorities are now established,
up and running with well-qualified staff can in large part be attributed to the PPSDP. Regulations have
been developed, rules and guidelines published, and cases/appeals and tariff applications have been heard,
often in a speedy manner, mostly within 18 months.

70.      EWURA is now often cited as an example of a strong multi-sector regulatory agency in SSA.
EWURA is doubly challenged with the regulation of both public and private utilities, and so far is
handling this adeptly, meeting the KPI for the project, including those proposed in the extension log-
frame which were not formally adopted. EWURA was also financially sustainable by the close of the
project ­ a highly satisfactory achievement given that the regulator was not effectively in place until
2005. In terms of impact on sector performance by EWURA, it is much too early to attribute a trend in
improved performance to the regulatory success of EWURA. Many of the regulated entities have not yet
completed a full regulatory cycle of tariff reviews and comparative competition which is then followed by
a period of performance that can been fully monitored and benchmarked. EWURA is gathering data on
access to basic services, as well as efficiency gains achieved by the regulated entities. Another potential
gauge of regulatory success (by providing a stable and consistent regulatory environment) could be the
demonstrable interest of the private sector to take risk and engage, for example through management
contracts, concessions or other PPP arrangements. But since EWURA was established, there has not been
a concerted effort to tender for extensive private sector involvement in the water or energy sector;
therefore, this litmus test cannot yet be applied. However, the project did support EWURA in the
establishment of a framework for the development of small power projects, including the development of
a standardized small power purchase agreement, which is expected to pave the way for more investment
in generation.

71.      Rules appear generally clear and consistent. Regulated entities have noted that there is some
method in the regulatory processes that did not exist before, providing advantages (e.g. on predictability).
Notably several water utilities are not satisfied with EWURA's performance, and do not feel they can
maintain their systems without more financial support. It is expected, however, that there will be tension
between a regulated entity and the regulator, and therefore some dissatisfaction expressed is not
necessarily a cause for concern. In the case of electricity, satisfaction is higher, and EWURA is seen to
protect customers and "investors"/operators.

72.     FCC and FCT were the two other regulatory/competition entities that received substantial support
from the PPSDP. From 2006/7, FCC started to receive operational income from the project to hire
qualified staff, secure office space and furniture and develop material for dissemination and rule making.
FCT received such support at a slightly later date. Both entities can be seen, as in the case of several of

                                                     17
the Tanzanian regulatory authorities discussed here, at the forefront of regulation and competition for Sub
Saharan Africa. Consistent rules have been established, and cases have been managed within the required
18 month period ­ often well before hand ­ except after FCT's Member appointments lapsed in late 2008.
Training was also provided through the PPSDP, but often in a much delayed manner when such training
required Bank prior approval. Both entities complained in ICR interviews that training provided was
often regulatory in nature, as opposed to competition oriented. Competition-oriented training was
provided to FCC and FCT in June 2009 prior to project close.

73.     Senior appointments have not always been made sufficiently expeditiously by Government: for
example, in the case of FCT, after appointments had expired in 2008, Tribunal Members were not
appointed or reinstated until early 2010. This lead to a lapse in the ability of the FCT to hear cases. In
terms of financial sustainability, these agencies do not have sectors from which to levy license fees as is
for other regulators, and so rely on annual decisions from Government regarding their funding. The 2008
Finance Act eliminated the 2.5 percent of business licensing fees that were funding the FCC in a more
predictable manner, and the Government replaced that fee with an annual Government budget allocation.

Business Environment Component

74.       The outcomes of the fourth component pertaining to business environment are unsatisfactory.
This component was intended to provide assistance as follows: (i) establishment and operation of a
consultative body for discussion, consideration and addressing constraints to investment, employment,
output, exports and competitiveness of the private sector; (ii) design and implementation of a public
awareness and communication program about the issues to be dealt with by the consultative body; and
(iii) strengthen the capacity of the consultative body to carry out its mandate through training, advisory
services, and technical studies.

75.     Under this component, efforts were made to facilitate removing impediments to domestic and
foreign private investment. An innovative public-private sector dialogue mechanism in the form of a
"Presidential Investor Council", known as Tanzania National Business Council (TNBC) was set up in
20028. The Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF) participated in the design of TNBC. Between
2002-2009, TNBC has organized seven International Investors Roundtables and three Local Investors
Roundtables.

76.     Through eight working groups, TNBC's work has expanded from business regulatory issues (e.g.
business licensing and registration, Doing Business Indicators), governance and legal sector reforms, to
sector-specific issues (e.g. agriculture and ICT). The Roundtables have helped sustain a much needed
dialogue between the public and the private sector on issues that matter for private sector-led growth.
Pro-business policies, strategies and regulations have been developed. However, results remain below
expectations as a "big push" to improve the business environment has not happened. For example,
Tanzania's ranking on the Doing Business comparative table did not improve for many years; and, in the
latest Doing Business Report (2010), it slipped from 126 to 131 out of 183 economies. The Report states
that no single reform was completed in the period under review (May 08-May 09), despite the support
available from the ongoing Private Sector Competitiveness Project since 2007.


8
  Tanzania was, along with Ghana and Senegal, one of the three countries that pioneered the mechanism consisting
of putting together a forum, under the chairmanship of the Head of State, of Government officials, domestic private
sector actors, and international private sector (both invested and not invested) representatives to discuss issues that
would foster the acceleration of private sector development and investment. Other counties eventually followed (e.g.
Uganda, Mali, Benin, Mauritania, Burkina Faso).


                                                          18
77.     Capacity building in this component was supported by the PPSDP which extended over US$0.5
million for the salaries of three key staff, training and to cover the costs of the Roundtables. TNBC is
decentralizing to ensure national coverage; and the Government has started funding the institution from
its own budget. However, budgetary constraints are likely to slow down the pace of work plans
implementation. Accomplishments under this component are modest, at best.

3.3 Efficiency

78.     Project efficiency is rated moderately unsatisfactory, considering that the performance could
have been much higher, should implementation have been properly managed. Considering the technical
assistance nature of the project, there was no economic analysis carried out. Indeed, many of the most
important economic benefits are indirect and difficult to impute with accuracy. There was simply a
discussion of the various types of benefits to which the project would contribute. No net present value
(NPV) was calculated because it was infeasible.

79.      Project efficiency can be looked at by comparing the resources spent with the results achieved.
The project disbursed SDR 25.5 million (US$36.3 million equivalent), and the activities financed allowed
financial returns in the areas of privatization, debt collection and foreign direct investment. Privatization
allowed the government to reduce substantially the fiscal burden as divested PEs that were viable or have
been turned around since are generating revenues for the Government; net privatization proceeds were
about US$ 207 million; and there was some increase in firm productivity. The debt collection effort
allowed a recovery of about US$14.2 million for a cost of about US$4.36 million. Cumulative FDI during
the implementation period exceeded US$4 billion over a period of ten years (as opposed to US$5 billion
in five years), not even considering the issue of attribution. On all these fronts however, the performance
could have been higher if (i) the flaws of project design had been readily addressed through a
restructuring and (ii) implementation had benefitted from collaboration between the Bank and the
Government at all stages.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory

80.      The project overall rating is unsatisfactory. Although the project was relevant to the country's
needs and to the Bank's assistance strategy, the overall performance during the ten year implementation
period was uneven, and it declined substantially following the second extension of the closing date.
Policy dialogue on issues such as infrastructure reforms, a public-private partnership unit, a competitive
debt market, and investment climate reforms, was not carried out in a sustained manner. The pace of
efforts to deliver the defined outputs declined steadily during the later years of the project. The problems
of the project were sufficiently serious and sufficiently evident that restructuring should have been
attempted. This step was, evidently, never considered even though the project was not disbursing
properly, never managed to shift from transaction-based to report-based disbursements, capacity building
efforts and communication campaigns remained rather shallow, and a substantial amount of resources
remained unused at the closing of the project. Although the project managed to produce some positive
outputs, it failed to achieve its more important objectives in the area of infrastructure reforms.

81.      Had the project been closed in September 2007 (at the end of the first extension), performance
might have been better rated. That is, almost no progress of substance took place during the second two
year-extension period in the areas of infrastructure reforms and investment climate activity; an
opportunity was missed to address these key strategic issues and provide effective implementation
support.



                                                     19
82.      The extension of the project in 2007 did benefit the regulatory component. Because of the initial
delays in creating the regulatory institutions and making them effective, operating support from the
project had not yet been fully (and in some cases hardly) disbursed to the entities. The operating income
support proved critical to the establishment of well staffed and equipped agencies (Table 1). Had the
project closed in September 2007, the regulatory component would surely have received an unsatisfactory
rating. Unfortunately, even in this component the implementation support provided in the 2007-2009
period cannot be highly rated since the executing entities could wait for months before receiving
appropriate approval from the Bank to train and equip staff. This indicates that bureaucratic delays and
inaction were not always limited to the borrower, but were problem within the World Bank after the
change of TTL in 2007.



3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

83.   The project had no specific poverty, gender or social development aspects. The impact on
consumers and the issue of retrenchment are discussed in the relevant sections.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

84.     The project's contribution to institutional change/strengthening was uneven, tending towards
weak. In the area of privatization, the expertise built over time to handle privatization transactions has
been mostly lost with the disbanding of the PSRC. Only two senior staff from the previous team is still
with the PSRC successor, CHC.

85.     In the area of regulation, staffs were trained, albeit over a short period, given the late
operationalization of the component, compounded by the slow Bank response during the last two years of
project life. However, all agencies are likely to continue their operations, though they need capacity
strengthening.

86.      With respect to the debt collection activity, the original objective of converting LART into a
private sector debt collection entity was not achieved. Instead, LART's legal mandate was allowed to
lapse in June 2006, despite a Bank Aide-Memoire of 2005 which recommended (i) an extension of the
LART mandate for 12 months; and (ii) that LART be encouraged to submit a recommendation on its
future status to the Minister of Finance together with a draft Cabinet paper and a draft Resolution for the
National Assembly. As no action was taken on the above recommendations, by process of law, the LART
Act expired on June 30, 2006. As a consequence, a number of cases were left in limbo. CHC did take over
the debt collection role, but it lacked the ability to operate as effectively as LART. The idea of
developing a competitive private debt collection market is no longer being considered as such a market
has arisen as a result of the general growth in commercial activity over the past few years. The status of
the remaining uncollected debts is not known.

87.     Little was done to promote the business environment. There is now an institution in charge of
public-private sector dialogue that reports to the Prime Minister's Office. It appears, however, that its
resources are limited and that it is largely inactive.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)



                                                    20
88.      Even though most of the transactions (one management contract, two partial sales and three
leases) dealing with private sector participation in infrastructure were reversed or came under stress, some
benefits did emerge from the process. They include:

        (a) changes made to the market structure by separating asset-holding authorities from operating
            companies have established some checks and balances in the respective sectors;
        (b) the introduction of regulators has improved the operation of the respective sectors and
            increased consumer protection; and
        (c) there is a sense that, despite past problems, private sector involvement in these sectors should
            be sought in the future. As the responsible Minister said at the time of the cancellation of the
            water lease, "This is a contract failure; not a concept failure." Private operators are still being
            sought in air transport, water and telecommunications.

89.     The regulatory component has established what are likely to be lasting institutions that can help
support further sector reform, including privatizations when appropriate, and should help bring increased
efficiency and build increasing confidence in Tanzania as a country in which to invest stability and
consistency.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

90.      A stakeholder workshop was undertaken during the preparation of this ICR. Stakeholders
indicated that the project was a very useful support tool for the implementation of Tanzania's private
sector development strategy. Through its assistance to the privatization program and the public-private
sector dialogue, the project helped the public understand the respective roles of the Government and the
private sector. The support provided to various institutions, particularly the set up and the capacity
building of regulatory agencies is considered as very beneficial. However, the stakeholders were very
critical of the weak support received from the Bank during the last two years of project implementation
after the change of the TTL in 2007.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

91.      The risk to development outcome is rated moderate because there is a good likelihood that most
of the development outcomes will be maintained. Even though privatization reversals have occurred in
infrastructure sectors, it is also clear that privatization in other sectors is no longer questioned. Utility
regulation and competition enforcement should remain as well, notwithstanding challenges pertaining to
capacity and financial resources in some cases. The effectiveness of the public-private sector dialogue
mechanisms hinge on future leadership on both sides, but can hardly be weakening than at present.

92.      Though the PPSDP was highly relevant, there were significant shortcomings in the achievement
of its development objectives and in its efficiency. The trend of good performance toward the
achievement of the development objective was satisfactory during the first few years of project
implementation during which most of the transactions producing private participation in infrastructure
were achieved. As noted repeatedly, after 2005 most of these experienced severe problems.
Subsequently, the institutions that could have helped manage the complex transactions and assisted in
finding solutions to troubled infrastructure contracts and post-privatization problems and debt collection
issues, namely PSRC and LART, were closed. The successor CHC took over the mandates but the skills
and systems built over time were lost; and there is currently a major need for capacity building within the
Tanzanian Government to handle the critical issues at hand. In order to address the most pressing
constraints to private sector development, the availability, cost and reliability of infrastructure services
must be addressed, and this will require reforms in the various utilities.

                                                     21
93.      This project contributed to a changed perception of the role of the Government in the Tanzanian
economy over the last decade. The state now leaves most commercial activities to the private sector; and,
there are lasting reforms even in infrastructure sectors where the Government had to retake a direct role
again after an attempt to involve the private sector in their operation. Moreover, notwithstanding severe
capacity challenges and the complexity of public-private partnerships in infrastructure, the Government is
still designing a policy that would involve the private sector in the management of these issues in the
future. The public-private sector dialogue is an ongoing process, slow and with many reverses, that will
need to be associated with a robust implementation mechanism to ensure that recommendations translate
into changes that encourage private investment policy.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

94.     Although project preparation and quality at entry benefitted from the implementation experience
of the PPSRP, there were several shortcomings. The project's strategic approach and content were
relevant to both the country's priorities and the Bank's assistance to GOT; but the formulation of the PDO
remained unclear and the selection of KPIs should have been focused on those that could be easily
measured and legitimately attributed to the project. The log frame had a poor quality baseline. While
implementation arrangements, fiduciary aspects and risk assessment were broadly adequate, an effort
could have been deployed to ensure that critical actions (e.g. appointment of the Steering Committee,
adoption of the quarterly report format). Many operational aspects could have been better defined,
particularly in the area of privatization and regulation.

95.      The privatization component did not consider the complexity of a new phase of privatization
entailing utilities so as to build capacity and institutions accordingly; and the set up of regulatory
institutions should have been planned to occur early enough during project implementation to increase the
chances of private sector participation in infrastructure. Planning should also have properly taken into
account the amount of time that can be required to make any sweeping reforms in sensitive sectors that
require extensive Government ownership and support. Risk mitigation measures should have been more
forcefully defined in the project design as well with respect to infrastructure reform, particularly in light
of the East Asia crisis that had just started when the project was being designed.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Unsatisfactory

96.      Supervision effort was well deployed during the initial years of the project, but declined during
the two periods of project extension of the closing date. Although progress in the implementation of
major project activities was not on schedule, which translated into large disbursement lags, some legal
covenants were not met (e.g. no steering committee, no quarterly reports), Bank's supervision reports
remained over-optimistic with satisfactory ratings. Had supervision reports been more accurate in
flagging the problems, corrective actions might have been taken while there was still time to fix this
effort. The fact that supervision was carried out from the field since 2005, i.e. at the beginning of the first
project extension, should have helped improve substantially the Bank's supervision performance.
However, this opportunity was missed since (i) key problems affecting the project performance could
have been more squarely addressed (e.g. stepped up dialogue on infrastructure reforms, restructuring,
improved M&E and reporting); and (ii) the management of the second extension period was particularly

                                                      22
deficient. On the contrary, it is during that period that there were reversals, "de-specification", undesirable
changes in implementation arrangements, etc., and it is not clear how much the Bank attempted to advise
in those processes.

97.     Although the respective project teams regularly reported on implementation progress, the focus
on development impact could have been sharpened. For example, the same amount of effort deployed to
inform the impact of privatization in infrastructure in 2005 could have been applied to other aspects of the
project as well. In some instances, ISRs were simply updated every six months so as to meet the regional
reporting requirements, without field visits (e.g. second semester of 2005 and from September 2007 to
May 2009).

98.      Management's comments on project status reports (PSRs)/implementation status and results
reports (ISRs) were not systematically taken into account. For example, comments on the June 2005 ISR
recommended the team to (i) provide support to the GOT to take the infrastructure privatization impact
assessment study on board, (ii) prepare an issues paper prior to the September mission, and (iii) provide
systematic information on project performance and actions required. No action was forcefully taken on
any front. Infrastructure contracts continued to unravel; no position paper was prepared to flesh out the
issues and eventually revisit the project design; and information on project performance remained partial.
From 2006 onwards, Management flagged the need to take action to ensure a faster disbursement pace
and avoid cancellation of funds, but little was done. While the second extension was necessary to support
the nascent regulatory entities, the Bank should have engaged the Government to be more focused on that
component and then provide the required intensive implementation support. On the latter front however,
the team leadership's presence in the field did not result in intensified interactions with the client and
reporting, and, as mentioned above, there were long periods of time without any supervision.

99.      The lack of periodic reports from the Borrower made it difficult to establish whether (i) there was
consistency between funds disbursed and project's implementation progress, particularly on critical
activities, and (iii) budgeted costs were being executed as planned and on schedule. Ratings were
consistently overoptimistic, and Management questioned the candor of the ratings particularly in 2007
and 2008. It was only in 2009, a few months before the project closing that the team better aligned the
project ratings with the observed performance, downgrading the project to marginally unsatisfactory.
Moreover, the project team failed to make a necessary Credit Agreement amendment requested by the
Borrower in early 2008 to replace PSRC with CHC as the implementing agency and this amendment
occurred only in July 2009. This was a very weak supervision performance on the part of the Bank.

100.    On the financial management front, issues were well addressed throughout the project life.
Financial accounting, reporting, disbursement and external auditing arrangements for the project worked
normally throughout. However, it had been agreed during project negotiations in 1999 that action would
be taken swiftly to shift to project management report (PMR)-based disbursements system by end June
2001. However, the project never shifted to a PMR9-based disbursement. The only attempt to do so, in
late 2002, was unsuccessful because the executing agency failed to prove that the Government's
contribution to project costs was being adequately made and accounted for. Later, even though the issue
of counterpart funding was resolved, PSRC decided not to shift to PMR-based disbursement and to
continue with statement of expenditures. Should the project have migrated to PMR-based disbursements,
it would have eventually migrated to the Financial Management Report (FMR)-based disbursements
when they were introduced by the Bank. Annual financial statement reports were prepared annually for
external audits which were performed always on schedule by the National Audit Office (NAO). Overall,
the Bank team should have encouraged and provided support to the executing agency to submit PMRs.
9
    Project Management Reports (PMR) changed to Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) in 2002.


                                                      23
101.     The procurement function during the project life covered two main categories of consultancy
services and equipment (goods). Other categories of the project included training, and incremental
operating costs. Major part of the project constituted of consultancy services since the project supported
institutional reforms and capacity building in privatization, banking restructuring, and utilities' regulation.

102.    Major delays were observed in the issuance of no-objections by the Bank, particularly during the
last two years of project life, which caused slippages in implementation and slowed down the
disbursement pace. Moreover, the Bank could have been more proactive in settling the change with
executing agency once PSRC had been terminated and the Government introduced a formal request.
Considering the above series of shortcomings, Bank's overall quality of supervision is rated
unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

103.     The shortcomings observed during project supervision were severe enough to trump the relatively
good quality of project design and early implementation efforts. Threats that were noticeable and
occasionally flagged by management remained unaddressed; and this translated into a deterioration of the
project's performance. In 2007, two components were closed on the ground that they had achieved their
development objectives: debt collection and business environment. As this report shows, the judgment
that the objectives had been achieved was questionable. More proactive actions could have and should
have been attempted, particularly those focusing on strengthening the foundations for public-private
partnerships in infrastructure.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

104.     The Borrower's contribution to project preparation was initially of satisfactory quality, based on
the fact that the track record in key areas covered by the project (privatization and debt collection) was
sufficient to justify a follow up operation. At first, key executing agencies (PSRC and LART) were
performing well even though there were delays in meeting some of the operational requirements such as
the production of quarterly and annual reports covering all aspects of the project. Actions required for
project preparation and effectiveness (e.g. formulation of the privatization program scope, development of
a retrenchment policy, etc.) were taken in a timely manner, but the momentum declined as
implementation proceeded, particularly during the two consecutive extension periods.

105.     Noteworthy shortcomings in Government performance that hindered the achievement of project
outcomes include: (i) the spate of problems in the contracts with private sector operators in various
infrastructure areas; (ii) lack of transparency in the extension of the concession contract for the container
terminal of the Dar-es-Salaam port; (iii) the termination of LART and LART Tribunal which left a
number of cases in limbo; (iv) the failure to set up a Steering Committee; (v) the termination of PSRC in
2007 (while what had been recommended was the transformation of its mandate to better manage post-
privatization issues and PPP transactions); (vi) the delays in passing the legislation and making the
regulatory agencies operational; and (vii) the repeated delays in appointing FCT staff. Some legal
covenants (e.g. Steering Committee to oversee the supervision of the project, quarterly project
management reports) were not complied with.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

                                                      24
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

106.     The overall project coordination and the implementation of the privatization component were
under PSRC's responsibility from the preparation phase until end 2007 when the responsibility was
transferred to CHC. Debt collection was implemented by LART and LART Tribunal until June 2006. The
regulatory component was implemented by the various regulatory agencies as well as by FCC and FCT;
and the business environment component was implemented by the Tanzania National Business Council.

107.     According to the various aide-memoires and PSRs/ISRs, implementing agencies performed
reasonably well on most of the project activities, particularly during the first phase of project
implementation. By 2005, the overall project performance was positive and there was a legitimate sense
that the project development objective was being achieved. However, there were also several weaknesses
that limited implementation success and swift achievement of development objective: (i)
beneficiary/stakeholder consultations and involvement remained rather limited, even though there was a
communication function built in the project design; (ii) the executing agencies failed to submit periodic
project reports; (iii) the plan to shift to a PMR-based disbursement mechanism was not implemented as
agreed upon with the Bank; (iv) although PSRC reported on privatization progress and the LART on debt
collection in their respective annual reports, there was no reporting on the project's log frame by way of
monitoring and evaluation.

108.    The change of executing agencies that occurred at the end of LART and LART's Tribunal in June
2006, and of PSRC in December 2007, led to the transfer of the respective responsibilities to CHC. This
new agency had not been prepared to fulfill this dual role. The administrative change had an important
disruptive impact on project performance. The issue of weak capacity coincided with a deterioration in
the intensity and quality of Bank implementation support during the two last years of the project, and
performance suffered. As a result, many of the targets that were set for the second and last extension of
the closing date were not achieved. Nevertheless, progress made during that period should be credited
essentially to CHC and the regulatory agencies.

109.     On the fiduciary front, the overall assessment of the PSRC's and CHC's performance with regard
to the implementation of the procurement function was considered as moderately satisfactory. Some
procurement issues arose during implementation: (i) inadequate procurement planning whereby most of
the procurement plans were overly ambitious in terms of the number of activities proposed in a financial
year, and the plans were also prepared late; inadequate preparation of the individual annual work plans
and budget by the various beneficiary entities (LART, EWURA, FCC, FCT, TCAA, etc); (ii) inadequate
filing and record keeping and in some cases not all procurement documents of a specific contract are kept
in the same file; (iii) slow procurement implementation with activities lagging behind original planned
dates; and (iv) procurement sections not adequately staffed for efficient implementation. In the area of
financial management, the executing agencies performed their work satisfactorily, even though they did
not embark on PMR-based disbursement arrangements as initially planned.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

110.    The overall Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Like the Bank, it
generally performed relatively well in the first implementation phase, but it failed to make decisions and
appointments in a timely manner, leading to delays and difficulties. In spite of the adoption of a "fast
track procedure", the time between the conclusion of the bidding process and the signing of the sale
contract remained too long (over a year on average). Moreover, multiple changes in Government
(oversight Ministry and 2005 elections) and in implementation arrangements (end of both LART and


                                                   25
PSRC, and hand-over to CHC) broke periodically the implementation momentum. Quarterly reports on
project performance were not submitted and there was no M&E system in place.

6. Lessons Learned
113.     Realism in setting performance targets is key to achieving results in weak capacity contexts. In
the areas of privatization (infrastructure in particular) and regulation, it would have helped to recognize
politically sensitive sectors and topics that would take time and more high level Bank and development
partner dialogue with the Government, and set less ambitious/more realistic timetable for the completion
of infrastructure reform as well as the creation and strengthening of regulatory/competition agencies.
114.     Specificity in project design is essential to facilitate implementation. More specificity and
consistency between the broader project design discussion (e.g. importance of awareness-raising,
relationship of PPSDP to other Bank and sector initiatives) with KPIs and implementation plans would
have generated more commitment on the executing agencies.
115.    Systematic and candid reporting on project performance should be required from the Borrower
and the Bank task team should be required by management to maintain a systematic follow up and
support mechanism. In the case of this project, reports were mostly limited to outputs pertaining to
privatization transactions and NPAs recovered and very little attention was paid to outcome aspects.
Although recommendations made by management in some PSRs/ISRs were often not taken on board,
more realistic project rating should have been required earlier than at the end so as to trigger timely
corrective actions.
116.     Intensity of implementation support with the right expertise and resources is key to project
implementation success and achievement of development objectives. In the case of PPSDP, the less the
supervision effort, during the extension periods, the more the project performance deteriorated. In some
instances, the location of the team leadership in the field did not translate into more effective and
sustained interaction with the client.
117.     Timely project restructuring represents an opportunity to revamp project design and
implementation which was missed in the case of this project, in spite of obvious design shortcomings and
difficulties to report on the project's outputs and outcomes.
118.    Sustained Borrower's commitment rather than on the length of project implementation is
essential to the achievement of development objectives. The more the life of this project increased, the
more adversely the positive results of the early years were affected. The existence of a large undisbursed
balance until the ultimate closing of the project invited the Government to continue requesting the
extension of the closing date even though the infrastructure for successful implementation had been
weakened.
119.     Due diligence in privatization processes is essential to make sure the Borrower gets the right
private sector partner in a privatization transaction. There is a critical need to do thorough checks on the
solidity of any financial commitments in the bid, and to have a full understanding of the structure of
consortia and the corporate strategy of the different partners in each consortium. If this had been done
systematically, there are some contractual arrangements that would not have ended up failing. This due
diligence is also needed to get the best out of transaction advisors.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

   (a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower, through CHC, reviewed and provided comments on Bank's draft ICR. The following key
points were made: (i) The termination of both LART and PSRC occurred at the end of their legal
existence, and CHC was identified as capable of taking over the respective roles; (ii) CHC integrated a
small number of experienced PSRC staff because of the diminishing privatization activities; (iii) the issue
of PPP Unit is currently being handled by the Prime Minister's Office, and a policy has been approved.

   (b) Cofinanciers

        There were no cofinanciers.

   (c) Other partners and stakeholders
        (e.g. NGOs/private sector/civil society)

  Original cost table assumed funding from both the Government and other donors. Since there was no
agreed upon co-financing arrangements, very little of the expected other donors' funding of project
activities did not materialize. Only the United Kingdom's Department for International Development
(DFID) supported the project's communication activities for about US$600,000.

  The Bank disbursed the equivalent of SDR 25.5 million and canceled SDR 7.8 million after the project
closing date. The exchange rate applied is SDR 1 = US$ 1.5

In addition to the above, it is worthwhile to note that privatization procedures and approval process were streamlined already during the first
year of project implementation (2000). During the same period, a retrenchment policy was developed, even though implementation never
followed. Over the years, privatization strategies were developed and implemented for various utilities as well as the necessary legislation
required to set up regulatory mechanisms. However, capacity to handle complex privatization transactions, with will be required for any future
infrastructure reform, is still lacking.

                         Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


1.      A stakeholder workshop was held during the preparation of this ICR. While the overall
assessment is that the project was very useful to make inroads in the implementation of Tanzania's private
sector development strategy, there is also a marked sense that the project could have achieved much more,
should the design have paid attention to a number of issues and, more importantly, should implementation
have been more client-oriented and sought to address some important issues including the set up of an
adequate monitoring and evaluation system.

2.      On the privatization front, the project was instrumental in supporting the reduction of the
Government's role in commercial activities and expanding the role of the private sector. As a result, the
Government can now continue implementing its residual privatization program without much resistance
from the general opinion.

3.       The implementation of the privatization program over the last decade with the support of the
project has allowed the Government to reap fiscal benefits consisting in lower subsidies, lower investment
expenditures in areas where divestiture occurred and higher tax revenues generated more vibrant private
firms. On the other hand, the private sector has received new investment opportunities created by the
divestiture program, and a culture of competition has been initiated. However, results were mixed on the
competitiveness front as private participation experiences in several infrastructure areas failed. Therefore,
the expected improvements in the quality and cost of goods and services, including electricity, water,
telecommunications, transportation and shipment (e.g. railways and ports services) did not materialize.

4.     On the institutional front, the workshop underscored that neither LART nor PSRC were
disbanded. Their legal term had expired and the Government decided not to extend them. In both cases, it
was considered that CHC could take over the outstanding tasks; and that is what is in place today.

5.      With respect to regulation, the stakeholders indicated that the support in the set up of regulatory
agencies and their capacity building was instrumental. However, results could have been more important
if implementation support had not been deficient during final years of the project life, a time when more
proactive support to capacity building efforts was needed.

6.       The project impact on the consumers is not clearly identifiable. There is little information on
whether there is increased access to products and services at more affordable prices induced by increased
competition or not. However, the new institutions including the regulatory agencies and FCC are engaged
in the prevention from the misuse of monopoly power.

        (i)     Continue the institutional support to the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC)
                which was established in 1992 to prepare and implement public enterprise restructuring and
                privatisation;

        (ii)    Continue the support to the Loans and Advances Realisation Trust (LART) created in1991
                to collect non-performing assets (NPAs) of state owned banks; convert LART into a private
                debt collection company and the LART Tribunal into a commercial court;

        (iii)   Design and establish an institutional framework to regulate infrastructure and utilities
                (transport, telecommunications, water, electricity, ports, railways and airports etc); and

        (iv)    Create an independent platform where the Government and the private sector can
                dialogue/consult to remove regulatory and business environment bottlenecks to local and
                foreign private investment.


2.0     INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT TO PSRC

         2.1    Privatisation Component

                The privatisation component of PPSDP sought to continue institutional support to PSRC to
                complete about 200 divestiture transactions by December, 2004.

                Since PSRC could not finish the job at hand by the given deadline of 31st December, 2004.
                Parliament extended the Project and PSRC's tenure for another three years, ending
                December 2007. However by June, 2007 it was obvious that PSRC would not complete the
                divesture of the remaining 37 entities still on its register. So on 15th November, 2007
                Parliament amended the Public Corporations Act 1992 and the National Bank of
                Commerce (Re-organisation and Vesting of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1996 to transfer all
                the residual functions of PSRC to Consolidated Holding Corporation (CHC). PSRC's legal
                tenure expired on December 31st 2007.

                                                      72
             The move empowered CHC, like PSRC before it, to undertake all divestiture tasks. Section
             6(A) (b) of the Act specifically empowered CHC to conduct post-privatisation monitoring
             and evaluation.

      2.2    Privatisation Progress Under PSRC
             The privatisation status of the various entities at the end of PSRC's tenure was 340
             divestiture transactions and a cumulative total of 670 non-core assets sold.


3.0    Privatisation Achievements

       Among notable privatization achievements include the following: a drastic reduction of subsidies
       to PEs; increased Government revenue through taxation; increased foreign direct investments;
       establishment of capital and financial markets and the creation of the Dar es Salaam Stock
       Exchange; liberalisation of the banking and financial sector; increased production of goods and
       services in virtually all sectors; introduction of new technology in production and service
       delivery; establishment of an effective and vibrant regulatory regime as well as creation of more
       employment opportunities within privatised entities and the economy as a whole.

       3.1   Revenue Generation

             In a nutshell, in the area of Revenue Generation, figures show that as of December 31st
             2007 when PSRC ceased to exist, privatization proceeds amounted to TZS 122.1 billion
             and US Dollars 293.3 million.

             Similarly, a good number of formerly closed or loss making PEs has been turned round
             after privatisation and is generating substantial revenue to the Government mainly through
             taxation.

       3.2   Capital and Financial Markets

             It should also be noted that one of the key objectives of the PPSDP was to stimulate and
             facilitate the development of capital and financial markets and diversify the sources of
             investment capital. It is gratifying to note in this respect the creation of the Dar es Salaam
             Stock Exchange (DSE ) which effectively became operational in April 1998.

       The DSE is currently dealing in the following products:
            a) Stocks (15 listed companies--- almost all of them are divested entities);
            b) Seven corporate bonds;
            c) Eight Treasury bonds; and
            d) Four Unit Trusts.

       The financial sector reform initiative which began in year 1991 when Tanzania had only six
       deposit taking financial institutions has shown a tremendous positive impact to the economy. By
       the end of year 2008, the sector comprised 24 commercial banks ( including subsidiaries/branches
       of major international banks); 10 non-bank financial institutions; numerous foreign exchange
       bureaus; pension funds; insurance companies; and several hundred savings and credit cooperative
       societies (SACCOS).




                                                   73
3.4   People's Participation in the Economy

One of the basic objectives of the privatisation programme was to give the opportunity to the
ordinary Tanzanians to actively participate in the ownership of business and benefit from
dividend payments of TZS 5.2 billion capitalisation of the DSE. The listing of ex-PEs on the
DSE is a deliberate Government policy to hold some shares in privatised enterprises for some
time and later offload them to the ordinary citizens.

The participation of citizens in share ownership through the DSE is a humble but very vital
beginning in achieving that objective.

3.5   Increased Production and Economic Growth

The above record underscores the truth that privatisation is a strategy for improvement in the
overall efficiency in the mobilization and allocation of resources for investment and economic
growth. Although it would not be correct to attribute the performance of the economy over the
past nine years exclusively to privatisation it would not be right either to completely ignore its
contribution to the strides the economy has so far made in practically every sector.

3.6   Challenges Faced

Although implementation of the privatiation programme under PPSDP has generally been "
smooth ", a number of challenges were encountered, the most notable ones being:

      a)   TANESCO ­ which operated quite successfully under a management contract to
           NetGroup Solutions of South Africa between 2002 and 2005, was de-specified in 2007
           and the earlier decision to unbundle and divest its generation and distribution
           businesses as separate entities was abandoned. The utility, therefore, reverted 100
           percent to Government ownership;

      b)   Tanzania Railways Corporation(TRC)---earlier restructured to create a new joint
           venture company named Tanzania Railways Limited (TRL) with a share ownership
           ratio of 51 percent (RITES of India) and 49 percent (Government of Tanzania). TRL
           was given a 25-year concession of the former TRC assets effective October 2007. The
           concession has not been a success story and the shareholders are currently reviewing
           the Agreement.

      c)   TTCL---Saskatel International of Canada were contracted to              manage the
           telecommunications company with effect from July 1, 2007. Saskatel terminated the
           contract two years later because TTCL's shareholders could not make funds available
           as required under the contract to finance the company's business plan. The company
           continues to make huge losses.

      d)   ATCL---The shares of South African Airways in Air Tanzania Company Limited
           (ATCL ) were repossessed by the Government in 2006 following the failure of the
           joint-venture to operate commercially/profitably. ATCL is currently 100 percent
           owned by the Government of Tanzania which is making every effort to secure another
           strategic partner.




                                           74
4.0   INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT TO LART

      4.1   Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)
            LART and the LART Tribunal's tenure ended on 30 June, 2006 but LART activities,
            involving nonperforming assets, were taken over by CHC a year and a half later in January,
            2008, with the Treasury Registrar taking charge during the intervening period.

            The number of NPAs handed over to CHC was 26 worth TZS 14,919,014,675. The number
            of pending LART cases in law courts on the closing dated and which were handed over to
            CHC was 71 involving a total amount of TZS 112,741,763,668.80. Six cases have been
            cleared so far by CHC, leaving a balance of 65 cases which are at different stages of
            litigation.

      4.2   Conversion of LART and LART Tribunal
            The other objective of the PPSDP was to continue to support LART in the collection of
            NPAs, convert it into a private debt collection company and the LART Tribunal into a
            commercial court. These objectives have not been wholly met because there does not
            appear to be any compelling need for creating the two organs, especially since there are
            many private liquidators in the Tanzanian market as well as a functioning commercial
            court.


5.0   ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

      5.1   The third specific objective of PPSDP was to design and establish an institutional
            framework to regulate infrastructure and utilities (transport, telecommunications, water,
            electricity, ports, railways and airports).

            The objective of this component of PPSDP has largely been realised as evidenced by the
            establishment of regulatory Authorities and Competition Commissions which are now fully
            operational and functional.

            The Regulatory Authorities and Competition Commissions are: the Energy and Water
            Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA); Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory
            Authority(SUMATRA); Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA);
            Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA); Fair Competition Commission (FCC) and the
            Fair Competition Tribunal (FCT).

            The Regulatory Authorities and Competition Commissions are keenly involved in both
            technical and economic aspects of regulation, fully aware of the pressing need to squarely
            address the needs and expectations of consumers as well those of other key stakeholders.


6.0   CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT FORUM FOR DIALOGUE

      The fourth and final objective of the PPSDP was to create an independent forum where the
      Government and the private sector could dialogue to remove regulatory and business environment
      bottlenecks to local and foreign private investment.




                                                75
         6.1      The Tanzania National Business Council (TNBC)

        In 1999 the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF) formed a task force to study and make
        recommendations on the modalities to create the proposed forum. The team reported its findings
        and recommendations at a stakeholders' workshop on 8th March, 2000, coinciding with the
        launch of the PPSDP. The workshop endorsed the proposal to form the Tanzania National
        Business Council (TNBC).

        All the development partners' representatives interviewed clearly acknowledge that the Council is
        the second most credible party that they speak to, after the Government because:

        ·      It represents a huge constituency whose role is critical to economic growth and the
               alleviation of poverty;

        ·      It has developed a critical mass of human resource capacity to access donor funding to be
               able to deliver on its mission and strategic objectives; and

        ·      It is enjoying unequalled good will and support from the Government, the donor community
               and its members.

        6.2       Achievements and outstanding challenges

        A number of reform initiatives that have been implemented in recent years to create an enabling
        environment for the private sector are not unrelated to the persistent collective voice of the
        private sector at TNBC's forums.

        From the business policy and regulatory reform standpoint, Tanzania has been identified as one
        of the best reformers in the world14. Nevertheless as reported in the Geneva-based World
        Economic Forum's Africa Competitiveness Report for 2009, the Tanzania's business climate is
        still far from ideal; with poor infrastructure leading on the list of bottlenecks to doing business in
        the country.



7.0    POST-PRIVATISATION MONITORING AND EVALUATION
       UNIT (PPU)

        A post-privatisation monitoring and evaluation directorate has been established in the
        Consolidated Holding Corporation in accordance with the law. So far over 100 privatized
        enterprises have been monitored and evaluated.




1. A World Bank report on business indicators , Doing Business 2007 (World Bank, 2006) for 2005/06 placed
   Tanzania in 10th place out of several countries surveyed.


                                                        76
8.0   PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP (PPP) UNIT

      Efforts to establish a PPP Unit are underway. These are being coordinated through the Prime
      Minister's Office. However, it is not yet clear as to where the PPP Unit will be based. It is
      expected that the Parliament will soon decide on this issue.


9.0   CONCLUSION

      Considering what is happening on the ground, there is no doubt that the PPSDP has, to a large
      measure, achieved the envisaged objectives. It should, however, be stressed that more and better
      data and information is required to objectively assess the success or failure of the multi-purpose
      Project. Evaluation of its performance until now has been unsystematic and incomplete; only
      systematic further research, therefore, can help to assess and clarify its impact on the economy
      and society of Tanzania as a whole.

      It is recommended that:
      a) an in-depth study be commissioned by the Government and the World Bank to look into the
           downside to the PPSDP, especially employee retrenchment, loss of income and the
           accompanying social hardships, foreign vs local ownership, possible areas of corruption etc;
      b) mechanisms are established that will help to broaden and deepen business ownership by
           employees and the general public. Both privatised entities and family-owned enterprises
           should be encouraged to list on the DSE where they can sell shares to the broader public;
      c) efforts are made to link privatisation with broader development and private sector promotion
           strategies, including capacity building for Tanzanians to effectively participate in the
           economy; and
      d) the Consolidated Holding Corporation be converted into a post-privatisation monitoring and
           evaluation entity in line with Section 6(A)-(1) (b) of the National Bank of Commerce
           (Reorganisation and Vesting of Assets and Liabilities ( Amendment No. 2) Act 2007 which
           gives it the mandate to conduct post-privatisation monitoring and evaluation activities taken
           over from the residual functions and powers of the defunct PSRC.
