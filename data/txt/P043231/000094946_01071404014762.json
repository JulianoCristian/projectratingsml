World Bank\n            performance and Borrower performance are both rated as\n            overall satisfactory. The Borrower met its main\n            responsibility to effectively monitor consultants and\n            utilize their services to carry out a successful reform\n            program. Lessons learned include the following: The success\n            of a Technical Assistance Creidit will be enhanced to the\n            extent that it is directly tied into a Structural adjustment\n            Operation. The IBTA Credit laid the groundwork necessary for\n            the SAC by identifying the policy areas; the Terms of\n            Reference for IBTA Credit activities were directly related\n            to the conditions under the SAC; and the IBTA Credit\n            provided capacity building and technical assistance for\n            implementation of SAC. In a post-conflict environment, a\n            Technical Assistance Credit can be effective under key\n            conditions. These conditions include: 1) a general readiness\n            by the government to undertake reform; 2) deep country\n            knowledge by the task team which is embodied in project\n            design; 3) intensive supervision by experienced Bank staff\n            in new member countries; and 4) a dedicated Project\n            Implementation Unit that is in continuous contact with\n            consultants, beneficiary agencies, and the World Bank\n            supervision team."}, "docdt": "2001-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
