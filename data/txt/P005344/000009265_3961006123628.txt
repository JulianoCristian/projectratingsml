MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESYDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE LEBANESE REPUBLIC
FOR THE IRRIGATION REHABILITATION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan of US$57.2 million to the Lebanese Republic.
The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms of variable interest rate
with 17 years, maturity, including a grace period of 4 years, to help finance
the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Modernization Project, estimated to cost
US$70.5 million. The Government would contribute the remaining project coats
of US$13.3 million.
2.          Economic Situation.  Lebanon, a prosperous upper middle-income
country in the mid-1970s, has been devastated by 15 years of turmoil resulting
from violent civil strife and military occupation. In the period between 1950
and 1975, Lebanon's free market economy expanded by about 6 pe-'cent per annum.
This growth was largely driven by the service sectors, namely trade, tourism
and finance, which attracted business from surrounding oil-based economies.
After the eruption of the civil war in 1975, the economy deteriorated
markedly, with intermittent recovery during the two periods of relative calm,
1978 to 1981, and 1986 to 1988. Although resumption of economic activity
following the cessation of internal fighting boosted per capita income to
about USS820 in 1990, it was still only about one-third of the 1975 level in
real terms. The total damage inflicted on the economy during nearly two
decades of fighting has been estimated by the United Nations at US$25 billion.
All principal sectors of the Lebanesa economy have been affected. Damage is
both a direct result of the war as well as the accumulated effects of a near
total disruption in capital investment and maintenance.
3.          Sector Background.  Since the beginning of the civil war in 1975,
Lebanese agriculture has been adversely affected by the loss of export
markets, the neglect or destruction of public irrigation infrastructure, the
elimination of public services and the displacement of the rural population.
After the end of  -e1  war and despite the recent recovery, agriculture GDP has
remained significantly below its 20 percent pre-war level, and currently
accounts for about 10 percent of total GDP. Its contribution to the trade
balance also declined sharply during the course of the war as agricultural
exports fell from 43 percent of agricultural imports in 1970 to only 26
percent in 1990. However, agriculture has remained an important source of
income for the rural nopulation. Income disparities among the rural
population appear to have widened over the past two decades. While many
farmers engaged in subsistence farming have an average income only a third of
the national average, others own large areas of intensively cultivated land.
The total land area of Lebanon amounts to approximately one million hectares
(ha). Out of 360,000 ha of arable land, about 215,000 ha are currently
cultiveted and 87,000 ha are under irrigation. Lebanese agriculture is highly
diversified. It is highly intensive in the coastal areas, where major Lrops
include citrus, bananas and some newly introduced tropical fruits as well as



-2-
in-season and greenhouse vegetable crops. In the central Bekaa, field crops
including cereals, potatoes, etc., dominate. In the high rainfall,
mountainous areas, fruit trees constitute the major crops. In the low
rainfall areas of the Bekaa (where cannabis and papaver used to be cultivated)
and south Lebanon, uubsistence crops and extensive small ruminant husbandry
remain the major agricultural activity.
4.    The civil war had also a deleterious effect on the institutions involved
in the sector. The inadequacy of financial resources and, more recently, the
inability of public institutions to attract and/or keep qualified staff led to
a near complete loss of the Government's ability to provide basic services,
enforce existing ragulations, and control the use of natural resources. This
was particularly the case for the Ministry of Hydraulic and Electrical
Resources (MOHER) and the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), as well ar their
affiliated agencies (Litani River Authority (LRA), Regional Water Authorities
(RWA), Agricultural Research Institute of Lebanon (ARIL) and Green Plan).
Informal Water User Groups at village levels are operational in most of the
irrigation schemes. Nevertheless, there is a need for intermediate
institutions (Scheme Water Management Committee) to facilitate dialogue among
all the various groups of users of irrigation water, in order to solve
conflicts and organize water distribution. In sharp contrast to public
institutions, the private sector remained remarkably active throughout nearly
two decades of civil strife and has, indeed, filled many of the voids created
by the absence of the public sector. However, private supply of agricultural
services remains limited to advice on the use of chemical inputs given by
firms marketing these products. Essential services such as phytosanitary
regulation, technical support, and quality control of agricultural produce are
still missing.
5.          Agricultural Sector Policy. The Ministry of Agriculture has
recently conducted a national consultation on agricultural development, and is
presently formulating a national agricultural development policy.
Government's priorities for the agricultural sector are reflected in the draft
proposal for the Ten-Year Development Plan currently under preparation. The
Plan aims at creating an enabling environment for the private sector by
focusing public investment on: (i) natural resource management and
environmental protection; (ii) development of rural infrastructure, including
irrigation; and (iii) promoting accessibility of credit in rural areas. The
sectoral policy under preparation would further improve the economic
environment by addressing the following issues: (i) fiscal and tariff policy
for agricultural produce; (ii) agricultural land zoning policy; (iii)
agroindustry and export promotion strategies; and (vi) respective roles of the
Government and the private sector in delivery of agricultural services and its
implication on the public expenditures program for agriculture. The Bank has
carried out some preliminary sector work on Agriculture and the issues and
priorities outlined above emerge as the more important ones.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government envisages a phased
strategy for rebuilding Lebanon's ravaged economy and addressing social
problems. This strategy consists of a short-term emergency reconstruction
phase followed by e. medium-term recovery phase. The IBRD-financed National



-3-
Emergency Reconstruction Program (NERP) provides for initial urgent
investments, which will be made concurrently with the identification and
implementation of longer-term development strategies in the various sectors.
The proposed Irrigation Rehabilitation and Modernization Project would support
the irrigation sub-sector component of the program. The project is in
conformity with the proposed Bank's country assistance strategy (CAS). A
separate CAS Report No. 13085-LE has just been circulated. The strategy
focuses on: (i) helping to rebuild and strengthen a public administration that
would center its efforts on establishing an enabling environment for increased
private sector activity; (ii) rehabilitation of selected physical
infrastructure, in close coordination with private sector initiatives; and
(iii) addressing social needs and environmental concerns. Its institutional
strengthening component would focus on rehabilitating essential public support
services, which would complement a dynamic private sector. The project design
benefited from the Bank's experience in irrigation projects analyzed in an
Operation Evaluation Department Special Study and is consistent with the draft
guidelines on the formulation of Water Management Strategies and the Region's
Water Resources Paper. There is no international waterway issue under the
proposed project as none of the five irrigation schemes for which feasibility
studies have been completed are located on an international waterway.
Besides, the works that would be carried out under the proposrs p roject are
designed to rehabilitate ongoing irrigation schemes without, l
adversely affecting the quality or quantity of water Slows. -' oposed
project would not involve involuntary resettlement    local pNp-,.iation.
7.          Proiect Obtectives.  The main objectives of the project are to
increase agricultural production, agriculture-based income and employment in
previously neglected rural areas and achieve a sustainable and improved
management of water resources, through (i) the rehabilitation and adequate
operation and maintenance (O&M) of surface irrigation infrastructure; and (ii)
the provision of basic public support services.
8.          Project Description. The project comprises two major components:
(a) rehabilitation and modernization of surface irrigation infrastructure
covering up to about 27,000 ha; and (b) provision of support to national
public institutions involved in the irrigation sub-sector (MOHER, MOA, and
their affiliated agencies), and to regional and local institutions involved in
the O&M of irrigation schemes.
9.          The infrastructure rehabilitation component has been designed
under a program approach. Infrastructure rehabilitation works have been
divided in two groups according to economic feasibility, socioeconomic
priority and readiness for implementation: (i) a first qrcui of five
irrigation schemes: Yammouneh (5,600 ha), Quasmieh-Ras El Ain (3,800 ha),
Danniye (5,000 ha), Akkar El Bared (800 ha), and South Bekaa (2,000 ha;,
totaling about 17,200 ha for which feasibility studies have been successfully
completed; and (ii) a prooram of small and medium irrigation schemes
comprising about 10,000 ha to be selected from 28 schemes for which rapid
initial assessment (RIA) studies have been completed. The selection will
target poor rural areas and would support community participation. The project
would finance the rehabilitation of headworks, main and secondary canals,



-4
equipment, and facilities. On-farm improvement utilizing modern pressurized
and localized irrigation systems (sprinkler, drip, etc.) would be left to the
beneficiaries. The design of the main and secondary canals is compatible with
such improvements.
10.         The institutional strengthening component wouid focus on the
critical technical support necessary to ensure the attainment of expected
project benefits. It would consist of the following4 (i) Strengthening of
Irrigation and Water Management Institutions: training, techilical assistance,
facilities, equipment, and vehicles, to improve planning and Monitoring
capability of MOHER's Irrigation Service, of LRA's Studies and Project
Department; as well as the O&M capacity of Regional Water Irrigation
Authorities and Water Users Associations; (ii) Environment Monitoring:
training, technical assistance, equipment, facilities, and vehicles to
strengthen MOHER and LRA capability to monitor the quality of groundwater
aquifers, especially in the coastal areas where the danger of sea water
intrusion exists; (iii) Applied Research: training, techn:.cal assistance,
materials, equipment and vehicles to support ARIL's on-station targeted
applied research program; {iv) On-Farm Technology Testing and Extension (OFFT-
Extension): would be contracted to autonomous, mostly private institutions
such as universities, consulting firms and consultants, or ICARDA. These
would be specific to each of the sub-project areas and would complement the
existing private, supply-driven extension services. Given the importance of
women in small husbandry and other agricultural activities, it is expected
that the institutions contracted will also focus on service delivery to meet
their needs; and (v) QOulitv Control of Agricultural Inputs and Produce:
technical assistance, tiaining, equipment, facilities, and vehicles to improve
MOA's capacity in implementing quality control of farm inputs and pesticides
residues in agricultural produce.
11.         The total cost of the project, which would be inplemented over a
period of six years, is estimated at US$70.5 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$59.8 million (85 percent). The Bank loan of US$57.23
million would finance about 81 percent of the project costs net of duties and
taxes, and would meet most of foreign costs. The GOL has also addressed a
formal request to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
to consider allocation of about US$10 million as participation in the
financing of the project. It was agreed during negotiations that should IFAD
financing become available the Lebanese Government may ask the Bank to cancel
part of the IBRD Loan or propose to use the proceeds of that part of the Bank
Loan to finance additional irrigation schemes. The breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement methods, with amounts,
and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events is given in Schedule C. A map (IBRD 25865), and the Staff Appraisal
Report No. 13012-LE, dated May 13, 1994 are also attached.
12.         Project Implementation. The project would be managed by the
Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) under arrangements similar to
those of the on-going, IBRD-financed Emergency Reconstruction and
Rehabilitation Project (ERRP). CDR, assisted by the ERRP's Program Management
Unit (PMU), will handle project procurement, disbursement and accounting.



-5-
MOHER and MOA, assisted by ERRP's Water Sector Implementation Unit (WSIU),
will be responsible for the technical execution of the project, and will have
the capability to prepare bidding documents for the procurement of
rehabilitation works, and terms of referjnce for the recruitment of
consultants, as well as supervision of the contracts. O&M of ,nain headwork and
canals would be implemented by exieting Water Authorities or Committees and
eventually transferred to four new Regional Water Irrigation Authorities that
the Government intends to establish in order to rationalize water resource
management in the country. O&M of tertiary systems would remain under the
responsibility of Water Users Associations which will be progressively
involved in the management of the schemes. -mplementation of OFFT-Extension
activities would be contracted out to private institutions (such as private
universities, ARIL, ICARDA's Terbol station, private consulting firms and
consultants), which would be asked to conduct, on-farm demonstrations, testing
of technologies and farmer information field seminars on topics of immediate
concern to farmers, including for women farmers.
13.         Project Snstainabilitr. The active consultation of water users in
project preparation, the planned representation of water users in the boards
of the Regional Water Irrigation Authorities, and the empowerment of Water
Users groups in operation and maintenance, would ensure local ownership and
institutional sustainability. Implementation of the cost recovery policy
would ensure the financial and economic sustainability of the investment in
irrigation infrastructure.
14.         Agreed Actions. As one of the condition of negotiations, the GOL
has submitted to the Bank a letter of irrigation sector policy, which includes
the cost recovery policy applicable to irrigation schemes financed by the
project. The letter was discussed during negotiations and officially
confirmed on May 26, 1994. The objective is to ultimately attain full cost
recovery of both investment and of O&M. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that GOL would ensure that upon completion of the rehabili4ation
of the five first schemes, water charges be set at a level sufficient to
recov-lr 100 percent of the recurrent costs of O&M, and that recovery of
rehabilitation investment costs would be done in conformity with the policies
and objectives enunciated in the policy letter, for all irrigation schemes and
would commence six years after the completion of the rehabilitation works.
Assurances were also obtained that GOL would provide adequate budget
allocations to the relevant budgets of its public agencies, in a timely
manner, to cover recurrent cost that could not be covered through internal
cash generation during the rehabilitation period.
15.   Another condition of negotiations was the submission of a methodology
for the selection of small and medium schemes to be rehabilitated. The
methodology proposes a combination of economic and social criteria.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GOL would select sub-projects on
the basis of criteria acceptable to IBRD, including: (i) economic rate of
return equivalent to at least 12 percent; (ii) promotion of community
participation in the rehabilitation; (iii) impact on rural income; (iv)
abseace of adverse impact on the environment; and (v) absence of involuntary
relocation of the local population.



6-
16. Agreement was also reached on the implementation of the project through
CDR's Program Implementation Unit and MOHER's Water Sector Implementation
Unit. There would be standard cover.ants regarding audit of CDR's accounts as
well as the project account and special account. In addition assurances have
been obtained that CDR, MOHER and MOA would submit an O&1 program before July
31, 1995, initiate its implementation before December 31, 1995; and would
recruit key technical assistants, according to an agreed schedule.
17.         Environmental Aspects.  The project has been classified under
Category 8 for the purpose of OD 4., Annex A, as its aggregate impact on the
environmert would be positive. The project would improve the availability of
surface irrigation water for agricultural production and would consequently
reduce the risk of misusing groundwater resources. By regulating the
distribution and use of pesticides, and promoting Integrated Pest Management
(IPM), it will also reduce the potential hazards associated with the misuse of
pesticides. In addition, the project would help farmers in the Bekaa to
develop alternative irrigated crops to replace cannabis and papaver which were
eradicated two years ago.
18.         Proaram Oblective Categories. The project would address the
following Bank Program Objective Categories: (i) poverty reduction, through
providing income and employment-generating opportunities in traditionally
neglected rural areas- About 70 percent of the area covered by the project is
in the Upper Bekaa Valley and mountainous areas, where the average per capita
income is about a third of the average per capita income of the country and
investments in those areas will amount to about 45 percent of total base
costs; (ii) natural resource conservation, through increasing the efficiency
of use and sustainability of surfaca and ground water resources; and (iii)
Public sector management through rehabilitation of essential public
agricultural services.
19.         Project Benefits. In addition to the positive environmental impact
and institutional development, the primary benefits of the project would be
the incremental agricultural production resulting from improved water deliverl
and increased water use efficiency in the irrigation schemes. An estimated
34,000 farm families aro expected to benefit from the project. Overall annual
incremental production for major crops would include about 5,600 tons of
wheat, 750 tons of pulses, 20,100 tons of potatoes and 14,800 tons of summer
vegetables. Higher agricultural productivity would also be achieved as a
result of the adoption by farmers of improved agricultural practices regarding
irrigation as well as better use of inputs, particularly fertilizers and
pesticides. Quality of agricultural produce is also expected to increase
allowing Lebanon to gradually regain the export market share it enjoyed before
the war, especially for citrus and vcgeLables. In the five schemes, a total
of about 21,200 farm families are expected zo benefit from the project. As a
result of increased agricultural production, small farmers' income is expected
to increase by 320 percent in Yammouneh, 200 percent in South Bekaa, 50
percent in Akkar, 34 percent in Quaimi1h, and 24 percent in Danniye. Poor
farmers and women will be the focus of the proposed OFFT-Extension contracts
and are expected to benefit directly from this activity. The ERR of the
project as a whole, based on the primary quantifiable benefits, is estimated



-7-
at 19 p.? ent. To be financed under the project, small and medium schemes
would need to have an estimated ERR of at least 12 percent.
20.         P .ks. The major risk would be the inability of MOHER, MOA, and
their affiliat-'d institutions to implement the project efficiently. This risk
would be minimized by the organizational arrangements of the project, placing
implementation under the responsibility of the existing Water Sector
Implementation Unit, established under the Emergency Reconstruction and
Rehabilitation Project. Actual shortcomings in O&M would be addressed by the
empowerment of WUAs and restructuring of RWAs. In addition, the project would
include training and technical assistance for Government personnel and for the
staff of WUAs commensurate with the needs of the institutions involved. The
uncertain security in certain parts of the country would remain a risk until
the consequences of the long civil strife are overcome and more peaceful
conditions return to Lebanon.
21.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
