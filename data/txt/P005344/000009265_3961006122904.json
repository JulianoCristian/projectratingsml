irrigation sub-sector, and to regional and local\n            institutions involved in the operation and maintenance of\n            irrigation schemes. Under the infrastructure rehabilitation\n            components, the project will support: (i) rehabilitation and\n            modernization of irrigation works and facilities long\n            neglected as a result of the hostilities; and (ii) operation\n            and maintenance of irrigation systems as well as the\n            procurement of irrigation equipment and materials. The\n            institutional support component will include: (a)\n            strengthening of irrigation and water management public\n            institutions; (b) strengthening of basic public agricultural\n            services, such as applied research, extension, quality\n            control of agricultural inputs and produce; and (c) support\n            to Water Authorities and Water User Association in the\n            operation and maintenance of irrigation systems and\n            improving the efficiency of on-farm water use.
