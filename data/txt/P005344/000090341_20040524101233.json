was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and the borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that in a\n            situation where sector reform is a prerequisite to ensure\n            satisfactory O&M of facilities to be built under the\n            project, the passing of relevant legislations should take\n            place before Board presentation. The arrangement whereby the\n            Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR) was\n            responsible for all procurement and disbursement matters has\n            its merits. Good baseline data and an early implementation\n            of an effective monitoring system are essential. The\n            non-availability of a proper database and the inadequate\n            functioning of the monitoring system contributed to the\n            difficulties in impact evaluation and the ability to\n            optimize of the future investment programs. More resources\n            should have been made available during project preparation\n            for establishing a proper database. A national\n            inter-ministerial steering committee should have been formed\n            at the onset, with a clear mandate and terms of reference.\n            Consideration should be given to improving procurement\n            regulations, including provisions for rejection of bids with\n            excessively low prices compared to engineering estimates,\n            and for the introduction of a formula for automatic price\n            revision in the event of significant increases in the prices\n            of raw materials."}, "docdt": "2004-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
