"The Fourth Agricultural Credit Project\n            aims to finance credit to agriculture in support of the\n            Government's medium-term adjustment program (1987-91)\n            formulated in connection with the recent Agricultural Sector\n            Adjustment Loan (ASAL) (Loan 2754-TUN), and promote\n            development of a financially sound rural credit system.\n            Specifically, the project provides funds for (a) medium- and\n            long-term credit to private farmers and investors in the\n            agricultural sector to finance a wide range of investments\n            including irrigation, forage, tree crop and livestock\n            development, storage facilities, fishing gear and spare\n            parts, fruit and data processing plants, and farm equipment.\n            It also entails (b) improving the National Bank of\n            Tunisia's (BNT) management information and computer\n            systems, and training of project-related staff.  Lastly, the\n            project will also strengthen the agricultural credit policy\n            coordination between the various Government authorities involved."}, "docdt": "1987-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
