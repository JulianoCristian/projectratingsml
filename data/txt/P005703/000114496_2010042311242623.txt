the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank)
and the Banque Nationale de Tunisie (the Borrower) for the
above-mentioned Project and to the discussions in December 1987
between BNT, the Ministry of Planning and a Bank mission during
which the Tunisian authorities requested that the Special Account
for the purposes of the Project be opened at BNT, as.,now authorized
by the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT's circular No. 36374).
        The Bank hereby is pleased to accept to amend Section

Centrale de Tunisie" and replacing it by "Banque Nationale de
Tunisie".

and dating the form of confirmation below on the enclosed copy of
this letter and returning it to us.
