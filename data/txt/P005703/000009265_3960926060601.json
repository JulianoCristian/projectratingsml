The Project aimed\n            to: (a) encourage the Banque nationale de Tunisie (BNT) and\n            the banking sector to increase their roles in mobilizing\n            resources and in financing agricultural activities by\n            addressing sectoral issues such as on-lending interest\n            rates; (b) restructure the complex institutional and credit\n            systems; (c) improve the financial viability of agricultural\n            credit operations and harmonize credit terms and conditions;\n            (d) assist Government and BNT in their efforts to develop\n            private investment in the sector; and (e) promote savings\n            schemes tied to eligibility for credit. The overall results\n            of the project, in terms of achieving its main policy\n            reforms and investment objectives, were satisfactory,\n            particularly if compared to the previous three credit\n            operations in Tunisia. Still, some of the reform objectives,\n            for example, greater fungibility of funds, including\n            harmonization of terms and conditions, recovery performance,\n            and Banque nationale agricole (BNA) reorganization have not\n            been fully achieved during the short implementation period."}, "docdt": "1992-07-28T00:00:00Z"}
