internal competitiveness\n            and to actively promote investment and exports by achieving\n            a critical mass of meaningful structural improvements to the\n            business environment. These objectives will be achieved\n            through the following: 1) reform of the overall legal and\n            regulatory framework, which will improve productivity and\n            reduce business related costs and risks; 2) reduction of\n            specific operating costs and delays and improved quality of\n            the business infrastructure, mainly in the area of transport\n            and utilities; and 3) improved investment and export promotion."}, "docdt": "1996-03-19T00:00:00Z"}
