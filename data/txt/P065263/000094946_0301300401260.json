        sustainability was highly likely, the institutional\n            development impact was substantial, and the Bank and\n            borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicated that after an emergency of this magnitude,\n            the local government lacked the resources to cope on their\n            own and received little assistance for the first week. Areas\n            affected by disasters need immediate assistance from both,\n            national governments and international agencies. The\n            increased empowerment of beneficiaries enhanced their\n            understanding of their rights, responsibilities, and their\n            capacity to work together to identify priorities and create\n            consensus. Maintaining low overhead costs in the\n            Reconstruction Fund for the Coffee Region (FOREC) was\n            important. Several of the Non-Governmental Organizations\n            lacked sufficient procurement and engineering capacity. The\n            reconstruction program was slow to address the needs of rent\n            households. The use of \"vitrinas inmobiliarias\"\n            was an innovative and effective way of providing large\n            numbers of new housing units by balancing supply and demand.\n            The reconstruction of Barrio Brasilia, in the City of\n            Armenia, which was devastated by the earthquake, provided\n            special lessons in terms of social organization of the\n            community and the use of legal instruments for land titling."}, "docdt": "2003-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
