The project has five components. The first repairs\n            and reconstructs partially damaged, totally damaged, and\n            structurally damaged housing. It also finances subsidies to\n            homeowners and to displaced renters characterized as\n            vulnerable (heads of household, the elderly, and those in\n            poor health) for new house construction. The second\n            component rebuilds and repairs social infrastructure\n            (schools, health facilities, and community centers) ad\n            provides consultants. The third component rebuilds and\n            repairs damaged water and sewerage, power, and transport\n            systems as well as it invests environmental protection. The\n            fourth component builds the capacity for natural disaster\n            management by emphasizing prevention, mitigation, and\n            strengthening the management skills of public sector\n            agencies.
