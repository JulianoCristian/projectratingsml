Lessons from the LRP relate to\n            the provision of quick and substantial support in areas of\n            vast needs, rapidly evolving political, institutional and/or\n            material circumstances, and weak/uncertain implementation\n            capacities. These include: A) Reforming complex political,\n            institutional and economic systems require a broad\n            framework, to carry out interventions in a flexible and\n            exploratory manner. B) The framework need not be a single\n            operation. However, the prospects for continued and\n            substantial support/resources need to be credible at the\n            outset. C) Whereas the framework needs to be multi-year and\n            multi-faceted, it also must quickly build the technical and\n            managerial capacity to implement the reforms, and\n            demonstrate successes. D) In the absence of a demonstrated\n            implementation capacity a platform for reform support may\n            need to be built prior to direct intervention in\n            institutional arrangements and practices. E) In especially\n            challenging sector or country contexts, it may be necessary\n            to program a sequence of operations, starting with a short\n            2-3 year project that expressly focuses on building\n            implementation capacity and demonstrating short-term\n            results. F)  o minimize the risk of the reform momentum\n            being lost in the initial stages of capacity building, the\n            Bank may need to find additional mechanisms to keep the\n            spotlight on reform including policy work, linkages to\n            development policy lending, coordination of donors, and the\n            mobilization of grants."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
