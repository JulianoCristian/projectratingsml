the Russian\n            legal system in areas key to the effective functioning of\n            market institutions. Specific objectives are to: 1) improve\n            the quality of drafting of economic laws, decrees and\n            regulations; 2) assist the government of Russia in designing\n            the appropriate classification of legislation (including in\n            electronic format) and in identifying the appropriate\n            methods of codifying Russian legislation; 3) begin to\n            introduce innovative teaching methods and materials in the\n            legal education system, with particular emphasis on\n            increased exchange between legal academia and practice and\n            to improve teacher training; and 4) improve the quality of\n            judicial training for courts of general jurisdiction and\n            arbitrage courts. The project will comprise four\n            inter-related components consisting of technical assistance\n            to support: 1) legal drafting; 2) collection and\n            dissemination of legal information; 3) legal education,\n            including public education campaigns; and 4) judicial\n            reform, including support for alternative dispute resolution."}, "docdt": "1996-05-21T00:00:00Z"}
