Improvements to the Atlantic corridor will\n            comprise: (i) rehabilitation of tracks and bridges; (ii)\n            conversion of boxcars to multiple use; and (iii)\n            construction of a new freight terminal at Santa Cruz. System\n            wide improvements will comprise: (i) maintenance works and\n            drainage improvements; (ii) purchase of telecommunications\n            equipment for both Andean and Eastern rail networks; (iii)\n            technical assistance and studies; and (iv) procurement\n            services for the above."}, "docdt": "1989-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
