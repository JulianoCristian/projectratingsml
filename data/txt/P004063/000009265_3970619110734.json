development strategy stretching over\n            three decades from the 1960s to the 1980s. The Cholla region\n            lagged behind the impressive economic development that was\n            taking place in other parts of Korea. Any significant\n            infrastructure investment for industrial development did not\n            come into South Cholla province until the early 1980s, 20\n            years behind the rival Kyungsang provinces. Today, Kwangju,\n            the capital city of South Cholla province, is the fastest\n            growing city in Korea with its population increasing at a\n            rate of 4.5 percent per year. Moreover, Kwangju is the only\n            city, among the six largest cities in Korea, which is\n            gaining manufacturing employment. This study attempts to\n            document the process of development of the region during the\n            past two decades based on the experiences of World Bank\n            financed projects, identifying the elements of success, and\n            drawing lessons to be learned."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
