Infrastructure\n            Project is classified as a targeted poverty reduction\n            intervention. The main objective is to build small\n            infrastructures in poor rural villages on Java and Sumatra.\n            This also creates cash employment for villagers. Secondary\n            objectives are to increase decentralization and community\n            participation. The project will provide a grant to each of\n            2,600 of the poorest villagers on Java and Sumatra for\n            building local infrastructures. The villagers will decide\n            what to build, from a menu of choices, and will build it by\n            themselves, the workers being paid by output. Much of the\n            grant may be used to purchase materials. Some equipment will\n            be leased. Field engineers will assist the villagers to plan\n            and implement the works, while also handling financial\n            aspects. Senior engineers and a project management unit will\n            be in charge of the overall planning, coordination and\n            implementation management."}, "docdt": "1996-09-13T00:00:00Z"}
