Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are highly satisfactory\n            overall. Lessons learned from the First Village\n            Infrastructure Project (report no. 19099)(ICR) remain valid.\n            This project aimed at institutionalizing the VIP procedures,\n            and some lessons worth noting include: Programmatic and\n            flexible approaches and a franchise approach used to\n            replicate small-scale assistance, when shown to be feasible,\n            need to be evolved for a longer-term program. That is,\n            self-targeting instead of village targeting is preferable so\n            that assistance offered gets directed where demand is\n            demonstrated, and will benefit poorer segments within\n            villages. Likewise, the involvement of local officials\n            should be expanded rather than remain restricted.\n            Supervision reports should be honest about problems; this\n            reporting should be seen in context and not penalized. Road\n            maintenance and design should vary depending on\n            environmental circumstances and road function. Latrine and\n            septic tank use and maintenance will only improve once\n            hygiene instruction and sanitation importance is taught to\n            the public. Muslim women will participate in development\n            activities if the program is well advertised and they know\n            they are eligible. Beneficiaries will take advantage of the\n            opportunities offered by programs if they are involved in\n            program design. Monitoring is better assisted by local\n            agencies and local communities."}, "docdt": "2000-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
