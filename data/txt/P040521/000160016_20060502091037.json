The performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower were satisfactory. The Kecamatan\n            Development Project had a moderately satisfactory outcome\n            with substantial institutional development impact although\n            it too has a sustainability that cannot be evaluated. Here\n            also the performances of both the Bank and the Borrower were\n            satisfactory. Six lessons were suggested by these two\n            projects: 1) Translate the project's poverty objectives\n            into clearly defined outcomes and outputs in the Project\n            Appraisal Document that can be monitored and evaluated. 2)\n            Project management has to intervene at the community to\n            support poverty and gender issues and challenge the status.\n            3) Develop an infrastructure maintenance strategy that\n            addresses the total community infrastructure. 4) Reduce the\n            costs -including time spent in meetings -- of beneficiary\n            participation as the number of program's increases. 5)\n            Heed past lessons in rural finance: Effective and\n            sustainable rural finance calls for an institutional\n            capacity to evaluate debt capacity, a sustainable\n            institutional home, low costs, and strong incentives for the\n            borrower(s) to remain in good standing. In the Kecamatan\n            project it was a mistake to force an economic loans\n            component into a grants program outside a carefully prepared\n            rural finance intervention. 6) Define at the outset some\n            kind of baseline (and related milestones) regarding the\n            level of corruption, so as to measure progress."}, "docdt": "2006-03-21T00:00:00Z"}
