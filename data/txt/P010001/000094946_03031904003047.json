Project for Macedonia was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and Borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. The project provides a\n            series of lessons concerning ownership, particularly in a\n            society with low social capital. It is clear that ownership\n            will be constantly challenged in a project overseen by seven\n            different ministers, four Bank task managers, and two\n            project managers operating in a weak agricultural policy\n            environment and affected by the political instability of\n            Macedonia. The lessons include: unforeseeable political\n            events can powerfully affect project outcomes, the project\n            management team needed to be able, flexible and independent\n            of day-to-day politics, and project adjustments should occur\n            in response to real government commitments, and project\n            management capability. A project monitoring and evaluation\n            program should be fully described and priced in the design\n            document, project objectives must be as clear and measurable\n            as possible, outputs must be designed to contribute to the\n            achievement of each objective, and stakeholders should\n            participate in monitoring and evaluation activities."}, "docdt": "2003-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
