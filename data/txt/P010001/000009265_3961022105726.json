support the economic transformation process by strengthening\n            the provision of technology and information related services\n            to private farmers, thereby improving their production and\n            income. The project will change mechanisms for provision of\n            technical services to private farmers and initiate important\n            changes in the public institutions providing such services.\n            It will be implemented over three and a half years. Project\n            funds will be used for technical specialists, training,\n            equipment, vehicles, and small support grants. The project\n            will include the following main components: 1) pilot\n            initiatives to develop cost-sharing arrangements with farmer\n            associations, to decentralize extension management and\n            responsibility for support to farmers, and to strengthen\n            Macedonian Extension Service's extension capacity; 2)\n            support for applied agricultural research through\n            competitively-awarded contracts; 3) support for\n            privatization of veterinary services and development of\n            public epidemiological and quarantine services; 4)\n            development of a market news/information service and\n            planning work for a private horticulture wholesale market;\n            5) assistance to improve farmers' access to commercial\n            credit and to evaluate the feasibility of an apex\n            organization for rural, member-owned Savings Associations;\n            and 6) assistance to selected commercial banks to improve\n            their capacity to facilitate expansion of financial services."}, "docdt": "1996-04-17T00:00:00Z"}
