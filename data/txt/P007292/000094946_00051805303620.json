The key\n            lessons indicate that consideration should have been given\n            to private sector management, or ownership, as an\n            alternative to relying on the public sector, including the\n            viable option of introducing a management contract, or\n            concession, which could have been evaluated as an\n            alternative, prior to project approval. Although a law to\n            reform the sector is under preparation, it is currently at a\n            halt. Project design should allow for flexibility to take\n            advantage of unforeseen developments during implementation,\n            experienced by the expanded approach taken by the borrower,\n            to include provision of bulk water to water kiosks in low\n            income areas, and managed by the community, which proved\n            successful, leading to considerable savings in potable water\n            expenditures. But, careful assessment on the feasibility of\n            institutional strengthening programs, should have been\n            established at the early stages, with realistic objectives,\n            particularly under unstable political environments. The\n            absence of a close cooperation among co-financiers, hindered\n            success, given the contradictory views on water facilities\n            network expansion, and on institutional matters,\n            particularly on the role, and timing of private sector\n            involvement, harming the full commitment of stakeholders."}, "docdt": "1999-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
