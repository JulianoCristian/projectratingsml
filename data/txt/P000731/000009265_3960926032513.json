   desertification.  The objectives of this project are\n            twofold.  First, small-scale irrigation schemes will be\n            established for the drought affected areas of Arsi, Bale,\n            Northern Sidamo and Hararghe regions.  This part of the\n            project will include the following: 1) strengthening the\n            Ministry of Agriculture's Irrigation Development\n            Department and irrigation departments in the project\n            regions; 2) strengthening of agricultural support services;\n            3) establishing funds for construction or rehabilitation of\n            irrigation schemes; and 4) providing credit to rural women\n            for small income generating projects.  The second part of\n            the project provides conservation and agricultural support\n            in the Hararghe region.  The issues addressed are: 1)\n            strengthening the Ministry of Agriculture's Community\n            Forest and Soil Conservation Development Department; 2)\n            providing agricultural support services in the Hararghe\n            highlands for establishing conservation-based trials, bund\n            stabilization, and improvements in the extension system; and\n            3) supporting a development program for rural women\n            focussing on the introduction of vegetable gardens and\n            nutrition education."}, "docdt": "1987-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
