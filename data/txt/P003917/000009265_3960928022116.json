The project aims to: (a)\n            consolidate recent improvements in the formulation and\n            implementation of highway expenditures; (b) institute\n            improved policies on road use; (c) strengthen the\n            institutions involved in the subsector; and (d) improve the\n            quality of the road network by focussing on maintenance and\n            rehabilitation / betterment works. The project includes: (i)\n            technical assistance, studies and training to assist in the\n            implementation of the Policy Statement and Action Plan\n            (PS&AP) and the expenditure plan; (ii) specific\n            subprojects of the expenditure plan selected annually on the\n            basis of agreed procedures and economic and technical\n            criteria. Major components for which loan proceeds will be\n            used are road and bridge maintenance programs but other\n            components will include road safety, technical assistance\n            and training."}, "docdt": "1989-10-24T00:00:00Z"}
