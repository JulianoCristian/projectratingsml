       The main objective of the project was to assist the\n            govemment in improving the overall efficiency of the road\n            subsector by supporting its Policy Statement and Action Plan\n            (PSAP) for road transport and road use and comprehensive\n            three-year expenditure plan for national and provincial\n            roads. Bank performance was satisfactory.  Borrower\u2019s\n            performance was satisfactory. There were a few lessons to be\n            learnt from this project's experience : (a) dealing\n            with long-term  objectives, a new Policy Statement need not\n            be designed for every sector project, but each such project\n            should have a modular action plan; (b) rationalization of\n            the institutional development and corresponding changes in\n            the legal framework, should be viewed as a dynamic\n            interactive process; and (c) investing in Technical\n            Assistance (TA) and training for institutional capacity\n            building purposes can yield high returns in terms of\n            development effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1996-01-22T00:00:00Z"}
