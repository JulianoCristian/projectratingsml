28.6%. for the lower stream of the Hulan River the permanganate index and BOD5 exceed
standards by 1.34-3.60 and 0.70-2.68 times respectively. Although the water quality is
slightly better in dry season than in off season, in 42.8%  the permanganate index is above
standards, in 28.6% close to standards, in 42.9% BOD5 above. 14.3% DO above and
14.3% oil above standards.

which the most serious is the permangan-te index
1.2 Analysis of existing atmospheric environment pollution
The project zone is situated in county tor.w.ns and cojntr'yside and shou-d ;mn!er.-,t t.he 11
Grade of the state "Environmental air quality standards'(0E3095-96).
According to amount of discharge of main air pollutants in the assess-d p-rject and -o
the local standards for atmospheric environment quality and based on requirements of
"Technical guiding principles for assessment of er,vironmental imrnac`(HJII 2 1-2. 3-93) the
scope of atmospheric environment impact assessmnent for the proje^cts is set at 1 6-m   T The

It can be seen from the table that except for 3 areas in the project zone whose TSP
exceeds standards the atmospheric environmental quality in the other areas is fairly good
with pollutants density value below 11 Grade, particularly that of SC02 and Nox far below,
which shows a considerable environmental capacity for the tvo in the assessed zone.
1.3 Existing sound environment quality
The foilowing are adopted as standards for the assessed zone: "Envir_nmental noise
standards for urban areas"(GB3096-93). "oise standards for industrial enterprIses and
factories"(GB123it8-90) and  "Standards of control design  for indusr-ial enterprise
Noise! GBJ87-865).
Investigation and monitor result indicate that in most areas there is noise coliution but it
is only slightly above standards. it mainly comes from daily life and trafic. he nose value
in the factory and residential area is within standards.
1.4 Existing solid waste
Only cinder is treated in the zone and is used for making bricks. ThIe solid wasLe
generated by existing animal product processing proJects is not well treated and has
certain impact on the environment.
2. Analysis of Engineering pollution
2.1 Project screening
The 79 projects on World Cank L^a-, this time include 49 ilvestcc' and cred:ns projects.
aquatic production projects, 10 ivsestock product processing Pro-ects. 8 ae^oprocessing
and 1 linseed processmng project as wieil as 3 supporting service system  and 11 seed
co3ting project. Except for the serice system the rest 76z projects all haee mpac' or the
environment.See Table 1-4
Of these 76 prclects thcse of livestock produCtion(includ;ng aouaCut,ure) and seed
processing have relatively small impact, accounting for 73% of the total. For these projects
only repcrts on impact on the environment will be supplied. As fcr sma'l size production
projects wvith little pollutants discharge, which account For 5.4%O and are to te regarded as
Intermediate level of pollution, ana!ysis reports w.ill be supplied. Anotzhe, t'ie includes
animal and farm product processing, which account for 23% and have heav',' mpact on the
envircnment, assessm-ent of their imnpact on the envircnment is needede   S:  another 3
projects need not be assessed and accounts for 4%.
2.2 Factors of environment impact
All individuai projects have different impacts on the environment but proiec.s of the same
type have similar mpacts.
1) breeding pro,c!ts
Breeding projec-Ls, w hether aquatic products or livestock. have marn rpact on the
ecological environment.
2) processing projects
Impact of most animal products and farm crops processing prcects is rather hea\r/ on
water environment. Some projects need heat load. so the new or expanded coal-burning
boiler rooms will p roduce imoact on the atmospheric environment. And there is also impac't
on sound environm,nent made by equipment noise.
Environment aFfecting factors of the projects are shown in Table 1-5
The table showv,s that the main impact of the construction of the projec-s this time is
primarily on water environment and then on air and sound environment.

2.3 Analysis of polluting factors
2. 1 waste water
1) techrnological waste water
it Is generated by wash, soaking of animals and cleaning of equ!iment during slaughter
prccess. Wash water, was.e water discharged by distillinc a,nd thiokening, cleaning o' large
tanks and equipment pipeline also produce large amount of waste water and contain high
content of pollutants, chiefly organic vwaste matters
2) domestic waste water
Domestic use of water generates a certain quantity of waste water The amount is
calculated at 100-200 lId per capita. Compared vith technoic-ical waste-  a-:er ;t contains a
reiativeiy low content of organic matters.
2.3 2 w\aste gas
1) technological waste gas
Slaughtering process generates some odor and feather and dowvn processing powjder
dust.Oroc  processing produces a small amount of waste gas and powder dust They are
S02 waste gas from sulfur absorbing tower in Bayan corn processing, volatile organic
solven,t from oii extracting workshop in Qiqihar sea bucicnorn oil processing and powder
dust from, lNeh.e wheat flour processing project.
2' boiler smoke
Boilers for production and domestic use in this project generate large amount of smoke
during coal burning. As it is mainly coal with low sulfur content, the S02 density in the
smoke is low (SO2 content ((0.40O) with little impact on the environment. The main factor of
impact is smoke dust.

Slaughtering process generates wastes like blood, animal hairs. internal organs and
excreta which have great impact on the environment. If not treated in time, they will
endanger people' s health and pollute environment.
Crop processing produces broken rice, impurities, fiber,etc. Since such' wastes are
mainly organic matters, they can be turned into products.
2) cinder from coal burning in the boiler
Large amount of cinder is generated by burning coal in the boilers. The project will burn
115,890 tons of coal a year and produce 20431.45 tons of cinder
3) activated sludge
To make the waste water discharged by the project meet the effluent standards the
project will build 17 waste water treatment stations with a production of 372.5L/y of activated
sludge.
2.3.4 noise
1) equipment noise
It mainiy comes from air compresscr. \wvind blower, crusher. dehair maci,ine and vcr,a:t,ng
screen.
2) traffic rnoise
With the increase in raw material and products there %,!ll be m_re transport ve!hcies
thus causing increasing local noise
2.4 polluting factors
2.4.1 water polluting factor
Water polluting factors wvill be screened from those of subprojects wvlhich will be 'isted in
Table 1-6.

The table shows COD, BOD. SS and oil as main factors for livestock product processing,
COD, BOD and SS for crop processing and COD, BOD as common factors for all
projects 75% of projects produce COD, BOD and SS, 60% COD, BOD, SS and oil. In view
of the fact that animal product processing occupies a large proportion and has a wide
distribution in the whole project water polluting factors are determined as COD, BOO, SS
and oil



2.4.2 air polluting factor screening
As odor produced by killing processing is discharged from the workshop by means of
wind blower and technological waste gas is recovered for use through cociing or showering,
the rest will be discharged through tall chimneys and have lit'.e impact on environment.
Dust powder will be removed by bag remover with an efficiency of 99% and therefore have
no impact on the outside environment. So the main air pollution source in the project is coal
burning in the boiler, main factors being TSP and S02.See Table 1-7.

2.4.3 screening of solid waste pollutant factors
Of the above 3 kinds of solid wastes cinder is in great quantity but can a!i be made into
bricks and have no impact on the environment. Although local population may change. the
total population of the whole zone w,vill not thus causing no change in the amount of wastes
produced. For the entire zone the impact is mainly by technological wastes of which those
from processing projects are the most serious. So pollutant factor is determined as wastes
generated by processing projects.See Table 1-8.

2.4.4 screening of noise pollutant factors
Noise source in the zone is mainly equipment and traffic noises. A.s vehicles increase
only by one-thousandth as compared with existing vehicles, they wi.l have little impact on
traffic noise. Equipment noise spreads from the factory to the outside environment and
therefore is determined as noise pollutant factor See Table 1-9

In accordance with the oharaoer.stics of 'ischarg-  of wat,e. t^- 202C  2nd itS
environment the goal is designed as fc!llows:
1) control waste water ioads and amount of dscharge. orotect the  Qa:er Oua'!, rf the
Songhua River and water source in Slfantai against pol!utior
2) control the total amount of TS2- discharged into the air by the prc^ ct to protec' the
atmospheric environment quality in the zone.

4 Measures Against Pollution and Substitutable Proposal
The above analyses show\! that without ccunter measures and  ccrtr-l c!an  the
construction of the project would cause a numbler of environmerntal problerms To rea':ze the
goal of control and protection in the design and to ensure strict implementation of1 various
effluent standards set by the state and province so that the ccnprehensive utility rate of
sol.d wastes should meet the requirement set by the ical environment plan. ve advance
the followving measures against pollution and the subsstitutable plan.
4.1 control strategies for projects of aquatic product and livestock breeding
As these tvo projects mainly affect eco!ogical environm rent. we advance strategies for
ecological environment control
1) Strictly follow the requirement of technolocical desicn strenrc:en en'i -onrrenr controc
and strictly carry out environment control measures in all sut-projects.
2) Enhance environment awvareness cf personnel in prcduction and ccrstruc::cn of the
project Save every inch of iand and level. restore and plant trees and grass cn the
destroyed topsoil and vegetation in the neigrhborhcod to crevent erosion after the
completion of capital construction of the project. Recommend trees an-d -ass su:tatle for
grovAti in the local condition
3) Establish stable grain soybean--aninial, fowl--processing ecological sysLem, i.e. keep
and improve soil fertility and increase output of the system by growing. breeding and
processing project production and by returning fertilizer to the hield from animals and fowls.



4) Strictly carry out laws and regulations concerning grassland control and construction.
Follow instructions for raising animals and poultry in operation and avoid excessive raising.
Maintain balance betvveen grass and animals and rational distribution of rescurces. Protect
vegetation and prevent expansion of erosion. Adopt rotation of planting grass and raising
animals to avoid soil erosion on grazing pasture, particularly on grass mountains and hills
where material and water resources are often destroyed
5) Educate people in charge of grazing to cherish wild life and not to hurt illegally or kill
recklessly.
6) Postulate strict rules of hygiene and epidemic prevention for animal and fa, breeding
areas. Clean and remove excreta, pile and ferment them into fertilizer and send t'mrn to the
fields in time. Set u- sound system of livestock e;idemic prevention and \ ^-= rnary stations
to prevent and treat animal and fowl diseases.
7) Prevent water for fishing from deteriorating aiid reduce fly and mosqui:tc -reecing and
spreading of diseases.
8) imported fry must go through strict quarantine before being put into the pond to control
fish diseases.
9) Strengthen ecological c ultivation technology to reduce imnact of ohemrca fe. tlizer on
soil.
10) Do not build fish ponds in wvinte-r and timely res.Ore vegetat:on cn de,s^,,-_ :^_s_ii to
prevent soil erosion..
11) Delimit area of protection for Five Great lake scenic scot and Zaionn  Rec-Crcwned
Crane Natural Reserve, the mcst imn,ortant key, points Of e-.vircnment pr^teoco  on the
Songnen Plain. No livestock breeding, casn cro  growing fhsh ery or prcroess.ngr fat-cry
shall be set up in the desicnated 8C0krn  of protecion fcr .  La,ke area a._n 21kn  fro
Zalong Reserve so as to reaiiy protect the ecological environment of these c.vo areas.
4.2 farm and animal products processing projects
Waste water, gas, noise and cinder of these projects will affect environme-n  T n- order
- of degree is: waste wvater Iaste gas cinder -nose Simple and effective meas,rermst
be taken to control them to reojuce their impact to tne minimum.

Its characteristic of discharge is that the weaste wiSater contains hioh content of organic
matter and oil, the amount is medium. As it also cont-ans a certain amcunt of domestic
sewage, there is NP. Aerobic chemical treatment can be used for such wlaste hater. which
has the advantage of low c'o-t easy maragerent. quick drying. no need for dosrn nutriert

The operating cost of the substitutable plan is not as high as that of the first choice but the
project cost is higher and  so is the test adjustment. Nevertheless it can  also  meet the
effluent standards. It is suitable for geese, beef and pig processing projects

(4) Processing of Agricultural Products



The waste water discharged from processing of agriculturalproducts mainly contains
organic matter and suspending matter capableof biochemical reaction and congealment
sedimentation, and with lowconcentration of pollutants. Therefore, for reaching the
dischargestandard , only a small quantity of mixing agent is needed andtreatment with
good oxygen is followed. The concrete flowchart is shownin Fig. 1-8.

The prevention measures of underground water pollution are asfovl<.'s
(1) The " clean production " should be stressed in the design oflproduct;on Vcwchart fc a21
the projects so as to digest and recoverthe pollutants in the process of :roduot;on
(2) The " three samne-times' p rinciple should be practiced striocly intLhe rSrccess of the
project so as to properly treat the dirty water fromprcduction and life ard reduce cr
eliminate discharge.
(3) Leakage prevention measures should be taken inside the factoryareas with tuting or
teakage-prevention canals being used so as tostop leakage of water to pollute underground
water.
(4) Building of water storage pond or oxidation pond is prohibittLe  inareas capabie of
seeping. If it is inevitable. seeping-preventionmeasures should be taken
4.2.3 Measures of Treatment of Atmospheric Pollutants and theirSubst;tulicn Prcgram
As the World Bank's loan this time covers many projects and a widerange, the heating
supply projects concerned are mainly processing onesand the s;ngle bo;ier capacity is



mostly S 7 MW, therefore mostprojects adopt the multi-tubing high-efficienc,y dust remover
with dustremoving efficiency above 93%. and its concentration of smokedischarged is
lower than the standard.
If the second class dust-removal method with addition of waterfilm  is used. the dust
removal efficiency is above 95% , but itsshortcomings are greater investment. inconvenient
operation andadditional treatment of dirty water. hence the operation expenses v.,i"increase
Therefore, the first chosen program is that with the multi-tubinchign-effic!ency dust
remover; when the coal quality is poor or thecapacity of the boiler is greatr. th-e second
class dust-removal methodwith addition of water film is used.

(1) As the demand For agricutural products, especially fgor fine qualityanimal products
such as meat, milk fish etc. is constantly increasingat present, the demand for meat
produc:s with high protein and low fat.and the demand for intensive processed grain and
meat products arealso increasing, for example, border countries and regions need

the meat production will increase at the rate oflO %, the grain production will increase at
the rate of 0_53 %O, andthere is linear relationship between animal raising production

(1) ra io -nvestment in environmen-al protection
The investment in envircnmenta! prctection for animal husbandr.yprocessing in these
,r-iects is 6 818mlliion vuan.tak!ng 3 %o of thetotal investmernt.i The investment in
en>vr-onm.e^it_' p,rotecti-nfor grai, nd  -rop processing is 9 73  rnillin Yuan, taking 14.8%

(2) An.al,s;s cf E-nv rcnmentai Benet                                          .:
if rno m easa es vere_Lak_n to contro! poilution, the annualdischarge of dirty water of these

If no measures weretaken to remove dust, the increased coalburning amount wouFd
reach 120.C00 t / year and discharge of^moke into the air wtould be 4500 t /year and it
would require a paymerntof 700,000 yuan -as a fee for pollutants discharge



The technolcgical wastes would reach 345,000 t , and if nomeasures were taken , it
would harm the environmebt and the people inthe region and it would reqcuire a payment of
350,000 yuan as a fee forpollutants discharge.
If the 5076 t I a waste matter resulting from livestock productsare processed into high,
protein forage, an economic benefit of 4,000,000 yuan will be brought about. The left mattL er
from wheat processingmay be processed into high forage bringing an econom!c benefit of
2,400,000 yuan a year.
The environmental investment of all the projects is 22.104,000yuan. If the oCPeration term
is 20 years and the excenses forenvironmental pollution controll are 3.000,000 yuan, then
the ratiobetween the environmental investment and the oroduction vazue is 2.2,i e. one

9.1 Conclusion on Environmental Effect of Surface 'W'ater
The total increase of pollutants in th,e pro,ects concerned in thisWo,A rld 5   can is a
negative value. and acceptable to the capacity ofthe environment. Especial11. rmost o tUhe

9.2 Conclusion on Analysis of Underground Water Effect
When the projects are in operation, as necessary measures rorenvircnrmental protection
are taken, so the discharge of water will notgreatly affect the deep layer of thie fourth system
and not affectunderground water
9.3 Conclusion on Evaluation of Atmospheric Effect
The atmospheric environmental quality in the project areas isauite good  having
adequate environmental capacity. Forecasting  resultsof  all the suc-r_;=cmt areas
atmospheric environment does not exceedClass 11 standard of atmospheric environmental
quality. However, theQiqihar buckthorn processing project. the Lanxi eooxv oil project
andBayan corn processing project have exceeded the standard in TSP al thcughthe
increase is very small, that is 0.0091  mgin3, 0.0178 mgfrnr    and 0 C03^8mg/m3
