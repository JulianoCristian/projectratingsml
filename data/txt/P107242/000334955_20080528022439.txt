                    OPERATION AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

                         Lao People's Democratic Republic
            FOURTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION

Borrower       Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)
Implementing   Ministry of Finance
Agency
Amount         SDR 6.1 million (US$10.0 million equivalent)
Terms          Standard IDA grant terms
Tranching      Single tranche
Description    Jointly prepared by the Government and IDA in collaboration with Japan,
               European Commission, and Australia, as well as participation from other donors,
               the second programmatic series of the Poverty Reduction Support Operations
               (PRSO4-7) supports the implementation of Lao PDR's Poverty Reduction
               Strategy and its Sixth National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP)
               which successfully incorporates the key principles of an effective Poverty
               Reduction Strategy and is being submitted as such at this time. The financial
               support provided through PRSOs will help finance the costs of implementing key
               elements of this strategy, together with other domestic and external financing
               available to Government.




               The first in a program of four PRSOs, PRSO4 focuses on two broad policy areas
               consistent with the goals and strategies identified by Government in its Poverty
               Reduction Strategy, and reflected in IDA's Country Assistance Strategy:


               (i) sustaining growth though improvement of the investment climate,
                     facilitating trade and management of natural resources; and

               (ii) improving social outcomes through improving public financial management
                    system and service delivery.
Benefits       The PRSO program aims to support Lao PDR's medium-term strategy, to ensure
               that more resources become available through sustained growth and revenue
               mobilization in the future, and that these resources are efficiently and effectively
               used for poverty reduction.

               The First Programmatic series of the PRSO1-3 supported Lao PDR in three main
               areas:

               (i) Better public resource management;
               (ii) Public expenditure policy reforms; and
               (iii) More sustainable growth and enhanced revenue generation.


               The Second Series of PRSO4-7 and related policy dialogue, policy matrix and
               performance assessment framework, builds on the achievements of the previous
               series, deepens structural reforms on public financial management, and expands



                                            - iii -

         structural reforms on public financial management, and expands the reforms on
         supporting the delivery of further benefits in two broad categories:

         (i)    Investment Climate, Competitiveness, and Business Development; and

         (ii)   Public Finance Management and Improving Service Delivery.


         Progress in these policy areas in turn will support a continuation of the good
         macroeconomic situation and sustainable export- and private sector- driven
         growth (with growth of about 7.5 percent and average annual inflation rate at 4.5
         percent in 2007, and improved revenue performance), and continued progress
         with poverty reduction (building on the decline in the headcount poverty ratio
         from 46 to 33 percent between 1992/3 and 2002/3), including through reform of
         the public finance management system (as well as better management of natural
         resource revenues including those of NT2). As programmatic budget support, the
         PRSO series is aimed at increased predictability of funding and the associated
         dialogue between Government and donors, sharper policy prioritization and
         strengthened donor coordination.




Risks    Four main risks have been identified which could affect the impact of the
         proposed operation:

         (i) Weak public financial management systems indicate high fiduciary risk.
               This risk is mitigated through a strong public financial management
               component built into the PRSO3. Continuing fiscal risks could result in the
               diversion of PRSO funds away from PRS priorities, and to cover losses of
               State Commercial Banks and State-Owned Enterprises. This risk is partially
               mitigated by program of monitoring of SOE and SOCB performance
               embedded in PRSO3 program matrix.

         (ii) Severe capacity constraints in the civil service, due to the lack of qualified
               personnel, and low pay and incentives. This risk is partially mitigated by
               additional resources made available for PRSO3 implementation through a
               WB credit (FMCBP), Mining and Energy Sectoral TA, TA provided by
               other donors, and in particular ­ by an application for a PHRD grant for
               PRSO7 preparation.

         (iii) Provincial autonomy without adequate monitoring and accountability
               mechanisms hampers implementation of national policies and an equitable
               distribution of resources. This risk is mitigated through a technical assistance
               on public financial management that focuses on building systems for better
               central-local relations management and increased central control over
               expenditure execution and revenue collection.

         (iv) Uneven commitment to reforms in the past has resulted in poor policy
               implementation performance. Recently, however, the Government has
               shown increasingly stronger commitment to reforms reflected in improved
               performance on PRSO3, extensive dialog on NSEDP/PRS, strengthening the
               central-local fiscal framework, and a commitment to a range of for trade and

                   INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
         PROPOSED FOURTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION
                   TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The Government of Lao PDR has made progress in a wide-ranging structural
reform agenda and applied continued effort in key reform areas. The Government of
Lao PDR has been on the path of structural shift from a planned to a market-oriented
economy since 1985, and reinforced this commitment in its 5th and 6th National Socio-
Economic Development Plans (NSEDP) and in the Poverty Reduction Strategy called
National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy. This Program Document proposes a
Second Programmatic Series of Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSO4-7) for the
Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and presents recent achievements of the
Government and related challenges. It also discusses in detail the Fourth Poverty Reduction
Support Operation.

2.      The second series of the Poverty Reduction Support Operations (PRSO4 to 7)
builds on the achievements of the first series of PRSO 1 to 3, in two main ways. First, it
continues and deepens the achievements under the first series. Second, it builds on the
lessons learned with regard to implementation, such as benefits of greater focus and
addressing binding capacity constraints. Lao PDR's Third Poverty Reduction Support
Operation (PRSO3) was approved by the Board of the International Development
Association (IDA) on June 5, 2007. The first series addressed a wide range of policy
reforms, including a focus on public finance management, improving state owned
companies' and state owned banks' performance; alignment of the expenditures with
NGPES priorities, especially in infrastructure, health and education; and a range of actions
directed at improving revenue management, poverty data, and investment climate. PRSOs1-3
were based on Lao PDR's continued maintenance of an adequate macroeconomic
framework, continued commitment to the poverty reduction strategy, and adequate
implementation of the agreed reform program.

3.      PRSO4-7 therefore proposes a set of reforms that aim at sustaining high
economic growth; it also ensures that the benefits of this growth accrue to the poor,
through continuation of the comprehensive reform of the public financial system.
PRSO4-7 deepen reforms in public financial management, and widen the growth-related
agenda. The first series envisioned an expansion of the components related to growth and
investment climate improvements, after considerable progress would have been made with
the key reforms in public financial management and in curbing quasi-fiscal risks related to
state-owned banking system and state-owned enterprises. This series will deepen the public
financial management reforms where they concern strengthening of the central-local fiscal
framework, implementation of the legislative acts passed under the first series, and will focus
on improving service delivery in health and education. The series will also establish a new
front of reforms directed at improving the investment climate and quality of incoming
investment, through focusing on leveling the playing field for businesses of all sizes,
ownership, and location; elimination of at the border and behind the border constraints to
trade, and proposes actions related to managing investment in the natural resource sectors.

4.      Progress in the policy areas supported by PRSOs will bring significant benefits.
These include support to continuation of the good macroeconomic situation and sustainable
export- and private sector- driven growth, and continued progress with poverty reduction,
including through reform of the public finance management system (as well as better
management of natural resource revenues including those of Nam Theun 2). PRSO reform
program ensures that momentum is sustained in the structural reforms and therefore
mitigates potential risks to the macroeconomic framework and strengthens resilience to
external shocks. The public financial management component, for example, provides tools
that would allow channeling natural resources to the poor in a transparent and efficient
manner and contributes to a successful implementation of the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) revenue
management arrangements.

5.      PRSO4-7 pays special attention to the criticality principle for budget support
operations and therefore focuses the reform agenda on 7 key prior actions ("triggers") and
25 policy actions. It also incorporates lessons learned form the previous series, especially
with respect to addressing risks related to capacity constraints. Box 2 on page 18 reviews
other principles of conditionality applied to Lao PDR. In addition, as programmatic budget
support, the PRSO series is aimed at increased predictability of funding and the associated
dialogue between Government and donors, sharper policy prioritization and strengthened
donor coordination.

6.      The proposed second series and in particular PRSO4 is based on progress made
and continued adequacy of the macroeconomic framework. Lao PDR continues to enjoy
rapid economic growth and has made much progress with poverty reduction (see Section II).
In the 1990s, real GDP growth averaged more than 6 percent a year and this performance has
been sustained in the first half of the 2000s. The economy has performed particularly well in
recent years, with growth increasing by 8.1 percent in 2006 and by 7.5 percent in 2007.
Macroeconomic conditions remain relatively stable, reflecting monetary and fiscal
discipline, with inflation in single digits for the last several years, public expenditures under
control, and increased revenue efforts underway. Some recent risks, however, relate to cost-
and demand-push inflation, and are closely monitored by the Government.

7.      The IMF's latest Article IV consultations confirmed that economic performance
continues to be strong, although increasing reserves may push up inflation. The last IMF
Article IV report was published in November 2007, and concluded that "economic
performance continues to be strong", and that "fiscal performance strengthened". Budget
revenues rose to 13.8 percent of GDP in FY2007, well above the original target of 12.4
percent ­ and more recent estimates suggest revenues are now above 14 percent. The overall
cash deficit shrunk from 4.5 percent of GDP in FY2004/05 to 3.75 percent in FY2005/06
although the non-resource deficit remained at 5 percent. Strong revenues and contained
domestic expenditures led to a decline in domestic financing of about 1.5 percent of GDP,
while net external financing and grants increased allowing a corresponding rise in
investment. Revenue performance is driven by resource revenues, as well as by increases in
collection in other sectors. After publication of this report, new risks have emerged. While
headline and core inflation declined to historical lows on year-to-year basis in June 2007, it
since has picked up reaching an estimated 7.7 percent in 2008, driven initially by cost-push
(fuel and food prices) but increasingly by demand-pull factors, such as sharp credit growth


                                               - 2 -

(especially in Kip lending). The monetary expansion accelerated to around 40 percent by
mid-2007 and continues to be high.

8.     Apart from rising inflation that follows global trend, there are several country-
specific risks to this macroeconomic framework, mostly related to the management of
natural resource revenues and economic impacts, including exchange rate appreciation and
resulting supply response of the non-resource sector, inflation pressures resulting from cost-
push and demand-driven factors, the need for continued vigilance and fiscal discipline, and
potential adverse commodity price shocks. These risks are mitigated through focus on public
financial management reforms in the PRSO matrix, and through parallel work on natural
resource management, and macroeconomic monitoring, see paragraph 28 and below for
more discussion.

9.     Progress with poverty reduction in Lao PDR has been impressive over the past
decade. The poverty headcount has fallen from almost half the population in 1997/98 to one
third in 2002/03. The share of the population in poverty was reduced by 30 percent, lifting
one eighth of the total population out of poverty. Even though the population grew by one
million people over this period, the absolute number of poor declined from about 2.1 million
to 1.9 million. The Lao PDR Poverty Assessment showed that the greatest reductions in
poverty headcount happened in the areas that were selected by the Poverty Reduction
Strategy (NGPES) as priority districts for poverty reduction efforts including targeted
interventions.1

10.    The National Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-10 (NSEDP) indicates
Government's commitment to shared growth and social development. The NGPES
prepared as a Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2004 established a generally appropriate
framework for future reforms. The Government continuing commitment to poverty reduction
and structural reform is reflected in its new 6th five year plan (the National Socio-Economic
Development Plan 2006-10), which is finalized and has been discussed and approved by Lao
PDR's development partners in November 2006. A JSAN is being submitted by the staffs of
the WB and the IMF alongside this Operation.

11.    The World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lao PDR
build on the NGPES/NSEDP, and the PRSO program forms an integral part of this
strategy. The current CAS has been recently extended till 2011. Jointly prepared by the
Government and IDA, in collaboration with the IMF and other donors, PRSO4-7 support the
implementation of the NSEDP. The series builds upon a strong program of analytical and
advisory (AAA) work, both completed and ongoing, and complements the Bank Group's
other activities in Lao PDR, including the so far satisfactory implementation of the NT2
project.2

12.    Policy dialogue under PRSO4-7 will focus on two broad policy areas --
sustainable growth, and public finance management and service delivery -- consistent
with the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy and IDA's Country Assistance Strategy,

                                                    - 3 -

as detailed in Sections II and IV. Progress in the past 12 months suggests that Government
remains committed to reforms.

13.     The PRSO design builds upon several key pieces of analytical work done
recently by the WB and other donors. Most recent and used reports that created a
foundation for this series of PRSOs, are the Investment Climate Assessment, Diagnostic
Trade Integration Study, Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment,
Public Expenditure Tracking Survey, Financial Sector Assessment, periodic Lao Economic
Monitors, as well as on the ongoing work, such as Country Economic Memorandum on
Natural Resource Management, Civil Service Study, and the PSIA. These reports are
discussed in more detail in Section V.

14.     In accordance with standard practice for PRSOs, progress in implementing this
PRSO series is monitored using a PRSO Program Matrix, updated annually as part of
PRSO negotiations. The Program Matrix for PRSO4-7 (Annex 2) records the actions to be
completed by Government for each of the four years of the operation; and includes 7
"triggers" and more than 20 actions for each of the PRSO4, PRSO5, and PRSOs6-7. Given
the time horizon, actions and triggers for PRSO6 and 7 are bundled together, to be
reconfirmed and refined later on. The impact of the PRSO program is evaluated with
reference to expected outcomes and indicators (Annex 3), also set out in the Program Matrix,
and covering all operations (PRSOs 4-7).

15.     All the triggers envisaged for the PRSO4 operation have been achieved. The
PRSO4 operation has 7 triggers, and Table 3 on page 45 summarizes the progress made and
the prior actions recognized for this operation. Annex 2 contains the full Policy Action
Matrix that includes these prior actions, as well as 25 completed policy actions.

16.     It is proposed that financial support to the Lao PDR should be provided through
the Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Operation in the amount of SDR 6.1 million
(US$10 million equivalent). The evidence presented by the Government and the task team
has been assessed by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Operations Committee. In addition
to filling the financing gap and supporting the NSEDP, the policy dialog and technical
support provided through the PRSO program will narrow the gap between the Government's
reform strategy and its ability to design and deliver necessary policy reform measures in the
face of external shocks and capacity constraints.



                           II. ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES

17.     Lao PDR is among the poorest countries in the world. With an estimated per
capita income of US$500 in 2006 (see Annex 4), Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in
East Asia and is classified by the UN as a Least Developed Country (LDC). In 2004, 71
percent of its population lived on less than US$2 a day, and 23 percent on less than US$1 a
day. Lao PDR has a population of around 5.7 million (2006) and a land area of 236,800
square km. It has significant natural resources like forestry, minerals and hydro-electric
power.



                                             - 4 -

18.     Unlike in other transition economies, the public sector in Lao PDR is relatively
small and most of the GDP in Lao PDR is produced by the private sector. Even though
Lao PDR is a one-party state led by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP), civil
servants (including military and police officials) account for only about 3 percent of the
population. Similarly, SOEs produce less than 10 percent of the GDP, by most estimates. In
moving from a planned to a market economy, the Government introduced the "New
Economic Mechanism" (NEM) in 1986. Since then, price controls were removed, socialist
cooperative farming abandoned as farmers were allowed to work on their plots and assert
ownership, the exchange rate system was unified, government's monopoly on trade removed,
the number of state-enterprises reduced, and free establishment of private firms allowed.

19.     Although declining, agriculture remains a major sector of the economy
contributing around 42 percent of GDP (2006) and employing nearly 80 percent of the labor
force; the industry accounts for a bit more than 32 percent, and services for nearly 26
percent. By value of exports, Lao PDR exports mostly minerals, while industrial goods
account for almost three quarters of the total volume; other large exports are electricity,
agriculture, and wood and wood products. Imports are mostly of industrial products,
petroleum, food and produce; economy is also experiencing a surge in project investment
imports and FDI. The country exports mostly to Thailand, Vietnam, Europe, and China, as
well as with Australia and Taiwan. Imports come mostly from Thailand, followed by
Vietnam, India, Japan, China, and South Korea.

20.     Lao PDR has grown rapidly, building on these reforms, from the end of the
1980s onwards. In the 1990s, real GDP grew by an annual average rate of 6.3 percent -
despite the sharp fall-off in growth during the regional crisis of 1997-1999. Reforms stalled
during the regional crisis, as Lao PDR struggled with reinstating macroeconomic stability.
Successful stabilization began in 2000 and structural reforms revived in 2001 and have been
continuing since then. As shown in Figure 1, Lao PDR's per capita GNP has been increasing
fast since 2000. Exports grew at around 15 percent a year, reaching as high as 50 percent
growth last year. A significant decline in poverty has been achieved however during the last
decade: using Lao PDR national poverty line (of approximately US$1.5 a day) the incidence
of poverty has fallen from 46 percent in 1992/93 to around 33.5 percent in 2002/03. The
social indicators have been improving too, but they remain among the worst in the region,
and the quality of measurements remains low.

21.     Lao PDR maintained its good economic performance. Real GDP grew at 7.5
percent in 2007 and it is projected to rise back to 7.9 percent in 2008. New hydro and mining
projects are estimated to have contributed around 2.5 percent to this growth in 2007,
including the construction of four hydro-power dams and a large copper plant. The
remaining 5 percent is estimated to have come from investments in plantations for
agricultural crops and industrial forestry, steadily rising tourism revenues, and newly
emerging food and nonfood processing industries. As Lao PDR is surrounded by some of the
fastest growing economies in the world, it has benefited from increased demands for its
products and massive FDI inflows from neighboring countries, such as China, Vietnam and
Thailand.

22.     Bank of Lao has been faced with a challenging environment for monetary policy
with strong capital inflows and the global oil and food price shocks. Average yearly
inflation (of Consumer Price Index) has remained in single digits since 2005, dropping from
15.5 percent in 2003 to 4.5 percent in 2007 (Figure 2). However, despite having dropped to
historic lows in 2007, inflation picked up and is estimated to be above 7 percent in March
2008, due to higher global oil and food prices, as well as to emerging demand pressures.
Although the food CPI grew more slowly than in the global economy in recent months, it has
picked up recently and now stands at 9 percent (Figure 3). The Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) had
appreciated the exchange rate to manage external pressures. Between September 2007 and
February 2008, the kip appreciated by almost 7 percent against the US dollar. Reserves
continued to increase and had reached 5 months of non-resource imports in 2007 and are
expected to remain high in 2008, driven by high prices for mining and agricultural exports,
tourism receipts and FDI inflows. Imports and FDI related to large projects in the pipeline
will exert pressure on the external current account deficit, which is expected to be relatively
high. However, reflecting the size of the emerging resource sector with respect to the rest of
the economy, the non-resource current account balance is much lower.

23.      The fiscal situation has been steadily improving, especially in the last two fiscal
years. The GOL achieved its revenue targets for a third consecutive year, with budget
revenues increasing from 12.5 percent of GDP in 2005/06 to above 14 percent in 2006/07.
The disciplined spending policy also resulted in the overall budget deficit below 3 percent of
GDP in FY2006/07 (down from 4.4 percent in FY2005), if expenditure patterns remain
unchanged. These improvements are driven by resource revenues, as well as by the GOL
continued implementation of revenue measures, including the Tax Law 2005 that widened
the tax base, and increased receipts from large projects and tourism.

24.      There is new momentum in donor support for policy reform implementation,
even though Official Development Assistance (ODA) inflows as a share of GDP have been
declining for a couple of years--mainly due to fast economic growth. Budget support is on
the rise, with Japan, EC, and possibly Australia joining the PRSO co-financing, as are
initiatives for setting up multi-donor trust funds (MDTFs) in two key reform areas, adding to
the technical assistance support that is already being provided. The Government is also
seeking greater donor coordination and harmonization of foreign assistance through more
organized joint Government-donor working groups, in support of policy reform as well as
investments in health, education, infrastructure and agriculture. The Government and its 24
development partners including the World Bank signed the Vientiane Declaration on Donor
Aid Harmonization.


MACROECONOMIC POLICY AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

25.      Assuming that structural reforms stay on track, real GDP growth is projected to
stay well above 7 percent, with underlying growth3 above 5 percent. Sustaining
underlying growth will require ongoing efforts to continue trade reforms and to strengthen
the investment climate. Accelerated growth in agriculture and tourism has been observed
from increased regional integration, in addition to the continued growth in exports of
electricity and mining products and an emerging processing industry.

26.      Latest staff estimates suggest that financing requirements to support this growth
scenario will be around 1.5 to 2 percent of GDP in foreign financing yearly (Table 1).


3That is, growth excluding the large projects-- such as the Sephon mine and the NT2 hydroelectric dam.


                                                                               - 7 -

Lao PDR benefits from mostly project-related foreign assistance. Apart from IDA's PRSO,
ADB and Japan also provide some budget support and other donors are contemplating PRSO
co-financing. This donor assistance in the form of budget support comes useful to fill the
financing gap as well as helps deal with fiscal risks discussed below associated with
sustaining current revenue performance and dealing with pressures on expenditures side. It is
expected that European Commission, Japan, and Australia will provide additional yearly
support to PRSOs in the amount around that provided by IDA, bringing the total financing
under PRSOs to around US$20 million a year.

27.     Government revenues as share of GDP are projected to increase in the medium-
term; however uncertainty of projections beyond FY2010 is high. Many mining projects
are currently expected to come on stream between 2009 and 2011, but prices of gold and
copper are currently projected to decline around that time; in addition the process of
centralization of tax, treasury, and customs is expected to be implemented and have an
impact in the years before that. The uncertainty stemming from exact start of these expected
events is very high at this time, and the impact they would have on revenues is significant.
Table 1 contains the most recent macroeconomic projections, which will however be revised
for the IMF Assessment Letter to be distributed as Addendum (Annex 5).

28.     A number of risks exist to this good economic outlook. Upside risks include
additional mineral reserves, positive commodity price shocks, or faster coming on stream of
hydroelectric projects. Downside risks include adverse commodity price shocks, delays in
construction of the power plants, or significant delays in implementation of the structural
reform agenda. One risk is accumulation of arrears and related impact on fiscal
sustainability. In addition, the risks of rising inflation pushed up by global trends, as well as
by increasing demand factors are monitored closely and measures are being taken by several
ministries and the BOL to mitigate the impacts. Other risks include that of high debt distress,
and impacts on non-resource revenue base from the potential exchange rate appreciation.

29.     These risks have been partially addressed through PRSO1-3 and will continue to
be addressed through PRSO4-7. PRSOs include actions that aim to reduce the
accumulation of arrears to utility companies, improve debt reporting, and improve the
efficiency of the public financial system. The current restructuring of some key SOE's under
financial distress, led by the Prime Minister's Office, has led to reduction in new arrears
accumulation, and the current stock of arrears is estimated at around US$8 million, including
approximately US$3.5 million in FY2005/06 and is being repaid through a balance sheet
operation between MOF and Electricité du Laos (EDL). The policy actions aimed at
improved debt monitoring and a strong focus on comprehensive reform of the public
financial management system are key to mitigating macroeconomic risks.

30.     Lao PDR's external public debt burden remains elevated, but it is projected to
steadily decline to below indicative thresholds in the medium-term. The latest joint
Bank-Fund staff Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was issued in November 2007 in the
recent Article IV consultation report. According to this DSA, at end-2006 Lao PDR's stock
of public and publicly guaranteed external debt amounted to US$2.4 billion in nominal terms
and US$1.7 billion in net present value (NPV) terms, equivalent to 70 percent and 48 percent
of GDP in NPV terms, respectively (with indicative threshold of 30). The NPV of external

debt comprised 135 percent of exports (with indicative threshold of 100) and 377 percent of
fiscal revenues (with indicative threshold of 200). All three debt stock indicators exceed the
indicative sustainability thresholds for countries with comparable CPIA ratings, placing Lao
PDR in IDA's "high risk of debt distress" category.4

31.       Due to a disciplined borrowing strategy, most of the debt stock is highly
concessional, which warrants no debt-servicing difficulties in the near future. About 75
percent of Lao PDR's external public debt is comprised of concessional loans from
multilateral creditors, primarily the ADB and IDA. At end-2006, debt to bilateral and
commercial creditors amounted to approximately US$633 million. The size of domestic
public debt is negligible. According to the latest DSA, at end-2006 debt service to revenue
was 11 percent, down from 21.7 percent in end-2005 (and well below indicative threshold of
25 percent). Debt service to export is 4 percent, down from last year's 7.8 percent (and well
below indicative threshold of 15 percent). Debt service to GDP is also very low, at 1.5
percent this year, down from 2.5 percent last year.

32.       The latest joint DSA shows that medium-term debt service is manageable,
conditional on a prudent fiscal policy and continued reforms.6 In the near term, debt
stock indicators will remain at elevated levels, but they are projected to steadily decline to
below the relevant indicative thresholds within the projection period. The expected boost to
exports and fiscal revenues from large projects could help to further strengthen fiscal
position of the Lao PDR in the medium-term with relation to its debt servicing obligations.
Under the baseline scenario, the ratio of NPV of debt to exports would fall below 150
percent by 2013. By 2014, the NPV debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to come below 30 percent
indicative threshold.

33.       However, this baseline debt outlook is susceptible to several risks highlighted
under an alternative scenario.7 While the debt stock indicators will still decline over time


6 The DSA includes a baseline scenario, which also can be considered a proactive policy response to the
increasing natural resource output. It assumes smoothed spending and savings of a large portion of resource
revenues for future use, while pursuing fiscal consolidation of the non-resource budget. It also assumes efforts
to mobilize non-resource revenues to compensate for the depletion of proven reserves, and optimizes the
generation of resource revenues. Prudent fiscal policy stance, together with an enhanced BOL capacity to
conduct monetary policy, help contain the monetary impact of rising resource external surpluses. Inflationary
pressures are subdued and the real exchange rate appreciates only moderately. The prevailing macroeconomic
stability, coupled with improvements in the investment climate, including banking and SOE reform, raise
private investment contributing to higher non-resource exports and output growth.

7 The alternative scenario, which also can be considered a reactive policy response to the increasing natural
resource output, assumes that the government spends all revenues attending to urgent domestic expenditures,
keeping its net position with the banking system unchanged. The BoL takes time in developing monetary
management tools and inflationary pressures emerge, exacerbating the appreciation of the exchange rate and
adversely affecting the competitiveness of non-resource exports. Efforts to enhance the business environment
advance only gradually and SOCBs and SOEs remain fragile, posing a fiscal risk.

under a "reactive scenario", they would approach thresholds only towards the end of the
period. The debt service to revenue ratio could even rise in the middle 2010s, if revenues do
not increase to the extent projected under the baseline. Exogenous shocks would also have
stronger impact under the reactive scenario. The priority areas that require close monitoring
and strong policy effort include: (i) maintaining fiscal discipline; (ii) accelerating banking
sector reform; (iii) ensuring that new borrowing is only on concessional terms; (iv) avoiding
excessive reliance on natural resources; (v) giving new impetus to the investment climate-
related reforms and encouraging development of the non-resource sectors.

34.     Lao PDR has chosen not to avail itself of debt relief under the Heavily Indebted
Poor Country (HIPC) initiative or the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), a
decision that is consistent with Lao PDR's commitment to honor its debt obligations. In
addition, Lao PDR now gets all IDA assistance on grant terms (PRSO2 and PRSO3, and the
proposed PRSO4 are IDA grants). Lao PDR is now also eligible for up to 50 percent of
grants within its performance based allocation from the Asian Development Bank.

PROGRESS WITH POVERTY REDUCTION

35.     Recent progress with poverty reduction in Lao PDR has been significant. The
poverty headcount8 has fallen from almost half the population to one third in a decade. 46
percent of people did not consume enough to meet basic needs in 1992/3, but this number
fell to 39 percent in 1997/8 and to 33 percent by 2002/3. As such, the share of poverty was
reduced by 30 percent in one decade, lifting one eighth of the total population out of poverty.
Even though the population grew by one million people between 1992/3 and 2002/3, the
absolute number of poor declined to less than 2 million. During the period 1990-2007 the
projections of poverty evolution of the number of people living with less than US$1 a day
has also been positive, from the 2.2 million people of 1990 (representing the 53 percent of
population) to the projected 0.9 million people of 2007 (representing 14.4 percent of
population).9


8The poverty headcount gives the share of the poor in the total population, or the share of population whose
per capita consumption is below the national poverty line (which is a complex estimate approximately
equivalent to US$1.5 per day).

36.      Poverty fell by 1.4 percentage points per year in the first half of this decade and
by 1.2 percentage points per year in the second half. Thus, the speed of poverty reduction
remained almost unchanged during this decade, even though poverty reduction tends to
become harder the lower the poverty incidence. World Bank staff projections (see Lao PDR
Poverty Assessment) indicate that there is potential for Lao PDR to continue these positive
trends, with simulated national poverty headcount rates of about 25 percent in 2010.

37.      Nevertheless, poverty retains strong geographic features and thus geographical
focus of the NSEDP's poverty reduction effort is appropriate. Poverty is lower in cities
than in villages; in areas with roads than those without; along the Thai border than along the
Vietnamese border; and in the lowlands than in the uplands. The priority districts are on
average much poorer than non-priority districts. Indeed, the Lao Poverty Assessment shows
that largest decline in poverty happened in the priority districts.

38.      Liberalization of private sector, trade and expansion of the road network
(financed by public sector) were major drivers of poverty reduction during 1997/98-
2002/03.10 Other major entry points for poverty reduction include road access to market,
productivity of farming, lack of ownership of land and livestock, limited access to credit and
weak marketing chains. Besides physical location, major causes of poverty include the
legacy of physical devastation during the Vietnam war, with unexploded ordnance (UXO)
still affecting half of the country's territory; weak public service delivery, especially in the
health and education sectors; inadequate communications infrastructure; and shortcomings in
the management of public resources.

TOWARDS ACHIEVING MDGs

39.      Lao PDR faces challenges in meeting the Millennium Development Goals by
2015. After the 2004 First Millennium Development Goals Report, the second national
report on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals in the Lao PDR is being
prepared by GOL and UNDP. The MDG report sets the goals to be met by 2015, in
accordance with the national priorities and through the implementation of the NGPES (see
Figure 5). Lao PDR still lags behind regional averages on almost all key social indicators, as
Table 2 illustrates. It also lags behind low-income country averages on various indicators
including life expectancy, access to an improved water source, and children reaching grade
five. Overall, Lao PDR's mixed record on social indicators reflects a difficult transition
process in the 1990s, a low tax effort at less than 11 percent of GDP until the last year and
some unresolved governance challenges.

40.      At about the halfway point between the 1990 benchmark and the 2015 target
date, education is among the better performing sectors in Laos, according to the
Background Paper for the Round Table Implementation Meeting, held in Vientiane in
November 2007. The literacy rate for young adults (15 to 24 year-old) is roughly on target
(showing progress from the 71 percent in 1995 to 84 percent in 2005) --although ultimately,
literacy of young adults will hinge on achieving universal primary education. Although this
represents good progress, literacy rates are well below regional averages: an adult literacy
rate at 84 percent keeps on representing a considerable distance with the regional average at

98 percent. Enrolment rates data also show a steady progress, from 58 percent in 1991 to 84
percent in 2005, but still behind Cambodia or Thailand. Finally, the primary completion rate
reveals a slight increase from 48 percent in 2001 to 60 percent in 2004, making the MDG
target of 90 percent look beyond reach, and below regional average, showing that 1 out of 4
students is not able to complete primary school.

41.       Progress towards health MDGs has been satisfactory, especially for child and
maternal mortality rates. Although none of the health targets is yet close to being met,
progress in improving health outcomes related to child and maternal mortality is remarkable
given that domestic spending in this sector has not been significantly increased. Health
indicators may thus be improving more as a result of general economic advancement than
government action. Child health has improved significantly over the last decade. Thus the
under-5 mortality rate declined from 197 in 1990 to 98 in 2005, on track to the target of 66
for 2015, and at the regional average.

mortality rate for 2005 are sourced from Population and Housing Census, 2005, by NSC (data is not adjusted for under-
reporting and misclassification).Note: Lao Poverty Assessment (based on LECSIII data) and GOL/UN figures are generally
consistent, but they diverge widely for net primary enrolment rates: the MDG report refers to administrative data, which
suggests large improvements, while the household survey data shows sluggish increases only. This is because survey
captures attendance rates, while GOL/UN data captures beginning of the year enrollment rates.



                III.LESSONS LEARNT FROM PRSO 1 TO 3 IMPLEMENTATION

42.       The track record of adjustment lending in Lao PDR between 1989 and 2001 was
uneven. The World Bank Operations Evaluation Department (OED) rated as unsatisfactory
the outcome of the first three World Bank Structural Adjustment Credits--SAC I (approved
in 1989), SAC II (approved in 1991) and SAC III (approved in 1996). The first SACs
supported the New Economic Mechanism aimed at liberalizing trade and foreign investment,
strengthening the private sector, and improving macroeconomic management. According to
OED's evaluation, the SACs did not perform well--mainly due to weak Government




                                                                 - 14 -

commitment to the reform program and weak implementation capacity. OED recommended
that future policy-based operations in Lao PDR should take on board key lessons.

43.     The lessons from these adjustment lending operations were taken on board in
the design of the PRSO1-3 program. The Bank's increased confidence in the
Government's commitment to the reform program was based on the full implementation of
the FMAC, approved in June 2002, to which can now be added successful implementation of
PRSO1-3, approved in March 2005, April 2006, and June 2007. Moreover, the PRSO
program was based on the Government's own poverty reduction strategy rather than on an
externally imposed framework.

        · Fostering greater inter-ministerial coordination. The Government made a
            specific   effort  to    ensure   inter-ministerial   coordination   through  the
            NGPES/NSEDP process and through the PRSO Steering Committee and
            Technical Secretariat, with representation from across Government. As part of the
            PRSO review process, Government has organized frequent inter-ministerial
            PRSO meetings, to align implementation strategies and discuss cross-cutting
            issues.

        · Supporting the operation with adequate and appropriate technical assistance
            (TA). The Government continues to use FMCBC and other resources to support
            technical assistance, capacity enhancement and institutional development efforts.
            It is also making use of the PHRD grant TA attached to the PRSO3. Furthermore,
            the proposed MDTF for PEMSP will provide significant additional grant
            resources for technical assistance to effectively implement policies.

        · Taking full account of capacity limitations. To take account of capacity
            constraints, the PRSO program was designed as a programmatic series,
            recognizing the need to manage reform in a series of steps, but focused on
            medium-term outcomes and monitorable impacts.

44.       Efforts to mitigate the above shortcomings of the previous budget support
operations have been successful during implementation of the PRSOs 1 to 3, especially
on greater coordination and provision of TA. First, the inter-ministerial agency coordination
has been improved through the PRSO process and related dialog; this resulted in a process
that was comparatively more owned and efficient. Second, the impact of provision of
technical assistance in selected areas has been clear in public financial management
component: progress on this component has been faster and more profound in comparison to
other areas that enjoyed less of such support (for example, banking reform).

45.       However, the PRSO1-3 series had not fully taken into account the existing
capacity limitations. While the programmatic series has been more beneficial than a self-
standing operation would have been, the Government's capacity to implement reforms may
have been over-estimated during the design of the first programmatic series. Structural
reforms during transition from planned to a market economy, such as SOE reform and
Banking sector reform, need to be accompanied by several parallel processes before they can
be successful. Such processes require building understanding of the meaning of these
reforms, and building support within different parts of the Government. This suggests a

                                             - 15 -

sequence that needs to be followed: improved monitoring, setting targets and monitoring
achievement of such targets, building incentives system to achieve targets within the public
sector, and finally implementable actions. Building capacity to perform in such complex
reforms during this sequence is key to success of these reforms.

46.    Several other concerns about the coverage of PRSO have emerged from
implementation of the first PRSO programmatic series. The World Bank and
Government teams have taken stock of the lessons learned from implementation of the first
programmatic series of operations in Lao PDR, PRSO1-3. The discussions of lessons learned
took place during the dialog on PRSO1-3, as well as during retreat that took place in
Houayxay of Bokeo province (see Box 1), the administrative capital of Bokeo province in
the Lao PDR. Some of the lessons learned are:

       (a)    Recognizing the benefits of greater focus. The second PRSO series need to
              be focused in only two or three policy areas, and have less triggers and
              actions. The PRSO1-3 teams perception is that the coverage of the PRSOs
              was too ambitious for a government in a Low Income Country Under Stress
              (LICUS) county, with small public sector, severe capacity constraints and low
              level of inter-agency coordination;
       (b)    Identifying and addressing the critical capacity constraints. Take into
              account the small size of the Lao PDR program and opportunity costs of the
              WB team in pursuing an overambitious budget support operation. In addition,
              every action or trigger should be accompanied with TA or other WB program
              in order to achieve outcomes.
       (c)    Fostering ownership by aligning with national development objectives.
              The reform areas to which the Government has not fully committed or that do
              not have enough capacity or champions in the Government that are able to
              lead reforms should not be included, while the dialog in these areas should
              continue through other instruments, such as AAAs and capacity building
              activities;
       (d)    Shifting the focus to outcomes. The emphasis should be shifted from actions
              and triggers to outcomes and indicators, leading to a more streamlined policy
              matrix of maximum 6 triggers and 12 actions. Relying on outcomes will also
              allow to focus on achieving outcomes through a coherent and well-timed
              program, rather than focus on having an action in each sub-sector every year;
       (e)    Maintaining flexibility in order to achieve these outcomes. Triggers and
              actions should be worded more flexibly and indicatively, to allow for
              adjustments along the way that would lead to better outcomes rather than
              fulfilling the matrix to the letter. The Government should also get credit for
              reforms that lead to the outcomes, even if these were not initially envisioned
              in the matrix;
       (f)    Aligning AAA work with PRSO objectives will help achieve actions and
              triggers and lead to a more meaningful dialog on many issues.




                                             - 16 -

47.    Given these lessons learned, the following criteria for triggers and actions for
the next series of operations have been put forward. In order to be accepted, the triggers
should qualify on the following criteria that are consistent with good practice on
conditionality (see Box 2):

       (a)     Be consistent with NSEDP/PRS and cover four years (PRSO4-7);
       (b)     Do not attempt to fully cover all NSEDP agenda ­ on the contrary, they
               should help GOL prioritize the reform agenda laid out in NSEDP;
       (c)     Be flexibly formulated and be leading to achievement of monitorable
               outcomes based on programmatic approach. Focus should be more on a four-
               year program deliverables rather than on particular year-by-year actions;
       (d)     Be critical to the achievement of the series outcomes (growth, poverty
               reduction, and macro stability);
       (e)     Have lasting effect in improving mechanisms and incentive systems;
       (f)     Be accompanied by TA on a principle of mutual accountability.

                         Box 1: Lessons Learned from Implementation of PRSO1-3:
                        Government team comments at the retreat in Bokeo province

The Bokeo retreat had two main objectives: (1) Ensure PRSO3 is finalized on schedule and taking stock of the
progress made to date and urgent needs during the coming month; (2) collect lessons learned from the
implementation of the three year program and take stock of the programmatic support and the ways for WB-
GOL cooperation in going forward.

During the retreat, the GOL team took an active part in discussions and had well-thought views on the first
programmatic series successes and failures, as well as some suggestions on the way forward. Main concerns
with the implementation of the current PRSO series were related to the feasibility and opportunity costs for the
Government to perform on a wide-ranged reform agenda as opposed to concentrating on several priority areas.
The following have been mentioned:

         · Sector coverage was too wide. The step forward would be to focus on priority sectors from
             PRS/NSEDP, and prioritize within sectors based on analytical work (recent PER) would be
             desirable;
         · Number of triggers and actions was too high (42 under PRSO2, reduced to 38 in PRSO3 ­ as per
             PRSO2 final document). The way forward would be to reduce the number of actions, make each
             of them more flexible in drafting, and deepen current reforms in priority areas rather than trying
             to do too many things in too short a time;
         · Actions and triggers should be driving towards main goals of the PRS/NSEDP: growth, poverty
             reduction, and macroeconomic stability, and should not include actions that are already core
             business of the government ­ instead, PRSO program should help GOL build country systems
             needed for the market economy, that would enhance macroeconomic stability and increase growth
             and poverty reduction in the long- and medium-term, as well as help advance structural reforms;
         · Technical assistance provided for Public Financial Management component by the WB has had
             an enormous impact on the quality and depth of reforms; in other areas, on the contrary, the lack
             of such assistance combined with severe capacity constraints hampered progress. Going forward,
             TA from the World Bank or other donors should accompany each action and a principle of mutual
             accountability between donors and GOL should be taken as basis for continued relationship. The
             principle of mutual accountability should allow the WB to take responsibility for providing TA to
             the Government and if such TA is not provided to take it into account in evaluating the country's
             performance on PRSO.

These comments, combined with the PRSO team (including EC) thoughts have laid the basis for criteria to be
used for the next series of operations, in deciding which triggers and areas of intervention to include.



48.      The process leading to the design of the next programmatic series of PRSO4-7 is
aimed at maintaining momentum in structural reform. The main principles of the
PRSO4-7 operations and summarized key lessons learned from PRSO1-3, as well as
rationale for continuation of the programmatic series in Lao PDR have been discussed with
the Government of Lao PDR and other stakeholders. The preparatory work on the indicative
matrix for PRSO4-7 has started as early as in January 2007 and has continued after
effectiveness of PRSO3. An important lesson from previous implementation is to maintain
yearly cycles for the programmatic series ­ this will help sustain the momentum of structural
reforms gathered during PRSO1-3. Such a design is also beneficial for attracting more
donors into the budget support process.

                  Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality Applied in Lao PDR

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
· Ownership of the PRSO series is reinforced through program design and participatory and transparent PRS
    process. Recent track record of Lao PDR indicates increased commitment and ownership of the program


                                                     - 18 -

    supported by PRSOs. The analytical work is being undertaken by the GOL in close collaboration with
    development partners and is used in policy and decision making process.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
· Under PRSO series, there is an agreed accountability framework including a well-defined policy matrix for
    measuring progress under the program. Importantly, cooperation of the donor community behind the
    PRSO series has intensified, including joint missions, monitoring and evaluation, and strategic planning
    for PRSO4-7. The current matrix is jointly monitored and defined in a participatory way by the
    Government and donor-co-financiers of the PRSO4-7 operations. Other donors are informed and
    contribute to the design of the matrix through a parallel dialog.
· The general framework for reforms is being harmonized based on a sector-by-sector approach, and several
    SWAP-building processes have been initiated, including in transport, public financial management, trade,
    and education. Implementation of the Vientiane declaration on aid effectiveness (by GOL and 24
    development partners) is an overarching process under which this coordination takes place.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
· The modalities of the operation are meeting country needs and encourage public financial management
    reform.
· Ownership of some sensitive policy reforms has been strong (like on public financial management
    reforms), and has intensified on other issues in comparison to other series (such as SOE reform and state-
    owned banks reform).
· The evidence amounts that policies supported under PRSOs reflect Government's expressed policy
    intentions and are aligned with PRS.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
· Prior actions and conditions chosen from the agreed accountability framework are focused on critical
    actions for achieving the objectives of the program. Country circumstances and advancement of structural
    reforms however dictate specific approach to achieving the objectives of the program.
· PRSO4-7 pays special attention to the criticality principle of the budget support and therefore focuses
    reform agenda on 7 key prior actions ("triggers") and 25 policy actions. The actions and triggers
    prioritization is discussed in a cross-sectoral framework and prioritized across the board. For the proposed
    PRSO4-7, the size and coverage of the policy matrix has been reduced in comparison to the previous
    series, according to best practice and benchmarks are kept to a minimum necessary for maintaining policy
    dialog.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
· The PRSOs support is aligned with the budget cycle and is disbursed just on time for the fiscal year close
    in September. Regular reviews are done through frequent assessment missions (as well as RTM and annual
    plan processes) and are incorporated into the routine monitoring of progress on actions and triggers.
· Monitoring and evaluation framework is in place to monitor progress on outcomes. Given the need to
    monitor results, as well as broader sectoral situation, the indicators are divided into results indicators (that
    directly relate to the actions taken in the matrix) and more general monitoring indicators.
                             IV.GOVERNMENT'S REFORM STRATEGY

49.     The Government's intention, articulated in its medium-term strategy, is to
achieve rapid economic growth in order to improve the living conditions of its poor,
and graduate from the status of a least-developed country (LDC) by 2020. The
Government's strategy to achieve these goals has been articulated consistently in several
national strategy documents, including the National Growth and Poverty Eradication
Strategy (NGPES, 2004). Implementation of the NGPES progressed with the Government
presenting the next National Socioeconomic Development Plan (NSEDP, 2006-10) at the
Round Table Meeting as the successor to the NGPES and the proposed next Poverty
Reduction Strategy.



                                                       - 19 -

50.     Developed through an increasingly participatory process, NGPES and NSEDP
establish a framework for future reforms and make Government development
priorities more explicit and transparent. These priorities are consistent with the multi-
dimensional nature of poverty alleviation. The strategies, in particular, seek to: (1) deepen
structural reforms in areas including public expenditure management, financial sector, State-
Owned Enterprises (SOEs), private sector development, trade and legal development; (2)
maintain macroeconomic stability by increasing revenue and ensuring appropriate monetary
and fiscal policy; (3) invest in the social sectors to expand access and improve social sector
outcomes; (4) invest in infrastructure such as roads, power and water supply, and expand
access to these services; (5) invest in rural development and natural resource management--
including support for agricultural, mining, forestry and hydropower development; and (6)
strengthen national capacity and institutions. The Poverty Reduction Strategy underpins both
the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the PRSO program.

51.     The National Socio-Economic Development Plan (6th NSEDP 2006-10) is viewed
as a Poverty Reduction Strategy that fulfills the main criteria: poverty focus, broad
participation, results orientation, and donor harmonization. The NSEDP 2006-10
integrates the NGPES and builds on its participatory approach, poverty focus and to some
extent results orientation. The NSEDP 2006-10 complies with the key features of a
successful Poverty Reduction Strategy (see Box 3). In particular, it is poverty focused, has
gone through a transparent and accountable drafting process, and contains a small but
functional monitoring and evaluation framework. It also addresses donor harmonization
issues. International non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and donors active in Lao PDR
endorsed the final NSEDP at the 9th Round Table Meeting (RTM) on 28 November 2006,
and reconfirmed their commitment at the Round Table Implementation Meeting on 8
November, 2007.

52.     The NSEDP envisages the achievement of poverty reduction through a
combination of broad-based economic growth and focused and policy interventions.
The four strategic intervention areas of the plan are i) human development and private sector
driven economic growth; ii) competitiveness, trade and regional integration; iii) social
development and focused poverty reduction interventions; and iv) good governance.
Through these key priority intervention areas, the NSEDP points to the continued evolution
of Lao PDR towards a private sector led economy with modern governance, while keeping a
strong focus on human and social development. This geographical targeting of NSEDP's
interventions reflects the empirical evidence provided by the most recent household survey
and Lao PDR Poverty Assessment. The PRSO therefore incorporates the first two pillars
under Component 1 and the last two pillars under Component 2 of the Action Matrix.

53.     The proposed JSAN suggests that the NSEDP would benefit from inclusion of a
more comprehensive macroeconomic framework that includes reliable break-down of
expected and needed ODA, as well as fiscal envelope needed to fulfill Plan's objectives and
achieve targets. In addition, a more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework
than the one currently employed, would be beneficial. These and other comments are
reflected in the proposed Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) being submitted alongside this
Operation.



                                              - 20 -

54.       The Government has expressed interest in receiving further support for
implementation of 6th NSEDP from the WB and other donors under the next series of
operations PRSO4-7. The PRSO dialogue thus involved discussions on future policy
reforms which would "trigger" PRSO4, as well as a broad strategy for the next series
(PRSO4-7). A more detailed description of the proposed next series of operations is
presented in Section VI.

                     Box 3: National Plans as Poverty Reduction Strategies in East Asia
A Regional Forum on National Plans as Poverty Reduction Strategies in East Asia was held in Vientiane on
April 4-6, 2006. This was the third in a series of conferences on poverty reduction strategies and, like the first
two, was organized jointly with the IMF, ADB, and UNDP. About 125 representatives of governments,
development agencies and NGOs participated.

The main objectives of the forum were: First, exchange experiences with formulating and implementing
national plans and poverty reduction strategies among the six countries of the region which have participated in
the PRSP initiative--Lao PDR, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Timor-Leste--as well as the
experiences in formulating national plans and poverty reduction strategies in China and Thailand. Second,
agree on core principles for continuing these efforts, and discuss next steps by governments and development
agencies.

It was agreed that the five-year experience with PRSPs has helped in identifying the core principles of a
successful poverty reduction strategy. These are:

          Broad participation: consultation and transparency in formulating development strategies;

          Poverty focus: a greater poverty focus in the policies and programs that comprise these development
          strategies.

          Results orientation: better monitoring of the results expected from implementing these policies,
          better evaluation systems, and a tighter feedback to policymaking; and

          Donor harmonization: alignment of assistance with country priorities, and synchronization of aid
          cycles and reporting mechanisms with country processes.

In accordance with the agreed next steps at the regional forum, Lao PDR has presented the NSEDP as its
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper at the Round Table Meeting in November 2006. [The JSAN for the
document provides advice on its implementation and assesses the NSEDP as an effective poverty reduction
strategy, and provides guidance on how to strengthen aspects related to participation, poverty focus and results
monitoring.]

KEY POLICY REFORMS UNDER PRSO 1-3

55.       The buoyant economic growth during the last decade has been supported by
prudent macroeconomic management and ongoing progress with fiscal and structural
reforms. Macroeconomic stability was maintained through monetary controls and strict cash
management on the budget side; at the same time revenue policies were put in place to
reduce fiscal risks. These efforts have been successful and resulted in reduction in budget
deficit and meeting of revenue targets in FY05/06 and FY06/07. The success in maintaining
macroeconomic stability would not have been possible without continuing structural
reforms.



                                                      - 21 -

56.    Progress has been made in the public financial management reform. Budget
preparation has become more transparent and predictable. Additionally, the budget approval
time has been brought forward from October to June in order to allow for the National
Assembly to have more time for deliberations on the overall budget strategy. The Public
Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) has gained momentum and is
being implemented according to plan, including training and capacity building components.
Coupling the PEMSP interventions with the new provisions on centralization in the Budget
Law, makes for a very robust and internally consistent plan for improving public finance
management in Lao PDR. There are ongoing efforts in the context of the PEMSP to improve
public financial management in time for NT2 revenues coming on stream in 2010, and
progress is being made with identifying eligible expenditures for NT2 resources.
Government also made significant efforts to improve the monitoring and evaluation
framework through the Public Expenditure Review and Public Expenditures Tracking
Survey. Consultations for establishing F indicators to monitor progress of PEMSP are
ongoing and it is expected that the Government will do a baseline assessment in FY2008/09
and the next one in FY2010/11. Following the actions under PRSO1-3, a new Audit Law
was approved by the National Assembly in 2007 providing autonomy to the State Audit
Organization (SAO) from the executive. Subsequently the SAO initiated an Audit Peer
Review with Office of the Auditor General New Zealand to review current audit procedures
and to develop a capacity building plan for strengthening financial audit capacity.

57.    The new revised Budget Law has potential to strengthen public financial
management, especially in its currently weakest part ­ central-local fiscal relations. The
Law was approved by the National Assembly ahead of schedule. In order to effectively
implement the revised Budget Law, the Minister for Finance has constituted a dedicated
Steering Committee to oversee implementation of the central-local relations measures
including centralization of Treasury, customs and tax administration. Work in this regard is
now ongoing. The intention is to establish a vertical line of control in the Treasury
Department and in revenue management are particularly welcome aspects of this law. The
Prime Ministerial Decree on Budget Law implementation was issued in February 2008
further detailing out the key aspects of the intergovernmental fiscal framework. The decree
on organization and operation of MOF and draft ministerial instruction on organizational
structure of the National Treasury were also approved by respective authorities. These were
further steps in implementation of the revised Budget Law. The emphasis of the second
series of PRSOs is on making this law operational.

58.    The new Tax Law passed and VAT Law drafted were also significant steps to
improve revenue collection and broaden the revenue base. The VAT Law has several
strong points, in particular a single rate and limited exemptions, and the Government is
working on revisions to include centralized tax payer units and review of legal framework.
The VAT is planned to be introduced in October 2008. Successful introduction of VAT will
require significant coordination and collaboration across all levels of customs, tax and
treasury. Other efforts on revenue side include steady and regular increase in fuel levy,
notwithstanding oil price increases that are not subsidized in Lao PDR.

59.    The Government has also strengthened oversight of the State-Owned
Enterprises and made significant progress in bringing state-owned utilities to the cost


                                             - 22 -

recovery levels. Regular and on-schedule electricity and water tariff increases took place
during PRSO1-3, moving state-owned utilities to cost recovery levels. The Government is
following the Power Sector Action Plan to ensure financial viability of the EdL, and
established a Rural Electrification Fund and drafted new water supply law. It also introduced
a forestry sector monitoring system, and Forestry Industry Restructuring plan. The
international audits were undertaken by GOL for the largest loss-making SOEs and for the
State-Owned Banks, and the largest SOEs have been restructured. The Government has also
established regular monitoring of the progress against the restructuring plans of SOEs and
against financial targets established for the SOCBs.

60.     Several steps were taken in the PRSP priority sectors (health, education, and
infrastructure). During PRSO1-3 the Government improved monitoring and timeliness of
payment of salaries to teachers and health workers. In addition, it launched pilots of school
grants program and equity funds pilots for hospitals. In infrastructure, it increased financing
of the road maintenance fund to near financial sustainability through fuel levy increases; and
updated road preservation fund.

61.     A shift in approach to the private sector has taken place during PRSO1-3 that
marks an important step in transition from a planned to a market economy. The new
Enterprise Law approved in late 2005 is based on international best practice, and relevant
implementing regulations are gradually developed. At the Round Table Meeting in end-
2006, the Government presented a comprehensive strategy for private sector development
and trade that focuses on improving the investment climate including reduction in
cumbersome regulations and procedures at and behind the border. The Government hosted
two Lao Business Forums for private-public dialog and has made tangible progress in
resolving key regulatory issues raised by private sector. The Government has also committed
to an SME strategy encompassing reform measures in many investment climate components,
such as regulatory environment for businesses, access to finance, enterprise taxation, and
accounting. In financial sector, several laws and regulations have been developed, in order to
level the playing field and provide services for domestic and foreign, small and large
businesses; these include adoption of Law on Commercial Banks, Secure Transactions Law,
and revision of Presidential Decree on precious metals and foreign exchange.

62.     The government has entered regional and international agreements that require
increased transparency and specific economic policies from its members. Lao PDR
entered ASEAN/AFTA, and committed to access to the WTO. It became a member of the
World Customs Organization (WCO). Lao PDR undertook a Diagnostic Trade Integration
Study to find main constraints to trade and is now working on reduction in trade regulations.
Lao PDR has made progress on its commitments to reduce tariffs under regional agreements
and other related reforms.


              V. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINK TO CAS

63.     The present CAS was designed to support the Government's National Growth
and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES), and the extended CAS is specifically
designed to support the NSEDP. The first two objectives of the CAS aim to support the


                                              - 23 -

implementation of GOL priorities by: (i) sustaining growth through improving management
of key drivers ­ regional integration and private sector development, rural development, and
natural resource management; and (ii) improving social outcomes and reducing vulnerability
through strengthened public financial management and service delivery capacities and
targeted poverty reduction programs. In achieving these first two objectives, the CAS will
also focus on its third and fourth complementary objectives, namely: (iii) adopting a
strategic approach to capacity development and partnerships to yield better results; and (iv)
supporting the implementation of NT2 as an example of an area-based, sustainable natural
resource development program that contributes to growth, social outcomes, capacity
development and stronger partnerships. The CAS includes a mixture of programmatic
policy-based lending (through PRSOs), investment lending, and analytical and advisory
(AAA) services. The CAS update approved in May 2007 includes a provision of US$10
million for each of the PRSOs 4-7 operations.

64.      The PRSO program is an integral component of the CAS, supporting its
pillars, achieving the outcomes, and contributing to its risk management strategy.
Component 1 of PRSO and its subcomponents support the first pillar of the Bank's CAS
objective ­ to sustain growth through managing key growth drivers. Component 2 of PRSO
and its subcomponents support the second pillar of the CAS, especially where it concerns
strengthening public financial management to improve the social outcomes. PRSO also helps
to manage risks identified in the CAS, especially those related to weak implementation
capacity and to fluctuating political environment. The second series of PRSOs will continue
its strong contribution to the third pillar of the CAS and to establishing and implementing a
capacity building strategy and partnerships, though identifying capacity constraints in all
sectors of operation, addressing them though TA and an extensive PRSO dialog, and through
attracting strong partnerships under PRSO umbrella. The latter reflects the recent interest for
co-financing PRSOs by European Commission, Japan, and Australia, and other donors.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

65.    The PRSO program plays a key role in supporting other Bank operations, both
ongoing and as envisaged in the CAS; and in turn is supported by other Bank
operations. PRSOs are a complement rather than an alternative to sectoral investment
operations: over time, a satisfactory policy-based operation may provide IDA evidence that
country policies and institutions are improving and allow more resources to be made
available for both sectoral investment operations and budget support. In particular, the World
Bank's financed Financial Management Capacity Building Project (FMCBP) is assisting the
government in implementation of the PEMSP implementation to NT2 revenue management
arrangements.

66.    PRSOs are a critical complement to the Bank's support for NT2. The World Bank
decision to support the NT2 project was based on a decision framework with three key
elements:     (i) Lao PDR establishing and implementing viable development policies,
characterized by concrete performance, and national programs for poverty reduction and
social and environmental protection; (ii) the technical, financial, economic and
implementation aspects of the proposed project, as well as the design and implementation of
safeguards policies, being sound; and (iii) wider understanding and broader support from the
international donor community and global and local civil society for Lao PDR's development


                                              - 24 -

framework and the proposed project. The PRSOs support the implementation of
development policies, and national programs for poverty reduction and social and
environmental protection, as referenced in the first element of the NT2 decision framework.
The links to NT2 entail a high degree of scrutiny of the reform program, including the PRSO
program, through annual consultations with NT2 partners, the International Advisory Group
and ultimately through dissemination of information to the donor community and the wider
public.

67.    A key component of the series is support to the Government's program for
improvements in the transparency and effectiveness in public expenditure
management, as laid out in its Public Finance Management Strengthening Program
(PFMSP). The PFMSP inter alia supports implementation of the NT2 revenues management
arrangements which are aimed at resources in support for poverty reduction and
environmental protection programs, to be selected according to an agreed eligibility criteria.

68.    The Financial Management Capacity Building Project (FMCBP) is designed to
finance technical assistance and capacity building needs to support the implementation
of the Government's structural reform programs in public expenditure management,
State Commercial Bank reform, SOE reform and enterprise development. FMCBP has
already been used to support the financing of various PRSO-related activities, including
independent audits of SOEs and SOCBs under PRSOs 1 to 3; provision of technical
assistance for revising the chart of accounts and realigning the budget nomenclature, training
of staff, procurement of hardware to improve management of state assets, and the
recruitment of technical assistance under the PEMSP. FMCBP has recently been
restructured, to provide additional financing on grant terms, to assist the government in
scaling up the capacity building needs for the PFMSP, implementation of the revised Budget
Law, and reforms envisaged under the PRSOs. The FMCBP is also supporting the capacity
strengthening at the State Audit Organization. This work is being closely coordinated with
on-going TA from ADB. AusAID, the EC, SIDA, and SDC are in the process of establishing
a multi-donor trust fund managed by the World Bank to support the implementation of the
PFMSP.

69.    The proposed Lao Customs and Trade Facilitation Project (LCTFP) that is being
submitted alongside this Operation is designed to support Government's reform on
centralization and modernization of Customs. The objective of the project is to facilitate
trade by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of customs administration. The project
will simplify customs procedures, eliminate duplication and redundancy, reduce transaction
costs and time to clear goods, and increase transparency and accountability. The project
builds on the results of AAA work including DTIS and ICA and supports the reform agenda
in order to sustain fast export-driven growth in the medium- and long- term. The major
reforms in trade facilitation and other trade-related areas are supported through the PRSO
program, Component 1. In particular, these are concerned with the trade facilitation action
plan and streamlining of cross- and behind- the border regulations. The Multi-Donor Trust
Fund for a Trade Development Facility managed by the World Bank and with contributions
from EC and Australia is also supporting this program and provides technical assistance to
improving competitiveness, business environment, standards, information technology for



                                             - 25 -

border operations and inter-agency coordination, and implementation support for a sector-
wide approach in trade.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

70.     The proposed operation and program are underpinned by comprehensive
analytical work carried out and ongoing in Lao PDR to date, including a Country
Procurement Assessment Review (2002), a Poverty Study (2002), a Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (2002), a Public Expenditure Review (2002), a Poverty-
Environment Nexus Study (2002), Country Economic Memorandum (2004). More recently,
the analytical work includes the Lao Poverty Assessment (LAOPA), Public Expenditure
Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA), the first Public Expenditure
Tracking Survey (PETS); the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS); and an Investment
Climate Assessment (ICA). As part of the NT2 revenue management arrangements, the
Government has undertaken to conduct a PER and a PETS every two years, building on
those currently under way. These studies have been prepared by Bank staff in collaboration
with Government.

71.     The explicit strategy of the PRSO series and accompanying analytical work has
been to identify and fill key knowledge-gaps with an emphasis on joint work with other
development agencies so that there is buy-in on the diagnosis. The results of this AAA
process were used for building a consensus on policy reform, sector investments, and
harmonization of donor assistance in key areas and are reflected in the NSEDP as well as its
implementation. Several of the above mentioned studies have been completed in
collaboration with other donors including the IMF, ADB and EC, as well as other agencies.

72.     The Public Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment was
published in 2007 and examined public expenditure trends between 2002 and 2005,
robustness of the core financial management and delivery systems, and supports the GOL to
achieve its key development objectives by establishing sound, accountable and transparent
financial management practices. This PER-IFA also outlines the key requirements of the
Nam Theun 2 (NT2) revenue management arrangements and applies them to priority sectors.
The next round of the PER-IFA will take place in FY09. This will include focus on the
fiduciary framework of the Government through a Country Fiduciary Accountability
Assessment (CFAA). A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) currently
under preparation at a request from the MOF is described in paragraph 74.

73.     The PER-IFA provided the following recommendations: (i) Recentralize
Treasury, tax and customs administration, and establish credible mechanism for revenue
sharing and intra-governmental transfers as well as clearer assignment of revenues and
expenditures between center and provinces; (ii) ensure that revenue collection meets targets,
as historic revenue underperformance has been a major cause for cash rationing and arrear
accumulation; (iii) Introduce VAT system by 2009 with single rate, broad coverage of goods
and services, and minimum exemptions; (iv) restrain growth in wage bill in line with that of
revenues to keep ratio of wages to revenue broadly constant; (v) keep employment growth
under tight control and focused on needs of priority sectors; (vi) align public sector spending
to strategic objectives laid out in sixth national development plan; and (vii) devote revenue
gains to increasing priority sector allocations by keeping domestic expenditures on non-


                                              - 26 -

priority sectors broadly constant as share of GDP. Regarding the PFM management, the
PER-IFA has provided the following advice: (i) agree on center-local revenue-sharing
arrangements, intra-governmental transfers, and expenditure assignments; (ii) strengthen
fiscal planning underpinning annual budget process, which should be based on reliable
forecasts; (ii) revise budget cycle to make it less compressed: (iii) establish system of
minimum per capita allocations to priority sectors for provinces; (iv) reassert authority of
central Treasury over provincial treasuries by recentralizing tax and customs; (v) make GFIS
fully functional ­ update core systems and improve connectivity; (vi) effectively implement
revised public procurement rules and regulations: (vii) finalize, approve, and enact new
Audit Law for SAO; (viii) base budget allocations to provinces on more realistic revenue
forecasts and strengthen transparency and accountability of local institutions by posting
budgets and end-year accounts on public notice boards in provinces: (ix) conduct needs
assessment and elaborate, adopt, and enact capacity building strategy and (x)revise and
reprogram PEMSP, and adapt NT2RMAs to revised and reprogrammed PEMSP.

74.     A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) is currently under
preparation. The main purpose of the ROSC is to provide findings and recommendations in
support of the strengthening of enterprises accounting and auditing practices, in order to
foster the quality and reliability of enterprises financial reporting, thereby contributing to
improved business environment and investment climate in the country. The ROSC will
specifically address the systemic and governance requirements that are necessary for
improved competitiveness in world markets, an enhanced financial sector, and a
strengthened enterprise accounting and auditing practice in the country. It aims to provide
policy recommendations for necessary actions towards implementation of international
corporate accounting and auditing standards; strengthening the profession and improving the
capacity of professional bodies; introducing appropriate mechanisms for ensuring
compliance with enterprises accounting and auditing requirements; and developing
arrangements for high quality accounting and auditing education and training. The policy
recommendations from the ROSC review will provide a framework for preparing an Action
Plan for the reform of accounting and auditing practices in Lao PDR.

75.     The 2006 Public Expenditure Tracking Survey, the first PETS in Lao PDR, is now
being disseminated. The PETS focused on education and health sector expenditures and
provided information on education and health outcomes, described budget process and flows
of funds between different administrative levels (provincial, district, and facility), identified
public financial management issues that constrained service delivery in social sectors. PETS
identified the key constraints to service delivery and provided recommendations on how to
best eliminate these constrains. It concluded that in Lao PDR, there is little leakage of
salaries, but that overall low public funding of social sectors and inefficient allocation of
resources are key constraints to primary education and health service delivery. In particular,
low public funding strongly hampered service delivery. Inefficient and inequitable allocation
of funds diverted resources from the people who need it most. In a highly decentralized
context, the central government has limited control over the finance department. In the
frontline services, access and quality fall short: low public funding, inefficient and
inequitable allocation of funds and weak management of expenditures had negative effects.
In particular, low salaries and payment delays, negatively affected the delivery of education



                                            - 27 -

and health services. Schools and health centers are short on access and equipment. Teachers
and health workers fell short on training and qualifications.

76.     The PETS suggested the way forward: recentralize the tax, and revenue functions,
and developing a new revenue sharing framework for guide resource allocations and allocate
more resources to these two priority sectors and improve targeting of the neediest people. In
addition to enhancing the overall budget process, the PEMSP reform agenda including
institutional mechanisms for fiscal transfers and monitoring lie at the heart of improving
basic education and health services. To minimize a mismatch between capital expenditures
and recurrent needs, it is important to improve local capacity and to enhance the
effectiveness of donor assistance. The GOL should implement future PETS to expand on the
lessons learned from this pilot experience and to track progress in public financial
management and frontline service delivery in education and health sectors.

77.     The 2006 Investment Climate Assessment. Based on the 2005 Investment Climate
Survey, which surveyed private and public, domestic and foreign, SMEs and large firms in
Lao PDR, the ICA report's main objective is to identify key investment climate-related
constraints for higher economic growth. The Survey looked at firms in the manufacturing
and services sectors, which were interviewed to identify the main barriers to doing business
in Lao PDR, and also includes comparative country information from Investment Climate
Assessments done in other developing countries. The report emphasizes the need to have a
better understanding of the barriers to growth and productivity of firms in the manufacturing
and tourism sectors, and identifying policies and strategies that address these constraints.
Enhancing the quality of key infrastructure including electricity and transportation,
streamlining business regulations and taxation, and improving access to finance are
important first steps towards achieving higher economic growth driven by private sector
development in Lao PDR. More specifically, the report highlights the importance of
improving infrastructure, streamlining business regulations and taxation, and improving
access to finance across the country to maintain strong growth in the manufacturing sector.
In tourism sector, transportation and skills of the sector workers are also very important.
Manufacturing and tourism are seen as the key sectors in which private sector can help
support sustained economic growth and reduce poverty. The ICA report is a component of
one of the objectives of the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy -- to sustain growth
through regional integration and private sector development. One of the chapters of the ICA
looks at specific poverty reduction outcomes in the regions with improved investment
climate and shows a strong links between these improvements and increasing household
incomes. By addressing the main barriers to doing business in Lao PDR, the Government
can enable firms to increase their productivity and further contribute to the country's
economic growth and poverty reduction.

78.     The 2006 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study was completed in the context of the
Integrated Framework (IF) exercise led by GOL and WB with participation of the other core
IF agencies and the IF Facilitator. The DTIS led to an integrated strategy and action plan to
enhance the global integration of Lao PDR where the Government committed to enhancing
donor harmonization and implementing a sector-wide approach to trade-related reforms
based on the DTIS/IF Action Matrix, which was approved at the National Validation
Workshop in September 2006 by the GOL. The action matrix consists of five priority reform


                                            - 28 -

and assistance areas in trade and trade-related sectors: Export competitiveness; Trade
facilitation; Business environment; Trade policy, trade agreements, and global opportunities;
Trade opportunities for the poor.

79.     The upcoming AAA work will help to refine the design of subsequent
operations. In particular, the PRSOs will build upon findings of the Country Economic
Memorandum on natural resource management (scheduled for delivery in FY2009),
Financial Sector Strategy (FY2009), Health Financing Policy Note (FY2009), Teachers
Study (FY08), Education for All Assessment (FY09), Civil Service Issues Note (FY2009),
Study on Trade in Services (FY09), Uplands Livelihood Typology and ICA (FY2009),
subsequent PER (FY2009), the update of the Investment Climate Assessment (FY2010),
next PETS (FY2010), next Poverty Assessment (2010), and other studies. Regular policy
notes and small AAAs will also contribute to the overall program and allow for mid-term
corrections where needed, including Environmental Monitors and Economic Monitors.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

80.     The International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) was approved by the Fund's Board in April 2001, and completed three
reviews before expiring in April 2005. Subsequent reviews were not completed because
safeguard actions for the Bank of Lao PDR and key structural measures could not be
accomplished within the timeframe of the PRGF cycle. Since April 2005, Lao PDR has been
under the Fund's surveillance--including annual Article IV consultation as well as half-
yearly macroeconomic assessment letters. The IMF's last Article IV consultation was made
public in November 2007. The macroeconomic framework presented in this document is
consistent with the draft Article IV Briefing Paper prepared during the ongoing Article IV
Consultation mission. The IMF will provide an Assessment Letter in time for the PRSO4
Board meeting.

81.     Overall, the IMF's staff appraisal in the latest Article IV highlighted adequacy
of macroeconomic policy, but also noted potential risks to its continued success.
Particular features of the macroeconomic performance were (i) the continued encouraging
performance of the economy; (ii) the favorable economic outlook, provided that progress is
made on structural reforms; (iii) on the fiscal side, the challenges have shifted from
achieving revenues targets to managing increasing revenues from the natural resource
revenues and cautious programming of spending; (iv) the importance of further progress in
strengthening fiscal management and in particular non-resource revenue mobilization,
reforms of inter-governmental fiscal relations, and developing a medium-term fiscal
framework; (v) the need for prudent debt management to mitigate the risks from high debt
burden, and special attention needed to the debts acquired to finance stakes in private
hydropower and mining projects; (vi) the appropriateness of the current framework of
monetary and exchange rate policy, but stressing the importance to control monetary
expansion through a targeted reduction in NDA, developing an inter-bank market to allow
policy rates to play a more fundamental role; (vii) the intention to explore more actively the
possibility of joint venture partners for the banks as well as to continue to improve bank
soundness, regulation and supervision, making further progress on SOE reform, and
promoting broad-based growth; (viii) the steps taken to improve the investment climate; and
(ix) the need to strengthen statistics. The PRSO program plays an important role in


                                            - 29 -

addressing the concerns discussed during Article IV consultations, and the Bank and the
Fund are continuing close collaboration during the ongoing Article IV mission.

82.    PRSOs in Lao PDR reflect an evolving partnership between Government and
donors, and have become an important new aid modality and a vehicle for donor
harmonization and policy coordination. During preparation of PRSC1, PRSO2, and
PRSO3, the PRSO program was discussed with major development partners including the
IMF, European Commission (EC), Japan, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). For
PRSO4-7, the matrix was appraised jointly by the three donors co-financing the program:
Japan, European Commission, and Australia. Australia is currently discussing provision of
support for PRSO4-7. The WB and donor team inform the donor community on the progress
with PRSOs and encourage other donors' participation.

83.    The Government of Japan has decided to disburse PRSO3 co-financed with IDA
and other development partners in the amount of 500 million yen ($4.6 million
equivalent) through the scheme of Japanese ODA loan. The Loan Agreement was signed
and the loan was disbursed at the end of March 2008. Japan team comprised of the Embassy
of Japan, JBIC and JICA who have been actively participating to the policy dialogue in
PRSO4-7. Japan's interests in policy dialog lie in the following areas. In Component 1
(Investment Climate, Competitiveness, and Business Development): Improving Investment
Environment, including legislative consistency, institutional building and simplification of
procedures; Promotion of Trade and Transport, including institutional building and human
resource development on custom and custom clearance and simplification of procedures;
SOEs Reform, including preparation and implementation of restructuring plans; Financial
Sustainability of the Public Electricity Utility, including settlement of arrears, preparation
and implementation of action plans; and Financial Sector Reform, including improvement of
the management of state-owned commercial banks. In Component 2: Strengthening Public
Expenditure Management, including Implementation of capacity building towards MOF
officers and management of Public Investment Program (PIP); Strengthening Public Revenue
Management, including implementation of capacity building towards MOF officers for
management of tax collections; and Strengthening Debt Management, including monitoring
of external debt and periodical publication. Japan's interests also include Improving Service
Delivery (Education and Health) as another important sector. These interests have been
included in the Policy Action Matrix, as reflected in Annex 2.

84.    The European Commission's participation in the joint PRSO4 appraisal mission
focused on PRSO discussions as well as on additional support to the Government's
NSEDP reform agenda in the Public Finance Management, Private Sector Development
and Trade sectors, with a special focus on channeling resources to pro-poor priorities of the
Government in Education and Health sectors. The Financing Agreement with the
Government of Lao PDR to support the PRSO 3 implementation with Euro3 million has
recently been signed. EC informed the Government and the Development Partners that under
the PRSO4 the EC would like to use indicators to measure Government's performance in the
health and education sectors and attach it to an annual variable tranche, preferably starting
from PRSO5. For its variable tranche, EC proposed a set of three indicators per sector, some
of which are already incorporated in to the Policy Action Matrix (Annex 2), and others are in
the Policy Action Matrix in underlined script, awaiting Government's decision regarding the


                                            - 30 -

variable tranche concept. Further discussions among the EC, the Government and
development partners will take place regarding this approach, and, consequently, the EC will
finalize the submission of its PRSO 4-7 proposal to its headquarters.

85.    Donors not ready or able to co-finance the PRSOs, provide grants for technical
assistance in support of policy reforms and capacity building. The PRSO is an ambitious
agenda, and grant-based technical assistance plays an important role. Several donors are
already providing this. JBIC financed consulting to the Business Promotion Office (BPO) in
the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to support the development of SOE restructuring plans
under the PRSO2, and will provide similar support under PRSO4. The Government of Japan
provided a PHRD grant for technical assistance to Government under PRSO3, and an
application is being made for a similar grant for PRSO5. The EC, ADB and Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA) financed technical assistance to support the
PRSO-linked Public Expenditure Review (PER) and are supporting the Public Expenditure
Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP). The PRSO process has involved close
collaboration with many other donor-supported initiates--notably, the ADB's work on
banking reform, SIDA's work on tax reform and the United Nations Development Program's
work on governance and public administration.

86.    The Government has developed and recently appraised with wide audience of
development partners two proposals for multi-donor trust funds, with EC, Australia
and SIDA support. One MDTF is to provide grant-based TA for the Public Expenditure
Management Strengthening Program, with EC and Swedish SIDA joining forces
(TF070916). A similar initiative is set up for trade-related assistance, with EC and Australia
joining forces under a proposed World Bank-managed MDTF for the "Trade Development
Facility" (TF091201).

                              VI.THE PROPOSED OPERATION

87.    Jointly prepared by the Government and IDA and in collaboration with co-
financing and other donors, the second series of Poverty Reduction Support Operations
(PRSO4-7) support the implementation of Lao PDR's Poverty Reduction Strategy, as
reflected in the Sixth National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP). In particular,
the financial support provided through PRSO4 will narrow the gap between the costs of
implementing key elements of this strategy and the resources available from the
Government's own revenues and other donor support.

88.    The PRSO program aims to support Lao PDR's medium-term strategy, to
ensure that more resources become available through sustained growth and revenue
mobilization in the future, and that these resources are efficiently and effectively used for
poverty reduction. The first in the second series of four PRSOs, PRSO4 is focused on two
broad policy areas consistent with the goals and strategies identified by Government in its
PRS, and reflected in the CAS in the following way: (1) Sustainable growth; and (2) Public
resource management and public expenditure management.

89.    Progress in these policy areas is supporting a continuation of the good
macroeconomic situation; and continued progress with poverty reduction. As
programmatic budget support, the PRSO program will contribute to predictability of funding,


                                            - 31 -

and the associated dialogue between the Government and donors to strengthened policy
prioritization and donor coordination. Seven prior actions are recognized for PRSO4 and
described in Table 3 on page 45.

90.     The triggers and policy actions within this proposed PRSO4-7 series represent a
continuation of the reform program supported under the PRSO1-3. PRSO4-7 proposes
a set of reforms that aim at sustaining high economic growth; it also ensures that the benefits
of this growth accrue to the poor, through continuation of the comprehensive reform of the
public financial system. PRSOs4-7 deepen reforms in public financial management, and
widen the growth-related agenda. These reforms have gained significant momentum under
the previous series and this operation seeks to continue supporting the reform program.
Within this framework, the choice of triggers was guided by the following principles: (i)
trigger elements should represent key elements of the overall policy reform program in the
respective sector; and (ii) policy reform would already be integrated within the government's
work program, with technical support provided by development partners. Detailed criteria
for determining triggers and policy actions are also provided in paragraph 47 and Box 1. The
sections below provide motivation for the particular design of the series and paragraphs 100
and 118 provide specific aims that each sub-component strives to achieve; the adjacent table
summarizes the specific place of each trigger in the broader policy agenda.

91.     The PRSO4 operation has 7 triggers, all of which have been achieved by March
2008; at the end of the section, Table 3 presents current progress on the triggers for
PRSO4. Annex 2 presents the entire policy action matrix that includes triggers (prior
actions) and actions proposed for PRSO4-7, as well as expected outcomes and monitoring
indicators. The following sections review in detail progress made in the key policy areas
covered by the PRSO program. Each section discusses the key issues and government's
reform strategy and actions to be carried out under PRSO4-7; and the targeted outcomes of
the series of PRSOs.



                                       COMPONENT 1:
           INVESTMENT CLIMATE, COMPETITIVENESS, AND BUSINESS
                                      DEVELOPMENT


92.       The NSEDP estimates that necessary level of investment to achieve targeted
economic growth rate will be around 26-28 percent of GDP, out of which 16-17 percent
is expected to be mobilized from the private sector, including foreign direct investment
(FDI). Currently, the country enjoys similar volumes of FDI, but most of it comes to the
natural resource sector, and investment in other sectors would be needed to achieve targeted
growth. As discussed above, the NSEDP sets an ambitious growth target of 7 percent per
year for 2006-2010, with the objective of graduating from the least developed country (LDC)
status by 2020.

93.       Private sector still faces significant constraints to doing business, including
poor infrastructure, cumbersome regulations, discretionary taxation, limited access to
finance, and limited access to essential information and business support services.


                                             - 32 -

Exporters face higher regulatory burden than non-exporters. Two analytical studies
conducted by the World Bank in close cooperation with other development partners, identify
and prioritize the key constraints to a strong investment climate and export competitiveness
in Lao PDR. The Joint WB/ADB Investment Climate Assessment concludes that the
priorities in improving the investment climate should be to improve infrastructure, especially
electricity transmission lines, streamline regulations, eliminate discretion in taxation,
improve access to formal sources of finance, and to improve regulations and processes
specific to exporting and importing goods. The studies also highlighted the differences
between investment climate for exporters and non-exporters and identified trade-related
regulations and processes as key constraints.

94.       Lao PDR ranks 117 out of 150 economies, with respect to its Logistics
Performance Index11 (see Figure 6). Exposure to international competition is growing with
the gradual opening of the domestic market following trade liberalization commitments
made under AFTA and in preparation for future membership in the WTO. Although Lao
PDR is performing better than most landlocked countries, to become competitive in the
region, significant improvement will need to be made, especially in the weakest LPI
indicators such as the ability to track and trace shipments, infrastructure quality, and
efficiency and effectiveness of Customs and other border procedures. A Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study led by the World Bank and Ministry of Industry and Commerce provided
analytical background for the ongoing reforms in trade-related sectors.

95.       Lao PDR has an underdeveloped financial sector with little intermediation; as
such, it is struggling to provide services for the growing private sector. According to the
Financial Sector Assessment currently ongoing, in 2006, loans equaled only 9 percent of


11LPI aggregates the performance in seven areas, including efficiency and effectiveness of Customs and other
border procedures, logistics costs (including freight rates), and infrastructure quality, the ability to track and
trace shipments, timeliness in reaching a destination, and the competence of the domestic logistics industry.


                                                                     - 33 -

GDP. The sector is highly liquid, since loans absorb only about 39 percent of deposits. At
the same time, physical penetration of bank branches is very low, among the lowest in the
world. The recent effort of the Government to improve legal and regulatory environment, in
particular promulgation of the new law on commercial banks, has facilitated establishment of
a new private bank, as well as Australia and New Zealand Bank (ANZ) and the International
Finance Corporation's decision to invest in one of the local private banks. The state owned
commercial banks (SOCBs) have also suffered from high non-performing loans (NPL)
ratios, directed policy lending, and high loans concentration. Recently, two major SOCBs
have significantly improved their operating performance, and BCEL has significantly
reduced its NPLs by a balance sheet operation and strengthened monitoring of new loans
(using an International Banking Adviser). During PRSO1-3, the supervision function of the
BOL and MOF has been strengthened. The three major banks have signed Governance
Agreements to comply with prudential regulations and have committed to keeping to the
operational and financial targets outlined in these agreements.

96.       In terms of size, the SOEs tackled under the restructuring programs
supported by PRSO1-3 and PRSO4-7 represent 85 percent of the state-owned sector
(Figure 7). Lao PDR's SOE sector is relatively small, as is the potential risk it creates in
comparison to an average transition economy. Total losses by SOEs represent 0.5 percent of
GDP and have been declining fast during the recent years, while profits have been also
growing. Reforms implemented in the early 1990s reduced Lao PDR's State-Owned
Enterprise (SOE) sector substantially. The SOEs today are fewer in number and play a
significantly reduced role in the Lao economy in terms of share of GDP and employment.
Nevertheless, many of the remaining SOEs continue to generate losses; continue to receive
loans guaranteed by the state budget (although this practice has been reduced during PRSO1-
3); and account for some of the stock of the non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking
sector. Efforts to strengthen State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are necessary to ensure that the
remaining loss-making SOEs do not create further fiscal burdens on the budget or further
solvency problems for the banking sector. For the longer term, such efforts will help ensure
that the remaining state-owned enterprises become more transparent and commercially
viable. The previous Government's efforts to improve performance of the SOEs have been
relatively successful and have reduced the number of loss-making SOEs by 20 percent, and
losses of SOEs by 7.2 percent in nominal terms, between 2003 and 2004. Data for 2005
show that revenues of the 10 largest SOEs increased by 26 percent, and their net profit by 34
percent in nominal terms.12 The profits of central SOEs have increased by a factor of 2.5
between 2003 and 2005.




12More recent data are not currently available due to the ongoing administrative restructuring of all GOL
departments dealing with SOEs. This restructuring is expected to finish in early 2008.

97.        The Government has reduced the stock and accumulation of the arrears
between the Government agencies and the Electricité du Laos, an SOE. In order to
improve the performance of the EDL, the Government adopted the "Action Plan for
Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector" (Action Plan) comprising four main actions: (i)
settle electricity arrears of government for the year ending September 2005; (ii) implement
an arrangement for ensuring that future government bills for electricity consumption are paid
in full, and on time, so that the receivables from government departments do not exceed 90
days; (iii) regular tariff adjustment for EDL to achieve financial performance targets; and
(iv) reduction of technical and commercial losses by EDL. In order to stay on track with the
Plan's implementation, the EDL has increased tariffs and operational efficiency, and the
Government has significantly reduced the stock of arrears accumulated up to FY2005/06 and
stayed on track with mutual clearances of arrears. In addition, budget allocations for
electricity consumption have been increased and accumulation of arrears has slowed down
significantly as a result. The Government has also conducted a study on energy savings, to
determine appropriate budget allocations by ministry, and set up a high-level committee
chaired by the Minister of Finance and two sub-committees to deal with clearance of the
accumulated arrears, as well as with elimination of arrears in the future. As a result of these
activities, net arrears reduction was 6 billion kip in 2007 and is projected to be around 24
billion kip in 2008.

98.        The Government is creating level playing field in the banking sector and
business environment through enhancing commercialization of state-owned commercial
banks, and revising legal basis for leveling the playing field in the banking sector, promoting
non banking financial products and developing favorable environment for developing

13The phasing of SOE restructuring is based on GOL's decisions and is prioritized according to the losses
suffered. Phase I SOEs include: Lao Airlines (LA), Nam Papa Nakhouang Luang Lao (NPNL), Pharmaceutical
Factory #3 (PH3), and Bolisat Pattana Khet Poudoi (BPKP); Phase II SOEs include: DAI, LSFC, CC13, and
SLIE; Phase III SOEs include: DAFI, Lanxang Phatthana (LXP), Lat Visahakit Sanong Vatthou Technique
(LVSVT), Lat Visahakit Koncgak Kasikam (LVKK) and Borisat Phalithaphanh Beton Lao (BPBL).

sustainable micro-finance; as well as by improving state owned entities efficiency,
strengthening SOE monitoring capacity, improving regulatory environment for SOEs, and
developing and implementing strategic plan for SOE reform.

99.      Recognizing the importance of enabling business environment in enhancing
competitiveness of businesses in both domestic and international market place, the
Government has recently issued several important pieces of legislations and
regulations. These include the Enterprise Law, the Law on Commercial Laws, regulations to
improve trade facilitation and more streamlined import and export procedures. The
Government has also begun the process of reviewing existing legal framework for
investment promotion and the existing mining law. Progress has also been made in the trade
reform agenda, including international and regional integration. These include such
milestones as the adoption of the first SME Development Strategy, which outlines specific
measures for improving the business environment, and establishment of high level National
Steering Committee for Economic Integration to oversee efforts to integrate with regional
and international trading systems and to harmonize the trade related aid.

100.     PRSO 4-7 triggers and policy actions are designed to foster productive long-
term investment through improving enabling environment for regional integration,
private sector development, and natural resource management. As described above,
these are based on findings of a range of AAA work done by the WB and other development
partners during the past several years. In particular, the agenda of PRSO4-7 serves the
following purposes, and take the following actions to achieve them:

    · Create enabling business environment and attract quality investment (see Box
       4). This subcomponent will aim for improving the enabling environment for business
       development through improving the legal and regulatory framework for business
       including: (1) developing implementing regulations for the Enterprise Law and
       reviewing business licensing procedures to streamline business start up and business
       operations; (2) revising investment laws to increase transparency and efficiency; and
       (3) improving the incentive system to make better use of the country's factor
       endowments, including actions directed at improving the enabling environment for
       natural resource management through: (a) revising the mining law and implementing
       National Hydro Policy (NHP) to attract quality investment and promote sustainable
       business practice, and (b) promoting Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative
       (EITI) to improve transparency and accountability in resource sectors.

    · Reduce trade barriers and proceed with implementation of international and
       regional agreements through (see Box 4): (1) revising Customs law and developing
       relevant implementing regulations and guidelines, (2) developing and implementing
       national trade facilitation action plan aimed at promoting simplification,
       harmonization, transparency and automation in customs and other border procedures,
       (3) implementing customs modernization and preparing for the introduction of the
       ASEAN single window in the future, and (4) increasing compatibility with
       international and best practice standards by complying with ASEAN and WTO
       requirements;



                                            - 36 -

· Improve the performance and monitoring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
  PRSO4-7 series aim to support the government's effort in (1) improving efficiency
  and effectiveness of strategic SOEs through establishing relevant independent
  regulators in key utility sectors and strengthening corporate governance; (2)
  transforming non strategic SOEs and liquidating non commercially viable businesses,
  and strengthening role of the Ministry of Finance as designated share holder in SOEs;
  (3) developing and implementing strategic plan for SOE reform; and (4) settlement of
  the past electricity arrears and setting up a system that would preclude accumulation
  of the future arrears.

· Enhance commercialization and transparency of state-owned commercial banks
  (SOCBs). The sub-components seeks to further improve the depth and outreach of
  the financial sector through supporting the Government's efforts in the following key
  areas: (1) taking an integrated approach to financial sector reform through developing
  and implementing comprehensive financial sector strategy; (2) strengthening the
  banking sector through concentrating on the transformation of the SOCBs; (3)
  enhancing banking supervision and regulation; and (4) developing sustainable
  microfinance regulatory and institutional framework.

                     Box 4: Simplifying business startup and import-export procedures

Business Start-up. With clear objective of improving business operating environment in the country, the
Government decided to simplify business start-up procedures through promulgation of the Enterprise Law
2005. Among other, the law abolished minimum capital requirement for most business sectors. Most
importantly, it provides opportunity for all government agencies to gradually move away from ex-ante business
licensing regime to ex-post business regulation. To this end the Government has recently approved a clearly
defined Negative List of business activities under the Enterprise Law, which is the precondition for
implementation of simplified business registration system defined in the Enterprise Law. However, in order to
achieve the ultimate goal defined in the Enterprise Law, the Government will need to revise the two existing
investment laws to harmonize investment incentives regime for both domestic and foreign investors and
introduce uniform investment approval procedures for both domestic and foreign investors that is consistent
with the Enterprise Law.




The key challenge that lies ahead in this process is the lack of high level inter-ministerial body, which could
play effective coordinating role among all relevant ministries/agencies.
Import-export. With an objective to reduce trade transaction costs and enhance international competitiveness,
the Government has taken important measures to remove non-tariff barriers and implementing trade facilitation
and customs reform programs. The following are summary of key measures that the Government is planning to
implement in the medium term:




    1.   Implementation of new Customs Law and revision of the existing list of prohibited goods and goods
         subject to import export license;
    2.   Develop National Trade Facilitation Plan;
    3.   Simplification and automation of Customs clearance and licensing and technical procedures; and
    4.   Establish National Single Window for Customs clearance.




                                                    - 38 -

101.        Among PRSO actions, those related to natural resource management are
important for mitigating macroeconomic and fiscal risks. For example, the drafting of the
new mining law and conducting consultations on the Extractive Industry Transparency
Initiative (EITI) are important steps in ensuring poverty reduction is achieved through
channeling of resource revenues to the poor (see Box 5).


                               Box 5: Main principles of the new Mining Law

With an objective to promote sustainable development of the mining industry and attract high quality
international and regional companies, the Government decided to improve legal and regulatory environment in
the mining sector through revising the existing mining law. With technical support from WB and IFC, the
Government is currently developing new mining law through closed consultation with key stakeholders.
Among others, the new draft law intends to address the following key issues:

    · Lack of transparency and predictability in granting exploration/mining licenses to investors;
    · Unclear regulations regarding the transfer of mining rights;
    · Unclear government's equity rights in mining projects;
    · Inconsistent, unpredictable and uncompetitive fiscal regime (royalties and income tax);
    · High complexity and confidential nature of current mineral exploration and production agreements
         (MEPAs) and other legal and regulatory issues affecting the development of sustainable mining
         industry in Lao PDR.

MEM is currently making good progress in developing draft new Mining Law; however, considering number
of issues being address in the draft law, more consultation with key stakeholders will be required before the
final draft is submitted to the Government and consequently the National Assembly for approval. To provide
opportunity for more consultation, there is possibility that the government could delay the date for submission
of the draft law to the National Assembly from original schedule (June) to December 2008.

In addition to on going process of revising the Mining Law, the Government is also interested to learn more
about Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). With support from donors, the Government intends to
explore possibilities in adapting EITI principles to hydro power and mining sectors in the future. Prime
Minister's Notice ref 08 issued on January 7, 2008 assigns MOF to coordinate with MEM on these issues.




                                            COMPONENT 2:
   PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT AND IMPROVING SERVICE DELIVERY

Public Finance Management

102.        The public financial management component of the PRSO4-7 builds on the
reform momentum gathered under the first series of PRSOs. Component elements
supported by the PRSO4-7 are a logical extension of the achievements and program direction
set out in the earlier series. This means that the reform elements will continue seamlessly,
and ensures that momentum of reforms will be sustained. After considerable progress
achieved in public financial management under PRSO1-3, these series will deepen the public
financial management reforms where they concern strengthening of the central-local fiscal
framework, improving budget planning and execution, implementation of the legislative acts
under the first series, and will focus on improving service delivery in health and education.
A summary of the PRSOs strategic approach to the public finance is presented in Box 6.




                                                     - 39 -

103.      Based on this strategic approach, PRSO4-7 commit to provision of holistic
support to the Government strategy in the broader program of reform in public
financial management. The PRSO4-7 components are not isolated elements. They are
integral and critical policy milestones of a larger public finance management strengthening
program (PFMSP) which is also supporting implementation of the Nam Theun-2 Revenue
Management Arrangements, where the Bank is providing significant staff time support and
financial resources. In this regard the Bank is also working with other development partners
to establish a multi-donor trust fund to support PFMSP implementation. Triggers and policy
actions for the Public Finance Management component under the PRSO 4-7 were reached at
by applying the following filters to PFMSP elements:

    · Centrality to key policy aspects in the government's on-going public finance
       management strengthening reform program (PFMSP). Each trigger and policy
       action represents a critical policy milestone and decision at the center of the core
       public finance management program. For example, implementation of the new
       Budget Law is being undertaken under the umbrella of the PFMSP. In this regard, the
       PRSO incorporates key milestones in the centralization and revenue sharing aspects
       under a logical program implementation framework like development of a Treasury
       Single Account framework;

    · Cross-sectoral in nature and not related to day-to-day business processes of
       government. Program elements should by nature impact cross-sectoral issues on a
       critical time path. In this regard for example, the revision and deployment of the chart
       of accounts and budget nomenclature is a trigger, which will impact on budget
       classification across the entire government and provide functional breakdown of
       budget spending by sectors;

    · Elements should be part of on-going Government reform elements, with
       technical assistance being provided to implementation. Each element of the
       PRSO4-7 policy matrix is derived from on-going Government reform program and
       also brings together reforms associated with external audit. A key aspect that the
       PRSO4-7 reinforces is that of mutual accountability. By this, it is meant that
       government has undertaken to carry out wide ranging reforms and in this regard
       development partners have pledged to provide resources for technical assistance to
       help implement these elements. All stakeholders will be accountable for delivering
       on promised actions

104.      By implementing the revised chart of accounts across government by
FY2008/09, the government will have IMF GFS-consistent information for the Budget
on a functional basis, at the sub-sector level. This information will be important in
determining the spending at a sub-sector functional level and subsequently critical for
implementation of a more equitable and efficient revenue sharing framework. The
Government is in the process of developing a budget norms system with the aim of
improving equity of social expenditures across provinces, and to target public finances more
squarely to functions within sectors.

     Box 6: Towards Improving Public Finance Management Framework: PRSO1-3 and PRSO 4-7

The PRSO is supporting strengthening the entire framework of public finance management including budget
planning, budget execution, financial reporting, and external audit.

Budget Planning ­ Improving Policy Consistency: Prior to the PRSO1-3 series, budgets in Lao were planned
incrementally, based on economic classification, and the links with sectoral policies was weak. With support
from the PRSO and complementary technical assistance, Lao PDR has revised the entire budget classification
system and developed a functional classification of the budget in order to have for the first time information on
the budget by function. And the PRSO4-7 series will help develop a system of budget norms that will ensure
budget allocations are based on sector strategies and the medium term expenditure framework.

Budget Execution ­ Strengthening Fiduciary Systems and Resource Flows: During PRSO1-3, the
government implemented several measures aimed at ensuring more realistic revenue projections (a key
recommendation of the PER 2006) and in controlling arrears on goods and services. The government managed
to ensure that revenue collections met targets for the last two years and also in bringing down arrears
significantly. Under the new Budget Law, the government is mandated to recentralize tax, customs, and the
Treasury Department. The government has decided to implement a Treasury Single Account (TSA) framework
to improving cash planning and fiduciary control. In this regard, PRSO4-7 aims to assist the Government in
developing and operationalizing the TSA framework, ensuring continued improvement in revenue
mobilization, whilst also supporting the broader Public Finance Management Strengthening Program. This will
ensure that over the course of the PRSO series there is significant improvement in the fiduciary framework and
ensuring that service delivery units receive funds in a timely manner within a robust control environment.

Financial Reporting ­ Fostering Transparency and Disclosure: Budget publication in Lao PDR used to be
limited to an annual budget execution report that was submitted to the Parliament more than two years after the
end of the fiscal year. With support from the PRSO, the Government has now instituted: (i) publication of
detailed budget execution reports within one year of the end of fiscal year; (ii) publishing summary of the
budget, including statutory funds within the first two quarters of the fiscal year; and (iii) developed tools for
publishing in year budget execution reports. The PRSO4-7 will continue its focus on ensuring that detailed
budget execution reports are published within six months of the end of the first year (as mandated by the
Budget Law) and that the coverage of the budget is gradually expanded to cover technical revenues too. The
PRSO4-7 and complimentary investment operations also focus on supporting the government in publishing in-
year budget execution reports. These measures will ensure greater transparency and disclosure of financial
information and improve public access to key fiscal information.

External Audit ­ Enhancing External Oversight of the Budget: The PRSO series is assisting the
independent State Audit Organization in strengthening external audit functions by supporting the development
and implementation of a comprehensive capacity building program, based on an Audit Peer Review by New
Zealand. The aim is to improve the quality and timeliness of financial audit and to assist the SAO in submitting
detailed audit reports to the National Assembly within six months of the end of the fiscal year, as stipulated
under the Budget Law.

The reforms being implemented by the Government of Lao PDR, and supported by the PRSO series along with
complimentary technical assistance and investment operations will ensure that all elements of the public
finance management framework are strengthened adequately for Lao PDR to also meet the Nam Theun 2
Revenue Management Arrangements.



105.       The Treasury Single Account (TSA) framework would aim to reduce the
potential of leakages of public funds, improving the audit function, and speeding up
delivery of funds in a timely manner to service delivery units. With establishment of a
Treasury Single Account, fiduciary risks related to difficulties in consolidating numerous
bank accounts, as well as those related to auditing and monitoring of funds in a timely
manner will be significantly reduced. The currently existing over five thousand bank
accounts will be consolidated into a "single serial" account managed and controlled by the


                                                      - 41 -

National Treasury. This will mean that fiduciary rules and regulations will be effectively
implemented, audit and transaction verification will be carried out in real-time, management
reporting on the government financial position will be done on a daily basis. The TSA is thus
a significant and positive development in improving the governance of public finances. See
Box 7 for the steps that need to be taken for TSA implementation.

                               Box 7: The way to the Treasury Single Account

The government has resolved to institute a Treasury Single Account framework to improve the management of
public funds. The TSA framework adoption is stipulated in the new organic Budget Law. In order to guide the
process of Treasury recentralization, the National Assembly has also mandated the Ministry of Finance to
submit a Law on National Treasury in 2008. Among other aspects, the draft Law is about the TSA operations.

In this regard, the government aims to:

    · conduct a survey of government bank accounts in 2008-9 to determine how many bank accounts are
          being operated by different government ministries and agencies,
    · develop regulations governing the Treasury Operations in 2008,
    · prepare a needs assessment for operating a TSA at the Bank of Lao and also to execute expenditures
          via an integrated government financial information system in 2008-9,
    · devise an appropriate TSA framework in 2008-9 and implementation strategy; and
    · to implement these over 2009-11.

In this regard, the Government has already advertised for technical assistance in developing a TSA framework
that would be applicable for Lao PDR. The Treasury Department is leading this work, with IDA's Financial
Management Capacity Building Project providing the needed financial resources.



106.        Improving operational effectiveness of the Government's budget monitoring
system ­ GFIS ­ is a critical component of the PFM agenda. In this regard assistance is
being provided to ensure there is real-time connectivity of GFIS to provinces, and the
reprogramming of core GFIS system to manage the new COA, and to produce consolidated
budget execution reports. This will lead to more comprehensive and timely reporting of
budget reports. At the same time, the government is conducting a technical needs assessment
for deployment of an integrated financial management information system and a
countrywide payment settlements system to further streamline reporting and improve the
fiduciary environment. The World Bank is working with the Asian Development Bank to
provide coordinated assistance for improving operational effectiveness of GFIS.

107.        The PRSO will support the efforts of the State Audit Organization (SAO) in
improving the quality and timeliness of financial audit. In this regard the SAO is in the
process of conducting an Audit Peer Review with SAO New Zealand. This Audit Peer
Review will identify areas for strengthening over time and will be used to develop a capacity
building plan. The World Bank, ADB and other development partners will provide support
to the SAO Lao PDR in implementing this plan, with the aim of improving the quality and
timeliness of financial audits.

108.        The central-local relations reforms envisaged in PRSO4-7 have been
progressing according to schedule. Box 8 describes in details the current status of this key
strategic reform agenda.



                                                     - 42 -

                           Box 8: Central-local relations reforms: current status

With the new organic Budget Law the National Assembly has mandated the recentralization of the National
Treasury, Tax and Customs departments, and developing a transparent and efficient revenue sharing
framework. In 2007 the Prime Minister issued an Order for this centralization work to proceed, and the
corresponding implementing guidelines were also issued by the Minister of Finance. This has put in place an
effective authorizing environment for the recentralization to take place.

The Ministry of Finance has developed a high level Master Plan for centralization of the three departments.
The Master Plan aims to pilot centralization for 4 provinces in FY2007/8 and to roll-out the process across the
country during FY2008/9 onwards. At the same time the work on developing the new revenue sharing
framework is ongoing. In this regard a technical team has been formed within the Ministry of Finance (led by
the Budget Department), and a high level policy team at the National Assembly.

As of now, the Government has started piloting the recentralization of the National Treasury, Tax, and Customs
departments in Savanakhet, Boulikamxay, Khammouane, and Vientiane provinces. Recentralization means that
staff control has been shifted to central departments, away from provincial governments and new regulations
have been developed for managing the workflow and staffing. This process of recentralization is being
overseen by the Prime Minister's Office, with close coordination of the Public Administration and Civil Service
Authority.

From October 2008 (FY2008/9) the Government intends to shift all staff control and the wage bill to the central
departments, thereby changing the staff reporting and management arrangements across the country. At the
same time each department is planning to implement information systems that would be needed for effective
management and process control. With regards to the revenue sharing framework, the government is proposing
to develop a set of high level norms to address issue of imbalances in per capita expenditures on social services
across provinces from FY2008/9 budgets, and then to refine this system in the latter years by having a much
more detailed set of norms.

The PRSO4-7 aims to support these reforms centrally, as they develop. The World Bank along with other
development partners will provide technical assistance and financing for needed infrastructure to ensure that
GOL receives adequate guidance and support in this regard. The Government of Lao PDR is also receiving
support from the Government of Vietnam in this critical area.



Improving Service Delivery

Education

109.       Lao PDR has seen substantial growth in primary and secondary enrollment in
the last 10 years. Recent data indicate that net primary school enrollment now stands at
around 83 percent. Improvements in net enrollment in recent years have to a significant
degree been driven by growth in female enrollment. Notwithstanding these achievements,
enrollment is often late, a low proportion of students complete the full cycle of primary and
secondary school, repetition rates remain high, and there are concerns about the quality of
education. Moreover, the poorest districts in Lao PDR are experiencing systematic
disadvantages in a range of educational indicators. While public expenditure on education
has recovered from the financial crisis of the late 1990s, the level of spending remains low
and heavily reliant on external financing.

110.       The GOL's education policy focuses on primary education and is set out in the
NGPES, the NSEDP, and the National Education-for-All Action Plan. The government


                                                     - 43 -

has established achievement of universal primary education by 2015 as a primary goal, with
reductions in gender and geographic disparities in access, improvement in the quality and
relevance of education, and improved education management as key strategies for achieving
this goal. While the policy framework for the education sector emphasizes primary
education, it also establishes priorities in lower secondary education, non-formal and adult
education, teacher training, upper secondary, preschool, tertiary education, and technical
education and vocational training. Taken together, the Government's policy priorities in
education signify a substantial financing gap relative to current financing levels.

111.      The actions in Education sector envisioned under PRSO4-7 will create
conditions for improved strategic prioritization in the allocation of resources and more
effective performance management. The PRSO actions include the following:

    · Identify strategic direction and resource requirements. The completion of the
        Education for All Mid-Decade Assessment (EFA MDA), in the context of the
        development of a broader Education Sector Development Framework, provides an
        opportunity for the MOE to take stock of achievements and challenges in the sector,
        and to identify future strategic direction and resource needs.

    · Ensure that strategic priorities are reflected in the annual budget process (and
        eventual budget allocations), and that key components of recurrent spending are
        increasingly financed from domestic sources. These actions are envisioned to
        complete in the later years of the Program.

    · Improve the comprehensiveness and reliability of education information and
        integrate it into the planning and budgeting process. A second set of actions focus
        on the Education Management Information System (EMIS). Improvement of the
        EMIS is a fundamental step to improve performance monitoring and management in
        the sector, and one of the requirements for the MOE to access NT2 revenues in the
        future.

Health

112.      Health outcomes in Lao PDR are improving, but significant challenges remain.
According to available data,14 under-five mortality fell from 163 per 1,000 live births in
1990 to 75 in 2006. This signifies an annual rate of reduction of nearly 4.9 percent, putting
Lao PDR on track to meet the MDG target related to child mortality (requiring a 4.3 percent
annual reduction). Despite these improvements, important health challenges remain.
Mortality and morbidity remain very high, especially among the rural population. At least in
part, this reflects low levels of utilization of health services (including of key preventive
services such as immunization). Financial barriers and a lack of qualified personnel in rural
and remote areas comprise key constraints to increasing utilization.

113.      The government's policy framework for the health sector emphasizes equity
and improved access to primary care. NSEDP endorses the MDGs, establishing improved
health outcomes and enhanced equity in access to basic curative and preventive health


14www.childinfo.org


                                              - 44 -

services (in terms of gender, economic situation, religion, ethnicity, and geography) as key
goals for the sector. The Plan recognizes that a growing reliance on external financing and
user fees entails risks in terms of sustainability and equity. NSEDP calls for increased
government spending, but also for more diversified health financing arrangements, including
piloting and expansion of, inter alia, compulsory health insurance, equity funds, and
community based health insurance. The NSEDP also emphasizes the need to strengthen
human resource management and target attention to priority districts. These goals and
priorities resonate well with the CAS outcomes, which concern government spending on
health and access to health services.

114.       The PRSO4-7 seeks to support the government's policy framework by
focusing on key constraints to improving the performance of the health system. A first
set of actions focus on health financing arrangements, including the establishment of a forum
and process for developing a health financing strategy; piloting of equity funds to promote
access for the poor; routine monitoring of key performance indicators in the main health
financing schemes; and strengthened evaluation of health financing reforms to support policy
making. These actions are expected to contribute to a consensus among key stakeholders
about the merits and demerits of different health financing reform options, and, in the longer
term, to a health financing system that effectively promotes equitable access and financial
protection. A second set of actions focus on the Health Management Information System,
with the aim of establishing an institutionalized process for routine reporting on key health
indicators by 2011.

115.       The Table below summarizes triggers for PRSO4 and progress made by appraisal
and negotiations.

                            Table 3: Summary of Prior Actions for PRSO4
Prior Action 1: The Government approved the negative list of activities as part of Enterprise Law
implementation
The Enterprise Law is aimed to streamline business start-up procedures through shifting from the current
practice of requiring all firms to obtain prior approval from relevant government sectoral agencies before
business registration, to a system in which firms outside the Negative List automatically register with the
MOIC and are subsequently regulated by the appropriate line ministries.

In 2006, the Prime Minister issued order No. 37/PMO on the Implementation of the Enterprise Law, which
assigns MOIC to lead and coordinate the relevant line ministries to implement the Enterprise Law and sets out
a timeline for developing the "negative list". In response, the MOIC issued Instruction No. 1577, which
established the task force to coordinate the process for developing the "negative list". In August 2007, after
extensive consultative process, the MOIC task force submitted the final draft PM Instructive Order on the
"negative list", consisting of 62 four digit activities from 9 economic sectors, to the Prime Minister's Office for
approval. Government Secretariat issued official notification to the Minister of Industry and Commerce on
November 12, 2007 (Ref. No. 1930/GS), which indicates that the PM has approved the proposal on
establishment of the Negative List of Business Activities under the under Enterprise Law and the MOIC is
instructed to implement the Negative List. The PM Decree No.68 on Negative List was issued on April 28,
2008.
Prior Action 2: MOIC abolished the requirement to follow the approved annual import-export plan and
abolished licensing requirements for all goods outside the revised control list

The Prior Action is intended to facilitate cross-border trade in Lao PDR by reducing number of unnecessary
steps, documentation requirements and procedures for trading across borders.

MOIC Notice No. 0285 abolished licensing requirements for all goods outside the control list and the most
recent MOIC Order No. 0453 on facilitation of import and export (issued on March 26, 2007) further

streamlined import and export procedures by stopping the obsolete practice where companies are required to
submit an annual plan of imports for approval and which then are deducted on a shipment-by-shipment basis at
the ports of entry/Customs warehouse.
Prior Action 3: BPO continued monitoring of SOEs, and completed independent external audits for
FY05 and FY06 for four Phase II and three Phase I SOEs
The intention of this Prior Action is to continue the Government's effort to further improve the situation of the
largest loss-making SOEs, starting with strengthened monitoring according to international standards.

BPO has carried out its monitoring and evaluation of progress of SOEs under restructuring on quarterly basis.
The BPO has received audit reports from the auditing firms signed by the SOEs management.
Prior Action 4: MOF, Ministry of Energy and Mining (MEM) and EdL agreed upon the quantum and a
plan to settle arrears from GOL entities to EdL up to September 2006, within implementation of the
Action Plan for Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector
This Prior Action is intended to continue repayment of Government agencies electricity arrears to the state-
owned utility company Electricité du Laos (EDL), within an Action Plan that is intended to ensure that the
EDL is financially sustainable in the future.

The Government agreed on a quantum and schedule of repayments. The MOF and EdL have agreed upon
K38.4 billion in arrears for FY2005/06 and a schedule of repayment in three installments of K12.8 billion each
in FY2008/09, FY2009/10, and FY2010/11. The Government also introduced measures to curb future arrears,
including more appropriate budget allocation for electricity payments.
Prior Action 5: MoF issued a Ministerial Decision requiring ministries and provinces to prepare
FY2008/9 budget estimates based on revised Chart of Accounts (CoA) and Budget Nomenclature
The intention of this Prior Action is that the Budget for FY2008/9 is prepared based on the new Chart of
Accounts structure and the updated Budget Nomenclature. This will ensure that the Budget for FY2008/9
provides information on sectoral programs. This Prior Action is critical for meeting the Nam Theun2 Revenue
Management Arrangements, which require that eligible programs be clearly identified in the Government's
budget classification system.

The Ministry of Finance has finalized the detailed chart of accounts code structure as well as aligned the budget
nomenclature. In October 2007 the reprogramming of GFIS was completed to ensure that the system could
handle the new chart of accounts coding structure effectively. MoF has also started training and pilot testing of
the revised chart of accounts for the education sector in November 2007 for Budget of 2007/08. The MOF has
approved an economic classification of the COA, and the Minister of Finance issued a Ministerial Decision No.
0750/MOF for its implementation country-wide on April 1, 2008.
Prior Action 6: MOF published FY2005/6 actual budget and the FY2007/8 summary budget with: (i)
administrative classification; (ii) priority expenditure sectors; (iii) summary data on statutory funds;
and (iv) technical revenues for health and education sectors at central level, and published a summary
within the second quarter of the fiscal year
The intention is to ensure that there is enhanced dissemination of timely information on budget execution and
planning.

The Budget Department of the Ministry of Finance has compiled and printed the actual performance for
FY2005/6. The summary of the Budget FY2007/08 has been collated for: (i) administrative classification; (ii)
priority sector expenditures; (iii) summary of statutory funds; and (iv) technical revenues. The summary has
been printed.
Prior Action 7: Ministry of Education presented the Education for All Mid-Decade Assessment to the
Education and Gender Sector Working Group
The preparation of the MDA report is an opportunity for the MOE to take stock of achievements and
challenges in improving education outcomes, and to identify future strategic direction and resource needs.

The MOE has prepared a revised draft of the MDA report and presented it to the Working Group on March 13,
2008.


MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

116.        The monitoring and evaluation framework is presented in the last column of
the Action Matrix and in the Annex indicators table. A comprehensive set of indicators


                                                      - 46 -

tied to results is set up for each sub-component of the operation. In order to balance the need
to monitor the results of the actions in the Policy Action Matrix with the need of more
general monitoring in each sector, the indicators are divided into two categories: results
framework indicators and more general monitoring indicators; these are presented in plain
text and italics correspondingly in Annex 2 and Annex 3. A third category of indicators are
those proposed by EC within their new approach to EC's budget support and are now being
considered by the Lao PDR (these are underlined in Annex 2, see also paragraph 84).

117.      The outcome indicators for measuring the impact of the policy reform in
investment climate, competitiveness and business development Component 1 are
developed in four groups, corresponding to the four subcomponents of policy actions and
triggers:

    · The impact of the reform in creating enabling business environment and attracting
        quality investment will be measured by simplification of regulations for business
        entry through reduction in number of days to start a business and growth in business
        entry rate (new registrations as percentage of total), and number of hydro power
        facilities in compliance with social and environmental standards defined in the NHP;

    · Progress in reducing barriers and proceeding with implementation of international
        and regional agreements will be measured by number of days to import and export,
        reduction in the mean import, export, and transit clearance times; reduction in the
        number of steps to clear commercial shipments, and growth in total trade as
        percentage of GDP;

    · Results of improving the performance and monitoring of state-owned enterprises
        (SOEs) will be evaluated based on reduction in number of loss making SOEs under
        restructuring program and reduction in aggregate loss of the whole SOE sector, and
        stock of arrears from GOL entities to EDL for electricity usage; and

    · Progress on enhancing commercialization and transparency of state-owned
        commercial banks will be measured by reduction in level of NPL in the state-owned
        banking system, and increase in share of credit provided to the private sector.

118.      The outcomes of the public financial management-related component relay on
a range of parallel activities in the sector. By supporting PFMSP in general and some
central elements of the program in particular, the PSRO4-7 will aim to balance appropriately
the need to keep focus on the overall improvements in the PFM framework, whilst
concentrating on the key elements. Therefore by supporting key elements of the PFMSP and
providing adequate implementation support and technical assistance to PFMSP overall, the
program will aim to:



    · Improve the credibility of budget planning, and transparency and
        comprehensiveness in financial reporting: Strengthen the budget planning process
        in order for more equitable resources for social sectors across the country. The
        intention of this sub-component is to ensure that: (1) the entire public finance


                                             - 47 -

       management reform agenda continues to be conducted under a unified PFMSP
       umbrella that is anchored within an effective implementation structure; (2) the
       Budget is prepared based on the revised classification system (Chart of Accounts and
       budget nomenclature) and there is enhanced dissemination of timely information on
       budget execution and planning; (3) the Budget provides information on sectoral
       allocations by respective sectoral programs; (4) transparency is enhanced by
       publishing consolidated in-year budget execution reports; and (5) government is able
       to meet the Nam Theun2 Revenue Management Arrangements, which require that
       eligible programs be clearly identified in the Government's budget classification
       system.

   · Improve transparency of the intergovernmental fiscal relations, and faster
       budget execution: Support the efforts of the Government in centralization of
       National Treasury, customs and tax administration, and in improving the budget
       execution systems for delivering timely funds to service delivery units and ensure
       that: (1) a Treasury single account framework is developed and operationalized in
       order to improve fiduciary control; (2) customs and tax administration centralization
       happens effectively in order to strengthen administration of the revenue policy; (3)
       the Budget Law is backed-up with enabling implementing decree(s) for developing a
       framework for revenue sharing; (4) an improved legal framework for procurement
       and a procurement monitoring system is established; (5) debt reporting capacity of
       the debt management unit of the external finance department is strengthened and put
       in place a format consistent with CSDRMS system.

   · Improve Timelines and Quality of Financial Audit. Increase quality and improve
       timeliness of the external financial audit by assisting the SAO in developing a
       comprehensive Audit Peer Review based capacity building and audit strengthening
       plan. This would help the SAO embark on a well articulated capacity development
       plan that could be supported by development partners. Improving financial audit
       quality and timeliness is a necessary pillar of a well functioning public finance
       management system.

119.     The outcome indicators for measuring the impact of the policy reform in this
component are based on the overall public finance management reform program and
the specific policy actions and triggers proposed over the series The Government has
decided to utilize the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Performance
Measurement Framework (PMF)15 to monitor progress of the PFMSP. In this regard a
baseline assessment is planned for FY2008/09 and then in FY2010/11. The assessment in
2008 will provide the baseline of all the indicators. It is expected that with continued
implementation of the PFMSP the government will be able to attain improved outcomes
across a range of indicators. The specific elements of the PEFA PMF in-focus for the
PRSO4-7 series would relate more to:

       · A. PFM-Out-Turns ­ Credibility of the Budget (Four Indicators): By supporting
           measures aimed at improving treasury management, and customs and tax

           administration centralization directly, and by supporting PFMSP elements on
           improving macro-fiscal forecasting it is expected that out-turns of the budget will
           be more in-line with estimates as the aggregate level, as well at the at the more
           detailed levels. At the moment, on aggregate the budget outturns differ by
           between 5-10 percent of the approved estimates. Elements within the PRSO4-7
           support improved resource planning (development of budget norms) and
           implementation of the Budget Law. At the same time support towards
           implementation of the PFMSP will ensure that overall budget forecasting
           capacity is built. It is expected that the improvements shall be observed in at least
           2 out of the 4 indicators.

       · B. Key Cross-Cutting Issues ­ Comprehensiveness and Transparency (Six
           Indicators): This PRSO series is supporting the deployment of the revised chart of
           accounts and budget nomenclature that is fully consistent with the IMF
           Government Financial Statistics on the reporting front. At the same time support
           is directly being provided to upgrade of the Government's budget monitoring and
           recording system (GFIS) together with publication of budget information ­ which
           over the course of the series will expand to cover all technical revenues and
           statutory funds. Concurrently, the implementation of the budget law will ensure
           that there is more transparency in the intergovernmental fiscal system. This
           would mean that by end of this proposed PRSO series, the government would
           expect to see improvements in at least 4 indicators.

       · C. Budget Cycle (18 Indicators): By directly supporting the implementation of
           capacity building measures at the Sate Audit Organization and procurement
           reform, as they develop over the series time period. In this regard, the SAO is
           conducting an Audit Peer Review (APR) with the New Zealand Audit Office. The
           APR will help develop an audit capacity strengthening plan, which will be
           implemented with support from the PRSO. This will ensure that over the series,
           the timeliness and comprehensiveness of the audit report will improve and that
           the SAO will have the requisite capacity to follow-up on audit recommendations.
           Therefore the PRSO would be supporting directly measures aimed at the three
           indicators under sub set C(iv) External Scrutiny and Audit. On the procurement
           side, the work will be on enhancing competition, value for money, and controls in
           procurement. At the same time by supporting the PFMSP more broadly, the
           operation will also be contributing to improving other measures within the project
           cycle. During the proposed PRSO series, it is expected that at least 4 of the 18
           indicators would have improved.

120.     Over the proposed PRSO4-7 series it is expected that at least 10 of the 28
PEFA indicators will improve. The PRSO4-7 is not directly supporting measures aimed at
improving donor practices (Section D of the PEFA framework). At this time the Government
has not included external development assistance harmonization within PFMSP either,
therefore the PRSO outcome indicator framework is not including this subset of indicators.

121.     In the education sector, indicators reflect important intermediate outcomes in
the government's efforts to improve education performance; they also correspond


                                              - 49 -

closely to those defined in the CAS. Specifically, the PRSO will track the level of recurrent
budget for the education sector, provision of textbooks and recurrent financing for schools in
priority districts, and the completeness and timeliness of EMIS data and reporting. Given the
prominence of the primary net enrollment rate as a policy goal in the NSEDP, the PRSO4-7
will also monitor progress on this indicator, as well as disparities in primary enrollment
between priority and non-priority districts. Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that enrollment
rates reflect a number of demand-side factors that are unlikely to be responsive to policy
interventions in the short to medium term.

122.      In the health sector, indicators focus on intermediate steps to improving health
outcomes in the longer term. This includes a focus on the coverage of different health
financing schemes aimed at improving access to health care, utilization of health services,
coverage and timeliness of HMIS reporting, and the level of government recurrent spending
on health. With the anticipated improvements in the HMIS system, it will be possible to
track these indicators on a routine basis.


                             VII.  OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

123.    The implementation of the PRSO program is led by the PRSO Steering
Committee, which is chaired by the Minister of Finance. The Steering Committee is
chaired by the Minister of Finance and supported by a PRSO Secretariat chaired by the Vice
Minister of Finance; both bodies include representation from relevant ministries. In
particular, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Committee for Planning and Investment and its
National Statistics Center, Ministries of Education and Health, Ministry of Energy and
Mining, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, MCTPC,
Bank of Lao PDR, Prime Minister Office and its Business Promotion Office, PACSA, and
other agencies are represented.

124.    Progress with the PRSO program implementation is monitored with reference
to the PRSO Program Matrix, updated annually as part of PRSO negotiations.
Accordingly, this Program Document for the second series of four PRSOs includes a policy
reform matrix designed and updated jointly by Government, WB and co-financing donors, to
reflect evolving policies and the pace of implementation of the NSEDP and the current status
of progress. In addition to monitoring of progress against policy actions, there is close
monitoring of macroeconomic developments, as well as poverty and social indicators.

125.    As is standard practice for PRSOs, the impact of this PRSO series is evaluated
in accordance with a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework covering all four
operations in the series and established by the Government and IDA at the time of PRSO4.
The end-of-series outcomes expected under each sub-component of the PRSO program are
recorded in the PRSO matrix (Annex 2), and are presented in more detail in Annex 3.

126.    The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) is leading the preparation of an
action-plan to strengthen the Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (M&E) for the
NSEDP. This framework however is not yet strong enough to be fully transferred into the
PRSO. Nevertheless, the two monitoring systems share the majority of the outcome


                                             - 50 -

indicators and their sectoral focus is fully aligned. In cooperation with the WBI-EG the Bank
is supporting the progress in strengthening the M&E framework for the NSEDP, by
providing capacity building to the MPI, key line-ministries, pilot provinces, and to the
National Assembly staff. An essential part of these capacity building activities includes
support for the sector monitoring plans under the NSEDP. As far as possible, outcome
indicators listed in the PRSO matrix are identical with the outcome indicators of the NSEDP
monitoring plans drafted by the line ministries, including ministries of Health and Education.

127.    M&E activities are coordinated by the PRSO Steering Committee and Technical
Secretariat, supported by the NSC, with participation of other development partners.
However, the World Bank and other donors monitor progress via continuous dialogue
throughout the year, including periodic missions. The IMF continues to conduct enhanced
supervision, supplementing annual Article IV missions with mid-year assessments. Regular
discussions also take place with the donor community within the Macroeconomic, Private
Sector Development and Trade Working Group as part of the RTM process, as well as
separate and more detailed discussions on each part of the PRSO in other RTM working
groups. Donors, especially co-financing donors, participate in missions, and retreats. The
WB drive for joint AAA work has also contributed to consensus building among the donor
community and led to more efficient use of resources.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASPECTS

128.    Several beneficiary-related outcomes of the undertaken reforms stand out based
on the results of recent AAA work done by the country team. Overall, economic growth
and improvements in infrastructure and social sphere have benefited poor the most. Poverty
was reduced the most within the poorest districts. Impact incidence shows that minorities,
while still remained disadvantaged, have benefited on average more than other groups. The
ongoing studies, including the PSIA, uplands study and social inclusion work, will nuance
this picture.

129.    The Lao Poverty Assessment (LAOPA) was completed in 2006. It finds strong
evidence of a relationship between poverty and the following characteristics. It finds a strong
correlation between poverty and rural infrastructure: the poor are more likely to live in a
village without electricity (45 percent) or a primary school (7 percent). It also finds that the
education of the household head and spouse are strongly correlated with poverty. For
example, the share of heads of household without any schooling is 75 percent larger in
2002/3 than among the non-poor. This compares with only about 50 percent in 1992/3,
suggesting that some schooling has become more important for escaping poverty. LAOPA
thus tends to confirm the poverty reduction benefits of prioritizing sectors such as basic
education and rural electrification, as is done in the PRSP.

130.    Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA, FY2008) is a qualitative study that
aims to understand more about how Government's poverty reduction strategies are
translated into implementation at community level. In particular, it focused on the degree
to which they are effective in closing poverty gaps between ethnic groups, and between men
and women. The study looks at the government's strategy to focus poverty reduction efforts
at the 47 poorest districts which are the areas where these gaps are also the greatest, at how
public expenditure allocations have been reformed in response to this strategy and at how it


                                              - 51 -

translates into inclusive actions at the community level. It was anticipated that a better
understanding of how this strategy manifested itself in activities on the ground would
contribute to information on the potential social impacts of policy based lending, and provide
recommendations for management of Nam Theun 2 revenues, as well as providing
information on the nexus of sectoral strategies and investment projects, with geographic
targeting.

131.    The PSIA concludes that the government's policy to target poverty reduction
efforts on the poorest districts provides a good basis for a sound, socially inclusive,
poverty reduction policy. The study also found that there was active implementation of
policies to stabilize shifting cultivation, consolidate villages, and develop focal areas, and
that while some people benefited from these policies, others, especially the more vulnerable
groups, suffered some negative impacts. However, the evidence and data in the study were
not enough to provide conclusive evidence of the public or other funds causing these
negative impacts.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

132.    The 2005/6 Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (IFA) found that the overall
fiduciary risk is considered to be high due to weakness in the basic financial
management systems of government. Despite the fact that there are some built in controls
within the government's financial management system, there is still insufficient transparency
related to public finances. The Government's decentralization initiative needs to be
supported with a sufficiently robust institutional framework that clearly defines the new
responsibilities at lower levels. The oversight functions and the State Audit Organization
need to be strengthened. The accounting and auditing profession and related institutions need
to be developed. To address these deficiencies, the government is actively implementing a
program of reforms under its Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program
(PEMSP). Progress made under PRSO1-3 and planned under PRSO4-7 is contributing to
reducing the fiduciary risk, but this still remains high. Major recommendations aimed at
improving the public financial management systems, including the efficiency and
transparency of use of public resources, are reflected in the PEMSP and supported by the
PRSO program. The challenge will be in effectively implementing the PEMSP, and in active
monitoring of the strengthening program initiatives by the Government is critical.
Strengthening external audit function and public financial management systems is a medium
to long term process monitored under this series. At the Ministry of Finance's request, a
ROSC is currently under preparation, and its concept is described in paragraph 74.

133.    The last IMF Safeguard Assessment of the Bank of Lao PDR which was
conducted in 2003, classified the risk as being medium-high in all five categories on which
the assessment was based (external audit mechanism, legal structure and independence,
financial reporting framework, internal audit mechanism and internal control system).
Progress on the safeguard recommendations has been slow, and the agreed joint audit of the
Bank of Lao PDR's 2003 and 2004 accounts by the State Auditor and an international audit
firm has not been done. The authorities have indicated that they are not in a position to
implement this agreement on the audits.




                                             - 52 -

134.   In view of the high fiduciary risks, it is recommended that the Recipient will
maintain a dedicated deposit account for the proceeds of the Grant, and will report on the
funds flow of the dedicated deposit account. The Government will, if considered necessary
by IDA, allow an independent external audit of the dedicated foreign currency deposit
account.

DISBURSEMENT, REPORTING AND AUDITING ASPECTS

135.   A single tranche grant of SDR 6.1 million (US$10 million equivalent) will be
made available upon grant effectiveness, anticipated for September 2008. The recipient is
the Lao People's Democratic Republic. The closing date of the operation will be February
2009.

136.   The Grant proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the
development policy program and the stipulated release conditions of PRSO4. The grant
proceeds will not be tied to any specific purchases. However, such proceeds will not be used
for ineligible expenditures. As was practice under PRSO1-3, the Recipient will maintain a
dedicated Deposit Account in US dollars at the Bank of Laos (which is the Central Bank of
the Government), as part of the general foreign currency reserves of the government, and the
Grant proceeds will be deposited by IDA into that Deposit Account. An equivalent amount
will be converted into local currency and credited to a Central Treasury account that is used
to finance budget expenditures.

137.   Through the Ministry of Finance, the Government will report to IDA the
amount received into the US Dollar Deposit Account at the Bank of Laos, and the
amounts withdrawn from the Deposit Account and the equivalent amounts credited in local
currency to the Central Treasury Account available to finance budgeted expenditures. The
report on the amounts withdrawn will include the date and name/number of the
government's bank account into which the local currency amounts have been deposited. The
report on receipts and disbursements from the Deposit accounts is to be submitted to IDA
within 45 days of the final disbursement of the grant proceeds from the Deposit Account.

138.   The Government will ensure that the grant proceeds are used for budgeted
public expenditures except for purposes or items on IDA's "negative list" as agreed
during negotiations and specified in the Financing Agreement. If the proceeds of the
Grant or any part of the Grant proceeds are used for ineligible purposes, as defined in the
Financing Agreement, the Bank will require the Government, upon notification from IDA, to
refund the amount directly to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such requests shall be
cancelled. Upon request by IDA, the dedicated account and related fund flows to and from
this account will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and in accordance
with terms of reference acceptable to IDA, and the audit report will be provided to IDA
within four months after IDA's request for such an audit. The processes and controls
described above reflect the findings of the IMF's safeguard assessment as regards the central
bank control environment in making use of a dedicated deposit account for the foreign
exchange proceeds of the Bank's disbursement.




                                            - 53 -

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

139.    The environmental impacts of this operation are not expected to be significant.
Nevertheless, certain environmental impacts might arise since PRSO3 supports a wide range
of policy areas and interventions. While some PRSO supported actions may have potential
environmental implications (such as SOE restructuring), given that SOE sector is small, and
impacts will be low (the program only covers nine enterprises directly, and no massive lay-
offs or construction are envisioned). While trade liberalization may potentially have an
impact on the environment, this operation covers only first steps and regulatory reform
aimed directly at easing cross-border movements of goods, rather than at major trade
reforms. In fact, the investment climate improvement program would not touch upon
environmentally-sensitive sectors, such as forestry or mining since these sectors are
regulated by separate legislation. The impacts therefore are expected to be low.

140.    PRSO4 continues to support major policy and institutional reform in natural
resources management. Regarding infrastructure, the PRSO program provides support to
EdL to implement the Action Plan for the Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector. Since
the major source of power comes from hydropower with potentially high environment and
social impacts, the government is working toward ensuring compliance with environmental
and social safeguards. Support from international partners is available through the Nam
Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project, Nam Theun Social and Environment Project, and the Lao
Environment and Social Project. In the context of NT2, the Government has enacted the
National Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability of the Hydropower Sector to
ensure that future development of the hydropower projects complies with environment and
social safeguards.

141.    The PRSO program is supported by the Poverty and Environment Nexus (PEN)
study; the Lao Environmental and Social (LEnS) project; NT2 environmental, economic and
social work; the Poverty and Environment Nexus study series and the Lao Environment
Monitor. With respect to the relationship between budgeting and environmental impacts, the
2005/6 Public Expenditure Review has a chapter devoted to environmental issues.

142.    The Lao Environmental and Social project is supporting the development of the
regulatory framework for the hydropower sector, and in relation to other large development
projects. Sub-grants to support implementation of the National Policy on the Environmental
and Social Sustainability of the Hydropower Sector and the Resettlement Policy are due to
get underway in the coming weeks. A further sub-grant will help to develop a river basin
organization to manage water resources in the Nam Theun / Nam Kading basin, contributing
to the development of a national river basin management model, alongside ABD/AFD efforts
in the Nam Ngum basin.

143.    The Nam Theun 2 project remains the primary vehicle for on-the-ground
implementation of social and environmental safeguards related to hydropower development,
and is providing considerable practical experience and potential for capacity building in
relation to a broad range of social and environmental activities, including detailed and long-
term village consultations, protected area management, community forestry, community
fisheries, development of market-based agriculture, and development of links between
micro-credit schemes and the formal financial sector.

144.    Several studies and activities are currently under way, and will contribute to the
work under PRSO4-7 series. A piece of regional AAA on the Social and Economic Drivers
of Wildlife Trade in East Asia currently underway will also contribute to the understanding
of trade issues in relation to conservation. LEnS funds could be used to examine or address
environmental issues related to the PRSO activities. Future Environment Monitors could also
be addressed towards relevant topics. In mining, a study is currently being undertaken that
will bring technical assistance into the mining industry to help the government deal with
impacts of the growing mining operations, including environmental impacts.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

145.    Many risks highlighted in the first series have not materialized and importance
of the highest ranked of these risks has substantially diminished during and because of
the implementation of the PRSO1-3. In particular, the risks related to commitment to
reform and inter-agency coordination have come down in their probability and importance,
while capacity constrains have come up and became a possible binding constraint. This was
due to the extensive dialog on PRSO issues and work conducted on improving inter-agency
coordination, as well as targeted technical assistance that has been provided during the
previous series of operations. The quality of macroeconomic management and commitment
to reforms has also improved during the last series, indicating better capacity and openness.

146.    Nevertheless, the Lao PDR PRSO series remains a high risk program. The
potential payoff--Lao PDR remaining on its current growth and poverty reduction trajectory
and making progress towards Millennium Development Goals--is substantial enough to
justify this risk. However, significant risk mitigation will be necessary. Four main risks have
been identified which could affect the impact of the proposed operation and PRSO program.
These are set out below together with mitigating factors:


        (a) Weak public financial management systems indicate high fiduciary risk. This
            risk is mitigated by the fact that the government is now in the process of
            recentralizing budget execution and revenue administration functions, and the
            PRSO is supporting this program frontally. Continuing fiscal risks could result in
            the diversion of PRSO funds away from PRS priorities, and to cover losses of
            State Commercial Banks and State-Owned Enterprises. This risk is partially
            mitigated by program of monitoring of SOE and SOCB performance embedded in
            PRSO program matrix. Closer implementation support by Bank staff on PFM
            issues.

        (b) Severe capacity constraints in the civil service, due to the lack of adequate
            qualified personnel, and low pay and incentives. This risk is partially mitigated
            by working with government to outsource non-core functions like ICT
            connectivity for GFIS, supporting the government in formulating an appropriate
            pay and compensation policy, and provision of additional resources for PRSO4-7
            implementation through a WB project (FMCBP), Mining and Energy Sectoral
            TA, TA provided by other donors, and in particular ­ by an application for a
            PHRD grant for PRSO7 preparation. Consistent with the lessons learned form
            previous series, the team makes sure that TA is available for each sub-component
            and action in the action matrix, and donors work together to identify capacity


                                             - 55 -

            building needs: additional resources made available to PRSO include application
            for PHRD grant (which is crucial to success of the program), bilateral aid from
            Japan, Australia, and EC, and aligned TA provided through multi-donor trust
            funds administered by the WB on behalf of other donors. The CAS includes a
            pillar on capacity building and the WB is leading donor efforts in this area.

        (c) Provincial autonomy without adequate monitoring and accountability
            mechanisms hampers implementation of national policies and an equitable
            distribution of resources. This risk is mitigated through a technical assistance on
            public financial management that focuses on building systems for better central-
            local relations management and increased central control over expenditure
            execution and revenue collection.

        (d) Uneven commitment to reforms in the past has resulted in poor policy
            implementation performance. Recently, however, the Government has shown
            increasingly stronger commitment to reforms reflected in improved performance
            on PRSO3, extensive dialog on NSEDP/PRS, strengthening the central-local
            fiscal framework, and a commitment to a range of for trade and investment
            climate related reforms.

147.    While these risks will continue to persist, mitigation measures have proven
successful in the past and it is believed that further reduction in importance of the PFM and
capacity constraints will be observed. Macroeconomic risks stem mostly from the external
environment, and therefore are more difficult to mitigate through in-country measures; the
Government is working on improvement of its monetary policy responses and on exchange
rate risks mitigation.

20It is important to remember when looking at NPL numbers that as classification of assets by the banks improves, the numbers may change which could result in an
increase at one point, or slower decreases than expected due to the increased number from which the banks will calculate.
21This calculation is based upon the definition of private sector currently in use in Lao PDR by the banks. Businesses of less than 100% ownership by Government
may today be classified as private in some instances.
