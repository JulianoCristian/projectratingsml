project sustainability was\n            likely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also a satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the pace and quality of implementation was lacking\n            during the initial years, but once the project organization\n            took roots and became operational, it worked satisfactorily\n            and resulted in the satisfactory achievement of the\n            financial, physical and development objectives of the\n            project. However, a more substantial role of the provincial\n            Kanwil of the Ministry of Agriculture in providing technical\n            back-up will have improved the quality of implementation of\n            the agricultural components. While these decentralized\n            implementation arrangements helped in satisfactory physical\n            implementation of the overall project, as well as provided\n            opportunities for 'learning by doing' to a large\n            number of local level agencies and staff, the wide range of\n            activities under the provincial component strained the\n            limited capabilities of the local level institutions and\n            affected the quality of implementation and their development\n            impact. Block financial allocations appeared attractive due\n            to their flexibility and being demand responsive, but they\n            also promoted too many loosely hanging activities without\n            proper management and technical back-up, and often with\n            doubtful viability. While maintaining flexibility in funding\n            and implementation arrangements will be important for\n            ensuring participatory and sustainable development, the\n            critical need to establish criteria or parameters for the\n            selection of project activities on the basis of realistic\n            assessment of priorities can not be over emphasized."}, "docdt": "1995-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
