Barat (NTB) and Nusa\n            Tenggara Timur (NTT). The project will provide funds to\n            sectoral agencies for farming systems research, pilot cotton\n            development, cattle development, and national and provincial\n            road improvement in NTT; and it will channel funds to the\n            provinces for agricultural activities complementing sectoral\n            programs and for two small pilot area development\n            components. Research and road improvement will lay the\n            foundation for increased agricultural production, and pilot\n            components will test new technologies and new organizational\n            arrangements for supporting agricultural development. A\n            component, cost-shared with UNDP and executed by their\n            Office of Project Execution, will identify investment\n            options in Southeast Sulawesi and Irian Jaya and provide\n            technical assistance to the provinces.  Technical assistance\n            for agricultural development components will be provided\n            under a grant from the Australian Development Assistance\n            Bureau (ADAB), and selected rural roads in NTB will be\n            improved under a roads project assisted by the Asian\n            Development Bank (ADB)."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
