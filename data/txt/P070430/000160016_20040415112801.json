performance ratings are as\n            follows: Outcome is satisfactory, sustainability is likely,\n            institutional development impact is substantial, and the\n            performances of both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            satisfactory. These are some of the lessons learned: 1)\n            Planning the project more deliberately as a standard\n            investment loan would have enabled better preparation of\n            procurement and institutional arrangements before appraisal.\n            2) Procurement planning must be done from the beginning. In\n            addition, it would have been preferable to have drawings,\n            specifications and terms of reference for the first year of\n            implementation prepared before appraisal. Modum operandi\n            between the Project Coordination Unit and the implementing\n            agencies should be written in the operational manual. 3)\n            Gabion works for slope stabilization and riverbank\n            protection proved to be an effective, easy and\n            labor-intensive way to implement mitigation works. 4) It\n            would have been preferable to process the various\n            loan/credit for the different OECS countries as separate\n            projects part of a broader program, but not integrated into\n            one horizontal APL. In the Bank system, APL phases each\n            correspond to one project (i.e. with one Project\n            Identification Number (P0 number)) which does not allow for\n            a segregation of reporting and accounting on individual\n            sub-projects. The task team had important problem at the\n            beginning of the program to obtain differentiated P0 number\n            for each country. 5) Reconstruction components often require\n            careful assessment and long term effort that generally\n            extends beyond the normal three year implementation period\n            for Bank-assisted emergency operations. Therefore, priority\n            in this type of projects should be given to prevention,\n            immediate measures to reactivate economic activity and\n            careful assessment of longer-term reconstruction priorities\n            and designs. 6) Ad hoc implementation arrangements through\n            Project Coordination Units need to be carefully considered.\n            In projects lacking a critical mass of work it is difficult\n            for governments to allocate enough of their scarce qualified\n            manpower to these units. 7) Terms of Reference for\n            consulting engineers need to specify government budget\n            constraints to avoid over-designed infrastructure that will\n            be unaffordable to implement. The Bank needs to consider\n            requiring performance guarantees of consultants and applying\n            penalties for late submissions."}, "docdt": "2004-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
