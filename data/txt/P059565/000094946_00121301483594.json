educational system, and responsiveness to the demands, and\n            needs of the State's population. The components\n            include: 1) school quality improvement, assuring minimum\n            operational standards for schools, consisting of the\n            following essential criteria: understanding of operational\n            standards, and equity considerations, by both the school\n            staff, and community; universal student access to basic\n            textbooks, and, teachers' access to teaching guides;\n            and, furnished classrooms, with at least the minimum\n            equipment, and basic teaching material requirements; 2)\n            expansion of educational access, to meet the growing demand\n            for secondary education. This component, complementary of a\n            federal loan that will finance the expansion of secondary\n            education in several sates, will plan, and structurally\n            reorganize the secondary school system, guaranteeing\n            additional school places, through the rationalization of\n            state, municipal, and private school resources. This\n            micro-planning, a combination of school mapping, and\n            geographic information systems, is a technical instrument to\n            promote state/municipal cooperation for school locations;\n            and, 3) increased school autonomy, by strengthening\n            educational assessments, institutional educational\n            management, and monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2000-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
