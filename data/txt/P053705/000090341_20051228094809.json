Following are lessons learned from the\n            project: IDA continued presence in the transport sector\n            helped to enhance the supervision effectiveness and deepen\n            understanding of transport issues. Proactive supervision and\n            restructuring of the project as soon as critical emergencies\n            occurred were essential to achieve the development\n            objectives. This type of program offers several important\n            advantages compared to other traditional road gravel or\n            asphalt rehabilitation work methods. When there is proper\n            coordination among donor agencies and institutional\n            organizations, it can help to ensure that efforts are not\n            duplicated while providing leverage for investments. The\n            micro-enterprises program was highly successful and enabled\n            many previously unemployed rural families to obtain a steady\n            income while carrying out economically justifiable road\n            conservation works."}, "docdt": "2005-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
