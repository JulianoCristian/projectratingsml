Pension Reform Adjustment Loan\n            Project will support the Government's efforts to\n            finance the transition to a fully funded pension system by\n            financing part of the estimated 1.7 percent of the GDP\n            (Gross Domestic Product) fiscal deficit brought about by\n            pension reform. The move to a funded system will continue\n            the transition to a market economy by encouraging savings,\n            creating an attitude of self-reliance among the population,\n            reducing the public sector, and deepening capital markets.\n            The loan will be disbursed in three tranches. By providing\n            for the development of non-state accumulation plans, the\n            pension reform will foster the development of capital\n            markets and improve the aggregate economic efficiency of\n            investments. The reform will also develop skills needed in a\n            market economy bolstering the financial sector, the banking\n            sector, and the insurance industry. The reform will reduce\n            payroll taxation and, as a result, encourage employment.\n            While the reform initially incurs additional budgetary\n            costs, in the longer run, as benefits from the old system\n            are phased out, budgetary costs will be reduced\n            considerably. In the longer run, the reform will lead to\n            increased savings and faster economic growth."}, "docdt": "1998-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
