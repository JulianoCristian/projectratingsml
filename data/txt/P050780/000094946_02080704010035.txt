Introduction
Following independence, Kazakhstan had a soviet-style pension system characterized by early retirement
ages, special privileges for certain groups, and high rates of income replacement. In addition, the system of
collection and payment was inefficient and ineffective. Consequently, the system had a high payroll tax



(25.5 percent of the wage bill), which was levied almost entirely on the shrinking state-owned sector.
Despite favorable demographics, Kazakhstan had a high system dependency ratio (ratio of pensioners to
contributors) and high payroll tax rate. By 1996, considerable contribution arrears on the part of
employers had built up, requiring the government to transfer 36 billion Tenge (2.6 percent of GDP) from
the state budget to the pension fund that year. In 1996-97, pension payment arrears were so severe that
mass protests of pensioners broke out across the country. The situation offered a compelling opportunity
to implement pension reform.
Faced with this situation, the government decided in 1997 to implement a radical reform of the pension
system, replacing the extant pay-as-you-go system with a mandatory funded defined contribution scheme,
with accumulation managed by private institutions and in parallel by a State Accumulation Fund, as a
default fund, on an interim basis. A secondary goal was to bolster capital markets and provide a pool of
capital that could productively be invested inside the country. Although the Government of Kazakhstan
(GoK) decision to implement a new system was based in part on information and analyses received from
their dialogue with the Bank, the new system was designed and developed by a small dedicated group
within the Gok without any external inputs. The Bank then examined the pension reform concept,
concluded that the government's design of the new pension system was basically sound, and undertook the
PRAL to validate the government's pension reform efforts and support implementation of the new system.
Technical assistance complementary to PRAL in the amount of US$13.94 million was provided through the
Pension Reform Implementation Loan (PRIL), which provided assistance to strengthen the areas of:
actuarial capacity; structural analysis of pensions; pension regulation; pension collection and payment;
insurance; information technology; and public information. All of these areas were the subject of PRAL
conditionality.
PRAL was closely coordinated with ADB, which provided a US$100 million loan to support pension
reform, as well as additional technical support. And PRAL was also coordinated with USAID, which had
a pension reform project in place, and played a critical role in developing actuarial and fiscal projections.
3. -Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Oniginal Objective:
The development objectives were: 1. Provide adequate retirement income for old-age pensioners; 2. Provide
a minimum standard for old-age pensioners; 3. Ensure that pensions are fiscally sustainable; 4. Develop
capital markets through funded pensions; 5. Foster individual responsibility for own social protection; 6.
Reduce social demands on business; 7. Improve regulation of financial institutions.
Relevance of Objectives
It is the judgment of this ICR that PRAL objectives are substantially relevant. PRAL was demand-driven
and developed in close collaboration with the government. PRAL objectives were clear and consistent with
the 1997 CAS, which established two organizing themes: promoting private-sector led growth, including
improvement of the legal and institutional framework; and strengthening social protection with the goal of
mitigating transitional poverty. While the government's pension reform plan was quite ambitious, the
PRAL team analyzed it carefully and found it to be sound; the PRAL objectives of supporting
implementation of the reforms was realistic and important to the country's development needs. And the
reform would protect the poor by providing a minimum pension benefit and monthly old age allowances
(see section 4.2.0). By providing a pool of capital that could be invested domestically, and strengthening
financial sector regulation, PRAL had the potential to boost domestic growth and bolster the private sector.
The new pension system would strengthen social protection by substituting a well-managed pension system
-2 -



for a public plan that had lost credibility and was not able to pay for promises made.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Corponents:
The project had just one component-Pension Reform, US$300 million. It should be noted that
the third tranche was not released, and the final US$ 100 million of the loan was not disbursed and
was cancelled (additional detail in section 4.1.3).
3.4 Revised Components:
N.A.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry is assessed as satisfactory. As described earlier, the impetus for pension reform in
Kazakhstan, was quite acute: large pension arrears and mass protests of pensioners. Top officials formed a
working group to consider policy ideas, and these officials were influenced by analytical materials provided
by the Bank and other donors, and by Bank-sponsored conferences.' They drew up a concept paper on
pension reform (March, 1997) that outlined a proposal for radical reform similar to what was eventually
enacted. The Bank sent an expert advisory mission to the country in May, 1997, after the main design of
the reforms had been forged. After carefully reviewing the proposals, as well as USAID-sponsored
actuarial and fiscal projections, the team developed simulations of the benefit structure and deternined that
the proposals were sound. The Bank decided to focus its energy on supporting the government's efforts to
implement the reforms, and started work on the PRAL.
PRAL was subject to a April, 1999, QAG quality-at-entry review, which concluded that it was "marginally
satisfactory." This ICR disagrees, and finds quality at entryfully satisfactory. The QAG review agreed
that Borrower ownership was exceptionally strong, and notes that government was highly satisfied with the
quality of Bank support. QAG compliments the performance of the PRAL tearn under difficult
circumstances. However, the review found the following main deficiencies:
1.     The Bank did not move quickly enough, and thus had to "get on the train which had already left the
station"
2.    Insufficient consideration was given to alternative design and implementation options
3.     There was inadequate identification of relevant risks, in part due to the absence of independent
actuarial simulations and modeling of alternative macroeconomic scenarios
It is the view of this ICR that the QAG Panel did not sufficiently appreciate the speed and determiination of
the Kazakhstan authorities in pursuing this reform. The government's working group prepared, in secrecy,
an outline of the reform in 4 months, culminating in the "draft concept" produced in March, 1997. This
concept was very similar to one recommended in the Bank publication, "Averting the Old Age Crisis." The
government was deternined to move quickly to implement the reform.
As noted above, a Bank mission was mounted within 2 months which offered analytical and technical
support. This mission worked closely with resident USAID advisors and carefully reviewed extant
analytical and fiscal projections. It also reviewed altemative macroeconomic scenarios with Bank and IMF
macroeconomists. Interviews with government policy-makers and Bank staff indicated that they assessed
USAID actuarial calculations as adequate to proceed with legislation. The Bank reviewed the projections
- 3-



and analyzed them using altemative assumptions as to real wage growth and replacement ratios (MOP,
Annex C). After determining that the government's pension reform concept was basically sound and had a
good chance of success, the PRAL team decided to provide resources to contribute to macroeconomic
stability during the changeover, and to support the government in the difficult measures needed to
implement the reform. The Bank did indeed "board a train which had left the station," but it is the judgment
of this ICR that action to assist with macroeconomic stability and strengthen implementation was
preferable to "not boarding." Waiting for more elaborate analytical results would probably have meant
missing the train entirelv.
It is the judgment of this ICR that key project risks-for example those concerning alternative macro
scenarios-were indeed identified and considered by the project team. Some, however, were not described
in the MOP, but were noted in BTORs during appraisal.
As stated by QAG, it is acknowledged that some of the conditions in the three-tranche operation (e.g.,
public information, insurance) were not sufficiently specific as to desired outcomes, and did not address the
possibility that the State Accumulation Fund would continue to dominate asset management. Also as stated
by QAG, PRAL did not have any monitoring indicators. However, these deficiencies were not sufficient to
assess Quality at Entry as less than fully satisfactory.
The principal architect of the pension reform stated that he had been heavily influenced by reading the
publication, "Averting the Old Age Crisis: Policies to Protect the Old and Promote Growth," World Bank, 1994.
See Mitchell Orenstein, "How Politics and Institutions Affect Pension Reform in Three Post-Communist
Countries," World Bank, March, 2000.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
For clarity and completeness, the description of achievement of objectives and outputs is organized in the
following way:
4.1.1-Outcome/overall achievement of objectives
4.1.2-Brief description of the new pension system
4.1.3-Compliance with Conditionality
4.1.4-Key issues in the pension reform
4.2.0-Achievement of each of the 7 specific PRAL objectives (as listed in section 3.1).
4.1.1 Outcome/Overall Achievement of Obiectives
Overall outcome and achievement of PRAL objectives was satisfactory. At the time PRAL was designed,
it was imperative to restore public confidence in the pension system. The pension reform was successful in
convincing people to contribute into accumulation funds. By late 2001, around US$28 million per month
was flowing into accumulation plans, resulting in quite a large aggregation of investable funds (see Table 1
and Figure 1). Although at first most funds flowed into the State Accumulation Fund (SAF)-assumed to
be the safer bet in the absence of experience with private funds-confidence in private funds grew, and the
market share of the SAF declined rapidly (Table 1).

As would be expected, the assets of the accumulation system have mounted rapidly, and currently exceed
US$I billion. Figure 1 below shows the growth in the level of assets in the accumulation system since its
establishment.

PRAL provided resources that were used to pay off arrears and mitigate macroeconomic imbalances that
might otherwise have resulted from the radical shift from a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system to a mandatory
defined contribution scheme. As a condition prior to Board presentation, Kazakhstan cleared all pension
paymnent arrears, and while some recurred during 1999, there are presently no arrears (See 4.1.3, below).
Also in compliance with PRAL conditionality, a min~imum monthly pension has been established, as well as
an old age allowance for individuals who do not qualify for a pension. These measures substantially
enhanced the poverty focus of the pension system, and signi~ficantly reduced the direct burden on the
republic budget of the PAYG system, which declined from around half of PAYG costs in 1999 to around a
fifth in 2001 (details in section 4.2.0).
In addition to the stated objectives, numerous Borrower officials stated that Bank participation (and the
clearance of arrears) provided an important validation of the pension reform to two constituencies: (1) the
domestic political and popular audience; and (2) international financial markets.2
4.1.2 The New Pension System
Under the refonrm, the 25.5 percent tax on the wage bill was replaced by a 15 percent tax paid by employers
based on the taxable income of each individual. In addition, a contribution of 10 percent of earnings is
- 5 -



allocated to each person's individual account. Workers received no further credit for service under the
PAYG system for work subsequent to January 1, 1998. The 15 percent contribution to the old PAYG
system is intended to support its ability to pay pensions to existing pensioners and current workers who
were covered under it until 1998.
Workers can choose to place their individual funds in either the State Accumulation Fund (SAF) or any of
12 private accumulation funds. SAF management is the responsibility of the government, while private
funds hire an asset management company that is responsible for investment decision-making. Fund
transfers and payments under the PAYG system are managed by the State Pension Payments Center
(SPPC) This is correct but hereafter you get it wrong by using SPPC, please change all to SPPC. Each
fund keeps its accumulated assets at one custodial bank, which accounts for and reports to the funds
regarding all operations on fund assets, their allocation, and investment income. There is thus a clear
separation of accounts and responsibilities.
The SAF is required to invest 90 percent of its funds in securities of the government of Kazakhstan.
Investments of Drivate pension management companies are subject to the following restrictions:
-Domestic government securities, minimum of 40%
-Domestic private securities (equity and debt), maximum of 40%
-Foreign investments, maximum of 10%
-Securities of multilateral development banks, maximum of 10%
--Exposure to one borrower, maximum 5%
The SAF and the 12 private funds publish a quarterly analysis of their portfolios which provides data on
the total assets managed by each fund, the allocation of their investments across categories, and the yield
they have achieved in the most recent period. The pension reform also achieved a saving within the PAYG
system, estimated at 1 billion Tenge per year in 1998, by eliminating some pensions on favorable terms.'
4.1.3 Compliance with Conditionalitv
First Tranche-The Government met all first tranche conditions prior to Board consideration, and the
tranche of US$100 million was disbursed in June, 1998.
Second Tranche-The Government met all conditions, except the following, for which a waiver was
granted:
*      No pension arrears; as described in the following section, arrears reappeared in 1999, but were
then cleared
*      Government shall issue inflation-indexed bonds of maturity of 2 years or more that satisfy the
reasonable investment needs of the pension accumulation funds. This condition was not met, and was
deemed impractical in light of the lack of demand for such bonds at reasonable interest rates.
Accumulation funds had an abundance of investment opportunities.
The second tranche of US$100 million was disbursed in December, 1999.
Third tranche-All conditions were met except the following:
Unqualified annual audit of SPPC (described in detail in the next section)
Government shall issue inflation-indexed bonds of maturity of 3 years or more that satisfy the
- 6 -



reasonable investment needs of the pension accumulation funds. This was not met, and was deemed
impractical in the context of prevailing capital markets.
The third tranche (US$100 million) was not disbursed. A waiver would have been required for these two
conditions, but was not requested by the Government. It should be noted that this took place when the price
of oil had risen substantially, and the government's budgetary situation had improved. A further
complication was that during mid-2001, the country did not have an IMF program in place, thereby making
tranche release much more difficult ( In order to release a tranche, the Bank has to be assured of a
satisfactory maco framework, which is usually-but not always-achieved by the country's participation
in an IMF program; Kazakhstan had repaid its entire debt to the IMF in May, 2000)
4.1.4 Key Issues in the Pension Reform
Arrears--Because the issue of payment arrears had been such a sensitive social issue prior to the pension
reform, PRAL conditionality required that all arrears be paid prior to PRAL Board consideration, and that
none recur during the project. While existing arrears were cleared after project effectiveness, the 1998
regional economic crisis significantly reduced the country's growth-from a projected 3% in real terms to
-2.5%. The related drop in revenue (which persisted into 1999), along with decreased availability and
increased cost of debt financing, led to the temporary reappearance of arrears during 1999. However, all
arrears were cleared by the end of 1999, and have not recurred.
Insurance Sector--A 2nd tranche condition was the issuance of a report on strategic actions to strengthen
the insurance industry. While the report was issued, the insurance industry actually developed little during
PRAL, with an important first step being the passage of an insurance law in December, 2000. This
provided only a framework, however, and implementing regulations and training are currently being
developed with the assistance of USAID. Factors that seem to have slowed the development of the
insurance industry until recently include the absence of appropriate regulations, a lack of consumer
awareness, and a lack of demand for annuities-the latter because so far, relatively few people had retired
who had amassed a significant sun under the accumulation scheme.
Establishment of Personal Identification Numbers-Personal Identification Numbers are the comerstone
of an effective pension individual account system. It was a PRAL condition that an individual number be
issued to every employed person. This was accomplished, with around 4 million workers having numbers.
This is estimated by foreign experts to be around 98% of workers in the fonnal sector. However, the
establishment of personal identification numbers has the following deficiencies: it is possible that a small
number of people have multiple numbers; most workers in the informal sector do not have numbers; many
farm workers or intermittent workers may not have numbers. The GoK is currently attempting to
rationalize personal identification numbers for pensions with those issued by the tax authorities and those
issued by some oblasts.
Audits of SPPC-PRAL 3rd tranche conditionality called for an unqualified annual audit of SPPC.
However, SPPC had substantial start-up difficulties, and the audit report for 1998 (received in December,
1999) contained reports of numerous deficiencies in administrative and financial controls-some
potentially serious. While the condition required an annual audit, the 1998 report was received almost a
year late, so instead of requiring yet another audit, the Bank decided to utilize the recommendations noted
in the 1998 report as the basis for a work program, with remediation of the problems noted as goals. By
mid- 1999, SPPC had made significant progress with one of the most serious problems-duplicate accounts
for a single individual-and by 2000 the incidence of this problem had declined to a trivial level. After 18
months' work on the 1998 recommendations, by mid-2000 SPPC had reduced deficiencies to the extent that
-7 -



SPPC officials estimate that 98% of incoming funds were allocated correctly.
Development of Actuarial Capacity-In accordance with PRAL conditionality, assistance funded under
PRIL (and USAID) strengthened GOK actuarial capacity. An Actuarial Division was established in the
Ministry of Finance, and initially 6 individuals were taken on a study tour to learn from foreign specialists
in this area. Starting in 2001, a USAID program began training of 50 specialists at the 3rd level of
actuarial skills (professional accreditation is provided to those who complete the 8th level). Local private
consultants were also provided with actuarial training.
GOK actuarial capabilities developed to an impressive extent, and the Division regularly updated actuarial
forecasts with actual economic data, which benefited long-term fiscal planning as well as calculation of
pension requirements. The GOK issues annual reports updating forecasts of the adequacy of pensions for
different groups of employees and recommendations for actions necessary to adequately address identified
retirement income deficiencies.
4.2.0 Achievement of 7 Specific PRAL obiectives
1. Provide adequate retirement income for old-age pensioners
In terms of "providing ani adequate retirement income for old-age pensioners," the former PAYG system
was somewhat arbitrary: its "adequacy" depended on what the government decided it could pay at a
particular moment. The new, defined-contribution system was based on the premise that it would provide a
facility whereby citizens could accumulate sufficient funds for an adequate pension if they took sufficient
responsibility for their retirement and made appropriate contributions. The pension reform achieved this
objective.
2. Provide a minimum standardfor old-age pensioners
As required under PRAL, a minimum pension level was established under the PAYG system for pensioners
(who had worked the maximum number of years). As also required, this was indexed for
inflation-although it was also increased in real terms from 1999-2001.
For those who hadn't qualified, PRAL required that old-age allowances be established, which was done.
Minimum pension amounts and old age allowances are shown in Table 2 below. The establishment of
minimum pensions and old age allowances imparted a significantpovertyfocus to the pension reform, and
were an important PRAL contribution.

3. Ensure that pensions are fiscally sustainable
The pension reform specified that 71.4% of the Social Tax-15 percentage points out of 21-be allocated
to supporting the PAYG system. This would support existing PAYG pensioners and those who have
contributed to PAYG and will retire in the future (but at a reduced level of payment since accruals ended

on January 1,1998). From 1999 to 2001, the extent to which the PAYG pension system has been a direct
burden on the budeet has diminished. Table 3, below, shows that the proportion of PAYG costs bome by
the republic budget declined from around fifty percent in 1999 to less than twenty percent in the first 9
months of 2001.

Although of course many factors influence macroeconomic performance, implementation of the pension
reform corresponded with an improvement in the GOK fiscal situation. As shown in Table 4,
Kazakhstan's fiscal balance improved from -8.0 percent in 1998 to an expected surplus of 2 percent in
2001. Also, GDP growth accelerated, reaching 9.6 percent in 2000, with a preliminary estimate of 7
percent in 2001, and the current account improved substantially. These data undoubtedly reflect the strong
rebound in oil prices. Inflation rose to 13 percent in 2000, after 2 years in the 7 to 8 percent range, but is
expected to fall back to 9 percent in 2001. After a significant depreciation against the U.S. dollar in 1999,
the exchange rate has been relatively stable in the last 2 years.

4. Develop capital markets through fundedpensions
-9-



According to the IMF, Kazakhstan's capital markets are among the most advanced in the CIS, although
they are small in comparison to Central European transition economies. The main means by which the
pension reform has contributed to capital market development has been by increasing the demand for all
types of securities, and in particular domestic non-government securities (corporate bonds). As noted
earlier, private pension management companies can invest up to 40 percent of their portfolios in domestic,
non-government securities. As of March, 2001, the 13 private pension management companies had
invested from 10.8 to 35.9 percent of their portfolios in domestic non-government securities, with an
overall average of 29 percent. Although a small portion of this is in equities, this market remained thin;
many of the country's most attractive firms were owned by strategic investors or by managers. However,
the demand from pension management companies provided a strong inducement for creditworthy domestic
enterprises to issue debt securities.
Pension management companies have also invested in municipal bonds; there were 2 municipal bond issues
in 2000, and 3 in 2001, with bonds issued by the cities of Almaty and Astana, and by Atyrau Oblast. The
international financial firm Fitch has issued ratings on these municipalities and oblasts. The rapid
implementation of pension reform has substantially contributed to the development of Kazakhstan's capital
markets.
5. Foster individual, responsibility for own social protection
As noted earlier, although pensioners covered by the pay-as-you-go system would continue to be paid by
the state budget, all new contributions would be made into the accumulation funds under the defined
contribution scheme. Individuals must designate a pension management company, and information on the
portfolios, investment strategies, and recent performance of pension management companies-12 private
firms and the SAF-are published quarterly in the newspaper Respublika in a user-friendly format (system
developed with the assistance of USAID).
The MLSP prepared and implemented substantial public information programs designed to convince
citizens that the new scheme was sound, and that it was in their interest to contribute. (It was a PRAL
condition that public information programs be prepared, but it was not required that they be
implemented-a shortcoming) And all people who participated in the defined contribution plan were
assigned a unique identification number (a PRAL condition), which facilitated administration. The rapid
increase in the assets of pension accumulation funds, illustrated above in Figure 1, shows the extent to
which many individuals have taken responsibility for their own income in retirement
6. Reduce social demands on business
The previous 25.5% "contribution" that enterprises were required to make to fund the PAYG system has
been replaced by a Social Tax, part of which (15 percentage points) is currently used to fund the old PAYG
system to support its ability to pay pensions to existing pensioners and current workers who were covered
under it until 1998. It is anticipated that the 15% that supports PAYG will be reduced in the future, as
demands on that system diminish. As the portion of the social tax that supports PAYG lessens, the burden
on enterprises will be reduced.
The pension reform has also reduced implicit social demands on enterprises. This was manifested
in the practice of companies that formerly provided goods and services to pensioners at
concessionary prices. It is understood that under the individual pension scheme, this practice would be
- 10-



discontinued.
7. Improve regulation offinancial institutions
PRAL supported extensive training for regulators (funded under PRIL) in drafting regulations and
monitoring financial institutions, and training of supervisors. When the pension reform was first
introduced, three agencies were responsible for the regulation of participating institutions: The National
Securities Commission regulated pension asset management companies; the National Pension Agency
regulated pension funds; and the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) regulated custodial banks. This was
an awkward arrangement-with some inconsistencies among regulations-and in the course of an extended
dialogue under PRAL, the Bank argued that a consolidated regulatory arrangement would be more efficient
and effective. In due course, the GoK moved to combine all regulation of these institutions under the NBK,
which arrangement will start in January, 2002.
Additional measures which also improved regulation of the financial sector included: a measure to require
financial institutions to evaluate assets at market values; the institution of deposit insurance for banks;
adoption of a law on bank privacy; and adoption of a law on joint stock companies that improved the legal
framework for private firms.
Privatization of the State Asset Fund and removal of its status as the "default" fund is pending before the
Parliament.
Two intemational reports comment favorably on financial sector development and the role of pension funds in
broadening the domestic securities market: "Kazakhstan: Strong Recovery," Oxford Analvtica Brief. August 1,
2000; and "Kazakhstan: Strong Recovery," Oxford Analvtica Brief July 4, 2001.
The new system eliminated the option introduced in 1996 that allowed people to retire at-the previous age limits
(60 for men and 55 for women) at a reduced pension until they reached the new age limits (63 for men and 58 for
women), at which time they would receive an unreduced pension.
IMF, "Republic of Kazakhstan: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix," January, 2001.
Additional reasons for the lack of attractive equities include: (1) reluctance on the part of many investors due to
shortcomings in corporate governance and accounting transparency; (2) lack of privatization progress; (3)
companies in which a small number of shareholders have maintained control may prefer to rely on issuing bonds to
meet their extemal financing needs.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
It was not possibpe to calculate the financial rate of return.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional Development Impact is assessed as substantial.
PRAL facilitated the rapid implementation of pension reform, substituting a well-managed pension system
for a public plan that had lost credibility and was not able to pay for promises made. PRAL supported
strengthening the administrative and regulatory institutions to manage and administer the new pension
system, including development of: a regulatory framework; upgraded IT; prototype legal and administrative
- 11 -



documents; reporting and disclosure requirements; and the assignment of unique identification numbers.
Also supported was the strengthening of actuarial capacity, described earlier. SPPC was strengthened in
its ability to: achieve accurate and rapid transfer of individual pension contributions to the correct
accumulation fund; and provide improved information on individual accounts. (Work done to achieve these
was financed under PRIL)
PRAL conditionality supported training to strengthen the capabilities of regulatory agencies as well as
pension funds and pension management firms.
The reform also contributed significantly to the development of capital markets, stimulating the demand for
private debt instruments and other securities. In part as a result of PRAL, an industry was developed of
well-managed private pension funds, respected by the public and entrusted to hold its funds. An
Association of Pension Accumulation Funds has also developed, which has worked with the GOK to
develop suggested improvements to the 1997 pension law as well as improved regulation, and to broaden
the range of potential investments available to pension management companies.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Three interrelated factors affected PRAL in its first 2 years:
*      1998 Russian financial crisis-In addition to the increasing GOK fiscal deficit, the 1998 Russian
financial crisis-with the depreciation of the ruble against the Tenge, had adverse effects on Kazakh
exports, and contributed to the drop in GDP.
*      Macroeconomic Developments-As shown in Table 4, the country's GDP, which had fallen
considerably after independence, fell again in 1998, and the fiscal balance reached -8.0 percent of GDP.
The Tenge, stable in 1997, lost around 10 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in 1998. The loss of
tax revenues, and the turmoil in financial markets, contributed to the temporary reappearance of pension
arrears.
* Oil prices-The price of oil fell substantially in 1998, reaching a low of US$11.80 per barrel in the
first quarter of 1999, before recovering to US$29.00 per barrel in the third quarter of 2000. The low
prices contributed to the 1998 decline in GDP, while the sharp recovery probably contributed to a
diminished GOK interest in receiving the PRAL third tranche.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
* The GOK was resolute in its support for the pension reform; it deflected several efforts to derail or
substantially modify the reform (which would have made it less fiscally sustainable)
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
none
5.4 Costs and financing:
PRAL was structured in 3 equal tranches of US$100 million. The first was disbursed upon effectiveness in
June, 1998, and the second in December, 1999. The third tranche was cancelled, so total disbursements
were USS200 million. The project closed six months later than originally envisioned on June 30, 2001.
6. Sustainability
- 12 -



6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Sustainability is assessed as likely. As evidenced by the rapid growth of the assets of pension management
companies-most notably the private ones-public acceptance of the new pension scheme is substantial.
The public seems persuaded that investing in their own individual accounts is an effective way to provide
for retirement. People are also confident entrusting their funds to fund managers. The lack of any episodes
of misappropriation also seems to have helped build public confidence.
The diminishing budgetary burden of the PAYG system also strengthens the sustainability of the benefits
achieved under PRAL.
The pension reform created a pool of capital that has allowed the republic government, local governments,
as well as many private firms to issue debt instruments, and this constituency will provide a strong and
continuing impetus for maintaining, or even extending, the pension reform. The stronger financial sector
regulatory framework will reinforce this tendency.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The transition to regular operations has already taken place. The accumulation funds and management
companies are established, have credibility, and are successfully handling an inflow of around US$28
million per month. The Ministry of Finance produces annual actuarial projections. The performance of the
SPPC has steadily improved over the course of the project, and it is now functioning quite effectively.
Nearly all formal sector workers have accounts, and duplication and other errors have been either
eliminated or reduced to an insignificant level. With the assistance of the Bank, USAID, and ADB, pension
regulatory bodies-now consolidated in the NBK-have become more competent.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.] Lending:
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory.
Bank performance in lending was satisfactory. Project design and the circumstances surrounding PRAL
initiation have been described in section 3.5, Quality at Entry, which is assessed as satisfactory. PRAL
was very much demand-driven, supportive of CAS goals, and timely. Numerous Borrower officials
acknowledged the key contribution of the Bank to implementation of the pension reform concept developed
by the authorities; they acknowledged that the rapid manner in which the GOK initiated reform had left a
number of implementation gaps, and that PRAL provided substantial help in addressing those areas.
Finally, a particularly valuable contribution that the Bank made to pension reform was to convince the
GOK to institute a mninimum pension, which provided a poverty focus.
The ICR acknowledges that project design included some PRAL conditions that were not well crafted.
Some were not sufficiently outcome oriented (e.g., preparation of plans for insurance sector and public
information strategies). And other conditions were impractical-especially those dealing with the issuance
of two and three year bonds. The impracticality reflects the unfeasibility of crafting conditions that, in
effect, have to predict circumstances in the financial markets several years hence. (See Section 8, Lessons
Leamed)
7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance in supervision was satisfactory. As described earlier, the Bank responded to the
deficiencies noted in the 1998 SPPC audit by working with the agency to develop a program by which it
could remedy its problems. The SPPC effort to upgrade its operations was successful, although it was not
- 13-



accomplished in the exact manner or time frame originally envisioned. Borrower officials reported that the
Bank assistance received was of high quality, extremely helpful, and important to the country. Bank Task
Managers identified implementation problems in a timely manner, and worked with the Borrower to achieve
resolution.
The waivers granted for the 2nd tranche were appropriate, because the reappearance of arrears was
relatively brief and was related to the 1998 regional economic and financial crisis. The condition involving
2-year inflation-indexed bonds was considered impractical in light of the lack of demand for such bonds at
reasonable interest rates. In any event, when the 2nd tranche was pending, accumulation funds had an
abundance of investment opportunities.
Throughout the project, Bank supervision missions consistently reiterated the message that the pension
regulatory structure should be simplified and consolidated. In due course, the govemrnment agreed, and this
action will be taken on January 1, 2002.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Overall Government performance was satisfactory.
Preparation was satisfactory. Borrower officials worked closely with the Bank in preparation of the
PRAL. Having rapidly launched the new scheme-which did not have implementing regulations or
adequate administrative arrangements-the GOK greatly appreciated Bank assistance in implementing it.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Implementation performance was satisfactory. The pension reform was not universally popular in
Kazakhstan, and several attempts were made to modify it in an manner that would have made it less
fiscally sustainable, or which would have restricted the flexibility of individual account holders to transfer
their funds. However, the GOK was resolute in its support for the pension reform program and deflected
several efforts to derail or substantially modify the reform. With the assistance of the Bank, USAID, and
other donors, the GOK put into place regulations, procedures, required staff, and all necessary resources to
assure satisfactory PRAL implementation.
Government implementation performance was good; as detailed earlier, nearly all conditions for the release
of the three tranches were met. Project progress was facilitated by the high degree of consensus between
the various agencies involved: Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (the administering agency), NBK,
Committee for Regulating Activities of Pension Funds, National Securities Commission, and Ministry of
Finance. While the GOK eventually agreed to consolidate pension regulatory agencies and functions under
the NBK, it took too long to do this.
7.6- Implementing Agencyv:
The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) worked diligently to achieve implement the project
and achieve consensus among the other agencies involved. While attempts were made to modify PRAL,
MLSP worked hard to keep on the course spelled out by the 1997 pension reform law.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is assessed as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned
&      Establishment Of A Private Pension System Can Provide A Major Stimulus To Capital
Markets Development-The pension reform in Kazakhstan provided a pool of capital that stimulated the
demand for investment opportunities. In parallel with efforts to strengthen regulation of capital markets,
pension reform significantly increased the funds available to flow into productive investrnent
opportunities-including the debt instruments of private fiums and municipal and regional governments.
Importantly, the risk and reward of these investments was assessed by private fund managers who are
accountable for the performance of funds under their management.
*      Limited Privatization has Constrained Equity Investment Opportunities-Investment
managers stated that their options for equity investments are significantly constrained by the limited
number of attractive companies that have been privatized. Further pnvatization of viable firms, as well as
improved corporate govemance and accounting transparency, would offer substantial benefits for the
countr.
*   In a Radical Pension Reform, Sufricient Time should be Provided for the Development of
Administrative Capacity-PRAL provided support for implementation of pension reform. While the rapid
development of the pension concept and the passage of legislation was driven by political factors, it would
have been desirable to have more time to develop administrative infrastructure (e.g., implementing
regulations, regulatory expertise, required IT support) before actually starting the new program.
*   "Boarding a Train After it Has Left The Station" May be Preferable To Not Boarding At All
-The
Bank became involved in pension reform after Kazakhstan had decided on the design of the reform. After
determining that the design was basically sound, the Bank chose to support the government in implementing
the    reform. Even though it was not an ideal situation, and more time and more detailed analyses might
have been    preferable, the Bank made the correct decision to "board the train."
* To the Greatest Extent Possible, Conditionality Should Focus on Outcome-Several PRAL
conditions required plans or studies (e.g., preparation of plans for insurance sector and public information
strategies). It would probably have been more effective to specify desired outcomes.
* To the Extent Possible, Conditionality Focused on Unpredictable Exogenous Circumstances
Should be Avoided-PRAL conditions required the government to issue two and three year bonds that
could
then be purchased by accumulation funds. However, by the time the 2nd tranche release was pending, the
situation in financial markets made it impractical to do so, and in any event by that time asset management
companies had many other investment possibilities. Rapid changes in financial markets had made the
PRAL
conditions impractical.
