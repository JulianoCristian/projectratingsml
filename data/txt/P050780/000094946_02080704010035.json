Overall\n            performances by the Bank and the Borrower are judged as\n            satisfactory. These were the lessons learned from this\n            experience: Establishment of a private pension system can\n            provide a major stimulus to capital markets development. In\n            parallel with efforts to strengthen regulation of capital\n            markets, pension reform significantly increased the funds\n            available to flow into productive investment\n            opportunities--including the debt instruments of private\n            firms and municipal and regional governments. Limited\n            privatization has constrained equity investment\n            opportunities. Further privatization of viable firms, as\n            well as improved corporate governance and accounting\n            transparency, would offer substantial benefits for the\n            country. In a radical pension reform, sufficient time should\n            be provided for developing administrative capacity. The Bank\n            became involved in pension reform after Kazakhstan had\n            decided on the design of the reform. Even though it was not\n            an ideal situation, and more time and more detailed analysis\n            might have been preferable, the Bank made the correct\n            decision to \"board the train.\" To the greatest\n            extent possible, conditionality should focus on outcome.\n            Lastly, to the extent possible, conditionality focused on\n            unpredictable exogenous circumstances should be avoided."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
