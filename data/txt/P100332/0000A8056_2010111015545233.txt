                         shortfall in project funds. However, the Labar-Khenzar Road is being dropped from scope of the project, and it is expected that it will be undertaken with RGOB's own funds. The

                         project would need to be restructured to reflect these changes. The restructuring process will be initiated during the next mission, in collaboration with the Department of Roads, when
                         the likely cost of project can be confirmed better. Meanwhile, IDA has requested the RGOB to allocate at least 50% ofthe committed amount (Nu 37.5m) to project accounts at the
                         earliest.
