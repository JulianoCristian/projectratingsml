Project for Bhutan were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was negligible\n            to low, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: economic evaluation in a situation where\n            low density populations live in mountainous terrain, the\n            construction costs are high and economic benefits are low.\n            This undermines the application of conventional cost benefit\n            analysis, which focuses on the savings accruing to the\n            vehicles using the roads, or the effects of transport cost\n            reductions on agricultural producers living along the road.\n            Cost effectiveness criteria as a road planning tool is\n            therefore a pragmatic and acceptable approach for ranking or\n            prioritizing roads. Independent monitoring in a global\n            biodiversity 'hotspot' like Bhutan, environmental\n            issues are given at most attention. The independent\n            monitoring body comprising of different agencies proved to\n            be exemplary in achieving the required level of\n            environmental compliance during project implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-04-08T00:00:00Z"}
