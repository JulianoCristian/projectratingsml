The last review concluded that\n            the project was well placed to achieve its development\n            objectives. This paper seeks the approval for restructuring\n            of the project. The following changes to the original\n            project are being introduced: 1) dropping of two outcome\n            indicators given that they were influenced by external\n            factors (e.g. fuel prices, government regulated mule rate);\n            2) changes in the road length component one for new\n            construction by 10km; 3) dropping technical assistance\n            provisions linked to the pilot performance-based maintenance\n            mechanisms under capacity development and implementation\n            support component (component two); and 4) changing the road\n            for Otta-sealing under road access component (component one)."}, "docdt": "2011-10-20T00:00:00Z"}
