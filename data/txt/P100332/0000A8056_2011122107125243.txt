                         Key agreements reached with the Department of Roads include:

                         1. Given that compensation payments of project affected persons (PAPs) losing less than 10 decimals of land are yet to be made, RAP-II has agreed to monitor the process for quick
                         payments. .

                         2. A detailed plan for plantation/bio-engineering works with site details and species to be planted, taking appropriate expert advice, for K-K-T-Y road will be developed

                         3. A post-monsoon assessment, to evaluate the extent of remedial measures necessary for the restoration of J-T road, will be done. DOR will prepare an action plan to deal with this
                         issue. PCU and PMU will closely monitor the progress of the on-going K-K-T-Y contract so that the work is completed within the stipulated contract time (early-June, 2012).
