                         (approximately 18km in length). The roads are part of Bajo-Shengana road (10.6km) and road to Samdingkha village (7.50km). Additionally following changes are also being propose
                         under the additional financing: i) changes in the road length for new construction by 10km; ii) dropping of two outcome indicators given that they were influenced by external factors
                         (e.g. fuel prices, government regulated mule rate); iii) dropping technical assistance provisions linked to the pilot performance-based maintenance mechanisms under Capacity
                         Development and Implementation Support component (Component 2): and iv) changing the road for Otta-sealing under Road Access Component (Component 1).
