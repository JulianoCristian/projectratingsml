Following independence in 1957, Ghana expanded its basic education, but by the mid-1970s the
number of children attending primary school had fallen. Government spending on basic
education as a percentage of GDP dropped. By the 1980s, school buildings were dilapidated,
classrooms had few desks, and in several cases, a single textbook was shared by the whole
class.




In the mid-1980s, the government embarked on an education reform program to restructure the
system. The restructuring took place, but concerns remained regarding the poor quality of
instruction, teacher absenteeism and poor school infrastructure. IDA has financed a number of
education programs in Ghana. Of these, the Basic Education Sector Improvement Program
supported the government’s policy of free, compulsory, universal basic education. The goals
were improved access and learning outcomes, as well as better education system management.




Classroom construction and rehabilitation contributed to higher enrollments and better
learning outcomes. The project financed 11 million textbooks which played an important
role in improving the quality of instruction.


Highlights:
- From 1996 to 2001, absolute enrollment in junior secondary schools increased nearly by
130,000 pupils (from 738,057 to 865,636); gross enrollment rate increased 5.2 percentage points
(from 58.7 percent to 63.9 percent); girls’ enrollment share increased 2.3 percentage points (from
43.1 percent to 45.4 percent).
- With increased teacher training and availability of textbooks, Criterion Referenced Test mean
scores increased (from 1996 to end of project) in English from 33.0 to 36.9 and in math from
28.8 to 32.3.
- An Education Management Information System (EMIS) was established in 10 regions and 26
districts. It enabled the generation of annual school census data from 1997 to 2001, the
production of key education indicators and of policy-relevant analysis, and the sensitization of
education officials in the use of data for planning and decision-making.
- 2,300 classrooms were rehabilitated. 344 four-unit teacher accommodation blocks, 101 primary
schools and 50 secondary schools were constructed.
- US$45 million in financing from 1996 to 2002.
- Project is just one of a dozen IDA investment and policy operations supporting long-term
improvements of education in Ghana.
- IDA facilitated Ghana’s inclusion in the Fast Track Initiative of the Education for All initiative.
Improvements in enrollment and outcomes were needed to qualify. EMIS also enabled the
government to prepare a sound plan to achieve education for all.
- IDA helped enhance the government’s capacity for better donor coordination.




At the time of project implementation, the European Commission, the UK's Department for
International Development and the US Agency for International Development were IDA's main
partners. Other partners such as France, Japan, UNICEF and WFP have joined forces since
then.




- The program built on previous Bank operations and laid the groundwork for
subsequent operations.
- Continued support from development partners and follow-up investments in the education
sector are likely to sustain progress.
- The government must contribute to these efforts by addressing issues of disparity among
communities, along with providing support to EMIS. Specifically, continued skills enhancement
for EMIS staff and further development of the system are needed.
