Some lessons learned\n            included: project design based on a successful pilot\n            experiment leads to better choice and design of subprojects,\n            and fosters well targeted government-financed investments,\n            which in turn can represent a valuable contribution to an\n            overall poverty reduction strategy. Project flow of funds\n            and Bank disbursements can be improved through priority\n            scheduling of project investments and by the delegation of\n            greater authority over the management of project funds to\n            the project executing agencies. The organization of local\n            producers, established as a priority from the very beginning\n            of the project, creates a sustainable basis for operation\n            and maintenance (O&M) of project infrastructure and\n            contributes to overall project success and sustainability.\n            Project management instability at the federal level\n            negatively affects project implementation performance, and\n            should be minimized through decentralization of most\n            implementation functions to the state level and closer\n            project supervision."}, "docdt": "1996-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
