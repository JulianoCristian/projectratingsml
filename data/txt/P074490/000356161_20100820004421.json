Project for Cameroon were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the project was simple at the\n            beginning with its three components clearly linked to the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO), thus favoring a clear\n            assessment of its outcomes with respect to set targets. A\n            fortunate but unforeseen situation was the financing of the\n            third lot of civil works from cost savings which provided an\n            alternative access to the city center of Douala and\n            it's industrial zone from Yaounde. It will be good to\n            anticipate such opportunities in future similar projects in\n            order to use a flexible project design to accommodate cost\n            savings in a more creative manner to enhance achievement of\n            the PDO. At the time of the project implementation, current\n            measures to use savings and keep them within a given\n            International Development Agency (IDA) country envelope had\n            also not been put in place. Institutional development and\n            capacity building are critical factors to ensure\n            sustainability during and after project. Experience suggests\n            that best results are achieved through long-term\n            relationships where new ideas can be introduced indirectly\n            and gradually, in pursuit of a shared vision and with a\n            clear road map. It is also critical to support institutional\n            building by encouraging synergy among implementing agencies\n            while making sure that all initiatives are demand-driven and\n            developed in a participatory manner."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
