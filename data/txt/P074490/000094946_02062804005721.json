local,\n            and national areas, by implementing an urgent program of\n            rehabilitation of the primary roads connecting it to\n            industrial areas, as well as strengthening the capacity of\n            urban road management, and maintenance. The project's\n            three main components will: 1) implement the urban road\n            rehabilitation program in Douala, to cover approximately\n            twenty three km of existing primary roads, connecting the\n            port and industrial areas to other districts of the city,\n            and to the inter-city road network. Pavements will be\n            rebuilt; intersections, sidewalks, and the drainage system\n            will be improved; parking places for buses and taxis, and\n            traffic lights and road signs installed; and, safety\n            improved; 2) provide technical assistance (TA) for program\n            implementation, audits, and monitoring project management,\n            as well as for capacity building to support urban road\n            management, and maintenance. Additionally, TA will be\n            provided for the preparation of an urban development\n            strategy, and program for Douala and other cities, which\n            includes financial, and organizational audits of the Urban\n            Community of Douala; and, 3) support the project unit, and\n            Environment Unit in the Ministry of Pubic Works, for project\n            implementation and monitoring."}, "docdt": "2002-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
