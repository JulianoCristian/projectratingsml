Measures to mitigate\n            adversity follow. Traffic signaling, and safety measures\n            will limit circulation, and speed in the proximity of\n            construction areas, while depots, and/or sanitary\n            installations will be located at safe distances from water\n            flows (at least five hundred meters apart). Hydraulic\n            systems along roads construction should prevent the frequent\n            flooding from nearby river flows, and, effluents will be\n            appropriately channeled. Landscaping, and re-vegetation\n            practices would control soil erosion, and air pollution, in\n            addition to slope terracing to contain erosion. Working\n            schedules will be limited to daytime hours, in order to\n            mitigate noise disturbances. Public awareness campaigns will\n            address the public health risks involved, aiming at disease\n            prevention, and control. Since construction will involve\n            mainly urban areas, no social nor resettlement issues are\n            envisaged, neither any adversity on archaeological sites."}, "docdt": "2001-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
