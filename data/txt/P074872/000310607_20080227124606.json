Within the short 2-3 year period\n            of time since project inception, many VSCOs have\n            demonstrated that they can provide a range of financial\n            services demanded by their members while adhering to global\n            standards of performance.

Although it is too early to draw\n            inferences on performance and impact of VSCOs, it is hoped\n            that this note provides some initial lessons for interested stakeholders."}, "docdt": "2007-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
