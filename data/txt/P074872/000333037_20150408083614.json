"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Community Development\n            and Livelihood Improvement Gemi Diriya Project for Sri Lanka\n            were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was significant, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: programmatic\n            approaches that involve multiple stages of lending require\n            iterative analysis of national priorities which can be\n            interpreted through political economy analyses. This\n            iterative analysis is especially critical in areas or\n            countries that are affected by fragility or conflict. A\n            relatively autonomous implementing agency allowing greater\n            flexibility than a line agency may be very valuable for\n            testing new participatory models but the roadmap of its\n            evolution towards sustainable institutionalization, that is\n            folding it back into a government institution, needs to be\n            planned in advance and then later, if necessary, adapted as\n            the political and economic environment evolves. Continuity\n            of community support up to a defined point of graduation -\n            that includes mechanisms for involvement of the poor and the\n            marginalized - is important for longer term sustainability\n            of participatory community development processes. Synergies\n            between the provision of financial services and\n            complementary infrastructure investments, carefully\n            designed, can offer compounded community welfare benefits."}, "docdt": "2015-03-13T00:00:00Z"}
