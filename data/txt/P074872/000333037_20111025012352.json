Project\n            for Sri Lanka were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was high, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: longer\n            term continuity in development support that preserves\n            community decision-making and participatory institutions,\n            and helps them graduate, is critical for sustaining and\n            expanding local efforts. Foremost among the factors\n            contributing to the strong performance is the soundness of\n            the Project village development model with its strong buy-in\n            from the community. Experimentation during project\n            preparation is critical for reducing risks and building\n            confidence and capacity of the staff and communities to\n            scale up under the project. A relatively autonomous\n            implementing agency with flexibility is critical for testing\n            of new models, quick results, compliance to the rules and\n            maintaining political and operational independence for\n            piloting and scaling-up of the project. The challenge will\n            be to ensure the continued evolution of this role to focus\n            on institutionalizing the model, by building capacity of\n            regular Government agencies and programs, and addressing key\n            policy and administrative issues. A very hands-on top\n            management approach and high staff commitment resulted in\n            close monitoring, troubleshooting and continuous refinement\n            of activities. An incentive and performance based\n            recruitment system is critical for showing results and\n            maintaining quality of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
