TheVillage Savings and Credit Organization (VSCO) is a community-managed microfinance organization developed
in Sri Lanka under the Community Development and Livelihood Improvement Project or "Gemi Diriya.1 VSCO is
the financial services arm of the community-run Village Organization, which has the mandate of overall economic
and social empowerment of the village, particularly the poorest. Within the short 2-3 year period of time since
project inception, many VSCOs have demonstrated that they can provide a range of financial services demanded by
their members while adhering to global standards of performance.

This note describes the context under which the model was developed, identifies some key features of the model and
outlines the benefits the system currently provides. Although it is too early to draw inferences on performance and
impact of VSCOs, it is hoped that this note provides some initial lessons for interested stakeholders.
