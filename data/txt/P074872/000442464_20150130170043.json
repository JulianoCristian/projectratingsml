The objective of the 12-year\n            program (in three phases) is to enable rural communities\n            improve their livelihoods and quality of life. Some 100,000\n            households (about 500,000 people) in the poorest districts\n            of Sri Lanka have benefited from community infrastructure\n            and productive investments (drinking water, access roads,\n            and bridges, information and communications technology (ICT)\n            centers, access to credit, markets, skills, and income\n            generation). The project is expected to benefit some 1,000\n            villages including 1 million people by end 2007. The second\n            phase of agricultural productivity program (APL), starting\n            in 2008, will expand the geographical coverage to additional\n            2,000 villages in the poorest divisions while also focusing\n            on institutional change of local governments and on linkages\n            with other governmental programs."}, "docdt": "2007-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
