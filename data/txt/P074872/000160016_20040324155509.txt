A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

A.l.l Poverty reduction in rural areas is a key objective o f the Government o f Sri Lanka's (GOSL)
poverty reduction strategy. Almost a quarter o f Sri Lanka's population are still poor, and 90% o f them
live inrural areas or estates. There are large regional disparities in poverty incidence, with the south and
north east showing higher levels o f poverty (although comprehensive poverty data for the north east i s
laclung). In the recent years, as part o f its sectoral work, IDA has completed two major studies-"Sri
Lanka: Poverty Assessment'' and "Promoting Agricultural and RuralNon-farm Sector Growth". The first
study shows that poverty inSri Lanka is largely a rural phenomenon and that the majority o fthe poor are
employed in apculture. The second study outlines a number o f key constraints, including poor access to
critical infrastructure and services (such as, roads, markets, telecommunications, electricity and banlung
services), ineffective public sector expenditure programs, poor flow o f information on technology
transfer, dominance o f public sector as a service provider and underutilization o f private sector interests
and initiatives. Like other South Asian countries, poor communities in Sri Lanka lack access to basic
services and financial resources to improve their income and welfare. Inaddition, the poor lack decision-
malung power to articulate local development priorities. Inthe search for sustainable solutions to address
these problems, GOSL has been implementing a variety o f development programs for several decades.
Unfortunately, most o f these efforts have not been able to contribute adequately to the government's goal
o f alleviating rural poverty on a sustainable basis.

A.1.2. Over the past four years, GOSL has made major efforts to deepen its understanding o f the nature
and root causes o f poverty in Sri Lanka, mainly to reassess and reformulate its policy fi-amework for
reducing poverty. GOSL's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) leans towards greater reliance on
economic opportunities and growth than on redistribution; addresses the inefficiencies and inequities in
the social protection system, particularly in the Samurdhi program'; and promotes empowerment o f the
poor through improved governance. The primary goals o f the GOSL's strategy are to secure peace,
growth and equity and to achieve significant transformation inthe quality o f life o f the people especially
inruralareas, through increasedincomes, andinvigorationo fthe rural economy.

A.1.3.   Although, Sri Lanka has made remarkable progress in the area o f human development, equity
remains a serious issue for two reasons. First, equity i s needed to ensure balanced growth at the national
level, with a special focus on the southern part that i s lagging behind the rest o f the country. The volume
of resources currently available (through various programs) inthe southern provinces (Uva and Southern
Province) i s considerable. Despite this, a large share o f these resources either does not reach the rural
poor, or i s not directed to activities that are not among the highest priorities o fthe poor, or is not delivered
in a cost effective manner. Second, Sri Lanka may not be able to meet the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) ifit does not achieve equity.

A.1.4. Faced with these challenges, and recognizing the need for innovative solutions to alleviate rural
poverty, GOSL has taken a policy decision to address poverty inthe country by adopting the Community-
DrivenDevelopment (CDD) approach.


'Samurdhi i  s a national poverty alleviation program implemented since 1995-96, by the Ministry o f Samurdhl, and
has been designed to focus on the poor and vulnerable inrural areas. The program covers a wide range o f services,
such as, monthly cash grants to the recipients, subsidized consumer items; a compulsory savings and credit
mechanisms using a village levelbanking system; an insurance mechanism for the poor; scholarships andbooks and
other basic needs for school children, etc. The programhas a wide geographic coverage--25 districts (3 10Divisions
and 14,000 GNDs, implementedby a cadre o f 26,000 specially recruited social mobilizers) with an annual budget o f
about Rs.13.5 billion.


                                                         1

2. Rationale for IDA involvement

A.2.1. GOSL has requested IDA to assist in adopting the CDD approach and developing a long-term
strategy for transferring funds for rural development through this approach. Itbelieves that IDA'Ssupport
will trigger a strong demonstration effect nationwide. IDA i s uniquely positioned to support GOSL's
long-term reform agenda of devolving powers to communities and local governments, and can make
available to GOSL its considerable knowledge of national and internationalexperience and best practices.
By serving as a facilitator, IDA can play a critical role inpromoting local institutions as key partners in
the local development process, be catalytic in helping to consolidate the participatory and transparent
resource allocation at the local level, and ensure that these processes continue beyond the life and scope
of the project, when external support will be gradually phasedout. Inthe context of this program, IDA is
in constant dialogue with other international agencies, including ADB, JBIC, UNDP, GTZ, KfW and
IFAD.

3. Higher levelobjectivesto which the project contributes

A.3.1. The proposed program is closely aligned to GOSL's strategic priorities. It would particularly
focus on rural infrastructure, which i s viewed as a major bottleneck for increasing rural growth,
strengtheningmarket, credit andtechnical support services to the poorer communities, strengtheninglocal
governments' planning and implementation capacity, and ensuring effective involvement o f the
communities in the programming o f investments and their implementation. By improving access of
village communities to basic economic and social infrastructure and productive opportunities, the
proposed project will helpraise incomes and improve well-being. The use of participatory processes that
have proven to increase the voice o f rural communities in priority-setting and decision-malung over
resource allocation will help build social capital, strengthen local governance, and improve the
effectiveness and sustainability of development mechanisms.

A.3.2. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed in April 2003, indicates a strong focus on
support to the peace process, growth and equity. To achieve sustainable poverty reduction, the CAS
recommends support for well targeted anti-poverty programs to enhance the human and physical capital
of the poor, both to improve social conditions and to allow communities to make better use o f economic
opportunities. Inline with the CAS goals, the proposed program promotes sustainable poverty reduction
inthe poorregionsofthe countryandhelpsto leverageresourcesfor localdevelopment.

A.3.3. The proposed program also supports the MDGs of: (i)improving incomes o f the poorest               -
reducingthe proportion of people living on less than US$1 a day (Goal 1, Target 1); (ii) promoting gender
equality and empowering women (Goal 3, Target 4); and (iii)       sustainable access to safe drinlungwater
and improved sanitation (Goal 7, Targets 10 & 11).

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

B.1.1. The CDD approach adopted by the project to address rural poverty focuses on building and
sustaining village level institutions and transferring decision-malung responsibilities and resources to
communities. International experience suggests that sustainable community development i s a long-term
process and sustainable poverty reduction cannot be achieved quickly. Experience also suggests that the
scaling up of anti-poverty programs needs to be approached ina gradual and phasedmanner to allow the
institutional support framework to be established. Against this background, GOSL and IDA have agreed
that a long-term programmatic approach would be most suitable for addressing sustainable poverty



                                                     2

reduction in Sri Lanka. The Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument has therefore been identified as
the appropriate lending instrument for this program.

2. Program objective and phases

B.2.1. The long-term objective o f the proposedprogrami s to support GOSL's strategy o freducing rural
poverty and promoting sustainable and equitable rural development through: (i)      better access o f the poor
to basic social and economic infrastructure and services and support for productive activities; and (ii)   the
development o f policies, rules, systems, procedures and institutional arrangements that would allow the
government to transfer funds directly to communities and provide them with technical and other support
on a demand-driven basis. The key expected outcomes o f the program are: (a) at least 75 percent o f the
households in the project area benefit fi-om increased income, incremental income generated from sub-
project investments and improved access to social and economic infrastructure; and (b) at least 50
percent o f national, provincial and district budgetary resources for rural development are channeled
directly to community organization and reflect community priorities.

B.2.2. The project will achieve the program goals by following a phased approach o f progressive
geographic expansion (ie., the "horizontal" version o f the APL) and policy deepening (ie., vertical
version o f the APL). GOSL's vision o f the program, as conveyed through the Letter o f Development
Policy, i s to influence the overall transfer o f budgetary resources to communities through decentralized
programs. The performance o f key local government institutions would be clearly monitored to draw
lessons for future policy dialogue with the Ministry o f Finance and the Ministry of Policy Development
and Implementation and with other stakeholders.

B.2.3. The APL instrument will provide a flexible and long-term approach under which IDA would
commit support for 12 years (about US$181.O million) inthree overlappingphases. The program would
cover 4,000 to 5,000 village communities in about 2,000 Gram Niladhari Divisions (GNDs - lowest
administrative unit) in 12 years' time. At the end o f each phase, the expected outcomes would be to have
local self-goveming institutions that are able to manage their resources sustainably and to mobilize
resources from the private and public sector. Overall, the lessons leamed fi-om each phase would be
incorporated into the strategies and approaches o f the next phase. The process therefore would allow for
continuous adjustment o f the project design, early risk identification, and implementation o f corrective
measures before expanding to other phases. If the performance triggers are not met, subsequent phases
may not take place.

B.2.4. Phase 1 (APL 1) would cover the first four-year period, supported by an IDA grant o f US$51.0
million (subject o f this PAD) and would be implemented in about 1,000 village communities (in about
510 GNDs) intwo provinces o f Uva and Southem Province. The program would be deepened inPhase 1
provinces by enlargmg the scale o f the proposed activities and focusing on institutional change in local
governments to enable them to become more responsive to citizens' demands and on establishing
federations and networks. The program would be gradually expanded from the southem districts to
include all the poorest districts o f the country.      Phases 2 and 3 (APL 2 and 3) will be initiated
independently o f the termination dates o f the previous phase and would cover 800 GNDs and 700 GNDs
respectively. Each Phase will begin when readiness criteria for expansion are satisfied. DuringPhases 2
and 3, the project will also invest ininstitutional partnerships which will increase the communities' ability
to bargainand negotiate and to achieve economies o f scale.

B.2.5. Each Phase will focus on three stages: (i)empowerment o f communities and building o f
community organizations i.e. Village Organizations (VOs); (ii)     institutional development process, which
would include formation and strengthening of federations o f VOs and building accountable and demand




                                                       3

responsive local governments; and (iii)forging partnerships between federations of VOs, local
government, financial institutions, the private sector, etc.

B.2.6. Moving from Phase 1(APL 1) to Phase 2 (AF'L2) will depend on achievement o f the following
performance triggers related to the satisfactory implementationo f Phase 1: (i)   at least 60% of VOs inthe
project villages covered in the first two years of Phase 1have accessed the Village Development Funds
(VDFs) while complying with rules as described inthe COM; andhave at least completed one sub-project
activity; (ii)at least 30% of women participate in decision makmg by holding management positions
(either as members o f the Board of Directors or as members o f VOs' sub-committees) in the first two
years o f Phase 1; (iii)
                       at least 50% o f the members o f the project villages covered have contributed 20%
or more toward capital cost of community infrastructure activities; (iv) at least 50% of the members o f the
project villages covered during the first two years of Phase 1 have benefited from project interventions;
and at least 60% o f these beneficiaries belong to the poorest households as identified by the Maha Sabha;
and (v) at least 25% o f the Divisions covered in the first two years o f Phase 1 have established
participatory sub-committees at the PS level with 30% elected representatives and 70% representatives of
community organizations to enhancetheir capacity for decentralized decision making.

B.2.7. The performance triggers for moving to Phase 3 (APL3) will be related to policy and horizontal
scaling up of the program. Policy triggers will refer to the establishment of institutional arrangementsfor
transfer of resources and delivery of services following the CDD approach. These triggers would be
reviewedand agreedduringthe preparation ofPhase 2 (AF'L2).

3. Project development objective and key indicators

B.3.1. The overall development .objective of the 12 year program would be to enable the rural poor to
improve their livelihood and quality of life.       The objective o f Phase 1 would be to target poor
communities inthe Uva and Southern provinces and improve their livelihood and quality o f life. Phase 1
would enable them to build accountable and self-governing local institutions and to manage sustainable
investments by: (i)   devolving decision making power and resources to community organizations; (ii)
strengthening selected local governments that demonstrate responsiveness and accountability to rural
communities; and (iii)working with federations of VOs, private sector and Non-Govemmental
Organizations (NGOs) on economic empowerment to increase size and diversityo f livelihood.

B.3.2. The key performance indicators to measure the achievements o f the project activities would be
the following: (i)  number of VOs formed and percentage o f these functioning effectively in priority
setting and decision makmg on resource allocation; (ii)     percentage o f sub-projects that are implemented
and maintained by the communities; (iii)     percentage increase in household incomes o f the poor; (iv)
percent of VOs with sustainable savings and credit system at the end o f the project; and (v) an increase in
private sector investment inthe communities.

4. Project components
(refer to Annex 4 and 5)

B.4.     Theproposedproject would include the following five components:

B.4.1. Component I: Village Development (USU6.6 million) - This component will have two sub-
components: (i)    Development and Strengthening of Village Organizations; and (ii)Funding o f
Community Sub-projects.      The first   sub-component will help develop self-reliant and self-managed
people's organizations for community development and livelihood improvement in rural areas. The
activities under the second sub-component would include capacity building, social and community




                                                      4

infrastructure, and livelihood support activities.     The component will finance village sub-projects,
procuremento f goods, training, and other services.

B.4.2. Component 2: Institutional Strengthening (US$6.0million) - This component would strengthen
capacity o f local and national agencies and support organizations (SOs) to facilitate implementationo f the
program effectively and broaden their skills, especially in participatory development, as well as to
develop a monitoring and learning system to capture results on the ground, and respond to the needs and
demands of the community. The component will include introduction o f social and public accountability
mechanisms, like participatory budgeting, community report cards, social audit and expenditure trackmg
to trigger changes in responsiveness and accountability among local govemment institutions and
communities. The component will also include a Policy Dialogue sub-component to help policy makers
develop policies, rules, systems and institutional arrangements that would allow the government to
transfer funds and technical support to communities on a demand driven basis. The component will
finance training, workshops, technical assistance, exposure visits, and goods.

B.4.3. Component 3: Innovation Seed Fund (US$1.5 million) - This component would pilot innovative
ideas that need experimentation, learning and incubation and have the potential for being scaled up and
replicated. Some o f the pilots will include technology and product development related to agricultural
processing and value addition and information technology in collaboration with other development
initiatives like E-Lanka, Uva Community Radio and Pradeshiya Sabha Incentive Fund. The component
will finance goods, trainingand services.

B.4.4. Component 4: Project Management (US$4.7 million) - The component would facilitate overall
coordination and management o f the project at national, provincial and divisional levels. The component
will finance goods, works, services andrecurrent costs.

B.4.5. Component 5: Village Self-Help Learning Initiative (VSHLI) Pilot (US$l.O million) - The
component would complete implementation o f the ongoing pilot in Polonnaruwa district. The pilot was
initiated in 2000 under the Mahaweli Rehabilitation and RestructuringProject (MRRP), which closed in
December 2003, to test an institutional model that empowers village communities and builds partnership
at the local level. The pilot has successfully demonstrated that given the participatory framework,
communities can articulate their needs and priorities and take responsibility for implementing and
monitoring village development. The pilot will now test the second stage o f institutional development -
federation o fVOs and partnership with private sector. The component would finance village subprojects,
goods, training and services.

5. Lessons learned and reflected inthe project design

B.5.1. Experience with GOSL's previous work inpoverty alleviation and the recent experience with the
CDD approach under the pilot project supported by IDA', as well as with several other interventions
funded by GOSL, IDA and other donors, have provided extensive lessons and generated beneficiary
expectations with regard to sustainable results in poverty alleviation. The proposed program seeks to
buildonthe following lessons:
0    Best results on the ground are obtained by listening to the people and enabling them to participate in
     the design and implementationo fprojectsbased on self-identified needs andpriorities.
0    Experience has shown that the CDD approach can reduce bureaucracy, eliminate administrative
     bottlenecks and reinforce accountability for project outcomes by placing decision malung closer to
     beneficiaries.

that GOSLhasbeenimplementingwith IDA support for the lastfour years.


                                                      5

e   Provide direct finance to community groups has shown to improve cost effectiveness o f small
    infrastructure works, build community confidence and capacity to manage, and increase
    accountability of service providers to communities.
e   Communities are willing to contribute-in           cash and labor-and      invest their time in managing
    (including Operation and Maintenance (O&M)) sub-projects when they: (i)             see clear benefits; (ii)
    have a role in managing their own development and controlling and allocating funds for various
    priorities (accountability and authority are clear); (iii)    select the common and basic needs first; and
    (iv) have full freedom inselecting the technology options and inprocuringgoods and services.
e   Transparency and proper dissemination of project rules are the two most critical factors for
    community participation and empowerment. Simple and clear rules o f business need to be widely
    disseminated and then consistently and transparently enforced. Once the rules are agreed upon, they
    should be adheredto by all parties concemed.
e   Developing effective institutional linkages with the relevant local authorities and assisting capable
    members o f communities (especially the youth) to develop as "paraprofessionals", from the inception
    itself, are critical factors for overall project sustainability.
e   Sustainability of externally financed activities - such as a loan fund- i s enhanced when communities
    have a strong sense of ownership of the assets and effective guidelines and systems to manage the
    assets.
e   There should be a simple and user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system that facilitates the
    subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and all necessary information to improve targeting
    and efficiency, and functions as management and planningtool.
e   Intensive supervision of CDD projects i s an indispensable determinant o f success and sustainability.
    It needs to be reinforced at all levels and involve local agencies that are closest to the communities,
    particularly PS and Divisional staff.

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

B.6.1. In designing the proposed project, various altemative approaches were considered.                 These
includedthe following options:

    Traditional, centralized approach to implementation using line agencies: Experience with integrated
    rural poverty reduction projects in Sri Lanka during the past 20 years has demonstrated that more
    centralized approaches to poverty reduction are not very effective in dispersedrural areas for reasons
    including: coordination difficulties, sub-projects that did not accurately respond to community needs
    and poor sustainability. By contrast,        the project builds on a successful community driven pilot,
    recognized for its effectiveness, transparency and strong performance inbuildingsocial capital among
   .rural communities.

    Channeling resources directly to line agencies: Decentralization o f finance and program
    responsibilities to line agencies without building capacity at the community level to interact
    effectively with these governments, carries the risk o f merely replicating difficulties associated with
    centralized decision-making albeit at a lower level.

    A program loan to the central government to bepassed on to the Provincial Councils: Consideration
    was given to a single large IDA loan to GOSL to be passed on to the provincial councils. However,
    the benefits interms of demonstrated commitment and ownership on the part of village communities
    were judged to outweigh any apparent savings in time and cost o f processing individual provincial
    loans. Implementation delays resulting from more complex arrangements for transferring funds from
    the central to the provincial level might offset such savings and would certainly undermine the
    credibility o fthe project among the beneficiaries.

C.2.1. The main strategic choices made inthe project design include:


0        Cost Sharing to ensure genuine demand for services and community ownership and commitment.
The participating communities contribute between 20 to 30% in infrastructure sub-projects and ensure
cost effectiveness o f the investments by exploring various possibilities and options.
0        Institutional Reforms and Decentralization to ensure institutional sustainability.             Local
government would be involved, ina phasedmanner, to increase their capacity to deliver services and raise
revenues.
0        Direct Transfer of Funds to Communities to ensure proper accountability and use o f funds. This
mechanism would be strengthened by establishing appropriate rules, regulations and systems that would
ensure transparency and accountability.
0        Fixed Budget Envelope and Milestone-Based Disbursement to ensure rational allocation o f
limited resources among the competing needs and accountability o f local organizations. Each VO would
be eligible for a fixed budget envelope based on per capita criteria and funds would be transferred to the
communities on achievement o f agreed milestones.
0        Devolution of O&MActivities to Communities to ensure the sustainability o f assets created under
the project. Inthe case o f savings and loans activities, the community organizations will be responsible
for maintaining the value o f the loan fund.
0        Simple and Transparent Rules of Engagement to ensure proper dissemination and understanding
among the communities and other stakeholders.
0        Independence and Autonomy of the "Guardian of Rules" to ensure that appraisers and approvers
o f community sub-project proposals have total independence and autonomy to appraise and monitor the
project inaccordance with the agreed rules.

C.2.2. Project ImplementationProcess: The project would be implemented according to rules and
procedures agreed in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and COM. These documents outline roles
and responsibilities o f individual agencies and provide details o f project processes and project cycle. The
PIP and COM are based on the experiences gained during the implementation o f the VSHLI pilot and
testing o f hands-on learning phase and various preparation workshops, studies and analyses that were
carried out as part o f project preparation.       The hands-on learning phase, in particular, focused on
validating various assumptions about community participation and ownership, willingness to contribute,
partnering capabilities o f local institutions and capacity buildingefforts required. COM will be subject to
periodic reviews conducted jointly by GOSL and IDA, with stakeholders' participation, to ensure
flexibility and to promptly address any constraints to the successful implementation o f the program. Any
changes inthe PIE' and COMwould require IDA'Sprior concurrence.

C.2.3, ProposedImplementationArrangements : The implementation arrangements at various levels
are describedbelow:




                                                       7

          (a) Community Level Arrangements. The proposed institutional arrangements would ensure
that communities are inthe driving seat interms o f organizing themselves, prioritizing their investments,
allocating resources, preparing subproject proposals, implementing sub projects and maintaining their
assets. There would be three levels o f community organizations: (i)Village Assembly or Maha Sabha
(MS); (ii)   VOs; and (iii)
                          Federation o f VOs.

          Village Organization (VOs): Constituted under the Companies Act, VOs comprise the MS, the
Board of Directors, and various sub-committees. VOs will have access to a Village Development Fundto
undertake investments in social, economic and community infrastructure. Part o f the Village
Development Fund will be allocated to a Loan Fund that will enable villagers to engage in income
generation activities o f their own choice.       To be eligible for the Village Developmental Fund,
communities must agree to the project rules, and proceed through the "project cycle".              Village
communities will receive technical assistance in participatory appraisal, community contracting and
financial management to competently manage the developmental funds. All critical decision-mahng
power and O&M responsibility will be at the community level. SOs will partner with local level agencies
and local govemments and will play a critical role in creating community awareness and ensuring
empowerment. Over time, the project would support federations of VOs to achieve scales o f operations
especially in income generating programs and to establish direct partnership with the private and public
sectors.

          Jb) Divisional Level Arrangements: Divisional Facilitation Teams (DFTs) will be responsible
for community facilitation. DFTs will assist communities in planning, implementation, monitoring,
analyzing and adjustingthe project. Their key role includes promoting and guarding program principles at
the divisional level, helping VOs in securing services of SOs and other service providers, providing
technical assistance as and when requested by VOs, reviewing progress o f implementation and helping
VOs inremovinghindrances to project implementation, andresolvingconflicts.

         Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) Level: The devolution o f power, responsibilities and funds to a highly
committed local government authority i s critical for institutional sustainability and scaling up o f the
project. For thispurpose, PS level would be involved throughout the program. The project would invest in
buildingtheir capacity and creating an enabling environment for them to be able to respondto community
demands. Their involvement would be achieved gradually, inthree stages, as described inAnnex 6.

          lc) District Level Arrangements: The District Facilitation Team (DrFT) will promote and
guard the program principles at the district level. DrFTswill assist inthe self selection o f GNDs, prepare
a roster o f service providers, provide technical assistance and support, facilitate linkages with private
sector, ensure convergence and linkage with other projects, review progress and resolve conflicts at the
district level.

          (d) National Level Arrangements: An Inter-ministerial Committee and the Gemi Diriya
Foundation would be the two institutions at the national level.         The Inter-ministerial Committee,
consisting o f Ministers o f Samurdhi, Rural Economy, Southem Development, and Central Development,
will be chaired bythe Minister, Samurdhi and will play an advisory and oversight role.

          Gemi Diriya Foundation (Foundation): This i s an autonomous agency established under the
Company's Act. 'The Board will be chaired by the Secretary, Samurdhi, and will comprise the Secretary
Ministry of Rural Economy (ME) a senior representative o f Planning and Policy Implementation
Ministry,a senior representative ofFinance/ERD, two representatives fromoutside the Govemment (such
as CDD practioners, private sector, banking sector, etc) while the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) would
act as the Convener. The Board would review project progress, resolve impediments, sanction annual
plans, provide policy reform and strategic support, and act as guardian of project rules. The CEO would



                                                     8

be responsible for the day-to-day management o f the project and be accountable to the Board. The
Foundation would be responsible for project coordination, monitoring, financial management,
procurement, disbursement, and audit. The operational autonomy o f the Foundation would allow the
management team to remain flexible and adapt, based on implementation experience. The staff o f the
Foundation will be selected through open competition and be professionally competent. The Foundation
will have two Teams: (i)    Management Team at the national level; and (ii)      Appraisal and Monitoring
( A M ) Team located in each Province. Both Teams would be headed by the CEO o f the Foundation.
The Management Team at the national level would be responsible for the project information education
campaign and promotion, overall coordination and monitoring and evaluation, and would consist o f three
units: (a) Village Institutions Unit; (b) Business and Livelihood Development Unit; and (c) Project
Management Support Unit. The A&M Team with one field office in each o f the two provinces will be
responsible for institutional and technical appraisal o f the sub-projects and for ensuring compliance with
the rules o f the game and good quality o f service provision to communities. The project would devolve
powers, responsibilities and funds to local governments by using a gradual approach inthree phases (See
Annex 6).

FundsFlow Arrangements:

C.2.4. Disbursement Procedures: Disbursements from the Grant account would initially be made on
the transaction-based system (reimbursement with full documentation) and against statements o f
expenditure, direct payment and Special Commitment. GOSL may request withdrawals from the Grant
account to be made on the basis o f reports to be submitted to IDA in form and substance satisfactory to
IDA, such reports to include the Financial Management Reports (FMRs) and any other information as
IDA shall specify by notice to GOSL (Report-based Disbursements). Annex 7 gives details on the fund
flow processes.

C.2.5.  A Special Account (SA) would be opened at the Central Bank and would be operated by the
Foundation. The authorized allocation o f the Special Account would be US$3.8 million, that represents
about four months o f average estimated eligible expenditures from the IDA Grant. The Special Account
would be operated inaccordance with IDA'Soperational policies.

C.2.6. Retroactive Financing: GOSL has requested retroactive financing o f US$2.0 million to meet the
expenditures incurred after August 31, 2003, including those that are anticipated upto the Grant signing.
The activities to be covered by retroactive financing are consistent with the project's financing categories
as agreed with IDA.

3. Monitoring,LearningandEvaluationof OutcomeslResults:

(2.3.1. Monitoring will have two components.         One would deal with policy impact and compare
performance o f existing systems and procedures with those being tested out inthe project and compare its
impact and cost effectiveness with other governmental welfare programs and service delivery systems.
Results o f policy level impact would be continuously shared with decision makers in the Ministry o f
Finance and Ministryof Policy Development and Implementation. The second component o fmonitoring
will deal with project level impacts. A Monitoring, Learning and Evaluation (ML&E) system has been
developed under the project, and i s being tested out in 24 pilot GNDs, with the objective o f generating
analytical information on the project's progress and performance, and disseminating this information
among stakeholders to enable them to effectively address project implementation issues, and revisehefine
the implementation approach as needed. The ML&E system will include: (i)              monitoring o f project
progress and utilizationo f village development funds- or inputs, outputs and outcomes; (ii)  monitoring o f
performance o f project institutions; systems, procedures and processes; and (iii)    project impacts. The
ML&E system will be established at three different levels - community, divisional and national. The


                                                     9

information will flow from community members to the CEO through the divisional coordinator
interfacing with divisional secretaries and service providers. As part o f monitoring and learning, six-
monthly audits (independent reviews) would be carried out by an external agency to ensurethat processes
and procedures as agreed are followed. The lessons emerging from the independent audits (reviews)
would be disseminated and discussed with the village level institutions, communities, divisional and
district teams and SOs, andcorrective measureswould be taken on a continuous basis.

C.3.2.    SocialAccountability Mechanisms. The projectwould promote and set up social accountability
mechanisms and systems within and betweenVO and community and service providers, and between the
Foundation and the communities.         Among other instruments, report cards will be used to ensure
accountability o f VOs, service providers, DFTs and SOs to the communities. The project would promote
transparency by openly displaying all financial andphysical information inaccessible form. Social Audit
Sub-committees (one of the various VOs' sub-committees) will use input and expenditure tracking and
report cards to develop a culture of accountability withincommunities. This information will be used for
developing rating system for VOs, and would be scaledup with local govemments after initialpiloting.

4. Sustainability

C.4.1. The project will focus on ensuring sustainability o f investments. An effort is made to create
mechanisms to involve all sections o f the community in the prioritizing o f investments, and in the
selection o f technical options based on their affordability and viability. For infrastructure investments,
the sustainability analysis would be made part of the participatory appraisal at the community level to
ensure selection o f technical choices that are affordable to the communities and can be managed and
operatedby the communities themselves. For livelihood support investments, the project would provide
technical assistance and exposure to communities to ensure that viable activities are undertaken as
business opportunities andthat the products and services chosenbythe communitieshave markets.

C.4.2.    Strengthening the capacity o f local governments to provide public expenditures and services ina
transparent and accountable manner directly to communities and strengthening o f VOs and savings and
credit organizations ownedby their members will leadto institutional sustainability. Besides, the project
will focus ondevelopinga diversified skill base (technical, financial andmanagerial) including fuflctional
leaders and village para-professionals at the community level who would be hired and paid by VOs and
other local institutions. The project will also support development o f a network or federated VOs which
will support community organizations after the project period and also help them access markets,
investments andthe private sector.

C.4.3. Contributions by the village community members towards the capital cost and full contribution
towards the recurring cost o f maintaining assets would lead to financial sustainability. Also, developinga
capital base at the VO level by using contributions and income from credit given to members;
encouraging a savings mindset to reach the goal o f sustainable livelihood, and linkingsavings and credit
organizations to banks will leadto financial sustainability.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic andfinancial analyses

D.1.1, The proposed project focuses on social organization and empowerment, improved local
governance, capacity building and community initiated and demanded sub-projects, including income
generation and rural infrastructure. Hence, economic opportunities from subprojects are but one o f the
project's outputs; the other two being empowered and active groups o f disadvantaged people and their
ability to promote more effective, accountable and inclusive local institutions. Due to its demand-driven
character, the project does not lend itself easily to a detailed ex-ante cost-benefit analysis and rate o f
return calculations. It will be the beneficiaries who ultimately determine the scope and mix o f the
investments.

2. Technical

D.2.1. Based on the experience o f VSHLI pilot, the community, economic and social infrastructure
would mainly consist o f activities, such as, rural water supply schemes, community and environmental
sanitation facilities, water harvesting measures, minor irrigation rehabilitation, community centers,
improvement o f inter village roads providing access to link roads and savings and credit facilities.
Savings and Loan Guidelines, as part o f the COM, have been developed and will be accompanied by a
well-documented accounting system. The community will choose the desired technology and service
levels, based on their affordability, with the help of SOs, divisional teams and technical service providers.
A Technical Manual, as part o f the COM, has been developed with various technical options, and
standards for viable per unit costs.     Guidelines and codes o f conduct to guide the community and
facilitation teams have been developed for effective decision malung during the planning and
implementation process. DFTs will be responsible for facilitating and ensuring that the communitieshave
access to trained technical service providers to support feasibility, design and implementation o f



                                                      13

subprojects. The &M Team would appraise community infrastructure sub-project proposals and ensure
their compliance with technical standards and safeguard requirements, economic viability and ease o f
operation and management after completion. Adoption o f internationally tested labor based construction
technique will be encouraged while implementing the sub-projects. Communities, SOs, divisional teams
and A&M Team would supervise the quality o f works under implementation. Social audits by an internal
sub-committee as well as extemal audits will be carried out every six months to check compliance with
procurement process, quality o fmaterial and works and financial management aspects.

3. Fiduciary

ProcurementIssues:
D.3.1.  GOSL prepared guidelines on "Government Tender Procedure" in 1996 (revised inAugust 1997)
under Chapter 13 o f the Financial Regulations. The Guidelines and Rules provide the framework for all
public procurement in the country including Provincial Councils (PCs), local governments, etc. It also
includes a separate chapter (XIII) for projects assisted by foreign funding agencies (this chapter has been
revised in December 2000 and issued as a separate booklet) and has resultedinmarked improvements in
the transparency of procurement processes. These Guidelines are now being revised to accommodate
recommendations following the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR),                    which was
completed in2003.

D.3.2.  Community Procurement: Procurement at the community level will be guided by the
Community Participation in Procurement (CPP- Para. 3.15 o f the Procurement Guidelines).               The
procurement procedures, processes and methods have been developed extensively during the
implementation o f the VSHLI pilot. These procedures and guidelines have been further reviewed during
the project preparation, and are being tested in the 24 intensive learning GNDs. COM gives detailed
procedures, rules and methods o f community procurement.             Prior to transferring funds to VOs,
community procurement training modules would be developed and the relevant committee members and
Board o f Directors would be trained incommunity procurement.

D.3.3.  Other Project Procurement: The Foundationwill be responsible for the procurement o f goods
and services for the remaining project components, and will comply with the IDA'S procedures as
described inthe relevant Guidelines. The capacity o f the Foundationcore team and district and divisional
level staff will need to be improved through procurement training programs both at national and
provincial levels.

FinancialManagementIssues
D.3.4. The financial management system proposed for the project i s adequate to meet GOSL and
communities' project management needs as well as IDA'Sfiduciary requirements as per OPBP 10.02.
The financial management framework envisages that the project will maintain accounts using standard
double entry cash hybrid-accounting systems.         The project implementation agencies will prepare
monthly/quarterly/annualreports required for project management at the village, district and national
levels. The accounting and reporting system will be manual in the beginning and will move into a
computerized environment during the life o f the project. GOSL will, by September 30, 2005, establish
and maintainthereafter the computerized Financial Management System (FMS).

D.3.5. The Financial Management Manual along with the Financing Agreements entered into between
the Foundation and VOs would include detailed guidelines on the agreed financial management
arrangements. The main challenges to satisfactory financial management o f the project relate to the
capacity to maintain quality and robustness o f the systems put inplace, while scaling up the project. The
financial management arrangements have consequently focused on: (i)simplifylng the financial
management framework and minimizingthe number o f accounting centers; (ii)       buildingthe robustness of


                                                     14

the appraisal mechanisms for sub-projects; and (iii)       ensuring that the project invests substantially in
buildingthe capacity of communities inbook-keeping and accounting through trainings o f office bearers
o f VOs and developing a cadre of para-professional book-keepers. Important lessons learned from the
implementation experiences inother C D D projects inthe region and duringthe implementation o f VSHLI
pilot have been incorporated into the design o f the FMS. The financial management arrangements would
focus on providing local level transparency, social audit and self-accountability.            The institutional
framework for the project envisages adequate levels o f staffing for financial management and accounting
functions at the national, provincial, district/divisional and village levels (Annex 7).

D.3.6. Audit: The Foundation, in consultation with the Auditor General of Sri Lanka (AG), will appoint
an independent firm o f chartered accountants to conduct annual audit of the project. The audit would
cover all project operations o f the national and provincial levels, and will also cover the VO accounts on a
sample basis. The selection and appointment o f the private Chartered Accountant (CA) firm will be
based on TOR(s) acceptable to IDA, and the selected firm will need to be acceptable to IDA. The audit
report would consist of: (i) financial statements; and (ii) opinion confirming: (a) whether the project
                                                            audit
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with consistently applied Accounting Standards
and give a true and fair view o f the operations o f the project duringthe year; and (b) that the withdrawals
from the IDA Grant made on the basis of Statement o f Expenses (SOEs)/FMRs together with the
procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied on to support the related
withdrawals. The auditor will be requiredto provide a letter to project management highlighting findings
during the audit. The audit will be conducted as per internationally accepted standards and financial
reportingwill follow the International Public Sector Accounting Standard(IPSAS) standards.

4. Social
D.4.1. The project seeks to improve the quality o f life o f the target population through village
investments under a CDD approach, thereby increasing the social capital o f rural communities via their
participation at all levels o f the sub-project cycle. Under the project's participatory approach, the wide
inclusion o f all potential beneficiaries including women, youth and vulnerable groups, would be ensured
through an information campaign designed to create awareness regarding the project's objectives, rules
and guidelines, and how to access project benefits. A gender and youth strategy specifically focusing on
their role as decision makers and beneficiaries has been designed and will be implemented duringproject
implementation (Annex 10). The project also includes incentives and'rewards (such as Grants to the
Poorest and Incentive Fund) for the VOs to include the poorest and vulnerable members in the project
benefits. Strategies to mobilize active participation and inclusion o f the most vulnerable members such
as, the landless, widows and female-supported households, and the disabled havebeen incorporated.

5. Environment
D.5.1. The project i s classified as category B as it i s expected to be beneficial from an environmental
and social perspective as the project investments will be small, very localized, and labor intensive. No
significant impacts are expected on any critical ecosystems or culturally or socially sensitive areas.
GOSL carried out an Environmental Assessment (EA) o f possible activities that may be included in the
project and a study to assess impact o f human-elephant conflict in the project areas and management
options for their mitigation. Considering the demand driven nature o f this project, specific village
investments or subprojects cannot be identified duringpreparation. As part o f the EA, an EMF has been
developed, which will serve as a template for ensuring that village investments or subprojects are
conducted in an environmentally sound manner. The EMF identifies: (i)        tools for screening o f activities at
the village level, including a negative list that would be excluded from project funding; (ii)   screening and
clearance procedures for village level activities at three levels (village, district and provincial); and (c)
capacity buildingto ensure effective implementation o f the EMF at various levels. All sub-projects will
be subject to environmental screening based on the tools as identified inEMFand referenced inCOM. A
pest management plan and dam safety plan have also been developed as part o f the EA. The pest



                                                       15

management strategy will attempt to strengthen linkages with existing programs o f the Department o f
Agriculture, Provincial Departments o f Agriculture, Divisional Secretaries and NGOs. Interms o f the
human-elephant conflict, the project will provide resources and options during village-level planning in
the most severely affected areas to reduce and manage the conflict through promotion o f non-agricultural
investments, crop protection devices, community patrolling and guarding, ecotourism and pilot testing of
physical barriers.

D.5.2. Public Consultations: Public consultations were carried out, as part o f the environmental and
social assessments, in all project districts and provinces. Consultations were also held with officials o f
the national, provincial, district and divisional level, and NGOs. Detailed consultations were held with 15
households in four villages in each o f the five project districts. The summary o f the draft EA and EMF
have been made available at the District Secretariats and other public places for comment and feedback.

6. SafeguardPolicies
D.6.1.   Involuntary land acquisition (OP 4.12): Most of village sub-project activities need very little
or no land acquisition. Land needed for income generation through private enterprise would be procured
at market rates. A detailed Social Assessment (SA) carried out in the project area indicates that minor
landneeded for up-gradation o f common infrastructure i s already available. Other private facilities do not
needinvoluntary land acquisition. Basedon these considerations, OP 4.12 i s not triggered.

D.6.2. Indigenous people (OD 4.20): The SA indicates that the indigenous population (Veddas) i s
located in a very limited area o f Uva province and had been already integrated into the mainstream under
Mahaweli Development Program. As such OD 4.20 i s not triggered.

CountryProfile
1.        Inthe recent past, GOSL has made major efforts to deepen its understanding o f the nature and
root causes o f poverty in Sri Lanka, with a view to reassessing and reformulating its policy framework to
reduce poverty.       As a part o f these efforts, IDA completed two major studies-'Si                    Lanka: Poverty
Assessment" and "Promoting Agncultural and Rural Non-farm Sector Growth".                                The first study
concludes that poverty in Sri Lanka i s largely a rural phenomenon. 90% o f those living below poverty
level are located inrural areas. 75% o f the total population i s located in rural areas, and 27% o f the rural
population lives below poverty level, with the majority being employed in apculture. In contrast to the
populationo f the rural sector, that o f the estate and the urban sector below poverty level accounts for 25%
and 12% o f the total respectively. The second study highlights a number o f key constraints to the
development o f the rural sector, including poor access to critical infrastructure and services, (such as,
roads, markets, telecommunications, electricity and banking services), ineffective public sector
expenditure programs, poor flow o f information technology, dominance o f public sector as a service
provider and underutilization o f private sector interests and initiatives. Despite numerous efforts to
reduce poverty, the problem continues to remain high in Sri Lanka with about one-fourth o f the
population livingbelow the poverty line. About 7% of the population live on incomes less than US$1 a
day, and 45% live under US$2 a day. These estimates do not reflect the poverty status inthe north-eastern
parts o f the country, where poverty would have worsened due to the on-going civil conflict.

2.        The data also suggest the existence o f large regional inequities inpoverty incidence with two o f
the provinces (Uva and Southern) inthe southern part o f country having the highest rural poverty rates in
the country. While Sri Lanka has made remarkable progress in the area o f human development over the
last decades, regional inequities remain a serious economic and social issue and this may hamper Sri
Lanka's ability to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG).

RegionalVariations inPoverty
3,        The latest HouseholdExpenditure and Income Survey (HEIS) data show that at the national level,
poverty has increased from 20 percent in 1990/91 to 25 percent in 1995/96. The data also suggest that
significant regional disparities still continue to exist despite good macroeconomic performance witnessed
duringthe early 1990s. Except for the Western province, all other provinces, including Uva and Southern
provinces have experienced a relative worsening o fpoverty situation between 1990-96 (Fig 1.1)

Project Area Uva and Southern provinces
               -
4.        Of the seven provinces for which detailed information on poverty profile is available, Uva i s the
fourth largest one. It occupies 15% of the country's land area and contains 6% o f the total population.
Uva province covers Badulla and Moneragala districts and both of them are entirely rural. In terms of
poverty, Uva shows the highest incidence with about 37% of its population below poverty line. Despite
the implementationof numerous development programs, Uvaprovince i s continuingto be one o fthe most
economically backwardregions inthe country. Mainly due to problems o f accessibility, connectivity, non
availability of quality infrastructure and poor quality o f economic services, Uva i s continuing to be
isolated from the rest o f the economy. Production o f primary commodities, mainly seasonal crops and
livestock i s the main source of economic sustenance. Access to health and education and other basic
services are less than satisfactory.    The development of Uva province i s affected by a number o f
economic, and social problems and its overall physical characteristics including hilly terrains, low and
long dry spells andabsence o f internalroadnetwork has accentuated these problems further.

5.       The Southern Province, consisting of Hambantota, Matara and Galle districts, shows a
significantly high average poverty incidence (27%) along with a high adult illiteracy (11%) with about
60% of the population having no access to electricity, 35% with no access to safe water and 20% having
no access to safe sanitation. However, in terms o f district-wise distribution of poverty and related
indicators, the Southern Province shows a remarkable disparity between districts.       Among the three
districts, Hambantota i s the most affected by poverty and related problems. It is located in the arid zone
and endowed with the lowest rainfall inthe country and hence subject to frequent andprolonged droughts
and chronic water shortages. Access to water for drinkingand irrigation is a critical problem, Almost all
o f Hambantota's population (97%) is rural and the population is primarily dependent on production of
seasonal crops and livestock as their main source o f economic sustenance. In addition, Hambantota
district also shows a high degree of economic isolation from the rest of the country due to remoteness
from main markets, poor quality of infrastructure and service provision, poor equity and inclusion. In
contrast to Hambantota, the other two districts inthe Southern Province (Matara and Galle) are generally
endowed with relatively better climatic and other factors. However, in the isolated pockets o f the
hinterlands, poverty is generally rampant. The coastal areas, beingcloser to main markets and the cities,
are better served with infrash-ucture and service facilities.

6.       The average monthly income of the project area is Rs. 5381 or about US$54 (Table 1.1). The
income distribution shows a substantial variation across the districts. About 50% the population inthe
project area lives below poverty line (less than US$1per day).

DevelopmentalPrograminthe Project Area
7.       With a view to improve the livelihoods o f the rural poor in the Uva and Southern provinces,
GOSL in the past has provided significant amounts o f funds for implementing a large number of
development programs (Table 1.2).

                           Source: District Secretary office records

8.       The analysis o f the total public expenditure incurred duringthe period 1998-2002 (Table 1.2) for
the two provinces for recurrent and capital costs per year averages to about Rs.15 billion. The overall
expenditure program i s dominated by agriculture (24%) and the transport (23%) sector. About 45% o f
the total expenditure inagriculture was aimed at rehabilitatingminor and major irrigation schemes. Social
infrastructure provision and improvement accounted for only 15% o fthe total public expenditure.

9.       GOSL i s also implementing a major welfare and service delivery program, called Samurdhi and
in2002, isreportedto have spent about Rs. 1.6billiononthisprogram (Table 1.3). The programcovers a
wide range o f sectors including health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure. Despite the channelling
of significant amount o f resources, the total number o f Samurdhi recipients in the two provinces during
1998- 2002 has seen only a marginal decline o f 3.4%. Inother words, only 14,049 persons (out of total o f
411,776) have benefited and weaned out of the program. Data relating to the overall physical quality o f
life o f the poor in both these provinces confirm that livelihood standards among the poor have not
experienced appreciable improvements.

10.      Despite government spending such significant amount o f resources, poverty levels in these two
provinces remain virtually unchanged. The non-responsiveness o f the public expenditure programs and
their lack o f cost-effectiveness is a major cause o f concern among key policy planners and implementers
inSri Lanka. The volume ofresourcescurrently available to these two provincesis considerable, andyet,
a large share o f resources available under these programs either does not reach the poor, or i s directed to
activities that are not among the highest priorities o f the poor, or i s not delivered in a cost effective


                                                                 19

manner. Faced with these challenges, and recognizing the need to try innovative solutions to rural
poverty, GOSLhas taken a policy decision to address poverty inthe country usingthe CDD approach.

11.      Evidence from VSHLI pilot and from international experience shows that CDD i s an effective
mechanism to make poverty reduction efforts more demand-responsive, equal and sustainable,
complementing market and governmental agencies by achieving immediate and lasting results at the
grassroots level.     At the same time, VSHLI pilots also suggest that CDD can improve the cost-
effectiveness and the efficiency of services like physical and social infrastructure and micro finance.
Finally, the direct transfer o f funds to communities has shownto empower communities and increase their
social capital.

Lendinginstrument: Adaptable ProgramLoan (APL)

12.      APL is chosen recognizing that sustainable community development is a process and that
outcomes o f sustainable poverty reduction cannot be achieved quickly and need a gradual process of
scaling up. Support over a long period of time i s therefore required. The proposed APL instrumentwill
provide a flexible and long-term horizon under which IDA would commit support for 12 years with a
phased approach of progressive geographic expansion and policy deepening (i.e.,              the so-called
"horizontal" and "vertical" versions o f the APL). The proposed program is explicitly aimed at scaling up
the VSHLI pilot over the 12-year period. The program would also test various strategies to extend the
reach of village communities and local governments, by progressively involving them in proactively
seeking funding and participating in decision making in resource allocation over all national and
provincial programs. At the end of the 12-year period, the program would leverage the overall impact of
expected public resources towards poverty reduction. The program would further assist communities to
access rural financial institutions, and expand ongoing piloting o f information technology to increase
transparency and to link communities directly to markets.

ProgramPhasing

13.      The APL would have three phases. Phase 1 would be implemented in about 1,000 village
communities (510 GNDs) of Uva and Southern provinces, testing further, refining and adapting the
experiences and approach developed during the VSHLIpilots. The program will be gradually expanded
from the southern districts to includeall the poorest parts of the country. Phases 2 and 3 would cover 800
and 700 GNDs respectively and would beginwhen readiness criteria for expansion are satisfied. Phase 1
would cost US$51 million, Phase 2 would cost US$70 million and Phase 3 would cost US$60 million.
Phase 1would focus on empowering communities, developing accountable and demand-responsive local
governments, and community federations or networks to develop links with markets (credit, commodity
and services). The subsequentphases (Phase 2 and 3) would be initiated independently of the termination
dates of the previous phase, when readiness criteria for expansion are satisfied. Phase 2 would provide
for expanding the geographic coverage of the program to include other poorest parts of the country which
meet eligibility criteria. The programwould be deepenedinPhase 1provinces by enlargingthe scale and
focusing on institutional change in local governments to become more responsive and on establishing
federations and networks. Each phase will be appraised takmg into consideration the experience gained
duringimplementationof the previous ones. This will allow for continuous adjustment to project design,
early risk identification, and implementation o f corrective measures before expanding to other phases.
During Phase 3 the program would be scaled up through institutions and slulled facilitators and
practitioners that worked intensivelyinPhases 1 and 2. Phase 3 would focus on deepening the program
of Phase 2 by ensuringthat all eligible villages are fully engaged. Inaddition to that, duringPhases 2 and
3, the project will invest in procedures and systems leading to increased investment both by public and

institutional partnerships to increase the ability o f the communities to bargain, negotiate and add
economies of scale. All phases will have the same development objective.

14.      Under each phase, there will be three main stages (see Chart 1 below). Stage 1 will focus on
community empowerment. The village communities will have access to a Village Development Fund,
with which they can undertake investments in social, economic and community infrastructure. Part o fthe
Village Development Fund will be allocated to a Loan Fund to enable villagers to engage in income
generation activities o ftheir choice. To be eligible for the funding, communities must agree to the project
rules, and proceed through the "project cycle" and thereby satisfy the project that: (i)the decisions taken
included broad representation from the community; (i)       they possess a feasible VDP; and (iii) are
                                                                                                   they
willing and able to contribute a portion o f the cost. Communities will receive technical assistance in,
participatory appraisal, community contracting techniques and financial management, to be able to
competently manage the Village Development Fund. Stages 2 and 3 will focus on forming federations o f
VOs and buildingpartnerships between the local governments, federations o f VOs, the private sector and
NGOs to achieve sustainable development. Local governments will receive capacity buildingassistance
as part o f the project, with the ultimate aim o f transferring program execution to them. Inthis way, the
program will build the capacity of local governments to manage development and a system o f
intergovernmental fiscal transfers.

    S R I LANKA: Community Development and LivelihoodImprovement "Gemi Diriya" Project

Project Area

1.       The project would be implemented in about 1,000 village communities (510 GNDs) in five
districts (Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Badulla, and Moneragala) o f Uva and Southern provinces.

                            Table 1 Basic information of the 5 project districts




Target Population and Selection Criteria

2.       The project will cover approximately 150,000 households and i s expected to directly benefit
approximately 700,000 people (about 20% o f the population of the two provinces).

3.       Consistent with the demand-driven nature o f the project, village communities will be included in
the project by adopting a self-selection process. The two-stage self-selection process has been developed
through a consultative process involving village communities and government officials. Duringthe first
stage, village communities qualifying for project support will be selected based on the following criteria:

                                      Table 2: GND Selection Criteria

                           I               GNDSelection criteria                  I
                            1. % o fhouseholds without all year round access

                                % oflandless households
                            4. % o fhouseholds without hygienic latrines


4.       Inaddition, the presence of development programs duringthe last three years is also taken into
consideration in the selection o f eligible village communties. All the village communities in the project
area will be eligible provided they qualify based on the following criteria and agree the project rules.

5.       Duringthe second stage, a self-selection process among communities from within the qualified
village communities will take place. The self-selection process will be based on willingness criteria.
Only those communities that agree to the project's "non-negotiable" principles of equity, inclusion,



                                                      31

transparency, accountability, sustainability and good governance ("Golden Rules") would be eligible for
project support.     The following are the self-selection criteria:           If the number of eligible village
communities is more that what the project can support, then the village communities will be selected
based on their relative scores inthe predetermined selection criteria (Table 2). The qualifying criteria for
village communitie are includedinthe C O M and will be readily accessible to all stakeholders.

 Project Components
6.       The project will include the following five components: (A) Village Development; (B)
Institutional Strengthening; (C) Innovation Seed Fund; (D) Project Management, and (E) Village Self-
Help Learning Initiative. A brief description o fthe project components i s provided below:

7.       Component A Village Development (US$56.6 million). This component will have two sub-
                         -
components: (i)Development and Strengthening o f VOs; and (ii)              Fundingo f Community Sub-projects.
VOs will have access to a Village Development Fund to undertake investments in social, economic and
community infrastructure. To be eligible for funding, communities must agree to the project rules, and
proceed through the "project cycle" and thereby satisfy the project that: (a) the decisions taken included
broad representation from the community; (b) they possess a feasible VDP; and (c) they are willing and
able to contribute a portion o f the cost. Village communities will receive technical assistance in
participatory appraisal, community contracting techniques and financial management, so that they can
competently manage the Village Development Fund. The outcome o f this component i s community-
managed infrastructure that i s maintained by the villagers from their own resources; and community
managed business support systems and funding, especially available to those who cannot access such help
from outside.

8.       Al: Development and Strengthening of VOs (US$7.5 million).                          The objective o f this
subcomponent i s to develop self-reliant, self-managed and sustainable people's organizations for
community development and livelihood improvement in the rural areas. This subcomponent will also
promote partnership with the private sector so as to widen the livelihood options for the poor and to
promote micro enterprise. This will be achieved through promotion of: (i)            partnerships with the private
sector to support the micro-enterprises; and (ii)    demand-driven vocational training facilities to linkupjob
opportunities for educated youth. An outcome indicator for this sub-component would be: community-
managed sustainable infrastructure, which i s maintained by the community from its own resources,
community-managed business support systems and community-managed Savings and Loans Funds (see
below). Activities to be financed under this sub-component will include: (a) facilitation support by the
DFT; (b) technical and other support to the communities by resource persons, SOs and other
organizations experienced in capacity building o f rural community organizations; (c) workshops and
training of community members, VOs and facilitators on institution building, preparation o f VDPs,
preparation and appraisal o f sub-projects, community monitoring, financial management, community
procurement and related areas; (d) capacity buildingo f para-professionals; (e) technical support to set up
and manage community information and monitoring centers; (f)technical support to set up and manage



                                                          32

VOs, federations, and savings and credit organizations; (8) support to develop private sector linkages -by
organizing "solution days" and topical PRAs; and (h) support to develop linkages with employment
agencies by linlung potential youth to employment opportunities prior to s h l l s development training or
livelihood support funds.

9.       A2. Community Sub Projects (US$49.1 million). The bulko f funds will be transferred directly
to the VOs to finance their capacity building and priority investments. The budget will be allocated
depending on the population o f the village communities. This sub-component will finance three main
activities: (i)Capacity Building Fund; (ii)   Community and Social Infrastructure Services Sub-projects;
and (iii) Livelihood Support (LS) Fund. In addition, the subcomponent will include a special reward in
the form o f a incentive fund for those VOs that have shown proven results on the ground in terms o f
equity, transparency, good govemance and timely implementation o f village subprojects (see Incentive
Fundas describedbelow).

10.      A2(i) Capacity Building(CB) Fund. About 10-12%o f the village development funds will be
earmarked for capacity building. The objective o f the CB Fund i s to build necessary institutional and
human resource competencies and skills o f VO office bearers and community members so as to empower
them to plan, implement and manage village development activities in an efficient, equitable, and
sustainable manner. A key outcome o f this support would be sustainable village level institutions built,
skills base developed and communities able to raise and manage revenues independently after the project
funds are fully utilized.

11.      The Fundwould finance activities listed below. Each VO would be expected to develop its own
rules and guidelines within the broad framework as indicated in the PIP and COM on how to utilize the
CB Fund, and allocate funds among the following eligible activities: (a) setting up o f Village Community
Centre and Information and Monitoring cell; (b) VOs' office management cost; (c) institution building
cost; (d) promotion and support to implement community sub-projects; and (e) technical assistance to
implement income generating activities. The guidelines would be discussed by each VO during the
prioritization process and orientation o f VO members indeveloping sub-projects and agreed upon by the
Maha Sabha before signingof the Capacity BuildingFundaddendum.

12.      A2(ii) Community and Social Infrastructure Activities and Services. The objective o f this
sub-component is to empower communities to manage the execution o f identified infrastructure activities
and to expand the scope o f social services already accessible to the communities. It i s designed to
facilitate communities to identify their priority needs for improving the quality of their lives. The
communities will be made aware o f the project appraisal process so that their sub-projects will meet
appraisal criteria. Communities will also be assisted in assessing environmental impacts o f sub-projects.
This sub-component will finance technical assistance for developing sub-projects on community and
technically and financially feasible social infrastructure activities and services; implementation o f sub-
projects; and execution and monitoring o f sub-projects by VOs. Only those community and social
infrastructure activities and services that benefit the majority o f households in a particular villagekamlet,
especially the poorest and vulnerable groups, would be eligible for funding. The beneficiaries are
expected to contribute at least 30% o f the cost o f such activities; 10% o f that would be required in cash.
The allocation o f resources to fund the community and social infrastructure would depend on particular
needs and priorities of each community, and may vary from village to village. To help communities select
their top most priority(ies), the project team will ensure that topical PRAs and private sector linkages and
"solution days" are organized during the development o f VDPs and that communities receive correct
information on various options and priorities before they finalize their VDPs. Details about the sub-
project cycle andrelease o f funds are provided inthe PIP and COM.

13.     AZ(iii) LivelihoodSupport Fund.The objective o fthe LS Fundis to improve the livelihoods of
the community members, especially poor women, unemployed youth and the vulnerable members (such
as disabled, widows, single mothers and landless) by linkingthem to employment and income generating
opportunities. Part o f the L S fund will be utilized to develop sustainable, micro-finance institutions at the
community level enabling villagers to meet their needs for savings and credit services and to assist them
indevelopingawide rangeo fincomegenerating activities.

14.     The size of the L S Fundwould vary fi-om village to village, and village communities would have
the flexibility to earmark half o f the eligible VDP funds for Livelihood Support activities. The terms and
conditions o f accessing L S fund will be agreed through signingof Addendum - I11 (LS) to the Umbrella
Financing Agreement between the Foundation and the VO. The L S sub-component will mainly fund
following the three activities:


    0   Grantsto the Poorest: VOs could provide one time grant to the poorest and most vulnerable in
        the community like the disabled, widows without any income, single women with small children
        and without any income, other destitute, etc. to start very small scale income generating activities.
        The aim o f the sub-component i s to provide support for starting very small scale income
        generation so that they are able to save and later participate inthe normal Savings and Loan Fund
        (see below) activities o f the VO. This sub-component i s a safeguard against the exclusion o f the
        most vulnerable who lack the financial capacity to participate in the savings and loan activities.
        The village community will agree on the rules for selection and amount o f grant. The Grants to
        the Poorest subcomponent will be implementedby the VO or a designated subcommittee.


    0   Skills Development Training: VOs could provide loans to eligible community members,
        especially to youth, to acquire slulls, such as, computer literacy, financial accounting, business
        development, etc. These trainings are expected to provide employment opportunities or to lead to
        starting a business.     This sub-component will also assist the youth with necessary technical
        assistance for linlungthem with employment agencies. The village community will agree on the
        rules for eligibility and amount o f loans. Since the benefits o f the skill development training will
        be accruing at the individual level, VOs will extend loans to members under the sub-component.
        Village communities will decide the rate o f interest to be charged on such loans, and other terms
        and conditions o f the loan. The loan would need to be repaid by the members after an initial
        moratorium o f one year. The assistance to the VO will be inthe form o f a one-time grant, which
        the VO will use as a revolving fund to extend loans to individual beneficiaries.


    0   Savingsand LoanFund: The objective o fthe component is to builda sustainable village-based
        savings and credit system that will expand opportunities for income generation for people who do
        not currently have access to loans from formal financial institutions and to enhance their access to
        formal financial institutions as their businesses prosper. This sub-component will assist setting
        up of a Village Savings and Credit Organization (VSCO) which all villagers will join. The
        Savings and Loan Fund will be implemented as per the guidelines for savings and loans as
        adapted by the VO and as approved by MS. The Savings and Loan Fund will help the village
        poor in starting various income generating activities. Members who need larger loans will be
        linked to the formal financial sector. There will be specialized institutional arrangements for
        implementing Savings and Loan Fund consisting of Small Groups (SGs),Cluster Committees
        (CCs) and Village Savings and Credit Committee (VSCC) as explained in the rules for
        implementing Savings and Loan Fund. Critical to the success o f this sub-component are: (i)         the
        development o f strong VOs whose members have a deep sense o f ownership and a vision for
        long-term sustainability; (ii) a governance structure that empowers the members; (iii)     transparent
        guidelines for fund management; and (iv) a reliable accountingand loan traclung system. Inorder
        to maximize prospects for long-term sustainability, the project will develop detailed policies and


                                                       34

          procedures adapted from the VSHLI model, an accounting and loan trackmg system that the
          villagers can manage themselves and provide extensive high-quality training to communities.

15.       The project will assist with the formation and development o f a savings and credit facility that
provides incentives for good governance and management, accountability and transparency. The facility
will be built from the bottom up, with small groups o f 5-7 members with similar interests and economic
situations.    These groups will self-select their members, save together and mutually guarantee each
others' loans. Each group will decide upon a weekly savings amount based on the savings capabilities o f
group members. Interest will be paid on these savings based on the interest rate paid by bank where the
funds are held and takmg account of expenses incurred in managing the account. After saving for three
months, members will be eligible for loans. The other members o f the small group will appraise their
loan applications, as they are in a good position to know the capabilities and economic opportunities o f
individual members. Small groups will be organized into clusters o f 5-6 groups. The elected cluster
office bearers will manage a bank account for the savings o f small group members. Cluster Chairpersons,
as well as two members o f the Board o f Directors (BOD), will form a Savings and Credit Sub-committee
to govern the savings and credit facility, and process loans. The project will introduce sound systems o f
financial management so that savings o f members are protected and the real value o f the loan fund
maintained.     Although loans will be primarily for income generating activities, short-term daily and
monthly loans may be used for consumption or emergency purposes, provided that the small group
members are confidant that members will be able to repay these loans and thus are willing to guarantee
them.

16.       Members whose credit requirements exceed the maximum loan size will be assisted by the BOD
o f the VO to obtain funding from commercial banks. Recognizing that individual VOs may not be
successful in developing such linkages, the project will make substantial efforts to develop a framework
with one or several banks that addresses s' risks. Examples o f procedures that could be put inplace to
mitigate the banks' risk ifborrowers do not have adequate collateral include introducing the SG members
as co-signers, securing a part o f the loan with SG compulsory savings or developing a partial guarantee
facility. The project can also negotiate incentives for the banks, such as having the VO's Loan Funds
deposited at the bank and encouraging VOs to set-up SG savings accounts at a participating bank. The
project will provide facilitators, trainers and accounting professionals to help these savings and credit
facilities to acquire the capacity and visionto effectively fulfill their responsibility.

 17.     Incentive Fund: Inaddition to the Village Development Funds, about 10% o f the total budget
 envelope for village development would be available as an Incentive Fund, i.e. as a special reward for
 those VOs that have achieved the agreed milestones. The objective o f the Incentive Fund i s to improve
 good governance, equity and transparency in the village community as well as help with effective
 implementation of VDP. The Incentive Fund will be in the form o f a special reward, and will be in
 addition to the per capita budget envelope provided to the village communities. VOs (with 2/3rds
 approval o f the MS) could utilize the Incentive Fund for higher value activities as part o f the federation
 business activities, or allocate part or all o f the funds for other village development priorities that
 improve the lives of the majority o f poor households. The Incentive Fund will be disbursed after an
 external evaluation o f the performance o f the VOs for demonstrated good-governance and the
 achievement o f the following milestones: (i)  the VO has implemented community sub-project(s) on time
 (as agreed) that have benefited at least 90% o f the community members, and at least one subproject
 activity has benefited exclusively the vulnerable group (disabled, widows, single mothers, unemployed
 youth etc) as identified under the Grants to the Poorest subcomponent. The quality o f the infrastructure
 sub-project has been certified by the Appraisal and Monitoring Team as o f satisfactory quality, and the
 sub-project(s) is being operated and managed by the community members with their own funds; (ii)        the
 VO has mobilized its own savings (minimumRs.500,000) fi-om its community members, sub-project
 savings, profits fi-om any business opportunities and interest generated through Savings and Loan Fund



                                                     35

  and deposited in a bank account, and has raised external funds (minimumRs.1 million) from the banks
  and outside agencies for village development; (iii)  the VO has disbursed grants to the poorest eligible
 beneficiaries as approved by the MS and brought at least 80% o f beneficiaries into Savings and Loan
  groups; (iv) VO has elected at least 50% o f women to decision malung position such as Chairpersons and
 Treasures (in BOD, Procurement Committee, Financial committee, social audit committee, Sub-Project
  Committees (SPCs), etc; (v) the VO has trained eight or more community members as para-professionals
  (as agreed in the Capacity Building Plan) and 50% o f the paraprofessionals are women; (vi) the VO has
  disbursed 75% or more o f Savings and Loan Fund and maintained 95% o f the repayment rate on the
  Savings and Loans fund and maintainedportfolio at risk 30 days or less than 5% on the Loan Fund; (vii)
  satisfactory ratings o f office bearers (BOD, Procurement and Financial committees, and SPCs) o f the VO
 through Report Card systems and Social Audit Committee Reports (certifying compliance with Gemi
 Diriya rules) have been maintained throughout the VDP planning and implementation (at least on an
 annual basis); and (viii) the VO has maintained all books o f accounts and financial and procurement
 records up to date, BOD has submitted financial statements every year, and held M S meetings on a
 regular basis as agreed (evidenced through minutes o f the meetings).

18.      Component B: Institutional Strengthening (US$6.0 million). The objective o f this component
i s to encourage the establishment o f highly sensitized, pro poor and responsive Project teams,
Government agencies, PSs, SOs and the private sector, with capacities to promote CDD. This would
consist o f building capacities o f the local and national agencies and SOs to effectively facilitate
implementation o f the program and broaden the skills base o f these agencies on participatory
development and information sharing as well as develop a ML&Esystem to capture results on the ground
and respond to the needs and demands o f the community. The component will include introduction o f
social and public accountability mechanisms, like participatory budgeting, community report cards, social
audit and expenditure tracking to trigger changes in responsiveness and accountability among local
government institutions and communities. The component will finance training, workshops, technical
assistance, exposure visits, and goods.       The outcome o f the component would be responsive and
accountable local and national agencies and SOs.

19.      B1. Capacity Building of National, District and Divisional Project Teams: The objective o f
this sub-component is to develop a shared vision andbuildrequiredcompetencies amongprojectteams at
national, district and divisional levels to enable them to perform their respective roles. This will be
achieved by promoting experiential learning, exposure to best practices and learning by doing
experiences. The project will identify the mix o f skills, attitudes, and orientation required for the project
teams, the line agencies, PSs, SOs and the private sector to respond to the needs o f rural communities.
The focus shall be on the role these agencies can meaningfully play to nurture and empower rural
communities.       Project teams will receive intensive training on social mobilization, community
participation, social capital, CBOs, micro-finance institutions, VDPs, environment management and
ML&E. The line departments will receive training on how to give space to the VOs inthe development
agenda and on improving the quality o f services to be provided to the rural poor. The PSs will be
facilitated to actively participate inthe program and their capacities will be built to gradually replace the
project teams and take over management o f the program (Phase 2).

20.      B2. Capacity Building of Support Organizations and Service Providers: The objective o f
this sub-component is to facilitate the active participation o f SOs and the private sector to expand
livelihood options o f the poor. The project will identify the SOs and service providers with considerable
experience in nurturing CDD and organize their exposure to project initiatives and facilitate their
interactionwith VOs to establish linkages and partnerships.

21.      B3. Monitoring and Learning: The objective of this sub-component i s to monitor performance
and progress o f the project and to disseminate it among all stakeholders to enable them to effectively


                                                      36

address project implementation issues. The sub-component will finance establishment and strengthening
o f a ML&E system that will serve the needs o f project agencies at all levels. The information will flow
from community members to the project director through the divisional coordinator interfacing with
divisional secretaries and service providers. The format for monitoring records will be designed with the
participation o f various stakeholders. Participatory techniques like beneficiaries' self assessments, focus
groups and key informant discussions will particularly be used for process monitoring, on issues related
to the evolution o f sub-projects, their inclusiveness, transparency and the level o f participation inproject
benefits and in decision-malung processes. Process monitoring will be carried out by an external agency.
The ML&E coordinator from the project team will anchor all related activities, such as baseline survey,
MIS, process monitoring, follow up studies, impact evaluation and community monitoring.

22.       ComponentC: Innovation Seed Fund(US$l.S million). The objective o f this component is to
pilot innovative ideas, which need experimentation, learning and incubation and have the potential for
being scaled-up and replicated. Proposals for innovative ideas would be selected through a screening
process that would favor linkages with the private sector and research institutions. Some ideas currently
under consideration under this component include technology and product development related to
agricultural processing and value addition (including development o f commodity value chains for
producers) and information technology and computer education applications in collaboration with other
development initiatives, like the E-Lanka initiative and Uva Community Radio and PS Incentive Fund. It
i s envisaged that additional activities would be identified during implementation and selected with a
competitive process through a screening committee consisting o f experts from the private and public
sector and research institutions.

23.       Component D:ProjectManagement (US$4.7 million). The main objective of this component
i s to facilitate overall co-ordination and management o f the project at national and divisional levels. The
component will finance goods, services and recurrent costs.

24.       Component E: Village Self-Help LearningInitiative(US$l.O million). The VSHLI pilot was
initiated in year 2000 under an IDA-supported project (MW), to test an innovative pilot o f transferring
power and decision making to the communities. The pilot has successfully demonstrated that given the
participatory framework, communities can articulate their needs and priorities; develop and implement
infrastructure and income generating programs and take responsibility for operating and maintaining the
assets created. The pilot i s being implemented in Mahaweli and non-Mahaweli areas in Polonnaruwa
district. With the closing o f M W project in December 2003, the pilot will be included under the
proposed project and will fund completion o f the remaining VDPs in the pilot villages. The component,
inadditionto findingvillage priorities, will further strengtheninstitutional arrangements at the locallevel
by developing a para-professional and village federation model, and linkthese institutions with public and
private sector agencies. The component will be managed separately to continuously learn lessons and to
apply them to the Gemi Diriya project.

   SRT LANKA: CommunityDevelopmentandLivelihoodImprovement "GemiDiriya"Project


1.       The proposed implementation arrangements are basedon an institutional model inwhich: (i)     VOs
will be the focal point; (ii) institutionsat all levels would enjoy independence and autonomy to ensure
                            the
compliance with the "Golden rules" and the "rules o f the game"; and (iii)     communities are allowed to
participate ina way that ensures their ownership and total independence intaking decisions and managing
resources. The envisaged institutional model is clearly linked to the programmatic approach o f the
project. Recognizing that holistic development i s a long process, the model i s based on the following
principles: (i)team effort, (ii)devolution o fresponsibilities; and (iii)
                                                                       participation of local government for

Maha Sabha. or VillageAssembly: All the householdsinthe community would become membersof their
Village Assembly (or any other form of organization at the village/GND level). This general body will be
called "Maha Sabha". The community would include everyone over 18 years.

 Village Organization (YO): This will be constituted under the Companies Act, and consist of the MS, a
BOD, and various committees (Finance Committee, Social Audit Committee, Village Savings and Credit
Committee, SPCs and Procurement Committee). VOs will be responsible for the following activities:
planning, implementation and supervision of sub projects, management o f funds, procurement of goods,
services and works, operation and maintenance of community assets, self-monitoring for cost
effectiveness and sustainability.

Federation of VOs: All VOs within a GND will be organized into Federations in order to achieve
optimum scale o f operation, particularly in income generating programs, and to establish direct
partnership with the private and public sectors.

Institutional Arrangements at the Divisional and PSLevel:
3.       Community development and livelihood improvement o f the rural poor activities cannot be
managedfrom Colombo. Hence, appropriate mechanisms to closely integrate district and divisional teams
withthe managementteam at the national level are a critical need. Two key functions that the Foundation
will devolve are: (i)  appraisal of community sub-projects and monitoring implementation progress; and
(ii) facilitation and technical support. Appraisal and monitoring functions will be devolved to the two
teams at the provincial level, while facilitation functions will be devolved to district and divisional
facilitationteams.

4.       Divisional Facilitation Teams (DFT): DFTs will facilitate and assist communities in planning,
implementation, monitoring, analyzing and adjusting the project. Their roles will mainly include
promotion and guarding o f program principles at the divisional level, assist in the self-selection of
GNDs, help VOs to secure services fi-om SOs and other service providers, provide technical assistanceas
and when requested by VOs, review implementation progress, help VOs in removing hindrances to
project implementation, and resolve conflicts.

6.       Pradeshiva Sabha Sub-committee: Inorder to build the capacity o f local govemment to respond
to the needs o f the communities, the project would help establish a PS sub-committee comprising 30 % o f
PS members and 70 % VO's representatives. The roles o f PS sub-committees will evolve over time.
Duringthe first stage, sub-committees will coordinate programimplementation, mainstreamtechnical and
other available expertise for VOs, and monitor progress o f implementation. Duringthe second stage, the
sub-committee will take the role o f the Appraisal and Supervision Teams at the provincial level. Their
responsibilities would include: appraisal and approval o f VDPs and sub-project proposals               and
certification o f milestones for release of funds to VOs. During the third stage, the sub-committee will
additionally rotate funds to the communities (detailed functions and roles o f the PS sub-committee are
provided later inthe section).

InstitutionalArrangements at the Districtlevel:

7.       District Facilitation Teams fDrFT1: DrFTswould be responsible for the promotion and guarding
of the program principles at the district level. Their main activities would include assisting the self
selection o f GNDs, preparing a roster of service providers, providing technical assistance/service support,
facilitating linkage with private sector, converging and linking with other projects, reviewing progress
and resolving conflicts.

appraisaVmonitoring and facilitation, other key functions that are essential to implement this program
include: policy formulation, advocacy, strategic communication, buildinglinkages with other government
agencies and private sector organizations, management o f program funds, capacity building o f the
management and implementation teams at various levels, service providers and support organizations,
guardian o f rules, coordination, facilitation, appraisal, monitoring and evaluation. Facilitation functions
will be delegated at the district and divisional level, while the appraisal and monitoring functions will be
devolved at the provincial level. All other functions will be directly carried out by the ManagementTeam,
divided into three teams. Each o f the three teams would be headedby a team leader and would have the
following functional units: (1) Village InstitutionsUnit; (2) Business and Livelihood Development Team;
and (3) Project Management Support Unit. Continuation o f ManagementUnitmembers will depend upon

Appraisal and Monitoring ( A M ) Teams (provincial level)/PS sub-committees (divisional level)

15.      Eachprovince will have one A&M Team. Communities will develop sub-projects that need to be
appraised to evaluate their quality, to verify whether they meet environmental and other standards, to
check the feasibility o f implementation and whether they have followed the Golden rules and the project
rules. The institutional arrangements for the appraisal process aim at building the capacity o f local
governments and creating an enabling environment for them to respond to the community demands. This
would be achieved gradually inthree stages. As mentioned above, during the first stage, A&M Teams at
provincial level will appraise sub-projects (with the exception o f savings and credit facilities), certify
milestones, and act as guardians o f the rules. The main objective o f this model -technical teams worlung
directly with communities - i s to ensure a widespread empowerment o f communities (by being in the
drivingseat of selection, preparation and direct use o ffinancial resources and implementation). Once this
process o f empowerment i s completed, the role o f the A&M Teams at the provincial level would change,
and their appraisal functions would be devolved to the local level authorities to ensure institutional
sustainability. DuringPhase 2, screening and appraisal functions would be carried out by a participatory
institutional sub-committee at the PS level consisting o f 70% VOs' representatives and 30% local elected
officials from executive and legislative branches. The A&M Teams will change their functions from
appraisal o f subproject proposals to the monitoring and supervising o f the process while providing
technical support to the PS sub-committee.        During Phase 3, the local participatory body not only
approves/appraises the subprojects but also receives an envelope o f money to be managed locally. Phase
3 will start when PS sub-committees demonstrate consistent participatory and transparent decision-
malung processes and capacity to take decisions about other govemment programs using a similar
approach.

Scalingup Strategies,Sustainability and CapacityBuilding

Scaling Up Strategies

16.       The distinct feature o f the project is that it i s based on the four-year VSHLI experience and on the
hands-on leaming phase piloted in 24 GNDs in the project areas. The lessons learned are expected to
steer the project implementation in about 100 GN Divisions in the first year and in about 200 GN
Divisions during the 2ndand 3rd year. In order to cope with the challenges inherent in such scaling up
operations, the project has evolved a very clear scaling up strategy. The strategy aims to ensure that there
i s no dilution in the focus and that the program objectives are realized.            The project would use the
following mechanisms for scaling up:

     Investment in increasing the capacity of national, district and divisional level government, SOs and
     service providers for community mobilization and facilitation.

     Members o f successful VOs and other community members will be trained as para-professionals to
     take some responsibilities for facilitation, mobilization and training. The pilots have shown that
     villagers are the best resource to promote and disseminate information. They would be accountable to
     VOs and their incentives would be performance based.

     VOs would be encouraged to develop networks and federations that could take up the responsibility
     o f scaling up the program.       Mature associations which have shown good performance will be
     rewarded and motivated by giving them a responsibility to mobilize, mentor and coach new and
     neighboring ones to enable lateral spread and peer leaming.

     National, District and Divisional Facilitation Teams will have their capacity increased to be better
     facilitators o f participatory processes and be more responsive and accountable.

     Development o f IEC material highlighting the impact o f using these approaches and the process
     followed would enable information exchange and creating demand for these approaches.

     Efforts would be made to locate competent SOs with technical skills, technical colleges with relevant
     disciplines and other private service providers and increase their ability to provide support to
     communities ina demand-driven manner.

     The project envisages a process through which communities would be able to procure a range of
     services using community contractingand procurement for implementation o f the activities identified
     intheir VDPs. Developinga largepool of serviceproviderswho work inrural areas, are accountable
     to the community, are paid by the community and deliver quality services i s a big challenge for the
     project.

     Communication material, training modules, PRA tools, processes such as village development
     planning, sub-project preparation and appraisal and monitoring tools will be standardized and made
     available for use inthe new villages.

         Role of Sewice Providers

17.       The project's main challenges are to build capacity at various levels to develop a large pool o f
service providers and networks who could work in rural areas, are accountable to the communities, are
contracted by the village organizations and deliver quality services on a timely basis. To address these



                                                           46

challenges, the project would encourage partnerships between VOs and service providers by: (i)
developing a cadre of community level service providers - para- professionals; (ii)   buildingcapacity o f
public service providers to deliver services in a demand-driven manner; (iii)facilitating interaction
between private sector service providers and communities to expose the private sector to various
opportunities and also develop partnerships wherein private sector provides service to rural communities
at a reasonable cost; (iv) developing capacity o f SOs that would move from village to village and provide
catalytic inputs; (v) hiringo f umbrella capacity buildingagency(ies) that would buildcapacity and mentor
and coach communities, district and divisional teams and SOs.

18.     Inaddition, theprojectwould focus on:


     0  Investing in improving the quality and quantity o f service providers available to the community
        through organization o f "solution days" (vendor development) and invest in promoting direct
        interaction between the village organization and other service providers on an intensive and
        regular basis.


     0  Linkmgsavings, credit andenterprise development inthe livelihoodsupport program.


     0  Combining both self-employment andjob employment (through s h l l development component) as
        part o f livelihood promotion.


     0  Linkingfinancial institutions like Banks and insurance service providers with communities from
        the beginning as part o f solution days so that they reduce their risk perception about village
        companies.


     0  Using PSs to take up certain roles in promotion, mobilization and service provision so that this
        could be replicatedacross the whole area without significant external facilitation over a period o f
        time

    Role of Support Organizations(SO)

19.     Basedon the experience of the VSHLI and other pilots, it i s clear that demand for project services
would not be an issue. By contrast, the supply side may be a problem. Communities would need
assistance with social mobilization, institutional development, financial management, identifying
employment and business development opportunities, building technical capacity o f para-professionals
etc. These services cannot be provided by the Foundationand govemment agencies ina cost-effective and
sustainable way. The Foundationwould therefore need to identify competent SOs. For the purpose o f the
project, SO include NGOs, CBOs, private sector business organizations and technical and training
organizations. The roles of SOs would range from facilitation (technical, social) to capacity building,
development o f business opportunities inthe communities etc. It is important that the SOs are oriented to
the philosophy, vision and operating principles o f the Foundation and the program. The Foundation
should be able to come up with unconventional solutions to conventional and unconventional problems
and would need to invest considerable effort to enhance the quality of SOs through sharing knowledge of
best practices, exposure to new, innovative programs, and establish a minimum threshold for quality
performance.

20.     In order to ensure that SOs provide the best possible services, it is important that the service
contracts be performance-based, with clear terms o f reference and deliverables. The triggers for payment
should be based on simple measurable milestones and community feedbackkertification on the
performance o f the SO would be an important indicator for payment for services.



                                                     47

Cauacity Building

         Pradeshiya Sabhas (PS) level

21.      The project would actively promote and build capacity of PS functionaries and institution. PSs
are expected to take up following roles inthe project inthe initialphases:

    e    Communicating the rules of the game to village communities and supporting social mobilization
         and community organization.
    e    Providing technical functionaries to act as service providers to the community organization for
         some community infrastructure projects, especially water.
    e    Reviewing the performance o f the project at PS and Divisional level.

22.      The project would invest in capacity buildingof PS functionaries on rules o f the game, village
development planning, technical service provision and financial management. This would enable them to
take up a more prominent role in future as facilitators, guardians of rules of the game and technical
service providers when the programi s scaled-up inlarger number of villages.

         Piloting of Incentive Fundfor Pradeshiya Sabhas

23.      In addition, it is proposed that the project would work with some PSs selected through a
competitive process for improving local governance and service delivery systems. These would involve
capacity building of PS functionaries in participatory budgeting and planning, financial management,
revenue mobilization, monitoring and other management aspects. They would also be provided some
block funding to improve their institutional and service delivery performance. The lessons learnt from
this work with PSswouldbeusedfor decidingthe scope, nature and size of future work bythe Project in
improving local governance.

         Villageand Inter VillageLevel

24.      At the village level, the VOs would mobilize community members from all sections of society,
undertake participatory village development planning and implement the various activities identified for
support under the program. In addition, they would manage and supervise community asserts created
under the project and promote various types of livelihood support activities. VOs would also promote
skill development among youth, women and other groups to access job employment opportunities in
service sector - by creating a good pool of para- professionals at the community level who provide good
quality services to community members and access information and expertise from outside agencies
including the private sector.

25.      Inthe longrun,the VO wouldbecome a major economic andlivelihood support organizationfor
the village. It would promote a village saving and credit organization and undertake many livelihood
support activities for various common interest groups. It would develop a financial base with its own
savings and undertake various activities relatedto marketing andvalue addition.

         Federations of Village Organizations

26.      The VO would also network with other villages in the form o f a inter-village federations to
provide services in a cost-effective manner and achieve economies o f scale with respect to marketing,
value addition and other aspects. The federation would also function as an effective support institution for
providing different kmds o f expertise to VO. Inthe long-term, the VO would develop linkages with the
private sector, public institutions and other service providers and develop skills o f negotiating with them,


                                                      48

accessing services and expertise in a effective and responsive manner. VOs would also ensure that
financial resources are available from Banks for investments in livelihood development and
diversification by ensuring highrepayment rates from its own, project and Bankresources.

Project Cycle and Village DevelopmentCycle

27.      PIP outlines the project cycle and sub-project cycle specifying key steps and sequencing o f
activities to be performed in implementing the project. This will enable all partner institutions and other
stakeholders to understand and agree upon critical activities and their timing, duration and
interdependence for ensuring successful project implementation. At village level, the sub-project cycle
involves five key steps, which are planned and implemented by communities on their own initiative: (i)
start up/dissemination o f information; (ii)   pre-planning; (iii) planning; (iv) community implementation;
and (v) completion.

28.      The Village DevelopmentCycle would consist o f the following steps:


    0    Start-upPromotiona1Phase: This involves communicationo fthe rules o fthe game andthe key
         institutional aspects o f the project at the village level. This phase i s likely to be handled by the
         divisional facilitating team, sub-divisional facilitators and SOs. This team would also facilitate
         collective action through small groups before formation o f the VO. Special efforts would be
         required to bring the poor and vulnerable groups into the mobilization process. The outcome o f
         this phase is communities that have been sensitized to rules o f the game, roles and
         responsibilities, the process, and its equity orientation.


    0    Pre-planningPhase: This phase involves setting up o f a VO and selection o f the BOD. It also
         involves conducting initialneeds assessmentsand identifying key activities, which could be taken
         up for capacity building, community infrastructure development and livelihood support. At this
         stage, resource envelopes are known to the community. The VO also selects various operational
         committees and para-professionals in key areas. Village functionaries attend initial capacity
         building programs and develop a capacity building plan. A memorandum o f understanding i s
         signed between the Foundation and the village organization and the first installment o f capacity
         buildingfundis releasedto the village organization.


    0    Planning Phase: This phase mainly consists o f the finalization o f the VDP and the preparation
         of sub-projects. Inorder to ensure the good quality o f VDPs, "solution days" would be organized
         by the Foundation in a cluster o f villages to enable private sector enterprises, service providers
         and financial agencies to directly interact with VOs and community members. During these
         "solution days",    VOs and community members exchange information about livelihood
         opportunities, slull development opportunities, and possibilities in terms o f technologies and
         design. Based on information and advice collected at the "solution days", VOs would refine and
         detail their VDPs. Inorder to develop detailed estimates o f costs and activities and prepare sub-
         projects, village organizations could engage service providers usingtheir capacity building fund.
         The VSCC would also be formed at this stage along with the mobilization o f savings groups. The
         outcome o f this phase is a good quality VDP, good quality sub-projects and a trained cadre of
         functionaries at the village level. Village organizations would thus be ready to access resources
         and to implement their sub-projects.


    0    Implementation Phase: During this period the various sub-projects would be implemented,
         including community infrastructure projects and livelihood support activities (through the
         savings-credit mechanism). The focus would be on good quality supervision, transparency and

  accountability, and community procurement in case o f community infrastructure projects. The
  capacity buildingfund would be used to develop capacities in this respect. Incase o f livelihood
  support, the focus would be on buildinga good financial institutionwith highrepayment rate and
  speed o f revolution o f the revolving fund. Livelihood support activities would be ongoing and
  efforts should be made to increase the speed o f revolution in the revolving fund so that more
  households are benefited. At the same time, the focus should be on developing market linkages
  and developing value addition through training communities in grading their produce and
  accessing private sector to get higher prices. At the same time the slull development component
  should be strengthened to create job employment opportunities for the youth.         The biggest
  challenge during this phase would be access to good quality service providers for the VO. The
  outcome of this phase would be a functional and vibrant VO, capable o f allocating and spending
  funds efficiently and effectively, with confidence, knowledge and skills to access other expertise
  and resources. Self-monitoring and development o f accountability between service providers and
  VOs would be a key aspect o fthe program.

e Completion (Self-reliance and Sustainability) Phase: Duringthis phase the focus would be on
  increasing the sustainability and viability o f both VOs and community assets created under the
  project. Each village would be encouraged to develop a sustainability plan which includes
  collection o f O&M charges for community assets, service fees for various services rendered and a
  plan for meeting operational expenses for the VO. VOs should also be able to identify collective
  activities for livelihood enhancement and should access resources from financial institutions for
  this purpose. The Village Savings and Credit Committee should have revolved various cycles
  and generated enough internal resources to service the needs o f members and should be able to
  access resources from Banks for future livelihood expansion and diversification. The activities
  envisaged could be funded through the Incentive Fund available to VOs that perform well.
  Activities related to livelihood support for value addition may be taken during this period. The
  focus o f capacity building activities would shift to building linkages with private sector and
  Banks and independent resource mobilization by these agencies.

Monitoring and Learning Aspects (including SocialAccountability)
29.      The monitoring, learningand evaluation system (ML&E) o f the project will monitor and generate
information about project progress and performance and disseminate this information amongst
stakeholders to enable them to promptly address implementation issues. Through a leaming process the
project will revise and refine implementation processes and procedures in order to improve its
performance and effectiveness. The system will monitor inputs, outputs and outcomes o f various project
institutions, project processes and project impact. Three major aspects that need to be monitored are the
quality o f group formation processes, the quality and performance o f service providers, and the efficiency
and effectiveness of appraisal process (timeliness, speed o f response, rejection rates, etc.) A Monitoring
Information System (MIS) will be developed in-house to support the overall ML&E system. The MIS
will be simple, participatory and responsive to the operational needs o f management to allow decisions
about project implementationand corrective actions to betaken ina timely manner.

30.      The Management Team will be responsible for overall monitoring' o f the process and
implementation progress. One of the main reasons for centralizing all the information on sub project
proposals at the national level i s to facilitate not only the monitoring o f the project but also the initial
evaluation o fits performance and impact, and to ensure timely release o f project funds.

3 1.     ML&E System Structure: The ML&E system will operate at four levels. The structure will
enable information flow both horizontally and vertically. Inorder to increase effectiveness o f the ML&E
system and reduce data redundancy, each level will be responsible for maintaining data at that level.
Reports will be generated and sent both horizontally and vertically and be made available across the

InstitutionalArrangements for ML&E

32.      Village Level: Decision-making and tracking community level development will be the main
focus of ML&E activities at this level. A village level information and monitoring subcommittee will be
set up to collect and analyze information on VDP progress. This sub committee will report progress to the
BOD and the Maha Sabha. The members o f the subcommittee will be provided focused training inboth
conceptual and operational aspects o f ML&E. The progress reporting o f VDP development will be the
ultimate responsibility o fthe BOD.

33.      Village level decision-making will be supported by regular surveys and data collection on family
profiles, compliance with the `Golden Rules', information that reflect changes in livelihood. Data will be
captured and reported on a monthly basis. Given adequate and stable power supplies and a computer, this
staff member will serve as a nodal point on the M I S systems.

34.      Division and District levels: District and divisional level officials will be responsible for ML&E
aspects ineach GND. The project has already appointed several sub divisional facilitators whose primary
responsibility will be to report to the divisional level.

35.      The project has been staffed with a district level coordinator who will collect, analyze and
aggregate data at the district level and be the point o f contact for each division. These district level
coordinators will report on a monthly and quarterly basis on formats provided to them by national level
ML&Econsultants. The projectwillprovidecomputers at thislevel for data storage andanalysis.

36.      Provincial level: The A&M Team will conduct appraisals two to three times a week in a two-
step process. This two-step process will include a quick desk review and a more extensive field review.
Reporting frequency at this level will be at monthly and quarterly intervals.

37.      National level: The ML&E officer will be responsible for the ML&E systems and for the
development o f a national M I S system, which will include an electronic network that will extend up to
and include the district levels. At lower levels manual procedures will be in place for data gathering and
reporting.   When the village information centers are in place the Management Team with national
consultants will develop plans to include activities for monitoring and reporting village level data using
electronic file transfers to the national level.

38.      Once the project cycle has been developed and each area specialist has identified specific roles, a
master list o f indicators will be prepared for the project as a whole. This master indicators list will
probably include 3 to 4 indicators for each area o f specialty.

39.      National level consultants are currently developing an MIS. Where computers are available
modules o f the database will be installed at the village (lowest) level. The database will be designed ina
modular fashion inorder to facilitate the installation o f sub modules at appropriate levels.

SocialAccountability

40.      The objective o f social accountability mechanisms i s to develop a culture o f accountabilitywithin
the VO and the communities, between service providers and communities and between the Foundation
and the communities. Some o f the mechanisms that will be usedinthe project include:


    0    Baseline community report cards indicating the criteria which VO members would like to use to
         evaluate VO's performance and six-monthly follow up report cards exercises to assess scoring o f




                                                       56

  the VO's performance. This also helps to develop a rating system for VOs. The data i s then
  discussed inopen meetings o f the Maha Sabha and the BOD to identify corrective actions;


0 VOs' self-evaluation about its own performance and presentation to the village on a periodic
  basis;


0 Display of all key financial and physical information at a prominent location or at the VO's
  office;


0 Report cards on performance of various service providers by VOs and sharing o f this data with
  providers to develop better service standards. This informationwould be made public to all VOs;


0 Training o f SAC members on input and expenditure trachng, financial supervision and report
  cards to enable them to report inVOs on a periodic basis;


0 Development of a user report card on the Foundation's performance on an annual basis by
  interacting with a sample o f community members and changing organizational processes as a
  result of the feedback (market research and client perception);


0 Piloting a PS report card on service delivery performance o f PS in selected divisions where
  intensive work i s undertaken on local governance development.

Country Issues
1.       A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) hasjust been completed for Sri Lanka.
GOSL has been an active participant inthe CFAA process and i s inthe process o f carrying forward the
recommendations. The CFAA has identified several areas o f reforms required in the public financial
management arrangements at the country and local government levels, the institutional arrangements
proposed for Phases 1 and 2 o f the project are sufficiently sanitized for the country level issues to have
any significant effect on the smooth implementation o f the project. At the country level, availability o f
counterpart funds from GOSL has been an issue. However, over the last few years, GOSL has accorded
highpriority to donor fundedprojects and this isnot consideredto be applicable to the proposedproject.

2.       The project would devolve the powers, responsibilities and funds to PASby using a gradual
approach, in three phases. The process envisaged would entail substantial investment in building the
capacity o f local governments and creating enabling environment for them to respond to the community
demands. As part o fthe capacity buildingplan, a detailed action plan for bringing about improvements in
the financial management capacity will be developed and be one o f the triggers to move into Phase 3.

StrengthsandWeaknesses
3.       Strengths:The projecthas the following strengths inthe area o f financial management:
    (i)      Financial management manuals for the GMF and VOs have been prepared. The manuals will
             govern all financial management aspects o f the project and would be revised and improved
             periodically based on implementation experience. The manuals have all the elements o f good
             financial management systems.
    (ii)     The framework o f financial management has been significantly simplified and special care
             taken to reduce the accounting centers to the minimum. This would become a critical factor
             as the project scales up.
    (iii)     Since the design o f the project i s largely community-based, disbursement procedures
             applicable to community-driven development projects,               as explained in Fiduciary
             Management for Community-Driven Development Project: A Reference Guide (May 2002),
             have been applied. Lump sum contractual arrangements for the sub projects significantly
             reduces the need for accounting for the sub projects in the project books o f accounts as
             releases made on the basis o f milestones are regarded as project expenditures.

FinancialManagementFramework

4.       National Level: The Foundation will be responsible for the financial management arrangements
for the project. It will maintain accounts for all project expenditures on double entry systems following
generally accepted national accounting standards and will be subject to GOSL financial regulations. The
financial management systems will allow expenditures to be classified by project components/activities
and disbursement categories and prepare monthly/quarterly /annual reports required for project
management. The accounting and reporting system will be manual inthe beginning and will move into a
computerized environment during the life o f the project.         The Foundation will be responsible for
compiling withdrawal claims for the project and liaise with GOSL as well as with IDA for fund releases
and operation o f Grant. The Foundationwill provide overall policy level support in developing financial
management policies and disseminating lessons learned.

5.       The Foundation will consider setting up higher level Finance and Audit Committees at the level
o f the BODSwith nominated professionals inthe field o f audit, financial management, rural banking etc.
as considered appropriate. The Finance Committee and Audit Committees will play a more active role in
deciding on financial management policies, review financial progress and have overall oversight
functions, receive and review audit reports (internal and external) and monitor follow up actions and
make recommendations for revision o f accounting and financial management policies.

6.       The A&M Unit with two field offices in each o f the provinces will essentially act as a `clearing
house', responsible for institutional and technical appraisal o f the sub-projects, and ensuring compliance
with the rules o f the game (for participation, inclusion, transparency, cost sharing and cost effectiveness
and technical requirements) and good quality of service provision to communities. Robustness o f the
appraisal mechanism, particularly in developing cost estimates for the sub projects will be the key
challenge. These Units will account for the operational field expenditures and submit monthly reports o f
the expenditures to the Foundation.

7.       District and Divisional/ PS Facilitation Teams (DrFTs and DFTs): At the district and divisional
levels, the project will provide an advance equal to 45/60 days o f estimated expenditures, to meet its
operational expenditures against an agreed budget The DrFTs and D a will be required to submit
monthly financial statements on a timely basis, accompanied by copies o f supporting documents, to
become eligible for additional advances.

8.        Village Organization: VO consists o f the Maha Sabha, BOD, and various committees. VO will
plan, implement and supervise sub-projects, manage funds, procure goods, services and works, operate
and maintain community assets, and conduct self-monitoring for cost effectiveness and sustainability.
The fiduciary relationship will be dnven by lump sum financing agreements between the Foundation and


                                                     59

the VO, and VOs will consequently not be considered as accounting centers under the project. However,
the financial management framework envisages active monitoring o f the financial management functions
and this has been built into the design o f the system.

9.      Executive Committee: The Executive Committee, duly elected by the General Body o f the
Association will be responsible for all the executive functions and be accountable to the Maha Sabha for
the implementation o f the project activities.       The Executive Committee will appoint sub-project
committees, Finance and Procurement sub-committees to be responsible for specific functions. The
Executive Board o f the VO will devolve funds and functions to other sub- committees, as considered
necessary for implementation, but essentially remain accountable for all the operations.

10.     Sub-project Committee: Sub-project committees (Procurement, Finance, Internal Audit, Social
Audit, Income Generating Activities, and others) plan, and prepare detailed proposals, execute, monitor
implementation and arrange for post-Project operation and maintenance to ensure sustainability o f the
assets created under the project.

11.     Finance Committee: The Finance Committee appointed by the Executive Committee will be
responsible for the overall financial management aspects and will follow the financial management
guidelines documented in the Operational Manual. The Committee will be specifically responsible for
oversight o f all the accounting and reporting functions. This would include periodic surprise cash checks,
verifying reconciliation o f books o f accounts with bank statements and ensuring that the requirements as
set inthe Operational Manual are being complied with at the VO and sub project committee levels.

12.     Procurement Committee: The Procurement Committee will be responsible for all procurement
functions and will ensure that the procurement guidelines for purchase o f goods and services are strictly
followed, assist the sub project committee to negotiate for highest quality for approval o f all procurement
proposals forwarded by the committees, as per the agreed procurement thresholds.

13.     Social Audit Committee (SAC): The SAC will be nominated by the Maha Sabha directly to
"watch" the work o f Executive Committee and all other committees to check whether they are "just and
fair", and follow the rules and principles. The Committee will meet at least once a month and report their
observations andproviderecommendations to Maha Sabha at least once inthree months.

14.      Village Savings and Credit Committee (VSCC): The VSCC will manage the Loan Fundthat has
              -
been granted from the project to the VO. It will ensure that the Loan Fundkeeps its value by setting
market interest rates and strictly monitoring loan repayment. It will also ensure that savings activities
managed by SGs and Clusters are properly managed.

FundsFlow

15.     The project will be fimded from three sources: GOSL, IDA and the beneficiaries through cash
and/or labor contributions. The envisaged fund flow for the Project i s as follows:

16.     National Level: The Foundation will be responsible for preparation o f the annual budgets and
submission o f the same through the Ministry o f Samurdhi to the Director General, Budget and Director
General, Planning. These estimates will be included in the Government's annual expenditure budget to
obtain appropriations from the Parliament. GOSL contributions will be transferred to the project by the
Treasury on an imprest basis and supported by actual expenditure statements. To facilitate timely flow o f
funds to the Foundation, IDA will advance a portion o f the proceeds o f the Grant to a Special deposit
Account to be maintained at the Central Bank o f Sri Lanka from which the Foundation will draw funds
against eligible project expenditures. A replenishment application will be prepared and submitted to the


                                                      60

Bank monthly for the amounts withdrawn from the Special Account while disbursements are transaction-
based and quarterly when disbursements are FMR-based.

17.     The Foundation will also be responsible for transferring project funds in agreed installments,
directly to the VOs in accordance with the financing agreements that would be entered into between the
Foundation and the Village Organizations. The C O M gives details o f eligibility criteria, size and nature
o f community subprojects, appraisal process and certification o f milestones, terms and conditions o f
financing agreements and fund flow arrangements.

18.     The A&M Units will be provided with imprest advances (equivalent to two months fund
requirements) from the Foundation. The Units will submit monthly expenditures statements to the
Foundationand obtain replenishment o fthe imprest on a monthly basis.

19.     District and DivisionaUPS Facilitation Teams: At the district and divisional levels, the project
will provide imprest advances (equivalent to two months fund requirements) from the Foundation. The
Units will submit monthly expenditures statements to the Foundation and obtain replenishment o f the
imprest on a monthly basis.

20.      Villaae Organizations: VOs will open two bank accounts      -  one for the project funds and the
other for their own membership collections and other sources o f funds. The project bank account will
receive funds directly from the Foundation Office against financing agreements, and also to credit capital
contribution by the community. This account will be operated on behalf o f VO by the Executive
Committee members under thejoint signature o f at least two officer bearers o f Executive Committee.

21.     Sub-Proiect Agreements & Beneficiaw Contributions: The Foundation will enter into financing
agreements with the VOs for implementation o f the sub-projects. The financing agreements will include
the sections:


    0   Overall Financing Agreement on selection o f the VO for implementation o f the sub-project.
        Under the overall Financing Agreement, the VO will be provided with initial capacity building
        fundto carry out the preparatory work andinitiate capacity buildingactivities.
    0   Addenda Ito the Overall Financing Agreements will cover terms and conditions for the capacity
        building component. The funds for the activities will be released in agreed tranches and will
        require reporting on utilization o f the funds released earlier and refundadjustment o f unspent
        funds.
    0   Addenda I1 to the Overall Financing Agreement will cover terms and conditions for the
        implementationof the specific sub-projects. Each sub-project will have a separate agreement and
        release o f the funds will be based on achievement o f pre-determined and mutually agreed
        physical and process milestones and in installments agreed between A&M Team and the VO.
        Savings on account o f economy and efficiency will be retainedby the VO for activities agreed by
        Maha Sabha. Cost overruns on account o f faulty design or extraneous reasons will be reviewedby
        the A&M Team, sanctioned by the Foundation under the circumstances and in accordance with
        the norms and procedures agreed between GOSL and IDA and released to VO through
        supplementary financing agreements.
    0   Addenda I11to the Overall Financing Agreement will cover specific terms and conditions for the
        implementation o f the L S Fund. This will fund the micro finance activities o f the VO aimed at
        building a sustainable and viable VSCO primarily meant to expand opportunities for income
        generation for poor women and youth. The releases against this fund will be made ininstallments
        linked to demonstrated institutional, financial and performance indicators.




                                                     61

22.      All payments against Financing Agreement as released by the Foundation to the VO will be
treated as eligible expenditure for claiming reimbursement because these payments are based on
achievement o f performance and financial indicators in the sub-projects. The date of release of such
installments to the VOs will be apoint of eligibility for claiming reimbursement by GOSL from IDA.

23.      The mechanisms o f accounting for beneficiary contributions inlund are detailed in the Financial
Management Manual and the COM. The amounts and method (cashAund/labor) of contributions will be
agreed and documented inthe financing agreements andinthe case of cash contributions (largely upfront)
there would be conditions for release of funds. In kindlabor contributions are built into the milestone
certification provided by the communities and will be accounted for by the Foundation on the basis of
these certificates.

Staffing& Training:

24.      National Level: Since the Foundation will be the main accounting and reporting hub for the
project, the National Project Management Team will have a senior level Finance Manager, deputed from
the Treasury of GOSL, responsible for development of overall project level policies on financial
management, accounting, auditing and beneficiary                contributions etc. The Team will also include a
professional chartered accountant as the Accountant - Project to be operationally responsible for the
consolidation o f the project financial reports, submission o f withdrawal claims etc. The Accountant -
Project will also steer the computerization initiative later, buildinginadequate integrationwith the overall
MIS for the project. The Finance function will be supported by adequate number of accountants. These
positions are expected to be mainstreamed into the Foundation core staff. In addition, the national level
staffing would include a position of an Accountant - Sub Projects (with previous experience in
accounting at community level and preferably from NGO/development background) and will lead the
development of policies and strategy and its implementation to build adequate book keepingcapacity at
the village level.

25.      The provincial A&M Units will each have an Accounts Assistant, who will be responsible for
maintaining the accounting records required for the Unit's expenditures and tracking of all sub-project
agreements, releasesmade, financial reports submitted and accounting o f beneficiaryContributions etc.



                                                              62

26.      District and Divisional Facilitation Teams: One o f the Community Facilitators (CF) at the
Facilitation Team level will be designated as CF-Accounts and will be responsible for ensuring the
qualitative aspects o fbook keeping and financial management at the village level. The CF-Accounts will
have relevant experience in accounting and be responsible for implementing the capacity building
strategy and provide handholding support to the book keepers.

27.      The staffing requirements o f Accountant    - Project and Accountant - Sub Projects (at National
level), Project Assistants - Accounts (at Provincial level) and Community Facilitator - Accounts (at
Divisional Facilitation Team level) are project specific and will need to gradually shift to Pradeshiya
Sabhas and Village Organizations as the project progresses into Phase 2 and 3.

28.      Villaae Level: At the village level, the finance, accounts and social audit functions will be with
              -
different institutions/committees as described earlier in the section on institutional arrangements. The VO
will hire the services of an accountant or entrust the responsibilityto a member o f VO duly trainedunder
the project for book keeping and maintaining accounts. Ifnecessary s l l l s are not available at the village
level, a suitable person can be identified and trained as a para-professional. As an alternate option, a cadre
o f self-employed accountants will be developed and encouraged to set up accounting practices at the
village level, whose services can be availedby the VOs.

Training:

29.      Since the project financial and accounting staff at the national and Provincial levels will be newly
recruited, and will not have been involved in the design o f the project and the design o f the financial
management system, they need to be trained in the requirements o f accounting and reporting under the
project. These trainings will be arranged in-house in consultation with the Finance Manager and will
draw on internal and external expertise for the purpose. The accounting staff will also need to be trained
to operate the computerized financial management system, once it i s ready.

30.      Capacity buildingo f the institutiondcommitteesat the village level to manage the funds, maintain
books o f accounts, report periodically on the financial progress to all the stakeholders will be one o f the
most critical aspects o f the project. The accountant with the DFTs will play a key role inthis function. A
centrally driven standardized approach to training, development o f standard training materials, training o f
trainers and provision o f standard books o f accounts will improve the degree o f compliance on the
ground. The modular standard set o f training capsules will address the requirements o f training o f office
bearers o f the VO, Sub Project Committees, Social Audit Committee etc.

31.      The Project will promote, as a conscious strategy o f internalizing capacities at the village level,
identification and development o f potential para-professionals in book keeping and accounting. Para-
professionals will be identified during the initial batches and their s l l l s will be developed by involving
them in Project processes and capacity building activities. Para-professionals may take up various roles
as facilitators, motivators, trainers, resources persons or service providers to villages during the
subsequent batches.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

32.      The Financial Management Manual has been prepared and documents in detail the accounting
and financial management processes and procedures. In addition, the Foundation will develop its own
financial rules, which will be based on GOSLrules.




                                                     63

33.      Books o f accounts for the project would be maintained using double-entry book-keeping
principles, principally on cash basis.      A detailed record o f all project liabilities will, however be
maintained.     Standard books o f accounts (cash and bank books, journals, ledgers, etc.) would be
maintained at all levels. The books o f accounts will be maintainedon a manual basis untilthe integrated
computerized accounting system is developed.

34.      A Chart o f Accounts has been developed to enable data to be captured and classified by
expenditure centers, budget heads, procurement methods, project components/activities, and disbursement
categories. This matches closely with the classification o f expenditures and sources o f funds indicated in
the project documents (PIP and Project Cost Tables). The key issues that have been addressed in the
design of the accounting policies and procedures are:


    0    Accounting entries for recording the beneficiary contributions in kind will be made on the basis
         of certification o f achievement o f the specific milestones as laid down in the Sub-project
         agreements (specifiing the Contributions in kmd linked to each milestone).          The COM will
         include guidance on the accounting for beneficiary contributions incash and labor and will cover
         aspects of: (i) conversion o f in hnd/labor contributions to monetary amounts; (ii)accuracy o f
         computations; (iii)approval by the Treasurer; (iv) review and authorization by the VO; and (v)
         proper posting and recording inthe prime books o f account
    0    Releases of installments against the sub-project agreements will be recorded as expenditures in
         the books of accounts o f the project.
    0    All other releases o f funds to accounting centers (Provincial Teams etc.) will be accounted for as
         advances in the books o f accounts o f and adjusted to expenditures only on submission o f
         expenditures.
    0    Various levels o f controls have been developed in the financial management framework. Special
         authorities, approvals, delegation of authority, approval limits at various levels, milestone
         certification, payment responsibility and controls to safeguardproject assets have been developed
         and documented inthe Financial Management manual;
    0    Service standards to process financial transactions and reporting formats have been developed in
         order to fulfill the fiduciary obligations. Jobs are segregated, reporting functions and key
         responsibilities are clearly laid down;
    0    At all accounting centers, separate books o f accounts will be maintained for the project funds as
         per the requirements specified inthe FinancialManagement Manual.

35.      VO will maintain simple accounts recorddregisters as follows: (i)Cashbank Book; (ii)
contributions received in cash/labor/materials; (iii)materials purchased and utilized. In addition, the VO
will retain all vouchers, bills, supporting documents and ensure that bank pass books are regularly
updated. Similar accounts will be maintained for the O&M bank account and reports submitted to its
members at M S meetings. Standards pre-formattedbooks and registers will be provided to eachVO. The
institutional arrangements at the village level have been structured to provide for custody and handling o f
cash. This will include periodic and surprise cash counts and reconciliation.

Audit Arrangements

36.      External Audit:: The Foundation, as a body corporate, will, in consultation with the Auditor
General o f Sri Lanka (AG), appoint an independent firm o f chartered accountants to conduct annual audit
of the project. The audit would cover all project operations o f the national level, provincial levels and will
also cover the VO accounts on sample basis. The selection and appointment o f the private CA firmby the
AG Office will be based on Terms o f References (TORS)acceptable to IDA, and the selected firm will
need to be acceptable to IDA. The audit report would consist of: (i)    financial statements and i)and audit



                                                     64

opinion confirming whether the project financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
consistently applied Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view o f the operations o f the project
during the year and that the withdrawals from the IDA Credit made on the basis o f SOEs or FMRs
together with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied on to
support the related withdrawals. Additionally, the auditor will be requiredto provide a management letter
to project management highlighting findings during the audit. The audit will be conducted as per the
internationally accepted standards and financial reporting will follow the IPSAS.

37.      The audit report with the management letter will be submitted to IDA within six months o f the
close o f each financial year. TORs for the audit has been prepared in agreement with IDA and will be
agreed upon with the audit f i d s .   The form o f annual financial statements to be certified will also be
agreed with the AG. Thus the following audit reports will be monitored inthe Audit Reports Compliance
System (ARCS):

      Implementing Agency                     Audit                  Auditors           Date Due

38.      VOs as institutions constituted under the Companies Act, will be legally obliged to have their
accounts audited annually by a CA firm. As a demonstration o f good practice, each o f the VOs
implementing the project will be required to submit audited statements o f expenditures and audit reports
for the project within 6 months o f the close o f the financial year. The VOs will also have the option o f
engaging firms o f chartered accountants from the panel prepared by the Provincial Appraisal &
Monitoring Units. These will maintain a panel o f chartered accountancy firms, based on the general list
approved by the Auditor General and agree on the rates o f fees to be charged. TORs have been developed
for the audit at the VO level and are documented inthe FinancialManagement Manual. Follow up o f the
audit observations by the VO Executive Committee, will be monitored by the District Financial
Management Teams and such reports will be made available to the IDA supervision teams, as required.

39.      InternalAudit: The project accounts will also be subjected to quarterly internal audit. A firm o f
chartered accountants will be engaged by the Foundation to conduct a quarterly and annual audit and
submit management letters to the Management. The TORs o f the internal audit task have been drafted
and included in the Financial Management Manual. The key internal audit function would be to (i)
ascertain whether the systems o f internal checks and controls operating are effective; (ii)ascertain
reliability o f accounting financial reports; (iii)
                                                 ascertain the extent to which the systems inplace prevent
misuse o f project assets; and (iv) ascertain that the financial rules and procedures as laid down in the
Manuals are followed. Arrangements to ensure proper liaison and coordination with the external auditors
and the AGs office will be built into the Manual.

40.      GOSL shall employ not later than September 30, 2004, and thereafter maintain throughout the
Project implementationperiod a firm o f chartered accountants with terms o f reference and qualifications
acceptable to IDA, for conducting the internal audit o f the records, accounts and financial statements of
the Project.

41.      Reportingand Monitoring: The monthly reporting formats from each o f the accounting centers
have been designed to provide summarized monthly financial information on the fund flows, balances in
cashhank, status o f advances and expenditures classified by project components/activities, disbursement
categories, procurement methods etc. These reports will be compiled by the Foundation on monthly and
quarterly basis to provide meaningful FMRs. An important aspect o f the reports would be that the
information on the number o f village-wise sub-projects signed, value o f the sub-projects, releases made
against the agreed milestones, contributions accounted for, status o f financial reports submitted by the


                                                     65

VOs will be monitored. These reports will be prepared from the start o f the project, submitted to IDA
within45 days o fthe close o fthe quarter and usedby the project at the state and district level and by IDA
for monitoring and management decision making.

42.     The financial arrangements between the VO and the Foundation will not require financial
accounting for the sub project expenditures inthe project books. All payments against the contracts will
be recorded as expenditures in project books.         However, VOs will be required to submit regular
statements o f expenditures summarizing sources and uses o f funds against the plans in order to build
accountability and demonstrate the presence o f adequate accounting and book-keeping arrangements.

43.     VOs will prepare a simple report summarizing: (i)the sources and uses o f funds, indicating the
balances in cashhank; (ii)contributions in labor and materials; and (iii)physical progress o f
works/activities. The report will be presented to its members and in the M S and provide all records for
scrutiny by members. The submission o f the monthly financial report will be required as a pre-condition
for release o f subsequent installments against the individual sub-project agreements.           The financial
management arrangements set up would emphasize on providing local level transparency, social audit and
self-accountability. These measures would include a simple summary o f the accounts (amounts received
from the members and the project, amount spent and balances inhand) to be publicly posted inthe notice
board in the village. In addition, the books/registers, vouchers and bank pass books would be open for
perusal by members.

44.     The social audit functions (comprising o f internal reviews/audits on all aspects o f quality,
quantity, procurement, beneficiary selection etc. conducted by an independent committee appointed by
the Maha Sabha the assembly o f all the members o f the VO) at the VO (where a substantial part o f the
                  -
expenditures will take place) are being adequately strengthened under the project and will play an
important role in ensuring transparency and accountability at the community level. The SAC will
countersign the milestone certificates that are required to trigger the release o f the tranches. The M S will
approve final statements o f expenditures for each o f the components.        Additionally, the project will
engage external consultants to conduct a concurrent review o f the qualitative and quantitative aspects o f
the works, including financial aspects.

ComputerizedFinancialManagementSvstem

45.     The computerization o f the financial management system has not been envisaged fromthe start o f
the project but will be initiated before the end o f Year 2 o f the project. The key issues considered while
developing the design o fthe software were:


    0   Integration with the MIS system - qualitative information on the sub-project proposals/contracts
        tracked in the MIS system are linked by common code numbers in the FMS system. Financial
        informationrelating to the sub-project contracts are tracked by the same code numbers.
    0   The system would be not be project specific but will broad base to cover the entity level
        operations. The system will allow accounting o f multiple projects and overall consolidation at
        the entity level.
    0   The system would be used for generating financial reports required to be submitted to the GOSL
        and the Accountant General as well as required for project management.

Imr>actofProcurementArrangements

46.     The nature and type o f the contractual arrangements with the VOs lay the basis o f accounting for
the project. As has been envisaged, the Foundation will enter into contractual arrangements with the VOs
for implementation o f the village development plans. These agreements will be based on lump sum


                                                      66

contracts with payments based on performance milestones agreed and documented in the contracts. The
achievement o f the performance milestones will be certified. Thus, the project will report on achievement
o fperformance-based milestones to obtainreimbursement from IDA.

DisbursementArrangements

47.      Disbursements from the Grant Account would initially be made on the transaction-based system
(reimbursement with full documentation and against statements o f expenditure, direct payment and
Special Commitment. GOSL may request withdrawals from the Grant Account to be made on the basis o f
reports to be submitted to the Association in form and substance satisfactory to IDA, such reports to
include the Financial Management Reports and any other information as the Association shall specify by
notice to GOSL (Report-based Disbursements).

48.      Periodic advances (or tranche) payments to VOs can be treated as eligible expenditures for
replenishment as long as they are made inline with the provisions o f the financinghb-project agreement
(linked to achievement o f agreed milestones). Supporting documentation for the replenishment would be
inthe form o f a simple summary statement providing details about the payments to the sub-projects, e.g.,
sub-project total amounts approved, amounts paid to date on account o f the sub-project, and the amount
o f the current payments, as well as certification o f achievement of milestones by the Appraisal and
Monitoring Teams.

49.     A Special Account would be opened at the Central Bank o f Sri Lanka and would be operated by
the Foundation.    The authorized allocation o f the Special Account would be US$3.8 million, that
represents about four months o f average estimated eligible expenditure for financing from the IDA Grant.
The Special Account would be operated inaccordance with IDA'Soperational policies.

50.     The Foundation will compile the financial information from all its management constituent
agencies and prepare reimbursement claims on a monthly basis when disbursements are made on
transaction-basis quarterly when made on FMR-basis.        The Foundation will also be responsible for
submission o f the withdrawal applications to GOSL for onward submission to IDA for replenishment o f
the special account, reimbursement, or direct payment.

51.     IDA may require withdrawals fi-om the Grant Account to be made on the basis o f statements o f
expenditure for: (i) works costing less than US$500,000 equivalent each; (ii) costing less than
                                                                                  goods
US$250,000 equivalent each; (iii) goods or works obtained through contracts costing less than US$lOO,OO
equivalent each financed under a sub-project; (iv) employment o f consulting firms under contracts costing
less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent each; (v) employment o f individual consultants under contracts costing
less than US$50,000 equivalent each; (vi) contracts with consulting firms or individual consultants
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent each financed under a sub-project; and (g) all training, studies,
and operating costs, all under such terms and conditions as IDA shall specify by notice to the Recipient.

            CommunityDevelopmentandLivelihoodImprovement"Gemi Diriya"Project

A.    ProcurementResponsibilitiesAnd Capacity

1.       The procurement arrangements under the project are primarily based on IDA'Sappraisal o f the
existing procurement management capability o f the Foundation that has been set-up under the project.
Experience and lessons learned from the other Bank-financed projects in Sri Lanka have been
incorporated into the design of the implementation and procurement arrangements. A draft procurement
plan has been prepared. In addition, GOSL has submitted a capacity building plan with actions and
recommendations to buildprocurement capacity o f the Foundationand other implementingagencies. The
Foundationdoes not have any experience with the World Bankprocurement procedures.

2.      Because o f the nature o f this project, bulk o f the procurement will be undertaken by the VOs or
cluster o f VOs. There i s a need therefore to strengthen the capacity of VOs as well as the divisional and
national level implementing entities - the Foundation, DrFTs, DFTs, PSs, and SOs. A full-time
procurement officer has been hired, and would be trained in the Bank procurement procedures and
guidelines as well in the community procurement aspects.            In addition, an Individual Procurement
consultant would be appointed to provide on-the-job training to divisional and district level staff as well
as to the communities to develop in house capacity. The Consultant would also conduct a series o f
workshops to develop the procurement capacity at the Foundation, District, Divisional, provincial teams,
PS and SO levels. Several officers both at central and provincial level will participate in at procurement
training programs conducted at the regional level.

ActionPlanfor StrengtheningThe Foundation's Capacityto ImplementProjectProcurement

3.      Based on an appraisal of the capacity of the Foundationto manage and conduct procurement, and
guide the communities on the procurement aspects, the following actions have been identified and
recommended for improving the procurement capacity inthe field: (i)     the Foundationto hire an additional
person as an individual consultant to buildthe in-house capacity; (ii)  ensure procurement training for the
Procurement Specialist as well as for other the Foundation staff; and (iii)    train the village communities
and divisional facilitators in the Community Procurement procedures, rules and processes as agreed and
documented inthe COM.

B.      ProcurementMethods

4.      All procurement of civil works and good contracts under the project will be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated
January 1995, revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999 (henceforth
referred to as Procurement Guidelines). Consultant Services financed by the project shall be procured in
accordance with the World Bank Guidelines on the Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers, dated January 1997, revised in September 1997, January 1999, May 2002 (henceforth
referred to Consultant Guidelines). IDA Standard bidding documents including evaluation reports for
Procurement under International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and Sri Lanka-specific Bank model
documents for Procurement under National Competitive Bidding(NCB) which are already being used in
Sri Lanka and Community contract formats pre-approved for the Project (Manual o f Procedures) shall be
used for procurement of goods and works under the project. The Bank's standard Request for Proposal
(RFP) or a modified version with the prior agreement o f the Bank will be used in the selection of
Consulting Firms, SOs and Individual Consultants. The methods to be used for procurement are described

below and the estimated amount for each method, are summarized in Table A. The threshold contract
values for the use of each method are established inTable B.

5.       GOSL has prepared guidelines on "Government Tender Procedure'' in 1996 (revised in August
1997) under Chapter 13 o fthe Financialregulations. For the first time the Guidelines and Rules provide a
framework for all public procurement inthe country, including PC, PS and LA. The Guidelines include a
separate chapter (XIII) for projects supported by foreign funding agencies (this chapter has been revised
in December 2000 and issued as a separate booklet) to ensure transparency in procurement activities
which i s being revised inline with the CPAR recommendations.

NotificationOfBusinessOpportunities

6.       A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published inUN"Development Business", and the
issue o f Development Gateway in January 2004. Specific procurement notices for all ICB contracts and
Expression of Interest (EOI) for contracts for consultancy services above US$200,000 will be advertised
inthe DevelopmentBusiness, eg. market ofDevelopmentGateway andina majornationalnewspaper (in
the national and English languages). Contracts procured under National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procedures will be advertised ina national paper o f wider circulation inthe local language.

C.       ProcurementArrangements

Community Procurement

7.       Most o f the procurement (works, goods and services) in the project will be done at the
communityN0 level. Under the project, the eligible communities will undertake sub-project activities
through their own efforts based on a demand-driven approach. The procurement procedures, process and
methods have been developed extensively during the implementation o f the VSHLI pilot.                 These
procedures and guidelines have been further reviewed during the proposed project preparation, and are
being tested in the 24 intensive learning GNDs The COM (in local language) based on the above
experience gives detailed procedures, rules and methods o f community procurement.

8.       Procurement at the villageicommunity level will be guided by Community Participation in
Procurement (CPP - Para. 3.15 o f the Procurement Guidelines).           The VOs will directly enter into
contracts with private contractors, SOs, consultants, government agencies, and will be guided by the
principles o f efficiency, equal opportunity, cost-effectiveness and transparency o f the process.      The
VOs/communities will manage and implement community infrastructure sub-projects such as water
supply, sanitation, minor irrigation, linkroads, community centers, hire slulled contractors and purchase
materials locally to ensure minimal delays and reduce inefficiencies due to loss during transport and
storage. Standardprice lists (based on market rates) will be developed, maintained and updatedregularly
under the guidance o f the districddivisional team, and will be used by the VOs/communities as standard
rates to guide their procurement.      Specific procurement arrangements under are summarized are as
follows:

9.       Villagekommunity Sub-project Grants oJS$47.5 million):                  The Village Development
component will finance sub-projects which are demand-driven in nature, making it difficult to determine
ex-ante what i s to be procured. Grant funds fromthe project can be used for services, goods, training, and
works.    The VOs/communities may obtain technical, management support and advice from the line
agencies at the division and district level or decide to hire local consultants, SOs for these services. The
community and social infrastructure sub-projects would include: new and rehabilitationo f existing village
link roads to improve the network o f inter-village roads, small scale water supply and environmental
friendly sanitation schemes works involvingl o w technical complexity, dug wells, rehabilitation of village



                                                     70

level reservoirs and minor irrigation rehabilitation, community centers etc. The productive sub-projects
will include income generation activities, such as skills building, village information luosks, micro-
businesses, livestock activities, and hiring o f technical services for skills building training for
employment opportunities. The village sub-projects would also include hiring o f SOs to help the VOs
and sub-project committees prepare and implement the village development plan. The average value o f
each sub-project would be about US$20,000 and maximum would not exceed US$SO,OOO.                         If the
community elects not to carry out works itself, then these works may be procured through local shopping
i.e. on the basis of comparison o f price quotations obtained from at least three pre-qualified contractors
that are eligible as per the Guidelines, or from registered and experienced SOs.

10.      The first sub-project contract per district, regardless o f value, and all contracts with an estimated
value o f US$lOO,OOO or above shall be subject to IDA'Sprior review. The A&M team will review the
first contract for goods and works under sub-projects in each division, regardless o f value, and all
contracts with an estimated value o f US$50,000 or above.             The agreed procedures for community
procurement are as follows:


     0   Works: Most works undertaken inthe project will use community participation to mobilize and
         pay labor. A small number o f works may need to be procured through small works. The
         following methods will be used: (i)    execute the works themselves by employing labor and by
         procuring the needed materials and technical assistance; or (ii) the whole or part o f work
                                                                             award
         on direct contract to community organizations or registered SOs; or (iii)    award the whole or part
         of work to qualified domestic contractors after invitingthree quotations (value o f each contract
         less than US$SO,OOO) inresponse to a written invitation; or (iv) award the whole or part o f work
         to qualified contractors after inviting Competitive Bids (value o f each contract more than
         US$50,000).


     0   Goods: The goods estimated to cost less than US$500 per contract may be procured through
         direct contracting procedures, and the direct contracting should be in accordance with the
         procedures as specified in the COM. Goods estimated to cost less than US$30,000 per contract
         would be procuredthrough shopping procedures on the basis o f at least three quotations.


     0   Services:   The services estimated to cost less than equivalent o f US$l,OOO            may be hired
         following section V o f Bank's Guidelines for the Selection o f Consultants by inviting proposals
         from three or more service providers or technical consultants or under single source method.
         Consulting services estimated to cost less than US$ 10,000 may also be hired based on consultant
         qualifications. Any service contracts costing more than US$lO,OOO but less than US$SO,OOO
         should be invited through newspaper advertisement.

Works and Goods

11.      Small Works (estimated to cost upto US$1.0 million): Small works estimated to cost less than
US$50,000 per contract will be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The
invitation shall include a detailed description o f the works, and the award should be made to the lowest
bidder. All works estimated to cost more than US$50,000 but less than US$500,000 would be procured
throughNCB.

1995, revised January and August 1996, September 1997 and January 1999). The following procurement
methods would be followed:


    0   International Competitive Bidding (ICB): Packages of goods estimated to cost more than
        US$200,000 per contract would be procured following ICB procedures. Since the works and
        goods are small, ICB i s not considered as an appropriate method.


    0   NationalCompetitiveBidding(NCB): PackagesofGoods andequipment estimated to cost less
        than US$200,000 and more than US$50,000 per contract would be procuredon the basis of NCB

Hiringof Instituteof Construction, TrainingandDevelopment(ICTAD)

14.     IDA has agreed to hire the services o f ICTAD that has unique experience in the country for
training the communities and local level officials and service providers in internationally tested labor
based construction techniques.      This will be implemented in two phases depending on the need and
estimated cost around US$200,000.

TrainingandWorkshops (uS$5.0 million)

15.     Training will focus on building capacity o f staff at the Foundation, District, Divisional levels
including the staff at PCs, PS and SOs where relevant. Courses will be conducted at local, provincial,
national and international level in social mobilization, community participation, social capital, CBOs,
micro-finance, sub-project development, environment management and monitoring and evaluation,
procurement and financial management.          There will be a number o f in-house training programs.
Workshops/Seminars would also be conducted where topics o f importance would be discussed inan open
forum with respected experts. Several selected staff from the Ministry,participating Districts, Divisions,
PCs and PSs will take part intraining programs and exposure visits to best practices outside Sri Lanka in
procurement. There will also be training programs for SOs and other service providers in capacity
buildingfor social mobilization, project design, and maintenance o f social and community infrastructure
services.

IncrementalOperatingCosts(uS$4.2 million)

16.     The incremental costs would be financed on a declining basis and would cover vehicle
maintenance (fuel and insurance), supervisory field visits (travel and per diem), office supplies and
operating cost, communication expenses, and salaries o f contract staff.

D.      Assessmentof BorrowersReadinessto Implementthe Project

17.     Due to the demand-driven nature o f the project, it i s not possible to prepare a detailed
Procurement Plan and Schedule for the community driven activities. However, a procurement plan has
been prepared for the goods and equipment and consultancy services to be procured in the project
outlining proposed methods of procurement, which has been reviewed and agreed and would be updated
annually. A tentative training plan has also been prepared identifying the areas o f training, number and
type o fparticipants to be trained, and the names o f the Institutions and resource organizatiodpersons.


                                                      73

18.     Disbursement Profile: For the first year, disbursement is expected to be low, at about 5%
because the initial year could consist largely of. capacity building o f key implementing agencies and
orientation to promote familiarity with work plans, sub-project cycle, procedures as laid out in the
community operational manual, development o f training materials, and testing o f the pilot batch o f 24
GNDs. Disbursement will pick up at year 2 at about 15%, increasing to 35% in years 3 and 4; and
tapering o f f to 10% inyear 5.

ReviewbyIDA of ProcurementDecisions

19.     Procurement Planning and Information: Procurement o f civil works, goods and services for
the project will be carried out in accordance with the agreed Procurement Plan, which will be updated as
necessary and included inthe progress reports for IDA review and approval. The annual implementation
plans will include a procurement plan as well. There will be quarterly reports on procurement, as part o f
the Project Management Reports, which will update changes in timetables and in addition reflect
information from sub-projects that have been added. Procurement information will be collected and
recorded as follows: (i)prompt reporting o f contract award information by individual sub-project
implementing agencies, to the project coordination unit, for their respective components; and (ii)
comprehensive quarterly reporting on: (a) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and total cost;
and (b) revised timings o f procurement actions including advertising, bidding, contract award and
completion time for individual contracts. IDA will review the procurement arrangements by the
Foundation, including contract packaging, applicable procedures, and the scheduling o f the procurement
processes, for its conformity with IDA procurement and Consultant Guidelines, proposed implementation
program and disbursement schedule.

20.     Prior Review Thresholds: The following procurement actioddocumentation will be subject to
Prior Review by IDA:

              Works and Goods: Prior review is required for the first NCB contracts for goods and works
              and all other contracts for works o f value more than US$500,000 and for Goods o f value
              more than US$250,000   -  as per the provisions set forth inparagraphs 2 and 3 o f Appendix 1
              of the Bank Guidelines.


        0     Consultant Services and Training:All consultancy contracts with firms of value more than
              US$lOO,OOO and with individuals o f value more than US$50,000 would be subject to prior
              review as per provisions set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 o f Appendix 1 o f the Bank
              Consultancy Guidelines. For expenditures related to the provision o f training, TOR,
              including budget will be reviewed.

21.     Despite the low limits stipulated for prior review o f contracts, not more than 5% o f the contracts
are expected to come under the provisions of prior review. This appears reasonable considering the
nature of the project and the procurement involved therein.

22.     Post review: The contracts below the prior review threshold for Works, Goods and Consultancy
services shall be subject to post review as per procedures set forth inparagraph 4 o f Appendix 1 o f the
Bank Guidelines and Bank Consultancy Guidelines. Given the small size o f the average contracts, post
review i s not expected to capture more than 1in20 contracts.

    S R I LANKA: CommunityDevelopmentandLivelihoodImprovement "GemiDiriya"Project


1.        A precise ex ante estimation o f the cost-effectiveness, economic rate o f return and fiscal impact
o f the project i s not possible because o f its demand-driven nature, which does not allow to determine a
priori how available resources will be allocated by the beneficiaries. Moreover, all project components
aim at empowerment and strengthening o f community and divisional level institutions and at facilitating
economic and non-economic opportunities for the rural poor. An economic cost-benefit analysis might
not be able to evaluate the project, as most benefits deriving from it are non quantifiable in terms o f
economic or financial returns.

2.        However, experience from similar community driven projects in the South Asia region indicates
that projects o f this type, involving community contributions, are highlycost efficient. First, the demand-
driven nature o f each sub-project permits scarce resources to flow where they are most needed. Second,
communities have a vested interest in achieving the best quality-price ratio, maximizing cost-savings and
ensuring accountability. Third, the delegation o f subproject implementation directly to communities has
proven to generate cost savings when compared to comparable quality works implemented by public
agencies.   The contracting procedures prescribed in the COM require direct contracting              through
competitive processes on all sub projects. This contributes to the cost-effectiveness o f the sub projects
financed under the project.

Social Safeguards:

1.        The Social Assessment has confirmed that OP 4.13 on Involuntary resettlement and OD 4.20 on
Indigenous People are not triggered, for the following reasons:

2.        Involuntarv resettlement (OP 4.13): Land requirements under the project fall into the following
two broad categories: (i)   land for community facilities; and (ii) for private enterprises. Inboth cases,
                                                                       land
land requirements are expected to be nominal. The VSHLI pilot experience shows that community
infrastructure schemes largely consist o f upgradehehabilitation o f existing ones while large multi-village
schemes are not envisaged by the project. Land requirements for private facilities (commercial and
household facilities) will not be acquired by the project. Lands for such purposes would be made
available by individual and group beneficiaries through their own private lands or through acquisition at
market rates.

3.        Given this background, OP 4.13 i s not triggered. Itwas agreed with project authorities that: (i)  the
project will not resort to involuntary land acquisition; (ii)   as far as possible public lands would be used for
community facilities; (iii)   in cases where public lands are not available, land (without encroachments,
disputes and encumbrances) will be secured through voluntary donations or through out right purchase
from a willing seller; ineither case, land would be transferred inthe name o f the community organization
through legal transfer; (iv) records o f all land donations would be maintainedfor independent verification
of voluntary nature o f such transactions; and (v) grievance redress mechanisms would be available for all
land sellers.

4.        Indigenous people (OD 4.20): The social assessment identifies the Veddhas as the only ethnic
group that could be potentially categorized under the characteristics defined in OD 4.20. However, the
majority o f Vedda have been relocated and rehabilitated under the Mahaweli resettlement scheme and
have become Sinhalese: they speak Sinhala language and have been culturally mainstreamed. From an
economic point o f view, however, the social assessment shows how the new mode o f subsistence based
on settled cultivation, with individual plots o f land, a reliance on paddy and the use o f ago-chemicals
does not seem to have a had a huge impact among the Veddhas, who used to depend on hunting and
gathering activities. Nonetheless, they do not exhibit the characteristics defined in OD 4.20 as there i s no
difference between such Veddhas and local population. As a result, there i s no need to prepare a separate
indigenous peoples development plan.


Summarv Findingsof Social Assessment:

CommunityTypologiesandKey Characteristics

5.        The social assessment identified four main types o f rural communities in the project area: (i)
traditional villages; (ii) created settlements (under colonization, village expansion and udagam3,
                          newly
Mahaweli schemes); (iii) communities; and (iv) villages under special circumstances (villages
                             fishing
with indigenous population, war-affected communities and tourism-affected comm~nities)~.Key features
of each community type are summarized inthe table below.

                                      (not necessarily low caste) are isolated. In some villages especially
                                      traditional villages located near the estate belt, there are few Tamil
                                      families. There are also some villages where a Muslim minority lives.

                   such villagers or GNDs. In some GNDs some sections or groups of
                   households inthe division are located far away from the road so that they
                   cannot access to benefits from development interventions.
    Women          Women in general are marginalized compared to men. This group should
                   be carehlly treated. Insome cases women have come forward more than
                   men in the activities o f CBOs. But their voice i s not hlly heard and their
                   participationindecision-malung i s relatively low.
 Female-headed     Female-headed households in many cases receive the public sympathy.
   households      Many organizations are sensitized about the problems experienced by
                   female-heads. They could be therefore considered as being in the
                   periphery not in the centre. They get something mainly because of the
                   sympathy. Their voice i s not in the decision-malung process and most o f
                   the time they are occupied because o f they have to play a duel role. As
                   they are mostly burdened with household work their participation in
                   decision-malung could be limited.      However, some female-heads are
                   active members or office bearers inCBOs.
Uneducatedpersons  Uneducated persons are marginalized even from CBOs due to obvious
                   factors. Some cannot read and write so that they cannot take
                   responsibilities o f decision-making at CBOs. They are silent listeners in
                   the development interventions. Unless participatory techniques are
                   applied their voices are not heard and choices are not included in project
                   plans.
Disabledpersons    Both children and more so the disabled are severely marginized and are
                   not included in the decision making process. Special mechanisms/
                   procedures need to be put in place to ensure their inclusion and
                   participationinthe development process.

Women andYouth StrategiesandActionPlans

7.       Gender Strategy and Action Plan: Rural women in Sri Lanka contribute a significant share to
household income and labor, and have primary responsibility over the productive activities o f the
household.    However, their social standing in the public sphere remains low. Notwithstanding the
increasing number o f women actively participating and managing community organizations, most o f
these serve practical and immediateneeds o frural women rather than building long-lasting capacity at the
community level to address gender equity. Meanwhile, gender i s one important factor that impacts
household vulnerability. Female-headed households, inparticular widows or estranged wives with small
children, are not only economically impoverished, but also socially marginalized.

8.       Inrecognizingthat women's empowerment and their participation indevelopment opportunities
will benefitnot only women but also the entire community o fthe current andnext generations, the project
aims to mainstream gender in all the project-related activities. Gender equity i s a cross-cutting aspect o f
the project, and measures to establish and sustain gender equity have been set inthe whole project design
and implementation arrangements. Inaddition, the project sets gender empowerment and participation as
a trigger for the next phase. The overall gender goals o f the project are threefold: (i)      social balancing
(power balancing) through awareness and sensitization; (ii)        economic empowerment o f women through
their livelihood improvements; and (iii)    promotion o f village level initiatives towards social issues.

9.       In view of the above, Gender Strategy and Action Plan of the project consists of three
components, addressing three objectives: (i)     gender mainstreaming and awareness building; (ii)      ensuring
women's equitable participation and benefit sharing; and (iii)      provision of special assistance to the most
vulnerable women. The following sections introduce the main activities, while more detailed information
about the implementation arrangements and the Action Plan i s provided inthe PIP.

     a. Gender Mainstreaming and Awareness Building: This component aims at mainstreaming gender
         in project designs and implementation modalities, at the same time creating genuine and long-
         lasting understanding on gender issues among the project stakeholders at all levels. This will be
         achieved through (i)gender sensitization training for all project managers and selected
         community leaders; (ii)   inclusion o f a full-time gender and youth specialist inthe national team;
         and (iii) gender-sensitive project ML&E.

     b. Ensuring; Women's Equitable Participation and Benefit Sharing:                This component aims at
         achieving women's equitable participation in and benefit sharing from the project. This will be
         done by internalizing gender aspects in the whole process o f community-level situation analysis,
         planning, implementation and monitoring, thus enabling the communities to regard gender as a
         positive factor for better economic and social relationships. Experience from VSHLI and the
         pilot phase indicates that up-front and unambiguous messages stressing the principles o f gender
         equity and need for their inclusion for the benefit o f the entire community create an enabling
         environment for women's participation.

     c. Providing; Special Assistance to the Most Vulnerable Women: Some women in the village are
         too poor and vulnerable to start up livelihood improvement activities. Requiring such women to
         fulfill (for example, widows and estranged wives with small children) the same conditions o f
         contributions would run a risk of malung them indebted and more vulnerable. The project will
         provide a one-time grant to such households, which can be utilized to finance income generating
         activities o f their choice. It is essential that identification o f such poorest and most vulnerable
         households i s done ina transparent way that ensures the communities' consensus and support for
         the neediest.

10.     Youth Empowerment Strategy and Action Plan: While the rural youth in Sri Lanka have
relatively highlevels of education and aspirations, they have limitedjob opportunities, social and political
powerlessness in the village societies, and cultural norms that discourage their active participation in
public activities and decision-malung. Experience from VSHLI and the pilot phase suggests that youth
can play a leadership role wherever there exists an enabling environment and where proper avenues to
realize their aspirations and interests are provided. The Youth empowerment strategy o f the project
focuses on the following sections. The detailed information about the implementation arrangements and
the Action Plan i s provided inthe PIP.


  0   Awareness Building on Youth Issues and Opportunities:            This component aims at increasing
      awareness on the constraints and opportunities o f the village youth, as well as importance o f their
      participation in the project. It is critical that both youth and adult members o f the communities
      discuss these issues openly and come to shared understandings, rather than the youth working
      separately from the mainstream decision making.


  0   Encouraging Youth Participation:        The project makes it a norm that all village organizations'
      committees include at least three youth members. This, however, has to be done on the basis o f the
      communities' understanding and appreciation that would be fostered by awareness building at the
      community level. Village Facilitators and supporting SOs will play the key role inthis at the time
      of establishment o f village organizations.


  0   Promotion o f Youth Income Generation Opportunities: The project will finance the promotion o f
      (i)partnerships with the private sector to develop innovative enterprises and (ii)    demand-driven
      vocational training facilities to link upjob opportunities for educated village youth.


  0   Improving Coping Skills o f the Youth: To improve the coping s l l l s o f the youth with distress, the
      Focal Point on Social Issues will ensure youth's access to professional services by making a list of
      agencies and qualified individuals for counseling and facilitating a coordination mechanism with
      them with support from gender and youth coordinator ofDFT.
