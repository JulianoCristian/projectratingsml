Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome (AIDS) Project for Benin were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)\n            studies conducted in Benin and other studies have confirmed\n            the positive impact of Projet Multisectoriel de Lutte contre\n            le VIH/SIDA (PPLS) in Benin. An important lesson here is\n            that persons infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS can be\n            reached through community mobilization and the use of\n            multiple channels. The process is demanding, as hundreds of\n            civil society organizations must be involved and trained,\n            and thousands of community-based groups established, and\n            nearly all government administrative infrastructures\n            engaged, but it can be done with good planning and\n            management and through innovative approaches. It is widely\n            accepted that Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) are\n            valuable tools of coordination and management in HIVIAIDS\n            activities. However, building up a nationwide and uniform\n            M&E system is much more demanding than project planners\n            usually acknowledge during the design process. It requires\n            much manpower (specialists and consultants), substantial\n            funds, and years of time. To ensure that everyone accepts a\n            uniform system, it helps to establish a steering committee\n            drawn from stakeholders including donor agencies; to\n            persuade some agencies to finance part of the process of\n            developing the M&E system; and to appoint United Nations\n            AIDS Program (UNAIDS) to chair the committee."}, "docdt": "2007-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
