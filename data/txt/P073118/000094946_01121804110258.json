In accordance with the main\n            goal of the MAP, the development objectives of the project\n            are to contribute to curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic\n            in Benin and to mitigating its impact for all those who are\n            infected or affected through 1) accelerating, intensifying,\n            diversifying, and empowering the response to civil society\n            and the public sector to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; and 2)\n            building capacity in both civil society and the public\n            sector to achieve and sustain this scaled-up response. The\n            project has three components: The first supports the\n            response of civil society by strengthening the institutional\n            capacities of community-based organizations and civil\n            society organizations, carrying out awareness campaigns,\n            training, and community sub-project preparation. It also\n            provides commuunity grants for executing sub-projects, and\n            financial support to civil service organizations for\n            executing prevention and care activities for communities.\n            The second component finances the response of the public\n            sector by supporting non-health sector action plans, or\n            health sector intervention/activities. The third component\n            supports project coordination, management and monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2001-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
