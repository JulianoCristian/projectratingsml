The\n            project is designed to test the viability of an integrated\n            private TW development program for increasing agricultural\n            production. To achieve this objective, the project consists\n            of: (i) a complete distribution network to extend\n            electricity to about 8,000 tubewells, and infrastructure for\n            the electrification of about 200 villages and 300\n            agroindustry units; (ii) improvement to watercourses; (iii)\n            technical assistance to ensure adequate back-up for the\n            implementing agencies and to provide training for the\n            project staff; and (iv) engineering and office equipment.\n            The installation of TWs will be financed by farmers by\n            availing of funds from an ongoing agricultural credit program."}, "docdt": "1989-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
