The project achieved most\n            of its objectives, sustainability is likely, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            reliable data is essential at the design stage. Second,\n            realistic forecasts of critical input prices, including\n            diesel oil and electricity, should be made during project\n            preparation. Third, there should be mechanisms at the\n            project level to continuously monitor and report changes in\n            economic conditions surrounding projects. Fourth, irrigation\n            projects involving farmer participation should have\n            provisions for promoting social organization/community\n            development, preferably through the inputs of\n            sociologists/anthropologists with the required expertise.\n            Fifth, future groundwater development projects should have a\n            built-in component for developing a regulatory framework to\n            ensure sustainability. Finally, in Pakistan, the Bank should\n            ensure consistency of the PC-1 with the SAR and legal documents."}, "docdt": "1996-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
