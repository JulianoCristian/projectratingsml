Project, located in one of the least developed areas of\n            Punjab province, is the first Government effort to\n            facilitate the development of new fresh groundwater areas\n            through intensive private tubewell (TW) installation. The\n            project is designed to test the viability of an integrated\n            private TW development program for increasing agricultural\n            production. To achieve this objective, the project consists\n            of: (i) a complete distribution network to extend\n            electricity to about 8,000 tubewells, and infrastructure for\n            the electrification of about 200 villages and 300\n            agroindustry units; (ii) improvement to watercourses; (iii)\n            technical assistance to ensure adequate back-up for the\n            implementing agencies and to provide training for the\n            project staff; and (iv) engineering and office equipment.\n            The installation of TWs will be financed by farmers by\n            availing of funds from an ongoing agricultural credit program."}, "docdt": "1989-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
