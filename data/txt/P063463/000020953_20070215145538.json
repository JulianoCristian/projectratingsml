Demonstration Project in Mexico were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included: 1) Adaptation of foreign\n            technology to local conditions needs to be taken into\n            account in the initial economic evaluation of a project; 2)\n            Owing to current Landfill Gas (LFG) legislation, additional\n            time is needed to process the corresponding permits and/or\n            contracts; 3) Future projects should seek more certainty on\n            the amount of available gas in order to avoid additional\n            cost once the plant is set up. Field measurements and\n            conservative mathematical model to estimate the gas amount\n            will help in that regard; 4) A continuous dissemination and\n            capacity building program is essential to sustain municipal\n            buy in; 5) The involvement of the private sector has been\n            very effective and proven feasible in a mainly public sector\n            domain. In the context of changing governments, the private\n            sector involvement helped ensure that the plant management\n            would be consistent and uninterrupted; 6) High energy prices\n            benefit LFG to power projects in Mexico and future energy\n            price scenarios should be taken into account while assessing\n            the feasibility of LFG to power projects; and 7) In future\n            many uncertainties while planning and setting up a LFG\n            facility can be overcome with the perspective of a long-term\n            and reliable revenue generated from emission reductions. The\n            availability of emission reductions revenues provides an\n            investor with more certainty on his investment and also\n            bears the possibility of addressing social and environmental\n            programs with part of the revenues."}, "docdt": "2007-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
