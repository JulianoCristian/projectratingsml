The project is expected to\n            significantly improve the environment, prevent gas\n            emissions, and reduce non-renewable energy consumption.\n            However, it is expected that during construction, adverse\n            environmental impacts will affect air pollution as a result\n            of dust, and generators' gas emissions; wastewater\n            discharges; and, eventually, oil spillage following the\n            installation of power generators; fire hazards; and, noise\n            disturbances. Mitigating measures suggest: 1) In accordance\n            with the country's environmental regulations, a burner\n            will be installed to eliminate exceeding bio-gas emissions,\n            and construction surfaces will be sprayed, maintaining an\n            adequate humidity to prevent dusting. 2) Wastewater\n            discharges will be controlled in accordance to standard\n            regulations, and solid wastes will be disposed of at\n            selected sanitary landfill sites, or recycled following the\n            appropriate sanitary treatment. Similarly, oil spills will\n            be stored, to be transported to pre-selected sites for final\n            disposal. 3) A methane detector will be installed to prevent\n            flammable gas concentrations, and potential fire hazards. 4)\n            Wall barriers will be installed, and protective equipment\n            available to mitigate noise disturbances. It is further\n            recommended that trees be planted around the construction\n            area, to minimize noise, and air pollution."}, "docdt": "2000-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
