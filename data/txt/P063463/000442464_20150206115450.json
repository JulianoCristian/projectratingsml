With World Bank assistance, the\n            Government of Mexico has initiated a program to address some\n            of the underlying causes of poor solid waste management. The\n            program is helping to introduce more effective practices and\n            incentives for solid waste management by strengthening\n            federal and local regulations and institutions. The program\n            will also help draw up a comprehensive recycling plan. As a\n            complement to this program, the global environmental\n            facility is financing a methane gas capture and use at a\n            landfill - demonstration project, based in the city of\n            Monterrey. This project will focus on incorporating landfill\n            gas capture and use into solid waste management practices.\n            It will result in immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."}, "docdt": "2006-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
