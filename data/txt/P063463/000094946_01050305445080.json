Demonstration Project, seeks to demonstrate a\n            proven technology for landfill gas (LFG) capture, and use,\n            and reduce barriers to development of future LFG projects.\n            Furthermore, it will demonstrate an institutional structure\n            for the implementation of LFG projects, with private sector\n            participation, and strengthen regulatory, and social\n            frameworks for LFG introduction in Mexico. Project\n            components call for: 1) funding provision for the design,\n            and construction of a LFG collection system, and power plant\n            at the Metropolitan Solid Waste Processing System\n            (SIMEPRODESO) landfill. Implementation of this facility will\n            be under a public-private partnership, which will include as\n            well the construction of methane monitoring wells; 2)\n            capacity building, to promote replication of the LFG\n            collection, and facility use. Training, workshops, and\n            information dissemination designed to build capacity of\n            government entities, and private contractors, in the\n            promotion, and management of LFG projects, will be funded,\n            as will the development of a national replication strategy;\n            3) technical assistance (TA) to identify legal, policy, and\n            regulatory reform necessary to LFG management; 4)\n            appropriate regional dissemination of the LFG design, and\n            experiences gained from the project, mainly through\n            workshops, and, in addition, funds will be provided to\n            develop twinning arrangements, including capacity building;\n            and, 5) project management, supervision, and monitoring support."}, "docdt": "2001-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
