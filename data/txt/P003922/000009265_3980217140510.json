Development\n            Project (SIJUDP) in Indonesia. The objectives of the SIJUDP\n            were: (a) to provide urban infrastructure in selected cities\n            in Sulawesi and Irian Jaya with emphasis on increased access\n            of households to water supply and sanitation services; (b)\n            to support improved infrastructure programming and financial\n            planning in the Sulawesi cities, especially, to support the\n            development of local government capacity to prepare and\n            execute annual Operations and Maintenance (O&M)\n            programs; and (c) to encourage local government and water\n            enterprise (PDAM) revenue generation and improved financial\n            management. Bank performance was marginally satisfactory.\n            Borrower performance was marginally satisfactory. The most\n            important lessons of the project were: (i) it is essential\n            to pay particular attention to the selection of\n            sub-projects, the criteria applied for that selection, and\n            the procedures for the economic and financial analyses of\n            the projects; (ii) much more emphasis should be placed on\n            proper O&M of already funded investments; timely\n            hand-over of sub-projects on completion; community\n            involvement in service delivery; and improved contracting\n            procedures; (iii) the PDAMs need to be more involved in\n            project design and implementation to ensure their full\n            understanding of the systems; (iv) modest, yet urgent,\n            efforts are essential for basic sanitation improvements\n            which must include community education and local\n            participation; (v) should include enhanced\n            professionalization, better land use and service delivery\n            planning in municipal management with primary emphasis on\n            'service delivery'. (vi)local governments should\n            not expect financial contributions from PDAMs regardless of\n            their financial capability; (vii) the relative isolation of\n            the project sites, particularly in Irian Jaya, illustrates\n            the difficulties associated with government decentralization\n            initiatives, building institutional capacity and\n            construction quality improvements; (viii) broad strategic\n            consensus on how to best help local governments through a\n            blend of investments, technical assistance, changes to\n            incentives, and other types of assistance; and (ix) to see\n            capacity building as an environment in which they work\n            (e.g., incentive structures) and linkages between various\n            government agencies, government levels and the community."}, "docdt": "1997-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
