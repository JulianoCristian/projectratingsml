Second Jabotabek Urban Development\n            Project in the Republic of Indonesia. The project's\n            main objectives were to develop and implement a coordinated\n            program of physical investments, technical assistance and\n            policies for urban water supply, waste water disposal,\n            drainage and water resource/quality management which would:\n            (a) balance the existing production capacity with that of\n            the transmission and distribution facilities; (b) increase\n            piped water supply to about 50 percent of the population;\n            (c) result in improved service for the poor through\n            construction of standpipes and removal of monopoly water\n            sale by vendors; (d) improve waste water disposal; (e)\n            strengthen management, staffing and financial viability of\n            water supply and sewerage institutions; and (f) strengthen\n            Jabotabek water resource planning capabilities. Bank\n            performance during Project identification, preparation and\n            appraisal was satisfactory. Borrower Performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows (a)\n            good quality preparation is key for successful\n            implementation; (b) project performance cannot be improved\n            simply through the provision of Technical Assistance (TA)\n            and training; and (c) agencies that cannot submit timely\n            audit reports by Government auditors should be requested to\n            engage private auditors to meet this requirement."}, "docdt": "1998-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
