The objectives of the Second\n            Jabotabek Urban Development Project are to develop and\n            implement a program of physical investments, technical\n            assistance and policies for urban water supply, waste water\n            disposal, drainage and water resource/quality management\n            which : a) balances the existing treatment capacity with\n            required transmission and distribution networks; b)\n            increases the piped water supply from 28 percent to 56\n            percent of the population; c) results in improved service\n            for the urban poor through construction of standpipes; d)\n            improves waste water disposal and drainage; e) strengthens\n            management, staffing and financial viability of water supply\n            and sewerage institutions and f) strengthens water resources\n            planning capabilities.  These objectives will be achieved\n            through : 1) the PDAM Jaya System Improvement Project\n            including primary distribution facilities, extension of\n            service mains and institutional improvements; b) the raw\n            water pipeline to Pejompongan; 3) the treated water\n            transmission main; 4) priority drainage and flood control\n            components in Jakarta; 5) technical assistance for water\n            resources management, institutional development, and\n            planning and pricing studies; and 6) reduce water related\n            environmental pollution in Jakarta."}, "docdt": "1990-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
