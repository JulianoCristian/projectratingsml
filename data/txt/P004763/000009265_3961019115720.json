(b) achieve a\n            better integration of the national grid so that optimal\n            generating options may be chosen in future without being\n            unduly restricted by regional constraints; (c) reduce\n            reserve margin for the system as a whole; and (d) upgrade\n            the existing load dispatch centers into a state-of-the-art\n            countrywide control system.  Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) EGAT readily\n            accesses expertise and resources from consultants when it is\n            not available amongst its ranks; (ii) to complete projects\n            rapidly and efficiently, executing institutions need to\n            anticipate problems and obtain environmental and other\n            clearances prior to project preparation; and (iii) the\n            attrition of experienced staff need to be reversed through\n            appropriate programs, including better compensation and\n            reinforced training programs."}, "docdt": "1995-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
