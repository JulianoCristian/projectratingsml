1.    The closing date for Armenia, Urban Heating PROJECT, Credit No 4102-AM,
P057880 will be extended from December 31, 2010 until June 1, 2011.

2.      The implementation of all of the project components is essentially completed. The
project has successfully met all the outcome targets. There are savings under the "school
heating" component of the project.

3.     The proposed extension is necessary to utilize the savings under the "school
heating" component and rehabilitate the heating systems of two additional schools.

4.    This will be the second extension of the project closing date, which will result in a
cumulative extension of eleven months from the project's original closing date.
