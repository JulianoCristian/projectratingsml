Some lessons learned includes: creation of\n            enabling environment for effective and safe provision of\n            heating services is important for ensuring sustainability of\n            project achievements. Well targeted, demand-driven\n            output-based capital subsidies can be effective but timely\n            implementation of such a scheme requires early preparatory\n            work and flexibility of procurement. Implementation of\n            credit lines is successful when the funds are allocated\n            transparently, financing terms are commercially determined\n            and there is competition among the Participating Financial\n            Institutions (PFIs). The on-lending funds were not earmarked\n            for PFIs, which resulted healthy competition among financial\n            institutions. Further, the PFIs had freedom to determine the\n            lending terms for the sub-loans while assuming full credit\n            risk, which helped the PFIs to develop their own due\n            diligence skills required for provision of heating\n            sub-loans. Energy efficiency measures coupled with\n            rehabilitation of heating systems substantially increase the\n            sustainability of heating investments. The schools, where\n            basic energy efficiency measures were implemented in\n            addition to rehabilitation of the heating systems saw\n            significant decrease of their energy bills. This contributes\n            to sustainability of safe and clean heating given rising\n            natural gas prices. Collective heating solutions may be hard\n            to implement even if those are the least-cost option. The\n            ability of communities for self-mobilization when dealing\n            with heat service providers is overestimated. Consumers\n            often assign higher value to their autonomy and ability to\n            make decisions independently and, thus, prefer individual\n            heating solutions even if those are more expensive than\n            collective heating option. This is particularly noticeable\n            in communities with mixed income levels, where service\n            standard expectations are different."}, "docdt": "2011-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
