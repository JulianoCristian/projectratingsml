                         monitoring survey suggest that 70.9% of households in multi-apartment buildings have safe gas-based heating, compared to the project target of 50%. The number of CO poisonings,
                         fires and explosions reduced further, reaching 10.4 accidents per 10,000 gas connections in 2010, compared to project target of 20. All of the schools with rehabilitated heating

                         systems and the residents of multi-apartment buildings who benefited from heating sub-loans, as well as 82.4% of the beneficiary urban poor were satisfied with heating conditions,
                         compared to the project target of 80%.

                         The implementation of the technical assistance component is completed. The TA component supported addressing gaps in gas safety regulations, strengthening the capacity of the
                         private sector, and public outreach to raise awareness about the benefits of clean and safe heating and about the available heating technologies.

                         The implementation of the on-lending component is completed. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate dollar amount of heating projects financed by the R2E2 Fund, participating
                         financial institutions and co-financed by the beneficiaries was US$ 9.04 million compared to the project target of US$ 4.2 million.

                         The school heating component has already achieved the revised project target. As of December 31, 2010, the total number of schools with improved heating systems was 117. By
                         the project closing date, the total number of schools with rehabilitated heating systems will exceed the project target of 117 schools.

                         The implementation of the 'capital grants to the poor' component is completed. As of December 31, 2010, the total number of urban poor with verified service delivery was 8,013
                         compared to the project target of 8,000.
