It is highlighted that\n            while in principle, the project design, neglected short-term\n            upgrade of urban areas in favor of the preparation of a\n            long-term infrastructure investment plan, it proved a sound\n            and valid approach. However, the project revealed the limits\n            of the community-based approach to addressing broader urban\n            development, and management issues. Future operations should\n            consider the following lessons to make project impacts more\n            sustainable and replicable. For the project to scale up its\n            impact, a participatory investment program should have been\n            combined with a comprehensive support, and capacity building\n            program for municipalities. In the future, operations should\n            rather expand from narrowly defined community-based\n            infrastructure development, to broader municipal operations.\n            Particular attention should be given to strengthening urban\n            regulatory functions, e.g., preparation of urban plans and\n            definition of building permit procedures, all of which aim\n            to promote, guide, regulate, and support private sector\n            development. Noticeably, any follow-up project should have a\n            substantially larger component for upgrading primary\n            infrastructure. Project experience made it clear that land\n            tenure issues in peri-urban areas are complex, and involve\n            serious social and political implications, and, it is not\n            within the jurisdiction of the municipalities. Therefore,\n            there may be a need for a separate project, specifically\n            focusing on land tenure, and land registration aspects."}, "docdt": "2005-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
