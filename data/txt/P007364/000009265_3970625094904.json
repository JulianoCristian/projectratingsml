for\n            municipal development.  To this end, the project will\n            finance professional services to help BANMA strengthen its\n            institutional capacity.  A secondary objective is to\n            strengthen the financial management of those BANMA clients\n            which account for the largest portion of BANMA's\n            operational performance and require increasing financial\n            assistance from the Central Government.  For the group of\n            municipalities selected for participating in the project,\n            financing will be provided for:  (a) professional services\n            to strengthen municipal financial management, including\n            revenue collection, budgeting, cost control, accounting,\n            debt management, and planning and execution of investment\n            projects.  It will also provide; (b) credit for pilot\n            investments in four municipalities; and (c) a pre-investment\n            fund for feasibility studies.  Finally, the project will\n            finance professional services for CONSUPLANE for\n            strengthening its capacity in urban and regional planning."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
