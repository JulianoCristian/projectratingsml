PROJECT", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "4096", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated as\n            satisfactory, and project sustainability is rated, likely.\n            Overall Borrower performance is satisfactory: Despite some\n            problems noted in the report, the Ministry of Public Finance\n            (MPG) in particular, maintained a strong interest in the\n            progress of the report, assisted in resolving many of the\n            financial issues that arose during implementation. The\n            Ministry of Education and Research (MER), legally designated\n            as the implementation agency, despite two changes in\n            Government as part of the regular election schedule in 1996\n            and 2000, and three changes in ministers of education,\n            remained actively engaged in resolving issues raised by\n            supervision missions. World Bank performance, overall, was\n            satisfactory: From sector work to supervision, the Bank\n            provided adequate teams with a range of expertise in higher\n            education reform issues. The dialogue with the Government\n            and project agency team was a productive one, acknowledging\n            areas of initial policy disagreement and working through the\n            analysis to reach agreement, as incorporated into the letter\n            of sector development policy of the Government and the\n            Policy Matrix of the Project. Other lessons to be\n            highlighted include the following: 1) The extensive sector\n            work with significant involvement of the local academic\n            community, the MER and the MPF, provides a positive lesson\n            on the role of sector work in analysis and identification of\n            sector issues. This could not have been done without a PHRD\n            grant. This also helps to address the political risks\n            inherent in the reform process and to build up enough\n            support in the face of some opposing constituencies. Second,\n            the policy matrix proved important for providing support for\n            long-term reform measures by ensuring that the progress on\n            policy issues and actions were discussed regularly during\n            supervision missions and difficulties and problems in taking\n            policy actions could be explored. A unique feature of this\n            project compared to most higher education competitive funds\n            was the involvement of supervision missions in ex-ante\n            reviews of the criteria and procedures as applied in the\n            competitions by the councils. The purpose was to review a\n            sample of accepted and rejected grant proposals, and to see\n            how the councils applied the criteria and procedures. This\n            ex-ante review of the grants award process increased project\n            sustainability. Fourth, early agreement on allocation of 50\n            percent of the grants to new, priority areas proved to be\n            highly beneficial since more traditional areas were more\n            powerful and would have been the winners of all the grants.\n            Fifth, the special round of competition targeted at young\n            researchers proved successful ans has been incorporated in\n            the research grants competitions run by the Multi-User\n            research Center (MURC) out of the government's budget.\n            Sixth, seed grants and major grants were beneficial since\n            they provided the chance to try out new ideas in pilot\n            stages and develop these ideas into major projects."}, "docdt": "2003-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
