Specific project objectives are to: 1)\n            improve the capacity of the recently formed higher education\n            councils and the individual institutions to fulfill their\n            responsibilities in the reform strategy; 2) develop the new\n            undergraduate and continuing education programs demanded by\n            the transition to a market economy; and 3) develop the new\n            postgraduate education and research training needed to\n            supply the next generation of academic staff in high demand\n            fields of study, and the professionals with advanced\n            training in the new fields demanded by the transition to a\n            market economy. The project will consist of the following\n            components: 1) management capacity improvement, including\n            management of the higher education councils, institutions\n            and the information systems; 2) undergraduate and continuing\n            education, comprising the university, college and continuing\n            education programs; and 3) postgraduate education and\n            research, including multi-user research centers."}, "docdt": "1996-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
