                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project's development objective is to increase the access of Senegal's rural population to modern energy services and to ensure the environmental and social
                         sustainability of woodfuels in urban and peri-urban areas.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The program will have a positive environmental impact at the global and local levels. At the global level, it will help reduce net CO2 emissions. At the local level, it will
                         promote conservation by encouraging the use of: (i) renewable sources of energy; (ii) efficient lamps and improved cooking stoves; (iii) improved carbonization methods
                         and improved woodfuel stoves. It will also continue implementation of sustainable forest and natural resource management which will also reduce deforestation.
                         Has the Global Environmental Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite the recent reconfirmation by the Government of SENEGAL in pursing current public-private based rural electrification concept, (letter from the Minister of State, Karim Wade
                         of October 14, 2011), the Senegal – Electricity Services for Rural Areas Project still suffers a very slow and difficult implementation.

                         The Senegal's Rural Electrification Agency (ASER), in charge of the implementation of the project, has seen its image particularly deteriorated in recent years mainly because of
                         delays in the implementation of the rural electrification program, the judicial proceedings against some staff of ASER, including the former General Manager, and too much attention
                         given to the emergency program financed by public funds to electrify some villages but with little impact and few additional subscribers, the latter to the detriment of donor funded
                         rural electrification concessions program.

                         ASER has already an existing ERPA with CDCF for the period through 2015. The UCF T2 ERPA provides for the purchase of additional CERs for another 3 years (2016-2018),
                         allowing the project to get additional revenues. A second ERPA, UCF T2 for the Promotion of Energy-efficient lighting using compact fluorescent light bulbs in rural areas in Senegal
                         has been signed in November.
