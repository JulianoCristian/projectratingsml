                         The project's development objective is to increase the access of Senegal's rural population to modern energy services and to ensure the environmental and
                         social sustainability of woodfuels in urban and peri-urban areas.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The program will have a positive environmental impact at the global and local levels. At the global level, it will help reduce net CO2 emissions. At the local
                         level, it will promote conservation by encouraging the use of: (i) renewable sources of energy; (ii) efficient lamps and improved cooking stoves; (iii) improved
                         carbonization methods and improved woodfuel stoves. It will also continue implementation of sustainable forest and natural resource management which will
                         also reduce deforestation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A Bank supervision mission took place recently with the following main findings:

                         ASER's image (the Rural electrification agency) particularly deteriorated in recent years mainly because of delays in the implementation of the rural electrification program, and also
                         the judicial proceedings against some staff of ASER, including the former General Manager and too much attention given to the emergency program financed by public funds to
                         electrify some villages but with little impact and few additional subscribers, the latter to the detriment of donor funded rural electrification concessions program.

                         In order for ASER to regain its credibility, a specific and detailed action plan has been prepared during the mission in order to : (i) put in place a more efficient and proactive internal
                         reorganization, as well as an updated procedures manual, including more adequate staffing tailored to its current and future roles. The new role for ASER should be to accompany
                         the concessionaires by helping them solve any problems uncounted between them and the national utility (SENELEC), the regulatory commission, and other institutions involved in
                         project implementation. ASER should be also playing a control, monitoring, and evaluation role for the program. A better communication system needs to be put in place, and the
                         best way to go about it is to provide access to electricity to some rural population which is planned by end of April 2011.

                         The mission was also the occasion for the government to restate his engagement in pursing current public-private based rural electrification concept and is fully committed to do what
                         is needed to have it succeed ­ all difficulties have been identified and included in the action plan.

                         By the end of the year, the program should be back on track with six concessions awarded and studies ongoing for the remaining four concessions.

                         As the project is closing in December 2012, the Bank team and the client have decided, in order to accelerate disbursement, on a new mechanism. A level 2 restructuration will
                         probably be necessary.

                         Regarding the other components of the project, the implementation of the small village based concessions (ERILs) is still lagging and a final decision to either cancel or maintain it will
                         be taken by mid-March 2011. The multisectoral (PREMs) program is under implementation, and additional financing (through Russian TF) is under preparation.
