                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The project's development objective is to increase the access of Senegal's rural population to modern energy services and to ensure the environmental and social
                         sustainability of woodfuels in urban and peri-urban areas.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The program will have a positive environmental impact at the global and local levels. At the global level, it will help reduce net CO2 emissions. At the local level, it will
                         promote conservation by encouraging the use of: (i) renewable sources of energy; (ii) efficient lamps and improved cooking stoves; (iii) improved carbonization methods
                         and improved woodfuel stoves. It will also continue implementation of sustainable forest and natural resource management which will also reduce deforestation.
                         Has the Global Environmental Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Delay was noted in project implementation as well as a low disbursement rate. This was mainly due to internal constraints within ASER and to insufficient collaboration of other
                         project participating entities. Action was taken to overcome these constraints and project implementation has improved. Negotiation of the second concession was completed and
                         awaiting signature between the Government and the selected concessionaire STEG. Based on the progress made in project implementation in 2012 and the good perspectives
                         towards the achievement of most project indicators, the rating of the project will be improved to MS.

                         Carbone project associated: ASER has already an existing ERPA with CDCF for the period through 2015. The UCFT2 ERPA provides for the purchase of additional CERs for another
                         3 years (2016-2018), allowing the project to get additional revenues. A second ERPA, UCF T2 for the Promotion of Energy-efficient lighting using compact fluorescent light bulbs in
                         rural areas in Senegal has been signed in November 2011.
