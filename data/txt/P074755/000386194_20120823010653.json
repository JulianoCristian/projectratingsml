"Ratings for the State Judicial\n            Modernization Supporting Access to Justice Project for\n            Mexico were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was low; Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: institutional reform projects in\n            upper-middle income countries may be implemented directly by\n            line agencies, sometimes with the support of other agencies\n            experienced in Bank procedures. In the justice sector where\n            there is limited experience in the management of\n            international cooperation, specialized Project Coordination\n            Units (PCUs) staffed by experts with strong technical and\n            professional qualifications have been the standard\n            implementing arrangement. Access components in public sector\n            projects may provide an appropriate interface between State\n            institutions and vulnerable groups. While focusing on\n            internal strengthening, institutional reforms should also\n            pay attention to demands of users or potential users, in\n            particular from vulnerable groups. To measure project\n            success or failure, indicators are critical and should be\n            chosen carefully and in the early stages of the project\n            cycle. Major cancellations and/or reallocations impacting\n            the Project Development Objective (PDO) and results\n            framework must be accompanied by comprehensive\n            restructurings. The completion of the processing of a\n            restructuring close to two years after a major\n            cancellation/reallocation took place reveals a critical\n            shortcoming during supervision. A realistic assessment of\n            justice sector issues at the early stages of the preparation\n            process is essential as a basis for quality project design.\n            Project design should be based on a solid institutional\n            assessment process that engages a range of justice sector\n            stakeholders, not only justice operators. Justice projects\n            should be structured around a problem-solving strategy and\n            should engage all actors required to implement a solution.\n            Civil society's participation is critical at all stages\n            of design and implementation of justice projects. Through\n            the advocacy role of civil society organizations, citizens\n            are given a voice in the process of formulating public\n            policies in relevant areas of institutional reform. Support\n            to infrastructure refurbishment should be considered when it\n            is linked to changes in core management processes and\n            functions. While justice institutions may need modern\n            buildings, equipment and ICT technology, the essence of\n            justice sector reform is institutional change."}, "docdt": "2012-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
