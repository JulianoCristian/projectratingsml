                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Development Objective (DO) of the Project is to support the improvement of institutional performance of judiciaries in a few states through BANOBRAS's
                         credit program for state judicial modernization by learning while doing. In these states, the Project would: (a) strengthen institutional capabilities, organizational
                         culture and knowledge; (b) strengthen efficiency and effectiveness of judicial services; (c) improve judicial transparency; (d) increase access to justice; and (e)
                         support Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and learning, including consultation with Project stakeholders.
