In these states, the\n            Project will support four components to: (a) strengthen\n            institutional capabilities, organizational culture and\n            knowledge diffusion; (b) strengthen efficiency and\n            effectiveness of judicial services; (c) improve judicial\n            transparency; and (d) increase access to justice for all\n            users; as well as support Project coordination, monitoring\n            and evaluation, and learning, including consultation with\n            Project stakeholders. In future projects, additional state\n            judiciaries would benefit. The Project would fund\n            subprojects or separate projects in \"participating\n            states.\" Each of these subprojects would be complete in\n            themselves, consisting of the design and implementation of\n            integrated state judicial branch modernization plans\n            consistent with the Project's objective."}, "docdt": "2004-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
