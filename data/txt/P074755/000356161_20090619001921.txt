IntroductoryStatement

1.      This Project Paper (PP) seeks the approval o f the Regional Vice President (RVP)
to introduce the following changes in the Mexico State Judicial Modernization
Supporting Access to Justice Project (Loan No. 7250-ME; P074755) and the
accompanying amendmentsto the Project's legal documents.

2.      The proposed changes include: (i)           the adoption o f country financing parameters;
(ii) reallocationofmostoftheproceedsoftheLoantoworksandgoods; (iii)
    the                                                                                                   the
extension o f the Closing Date to December 31,2011;(iv) an increase in the amount o f
the Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account to $6 million to expedite
disbursements; (v) the modificationo f the periodicity o f Financial Management Reports
(FMRs) submission from quarterly to semiannual; and (vi) the eliminationofComponent
Eofthe Project: "Project coordination, monitoringandevaluation, andlearning".

BackgroundandReasonsfor Restructuring

3.      The State Judicial Modernization Supporting Access to Justice Project (the
Project) i s financed by a US$30 million loan to Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios
Pziblicos S.N.C -BANOBRAS (the Borrower) under a Loan Agreement dated November
21, 2005 (the Loan Agreement.). The UnitedMexican States (the Guarantor) executed a
GuaranteeAgreement on the same day. The Loan Agreement and GuaranteeAgreements
became effective as o f January 25, 2006. However, due to unexpected implementation
delays', the Project has not been able to disburse any loanproceedssince effectiveness.

4.           The Project Development Objective (PDO) o f the project i s to support the
improvement of institutional performance o f judiciaries in selected states through
BANOBRAS's credit program for state judicial modernization by learning while doing.
The PDO was supposed to be achieved through the implementation o f five (05)
components: (a) strengthening institutional capabilities, organizational culture and
knowledge; (b) improving efficiency andeffectiveness o fjudicial services; (c) increasing
judicial transparency; (d) strengthening access to justice for all users; and (e) project
coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and learning. The Project would fund
'As recorded   inthe aide-memous of the recent supervisionmissions, the delays experienced inProject
implementation are basically associated with: (a) financial terms o f the sub-loans that State Governments
considered too high; (b) BANOBRAS' lack o f expertise and institutional capacity to market a judicial
reformproject; and (c) failure to coordinate with the states' executive branches that take financial decisions
about sub-loans resulted in very limited support from the State executives in allocating debt resources to
the Judicial modernizationplan.


                                                     3

Subprojects--essentially the design and implementation of integrated statejudicial branch
modernization plans--that are consistent with the Project's components (a), (b), (c), and
(d) noted above. Key performance indicators (outcome/impact) are: (i)improved
information development for institutionalplanningand external services; (ii)   reduction in
case processing times; (iii)  increased availability o f public information; (iv) increased
opportunities for community engagement; (v) increases in number o f users from
vulnerable groups accessing judicial services; and (vi) improved application o f project
know-how and skills through learning processes.

5.      Sixteen (16) State Modernization Plans were prepared between 2003 and 2006
(during preparation and immediately after effectiveness). BANOBRAS and the Bank's
Task Team were optimistic that at least 3 to 5 sub-loans would be signed shortly after
Board approval. That assumption proved unrealistic. Most Plans had been prepared by
the State Judiciaries with Bank assistance, but the State Governments had not been
involvedandwere hesitant to incur debt to finance investments uponwhich they hadlittle
or no control. However, after serious delays in implementation the Government and the
Judiciary o f the DF confirmed their interest in a substantial portion o f the whole Loan
(about $15 million out o f $30) and started the process to formalize an agreement as early
as November 2006. At that point, the strained political relationship between the DF
Government with the Federal Government made impossible to fulfill the conditions
precedent to the signing o f the respective sub-loan (specifically, the clearance o f the
FederalMinistryo fFinance     - SHCP).

6.      A new Bank Task Team took over supervision responsibilities inJuly 2007 and
explored with BANOBRAS various options to activate the project, the most feasible (in
spite o f the opposing political allegiances) being to unblock the agreement between the
DF andBANOBRAS, while reignitingthe interest ofother States. Somepromisinginitial
steps had been taken when in October 2007, during the Annual Convention of the
Mexican Association o f Judicial Officials (AMIJ), President Calder6n instructed
BANOBRAS to promptly move ahead with the implementation o f the World Bank's
loan for State Judicial Modernization. In order to comply with President's instructions,
the Secretary o f Finance has designated high-level officials to personally follow up the
activation process within Secretaria de Hacienda y Crkdito Pziblico - SHCP in close
coordination with BANOBRAS, the DF Government and any other interested State
Government.

7.      As a result of the joint work o f SHCP, BANOBRAS and the Bank's Task Team,
the sub-loan agreement between BANOBRAS and the DF is ready for final approval.
This sub-loan will support the implementation of key elements o f the DF's judicial
modernization plan, in particular the installation o f an integrated case management
information system that should improve the quality and timeliness o f service delivery for
the justice users of a national capital metropolitan area with a populationo f more than 8
million. The main requirement for this sub-loan to be entered into (a satisfactory cost-
benefit analysis) has already been complied with and cleared by SHCP. A draft sub-loan
agreement has already beenprepared, and agreedinprinciple.




                                              4

8.      In order to proceed with the signing of the referred sub-loan, and to make the
Project more attractive to other potential sub-borrowers, BANOBRAShas requestedthe
Bank to modify some aspects of the original design (basically, some implementation
arrangements that should expedite disbursements). It has also requested to eliminate
Component E of the Project, originally envisaged to support some activities for
BANOBRAS that could bebetter carried out by other partners like the AMIJ.

ProposedChanges

9.       The proposed modifications will require an amendment to the Loan Agreement
(LA). Such amendment will not affect the Project's Development Objectives (DO), nor
does it imply changes in project design. Likewise, no changes to the key performance
indicators are being proposed. However, due to BANOBRAS decision not to carry out
Component E of the Project -a complete component will be eliminated - hence,
according to the Bank's Guidelines "Processing Restructuring on Investment Projects",
the amendment proposal hasto be approved bythe RVP.

10.      Countw -financina parameters                  (disbursement percentages), Reallocation,
Extension qf the Closing Date. In order to facilitate project implementation in Mexico,
the Bank has approved country financing parameters that allow an increase up to 100
percent for the Bank share of financing o f project. To take advantage o f this option not
available at the time o f LA signing, BANOBRAS has requested that the financing
percentagesbe set at 100%for eachCategory inTable 3 o fAnnex 1.

11.      Because o f the delays in project start up, and the main features o f the proposed
Federal District Subproject, it i s proposed also to: (i)            reallocate most o f the proceeds o f
the Loanto works and goods, as most sub-nationals are not interested or allowed to use
debt to finance consultants' services or training; (ii)           extend the ClosingDateto December
31, 2011 to match the implementation timetable o f the proposed subproject (DF
Judiciary) and continue the marketingo f this credit line with other sub-nationals; and (iii)
increasethe amount o f the Authorized Allocation o f the Special Account to $6 million to
expedite disbursements under a work program that will comprise a few bigworks, goods
and services contracts with substantial advances; and (iv) modify the periodicity o f
FMRs' submission from quarterly to semiannual, as per LCSFM's recommendation.

12.      Component E: Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Learning.
According to the project description, Component E would originally finance two (02)
main activities: (i)    overall support to the carrying out o f Judicial ModernizationPlansY2;



  Including: (a) the strengthening o f the coordination, monitoring and evaluation capabilities o f the
Participating States, through the establishment and operation o f a PCU ineach Participating State and the
provision of training for PCU staff; (b) the development of project administration, financial management
andprocurement administration capabilities for Project staff; (c) the development and organization o f inter
and intra State knowledge sharing programs to promote good practices, the results and lessons learned
during the implementation o f the Judicial Modernization Plans, in partnership with NCSC and other
relevant institutions; and (d) the development o f strategic actions and the carrying out o f studies which may
contribute to the development o f sector-wide judicial modernization.


                                                        5

and (ii) strengthening of the Borrower's capability (at the central andregional levels)
         the
to supervisethe Subprojects andpromote learning among Participating States3.

13.      However, due to BANOBRAScurrent organizational structure (no specific unit i s
in charge of monitoring and evaluating judicial reforms) and internal financial policies
(no external debt can be used for monitoring and evaluation activities), BANOBRAS i s
not in a position to implement Component E as part o f the Project and with Bank
financing. The original partner envisaged for these activities (Comisidn Nacional de
Tribunales Superiores de Justicia - NCSC) has a limited capacity to contribute to the
proposed activities and the Asociacidn Mexicana de Impartidores de Justicia                   - AMIJ has
expressedinterest inbecomingan additional partner o f BANOBRAS inthe execution o f
these activities. AMIJ i s a civil association governed by Mexican public law, and has the
technical and economic capacity to carry out such responsibilities. However, the Bank
and BANOBRAS believe that these strategic partnerships should be handled separately
through memorandums o f understanding, and should not be financed out o f the proceeds
o fthe Loaninorder to preserve the independenceofthe external partners.

14.      The activities included in Component E remain highly relevant for the overall
judicial reform process inMexico, and each StateJudiciary will carry out monitoring and
evaluation through the line units in charge o f implementing the Judicial Modernization
Plans pursuant to the provisions o f the Credit Agreement4-Participation Agreement to be
entered into between BANOBRAS and each sub-national. The general monitoring and
evaluation unit o f BANOBRAS will conduct the supervision o f such activities in
accordance with the standard practice for all BANOBRAS sub-loans made out o f the
proceeds o f a Bank loan (an area in which BANOBRAS has a solid track record). The
Bank Task Team will coordinate its own monitoring and evaluation activities with
BANOBRAS andwith the Participating Sates. Therefore, the eliminationofPart E ofthe
Project will not have any impact on the PDO, as the Bank and BANOBRAS will follow
their usual monitoring and evaluation policies and procedures (the relevant covenants in
the LoanAgreement will remaininfull force and effect) but will allow the reallocation o f
a significant amount o f the proceeds o f the Loan (more than US$4 million) from this
component to Component B (Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness o f Judicial
Services) which i s the core o f Judicial Modernization Plans. Instead o f establishing new
units or committees in BANOBRAS or the Participating States, the institutional
strengthening/monitoring and evaluation activities o f the State Judiciaries originally
envisagedincomponent Ewill beincluded as part o fthe Judicial ModernizationPlans, or
as legally bindingcovenants inthe Credit-Participation Agreements for the sub-nationals
to carry out such activities with their own resources in case they face the same constraint
o fBANOBRAS regardingthe use o fexternal debt for these purposes.

31ncluding: (a) the carrying out of semi-annual Project monitoring and evaluation reviews and the
dissemination o f the results o f such reviews; and (b) the provision o f technical assistance for: (i)  the
identification o f new States interested in participating under the Project, and the preparation o f Judicial
Modernization Plans for such States; and (ii)    the preparation o f future projects aimed at supporting the
implementation o fJudicial Modernization Plans not financed under the Project.

4These credit agreements do not refer to IDAs lending instruments but to sub-loans to be made by
BANOBRAS out o fthe proceeds ofthe BankLoan.

13.     Consequently, the proposed restructuring involves a reduction in the number o f
components from five to four; see Table 1 below for further details. The scope o f the
remaining components will remain as originally envisaged. All costs saved as a
consequence o f the elimination o f Component E, will be allocated to Component B:
Improving efficiency and effectiveness o f judicial services The restructured project
would finance the following four components: (a)             Strengthening Institutional
Capabilities, Culture and Knowledge; (b) Increasing Efficiency and Effectiveness o f
Judicial Services; (c) Increasing Judicial Transparency; and (d) Strengthening o f Access
to Justice for all Users.

14.     ImDlementation arrangements. As explained before, some implementation
arrangements have been included as part o f the restructuring, in order to expedite
disbursements.The proposed changesdo not involve any exceptions to Bank policies:

    0    Transfer Agreements. According to the LA, each Participating State should enter
        into a Transfer Agreement with the State Judiciary, by which the proceeds o f the
         sub-loans be transferred. Such requirement will be removed because other
        budgetary mechanisms could expedite the transfer o f resources. Instead, more
         flexible Implementation Agreements (IA) will be entered into to allow budgetary
    '   mechanisms/arrangementsto beusedto effect such transfers.

        Letter sf Intent. According to the LA each Subproject Agreement should include
         among the legal documentation a Letter of Intent' in order to receive a Credit
         fi-om BANOBRAS. However, this document i s no longer required as sixteen (16)
         States have already prepared a Judicial Modernization Plan. Direct contacts
        between the State representatives o f BANOBRAS and the States' Executive and
         Judiciary Branches suffice to determine the interest o f each State inthis operation,
         and such interest will materialize in the negotiation and signing of the relevant
         Credit Agreements. Instead, legally binding covenants will be used to determine
         the parties' obligations either in the main body or in the annexes to the Credit

         Intent.

        Establishment and structure of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU).According
         to the implementation arrangements o f the LA, each Participating State should
         establish a PCU in order to carry out project coordination. However, such
         arrangement is not always feasible or desirable in most States; since it increases
         the costs for the Participating States (new units and committees have to be
         established). The establishment of PCUs i s not consistent either with the current
         Bank practice to entrust implementation responsibilities to the line units of the
         implementing agencies in order to build capacity in such agencies. BANOBRAS
         has also requested building up on the existing organizational structure o f the
         Judiciary o f each State, in order to avoid establishing new special
         units/committees, and keeping costs low. Even in cases where PCUs may be
         acceptable, their organizational structure should be kept as simple as possible, to
         the minimum required to conduct effective coordination between BANOBRAS
         and StateJudiciary. As StateJudiciaries vary substantially insize and complexity,
         it is hard to establish in advance a "one-size-fits-all" in the LA and this matter
         should be deferred to the particular agreements to be entered into between
         BANOBRAS andthe respective State.




  "Letter of Intent" meant the legal document sent by a State to BANOBRAS, confirming the State's
intention to obtainfinancing fiom the BANOBRAS underthe Credit Program.

15.    Proiect Cost and Financing. The proposed restructuring would result in
adjustments in the project costs and financing plan, and would require a reallocation o f
the Loan proceeds. The total project cost and Loan amount will remain unchanged. The
proposed changes do not have a significant effect on the original economic, financial,
technical or institutional aspects (Annex I contains a revised project cost by component
andthe proposed allocation of Loanproceedsonthe undisbursedbalance).

Analysis

16.    None o f the proposed changes has a major effect on the original economic,
financial, technical, institutional, or social aspects o f the project as appraised. The
changes arejustified by the needto restructurethis operation after more than two years o f
failed attempts to start-up implementation have shown that the original design was not
adequate for the sub national Governments that will enter into sub-loan agreements with
BANOBRAS. Apart from the elimination o f Component E o f the Project, the other
changes are routine amendments to the legal documents for a Project designed to
streamline processesand facilitate disbursements.

None o fthe proposed changesraisesthe environmental category o f the project or triggers
new safeguard policies, since there has been no change in the scope o f project
components/activities, remaining as originally envisaged. The restructuring does not
involve any exceptions to Bankpolices.

Benefits andRisks

17.     The proposed restructuring poses no new risks to the achievement o f the project
DOs or outcome targets. The risks noted in section F.2 o f the PAD, including political,
policy-related, social/stakeholder-related, institutional, or capacity-related risks preserve
their original ratings as the risk analysis o f the PAD remains valid for the restructured
project within current country and sector context andneedsno update.

These risks will continue to be mitigated mainly with the same measuresproposed inthe
risk analysis of the PAD, except for those that have changed as a consequence of the
proposed restructuring (see Table2 below).
