The lessons learned indicate\n            that the response of Honduras Social Investment Fund (FHIS)\n            and IDA to the Mitch catastrophe showed the major role that\n            Social Investment Funds (SIFs) can play in such emergency\n            situations because of their unique design and procedures.\n            This flexibility, largely a function of the fact that its\n            operating procedures are determined in an Operations Manual\n            that can usually be adapted with minimal bureaucratic\n            transactions makes it well suited to responding in\n            unforeseen circumstances. FHIS's decision to set up\n            nine regional offices with delegated responsibilities and\n            resources facilitated its rapid response to local hurricane\n            repair needs. With the road and telecommunications\n            infrastructure severely damaged by Mitch, having\n            decision-makers at the field level was essential. The\n            decentralized offices allowed FHIS to develop a productive,\n            collaborative relationship with the municipal governments\n            and communities. Based on the Mitch experience, it is\n            recommended that all SIFs and their respective governments\n            agree on what the SIF's role should be in the event of\n            a national disaster. This role should be clearly defined in\n            a detailed emergency operating manual (i.e., contingency\n            procedures) that simplifies the project cycle, while\n            ensuring transparent and efficient project management. This\n            project shows the reality of doing what is necessary in an\n            emergency situation. Speed and responsiveness can cause\n            drawbacks that need to be recognized, but are often\n            unavoidable. Future operations should recognize that the\n            transition back to normal operations can be facilitated by\n            an up front limitation on the volume and timetable of\n            emergency subprojects. When SIFs are involved in an\n            emergency, it may be appropriate to also consider a response\n            to social needs unrelated to infrastructure. The Bank showed\n            the capacity to respond immediately to the Mitch crisis and\n            adapt to new needs. A dramatic change in project approach\n            requires intensive Bank staff involvement at many levels\n            ranging from approving new operating procedures, pursuing\n            supplemental financing, and providing close technical\n            assistance. FHIS worked through ethnic umbrella\n            organizations, the federations, to reach targeted minority\n            groups. Based on this experience, the concept of community\n            banks (Cajas Rurales) should be cultivated among groups of\n            communities, rather than at the level of each community, in\n            order to make the funds more sustainable."}, "docdt": "2003-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
