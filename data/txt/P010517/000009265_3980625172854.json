The\n            project seeks to promote significant participation of the\n            private sector in the ownership, operation and maintenance\n            of infrastructure facilities by establishing a facility to\n            retail long-term subordinated debt.  It is intended to act\n            as a catalyst to encourage private sector investment.\n            Project sponsors would prepare individual sub-projects -\n            which are not covered in this report.  The paper evaluates\n            the process for reviewing the environmental acceptability of\n            the sub-projects both by the government of Sri Lanka and by\n            the International Development Association (IDA).  It details\n            the necessary steps toward preparing an Environmental\n            Assessment and the ideal approval process."}, "docdt": "1995-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
