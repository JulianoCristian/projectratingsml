Given the\n            pioneering nature of the project design, notably with regard\n            to the processes associated with the identification,\n            appraisal and financing of infrastructure projects, there\n            are substantive lessons learned. To attempt to capture the\n            full value of these lessons, an additional Annex 11 has been\n            created to detail these findings in full, including\n            suggested remedies. The lessons are of particular relevance\n            for future initiatives including implementation agencies\n            acting as financing intermediaries. The summary lessons\n            learned are as follows: 1) The creation of an infrastructure\n            fund was not a sufficient catalyst to increase private\n            sector investment in infrastructure as financing was not the\n            binding constraint. 2) The project was hampered throughout\n            by governance and control issues which emanated from the\n            attempt to establish a body which was at the same time\n            independent of government and transparent in its actions but\n            ultimately responsible for public funds. While the rationale\n            was a perceived need to be flexible but somehow maintain\n            transparency, this rather resulted in a lack of clarity of\n            function. 3) The Private Sector Infrastructure Development\n            Company (PSIDC) was perceived to be a government agency by\n            infrastructure promoters and by financial sector\n            participants and was treated as such. 4) During project\n            design, the core team did not include all the relevant skill\n            groups. 5) The project design was lacking relative to the\n            complexity of the core elements of the task relating to\n            project finance and lending operations. 6) The range of\n            financial products available to PSIDC was too limited and\n            there is no linkage between the riskiness of projects and\n            the price or allocation of credit. 7) The aim of the PSIDC\n            playing the role of \"lender of last resort\"\n            appeared unnatural to private sector practitioners more\n            inclined to try to build an institution, grow business and\n            secure tenure. 8) The transitory nature of the project\n            design did not jibe well with the long dated nature of the\n            sub-loans or with the structure of PSIDC as a limited\n            liability company with indefinite life. The description of\n            agreed objectives and processes for the implementation of\n            the \"Sunset Clause\" in the project documentation\n            was too vague. 9) The implementing agency responsible for\n            the technical assistance component should have been distinct\n            to that for the lending component. 10) The project failed to\n            support capital market development and particularly missed\n            the opportunity to promote local currency financing. 11) The\n            procurement requirements of the IDA credit appeared\n            unacceptable to some private sector contractors and\n            potential infrastructure providers were reportedly dissuaded\n            from using the PSIDC facility."}, "docdt": "2003-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
