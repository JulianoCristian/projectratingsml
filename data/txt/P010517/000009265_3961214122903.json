More\n            detailed objectives of the project are to: 1) establish a\n            government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) facility for the placement of\n            long-term debt that will work in tandem with private sources\n            of capital to facilitate potential private sector\n            investment; 2) encourage significant participation of the\n            private sector in the investment, implementation, operation\n            and maintenance of new infrastructure facilities; and 3)\n            strengthen GOSL's ability to attract, negotiate and\n            close private sector sponsored infrastructured projects by\n            increasing capabilities to evaluate and negotiate projects\n            with private sponsors.
