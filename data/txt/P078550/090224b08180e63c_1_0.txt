                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The SLEM project is linked to the Uttaranchal Decentralised Watershed Development Project which closed on March 31, 2012. The SLEM project however will close 18 months later.
                         The parent project has been consistently achieving and in some cases exceeding the targets, successfully reversing the water scarcity to surplus in the project GPs, with an increase
                         of the average discharge rate from 5-8 LPM to about 18 LPM, providing renewable water for irrigation and domestic use. Such reversed trend is contributing visibly to new the
                         livelihood opportunities in the project areas. The SLEM project aims to further consolidate the benefits accrued from the parent project.
