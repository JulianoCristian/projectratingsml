                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is closing in about one year. In consolidating the project activities, the additional financing of US$ 8 million has recently been approved, which will further strengthen the
                         implementation of agribusiness. Also, a reallocation of proceeds has been approved to complete the project implementation.
