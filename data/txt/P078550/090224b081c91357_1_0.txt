                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The SLEM project is supported by the Global Environment Fund (GEF) grant and co-finances the Uttaranchal Decentralised Watershed Development Project (IDA portion closed on
                         March 31, 2012). The SLEM project aims to further consolidate the benefits accrued from the parent project. The implementation progress is satisfactory. More than 92 percent of the
                         grant has been spent. Activities for the remaining amount are already budgeted and it is expected that the project will fully disburse by its closure (August 31, 2013).

                         The project has exceeded its expectation on two components:
                         (1) Source Sustainability - Ground Water Management - one of the project GP "Selalekh" has been given a national award as the best ground water augmentation GP by the Ministry
                         of Water Resources, GoI, and
                         (2) As part of the climate change mitigation initiative the project has successfully demonstrated a technology in converting pine needles (the main cause of forest fire) into pine
                         briquette - used for cooking food substituting fuelwood. This technology has substantially reduced the carbon load in project areas. They have already produced more that 500 metric
