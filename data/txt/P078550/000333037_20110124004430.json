During Mid-Term\n            Review (MTR) based on the project performance and outputs,\n            the task team and the project agreed on enhanced focus and\n            activities like agri-business activities, increasing the\n            scope of work in the drainage line treatment and increasing\n            the scope of consultancy to carry out evaluations. Apart\n            from the above on technical grounds, due to unit cost\n            escalation and the impact of such escalations on the sub\n            projects and allied activities, has necessitated this\n            reallocation. The reallocation will adjust the surplus\n            resources available under the training budget (category 4B)\n            and Goods and services for sub-project (category-1), and is\n            in line with the implementation plan. These changes will\n            support the incremental operating cost and natural increase\n            in unit cost of agri-business activities. With this\n            reallocation overdraw in categories 5 and 6 will also be\n            regularized which was done in line with the implementation\n            plan and activities."}, "docdt": "2011-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
