were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: fiscal decentralization and community\n            empowerment are necessary but not sufficient to promote\n            improved community management of natural resources. Science\n            and cutting-edge technology in hydrology cannot be\n            overemphasized: watershed development should balance\n            participation and science in its design and implementation.\n            Watershed development projects are a relevant response to\n            the needed increase in rainfed agricultural productivity in\n            India. Gram Panchayat Watershed Development Plan (GPWDP)\n            investments increased the water holding capacity, and\n            comprehensive watershed treatment at the micro-watershed\n            level, including reserve forests, has proven effective by\n            SLEM, in sustaining natural water source. Building on these\n            investments, Gramya I demonstrated the effectiveness of\n            rainwater conservation and harvesting in rainfed areas, when\n            combined with improved seeds and management practices. More\n            attempts must be made to quantify costs and benefits\n            relative to alternative interventions. Impact evaluation and\n            economic analyses of Gramya I quantified the relevant costs\n            and benefits accruing to the GPWDPs and by Watershed\n            Management Directorate (WMD) in watershed development and\n            considered these relative to alternatives."}, "docdt": "2014-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
