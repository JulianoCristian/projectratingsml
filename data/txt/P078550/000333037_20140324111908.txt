1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Uttarakhand became the 27th State of India in November 2000 3 , with a small
population of 8.5 million and a total area of 53,483 km2. About 87 percent of this area is
hilly and subject to severe soil erosion and land degradation. Uttarakhand is home to five
well-endowed river basins, including the Ganges. But the lifeline of the people in the
State has been its innumerable perennial steams and springs, which provide access to
water for meeting diverse needs. Severe soil erosion and land degradation has reduced
the flow and capacity of these water sources by 40 percent.

1.1.2 Approximately 70 percent of the hills population practices relatively low-yielding
rainfed subsistence agriculture. Average productivity of subsistence cereals in the hills is
less than 50 percent of that found in the plains. Moreover, landholdings in the hills are
as small as 0.87 ha per household and widely dispersed. Farm income, thus, is also small.
Over 24 percent of the hills population out-migrated, and there were a high number of
female-headed households. At the time of Project appraisal, the incidence of poverty was
46 percent higher in the hills than in the plains 4 and even worse among scheduled caste
and tribal populations.

1.1.3 For reducing poverty in the hills, the Government of Uttarakhand (GoUK) was
promoting watershed development and considered it a means to conserve natural
resources and sustainably increase productivity of rainfed agriculture in the ecologically
fragile and erosion-prone hills. The Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development
Project (UDWDP or locally known as Gramya I) was designed by building on the
predecessor multi-state project, which was the IDA-financed Integrated Watershed
Development Hills II Project (IWDP II) - P041264 5 . Gramya I was to scale up the
watershed treatment in 20 sub-watersheds in the mid-Himalayan hills, while supporting
GoUK’s administrative, fiscal, and political decentralization to Gram Panchayats (GPs,
rural local government).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The PDO of Gramya I was to improve the productive potential of natural
resources and increase incomes of rural inhabitants in selected watersheds through
socially inclusive, institutionally and environmentally sustainable approaches. It



3
  It was a hilly part of the State of Uttar Pradesh and named Uttaranchal upon independence and in 2006,
renamed Uttarakhand.
4
   38.5 percent of the population is below the poverty line in the hills, while it is 26 percent in the plains.
5
  At a total cost of US$ 135 million, IWDP II was implemented in five states (Uttarakhand, Jammu and
Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana). US$ 45 million was earmarked for Uttarakhand.
Impact studies indicated considerable success in this project, including an average of 38 percent increase in
incomes of beneficiaries with increased agriculture productivity while sustaining the natural resource base.
IWDP II closed on March 31, 2005.


                                                      1
encompassed three broad themes: (a) community participation in watershed development
and management aimed at integrating land-water management with the objectives of
increased soil moisture retention and improved biomass production, while simultaneously
enhancing incomes and livelihood options; (b) strengthening the administrative capacity
of GPs to manage project financial resources, implement sub-projects, deliver legally
mandated services (in the context of natural resource management), and sustain those
services beyond the duration of the project; and (c) ensuring equitable participation by all
groups, especially the landless and women who rely disproportionately on common-pool
resources for fodder, fuel, and other forest products. The original PDO indicators were:

   i.   10 percent increase in household income (over baseline) in targeted villages;
  ii.   10 percent increase in vegetation and biomass index of treated watersheds;
 iii.   15 percent increase in availability of water over baseline for domestic and/or
        agriculture use; and
 iv.    20 percent improvement in administrative capacity of GPs as measured by
        performance indicators.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.3.1 The GEO for the GEF-financed Sustainable Land, Water and Biodiversity
Conservation and Management for Improved Livelihoods in Uttarakhand Watershed Sector
(SLEM) was to restore and sustain ecosystem functions and biodiversity while
simultaneously enhancing income and livelihood functions, and generating lessons
learned in these respects that can be up-scaled and mainstreamed at state and national
levels. The GEO was consistent with the Gramya I PDO, with an emphasis on enhancing
climate change mitigation and resilience in the watershed ecosystem. The GEO indicators
were:

  i.    20 micro watershed management plans completed and under implementation; and
 ii.    10 percent increase in livelihood opportunities in treated areas.

1.4 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

1.4.1 The PDO remained unchanged throughout project implementation. However, one
PDO indicator and nine intermediate results indicators were revised or clarified at the
Mid-term Review. The target for PDO indicator (iii) was reduced to 10 percent. The
revised results framework was approved by the Board as a part of the Additional
Financing/restructuring package in January 2011 (the revisions are detailed in Annex 2).




                                             2
1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.5.1    The GEO remained unchanged throughout the project implementation.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

1.6.1 Gramya I treated 234,800 ha in 76 micro-watersheds, and benefitted a population
of 255,681 in 468 GPs in 18 development blocks in the 11 hill districts of Uttarakhand.
These GPs were selected on the basis of: (a) erosion intensity (e.g., land degradation and
soil erosion), (b) socio-economic status (e.g., below poverty line populations, resource
poor, and gender), and (c) access (e.g., remoteness and infrastructure). In focusing on
water source treatment and sustainability, the SLEM additionally provided incremental
benefits in land degradation control and climate change mitigation and resilience to the
selected 125 GPs (27 percent of Gramya I GPs) in 20 targeted micro-watersheds (detailed
in the Annex 2). The main beneficiaries for both Gramya I and the SLEM were as
follows:

•   Small and medium landholders in targeted GPs. These farmers benefitted from (a)
    watershed treatment, in particular, land degradation control, water harvesting and
    source sustainability, (b) demonstrations in rainfed and irrigated agriculture
    technologies and increase in yields, and (c) high value and/or off-season vegetable
    cultivation, group formation and capacity building, and the agribusiness pilot.
•   Marginal farmers, landless, women, and transhumant. The Vulnerable Group
    fund benefitted marginal farmers, landless, and women in enhancing their
    livelihoods. 6 The Transhumant Action Plan supported the transhumant populations,
    who passed by or stayed in the targeted GPs.
•   Targeted GP and community members. The GPs benefitted from the participatory
    approach in planning and implementing GP watershed development plans (GPWDPs)
    and micro-watershed development plans (MWDPs). Gramya I built their capacity in
    GP administration, project management, fiduciary and safeguards compliance, and
    social accountability through training and exposure visits.

1.6.2 Through the knowledge management activities, Gramya I and SLEM also reached
out to state and local stakeholders in watershed development, including the State
Departments of Forestry, Water Resources, Agriculture, Livestock, and Rural
Development, universities, research institutes, donors, aid agencies, and NGOs.




6
 The project defined the vulnerable households as very small landholders (less than 0.68 ha), landless, with
specific housing (“Kacha” house), limited livelihoods opportunities, few livestock, in debt, or socially
vulnerable. About 23 percent of the households (who were the poorest of poor) benefitted from the
Vulnerable Group fund.


                                                     3
1.7 Original Components (as approved)

1.7.1 Gramya I had three components: (a) participatory watershed development and
management, (b) enhancing livelihoods opportunities, and (c) institutional strengthening.

Component A. Participatory           Watershed     Development      and    Management
(US$ 55.95 million)

1.7.2 This was the key project component, which supported watershed treatment
through a participatory approach. The two sub-components were as follows:

•   Sub-component A.1. Promotion of social mobilization and community-driven
    decision making. This sub-component supported GP mobilization and GPWDP
    preparation, which was facilitated by field-based NGOs.
•   Sub-component A.2. Watershed treatments and village development. This
    supported GPWDP implementation, including investments in civil works.

Component B. Enhancing Livelihood Opportunities (US$ 14.25 million)

1.7.3 The component aimed at increasing production and productivity of irrigated and
rainfed crops, while supporting the Vulnerable Groups. The three sub-components were:

•   Sub-component B.1. Farming systems improvement. On a cost-sharing basis, the
    sub-component supported demonstrations of improved technologies and practices in
    water harvesting, agriculture, and horticulture.
•   Sub-component B.2. Value addition and marketing support. The sub-component
    piloted agribusiness development, including farmer interest group (FIG) formation
    and capacity building, value addition, and market linkages.
•   Sub-component B.3. Income-generating activities for vulnerable group. The sub-
    component financed income generation activities selected by the Vulnerable Groups,
    such as livestock, processing and value addition and other service sector activities.

Component C. Institutional Strengthening (US$ 17.29 million)

1.7.4   This component supported the following three sub-components:

•   Sub-component C.1. Capacity building of Gram Panchayats and local
    community institutions. Community members were trained on the participatory
    approach, sub-project management, and fiduciary and safeguard compliance.
•   Sub-component C.2. Information, education, and communication. The sub-
    component supported communication and knowledge management.
•   Sub-component C.3. Project coordination, monitoring, and management. This
    financed the WMD in its project management and various monitoring tools.




                                            4
1.8 Revised Components

1.8.1 There was no change to the three components and eight sub-components during
project implementation.

1.9 Other significant changes

1.9.1 The GEF-financed SLEM (US$ 7.5 million) was approved as Additional
Financing to Gramya I in August 2009. SLEM demonstrated source sustainability
towards improving access to water and water security through decentralized water
management. It also piloted alternative livelihoods that would enhance climate change
mitigation and enhanced resilience to climate shocks in the selected 20 Gramya I micro-
watersheds. SLEM implemented the following six activities: (a) participatory
development of micro-watershed development plans (MWDPs), (b) land degradation
control at the micro-watershed level, (c) reduction in pressure and dependence on the
natural resource base, (d) biodiversity conservation and management, (e) two studies on
climate change adaptation in natural resource-based production systems, and (f) project
management. These activities were to build on Gramya I investments but were not linked
to its components. The approved closing date was August 31, 2013.

1.9.2 To complement cost overruns, an Additional Financing IDA Credit of SDR 5.1
million (US$ 7.98 million equivalent) was approved by the Board in January 2011
(detailed in Section 2.2). The re-allocation between categories was also approved at the
same time, to ensure satisfactory completion of civil works related to watershed treatment
and to strengthen demonstrations under the farming system improvement (detailed in the
Annex 2). The Closing Date of Gramya I remained unchanged (March 31, 2012).
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 The project preparation is rated Satisfactory. GoUK had a strong interest in
Gramya I, in particular, in advancing decentralization by strengthening Panchayat Raj
Institutions (PRIs). Prior to the preparation, the GoUK had granted GPs formal legal
recognition in treating watersheds, including land improvement, soil conservation, and
social and farm forestry. While the overall project design was built on the multi-state
IWDP II, lessons were drawn from the Bank-financed Rural Water and Sanitation Project
- SWAJAL (P010484) 7, which promoted decentralization by building GP administrative
capacity through enhanced community participation. Gramya I emphasized a
participatory approach and built GP financial and procurement capacity in managing sub-
grants. To ensure sub-grant management at the GP level, GoUK agreed to place an
accounts assistant at every targeted GP and developed a community procurement manual.



7
 SWAJAL was to improve water supply and environmental sanitation services and promote sanitation and
gender awareness at community level (total cost US$ 60 million). The project was implemented by the
Government of Uttar Pradesh, prior to the independence of the State of Uttarakhand.


                                                 5
2.1.2 Gramya I also drew lessons from the Bank-supported Diversified Agriculture
Support Project (DASP) (P035824) 8. The DASP informed the project in: (a) improving
project ownership and sustainability by sharing costs with the community, (b) enhancing
the livelihood component by piloting agribusiness development, and (c) engaging NGOs
as implementation partners, to mitigate potential delays in project staffing or deputation
from line departments (as had happened in IWDP). GoUK agreed to contract NGOs to
support (a) overall project management in two districts (i.e., partner NGOs), (b) social
mobilization and GPWDP preparation (i.e., field NGOs), and (c) agribusiness
development, including FIG mobilization, value addition, and marketing support
(Divisional Support Agencies, DSAs). Despite the relatively complex design, Gramya I
was prepared in a short period of six months (from the concept review to the appraisal).

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The implementation progress is rated Satisfactory. Consistent with the PDO, the
project made an attempt to engage with Gram Panchayats in implementing watershed
treatment on arable and non-arable lands. This was done despite concern that the GPs had
low capacity to manage project finances and implement sub-project activities. The project
took up the challenge to enhance the capacities of GPs in fulfilling their constitutional
mandate of delivering development services at the local level. This has led to
improvement in efficiency of the PRIs in managing all development activities and in
creating a roadmap for their involvement in national watershed development program.

2.2.2 By design, disbursement projections were back-loaded, reflecting the
decentralized nature of the project, which required community mobilization and training.
These were prerequisite for significant disbursements for goods and civil works through
GPDWP implementation. By building on the IWDP experiences and by engaging both
partner and field NGOs, the expected progress in social mobilization and GPWDP
preparation was consistent overall: more than 50 percent of targeted GPs had prepared
GPWDPs by end-2006, and almost 100 percent had done so by end-2008 (detailed in the
Annex 2). However, the delay in project staffing slowed social mobilization in more
remote GPs and GPWDP implementation in some divisions. For example, in the first four
years of implementation (2004 to 2008), only about 50 percent of the key technical
positions were filled in engineering, agriculture, horticulture, and livestock management.
The implementation progress was, thus, rated “moderately satisfactory” in mid-2008.
Gramya I increased NGO engagement and hired 10 local NGOs, including six DSAs to
support the agribusiness pilot at the divisional level. With these adjustments, project
staffing reached 96 percent of expectations by end-2008.

2.2.3 At the Mid-term Review in November 2008, changes were made to the project
design to: (a) initiate comprehensive treatment at the micro-watershed level; (b) enhance
agribusiness development; and (c) strengthen support for Vulnerable Groups in


8
 DASP, on the other hand, was to increase agricultural productivity by supporting diversified agricultural
production systems, promoting private sector development, and improving rural infrastructure (total cost
US$ 130 million). Likewise, DASP was also implemented by the State of Uttar Pradesh.


                                                    6
entrepreneurial activities. Diversified crop productivity from rainfed areas induced the
project to emphasize agribusiness to enhance rural livelihoods, which the project could
not anticipate. While Vulnerable Group support had focused on SHG formation only, the
Mid-term Review shifted its emphasis toward entrepreneurial group activities in the
livestock and service sectors (detailed in the Annex 2).

2.2.4 Throughout 2009 and 2010, there were consistent improvements in the
implementation of both Gramya I and SLEM. Gramya I disbursements reached 84
percent by end-2010. However, due to an increase in the cost of civil works in the
targeted GPs and associated agribusiness support, and higher-than-expected inflation, a
cost overrun was anticipated. The Original Project budget included a two percent
allocation for physical and price contingencies (US$ 1.86 million), but this was not
enough to keep up with domestic inflation, which was about 12 percent in October 2008.
The Additional Financing of US$ 7.98 million equivalent, approved by the Board in
January 2011, helped to fill this financing gap. 9 The reallocation of funds and the revised
results framework were also approved at this time. In 2011, the project implementation
progress was upgraded to “highly satisfactory”, because of the consistent progress in
attaining most of the Gramya I targets and even exceeding a few (detailed in section 3).
At Credit closure, SDR 3.7 million (about US$ 5.6 million equivalent) was cancelled.
Both GoUK and beneficiary contributions exceeded appraisal estimates by some
US$11.7 million, thereby reducing the need for additional IDA resources. Moreover, the
depreciation of the rupee also played a role in the creation of savings 10. With the closing
of Gramya I in March 2012, the subsequent ISR documented solely SLEM progress; as
such, the rating reverted to Satisfactory.

2.2.5 The implementation of SLEM activities continued until August 2013. The SLEM
took full advantage of the skills, experiences and lessons learned of the Gramya I-trained
staff in its implementation. To ensure the sub-grants were fully disbursed, two
reallocations between categories were approved by the Bank. These were to strengthen
GP mobilization by reallocating funds earmarked for two climate change studies, which
were not carried out due to lack of implementing agency capacity in this emerging
subject (detailed in section 3.5). The SLEM fully disbursed the GEF grant and
satisfactorily implemented most of the planned activities before project closing. The
overall implementation progress of the SLEM remained “satisfactory”.

2.2.6 An Inspection Panel complaint was filed by a local NGO in March 2007, claiming
that Gramya I had reported achievements that were actually attributable to another
livelihoods development project. A subsequent site visit to meet with the claimant NGO
led the Inspection Panel to conclude that there was no basis for investigation and the
matter was closed.



9
 GoUK also provided US$ 2.51 million, which totaled to US$ 10.49 million.
10
  The exchange rate was US$ 1 = Rs. 52.63 around the project closure (as of April, 2012). At appraisal, it
was US$ 1 = Rs. 45.30 (as of March, 2004). The rupee depreciated by 16 percent, which reduced the actual
expenditure in terms of US$.


                                                    7
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 The M&E is rated Substantial. The Gramya I results framework was well-
designed to capture the project emphasis on decentralization and GP capacity building in
participatory GPWDP planning and implementation. Nonetheless, the indicators did less
to capture more science-based aspects of watershed development. For example, while
one of the PDO indicators measured increase in vegetation and biomass index, the results
framework could have highlighted key physical outcomes in water source treatment and
sustainability, by measuring increase in water discharge rate and stream flow duration,
and in area under irrigation. As a result, the physical outputs were measured by the
GPWDP implementation progress and sub-grant disbursement. This was also the case for
the GEF results framework. Also, at hindsight, the target values for some indicators could
have been more ambitious in achieving PDO and GEO.

2.3.2 The key physical outputs and outcomes were regularly monitored through
WMD’s well-established management information system (MIS), and these were
reported at every Bank mission. During Gramya I implementation, MIS was enhanced at
the divisional level to track progress in WDP development and implementation, area
under treatment (including irrigation), production and productivity of rainfed and
irrigated crops, value addition and marketing. The information was used to update the
results framework, in particular, measuring the project outcomes, and preparing case
studies, good practice notes (including 11 notes prepared by the SLEM), and various
reports, including the Bank and government ICRs. The results and outcomes of Gramya I
and SLEM were widely disseminated to stakeholders at the GP, division, and the state
levels.

2.3.3 In addition to the detailed MIS, both Gramya I and SLEM complemented output
and outcome monitoring by the innovative participatory monitoring and evaluation (PME,
detailed in Section 3.5 as a social accountability tool) and third-party impact evaluation.
An independent research firm was hired to conduct the baseline, mid-term and final
impact evaluations (with a methodology that included control groups) for both Gramya I
and SLEM. 11 These evaluations verified the projects’ achievements towards their
respective key indicators, such as vegetative biomass, biodiversity index, increase in
household income, adoption and uptake of alternative technologies for livelihoods, and
GP capacity building.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards. The project was Category B and triggered five safeguard policies:
environmental assessment (OP 4.01), natural habitats (OP 4.04), pest management (OP
4.09), indigenous peoples (OP 4.20), and forests (OP 4.36). The project fully complied
with the Bank safeguards. The Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF), integrated pest management (IPM) strategy, and Transhumant Action Plan were
prepared and disclosed in February 2004. In addition, the project also developed


11
     These were undertaken by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), a Delhi-based consulting firm.


                                                     8
guidelines for plastic waste disposal from poly house or poly tunnels and waste
management at processing centers.

2.4.2 The environmental and social safeguards were the integral part of GPWDP and
MWDP planning and implementation. GPs used safeguard checklists in selecting and
implementing sub-projects at the village level. The project trained 23,977 community
leaders and stakeholders on the ESMF guidelines and checklists, as a part of project
orientation. The safeguard compliance was monitored for all Gramya I and SLEM sub-
projects by WMD division offices. The checklists were also used by the GoI-financed
IWMP and the livelihoods and local institution development project supported by the
International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD).

2.4.3 Uttarakhand was declared a certified organic state (in terms of agricultural
production) in 2001 and was the first such State to be recognized by GoI. Building on
this status, the project’s IPM strategy encouraged the reduced use of agro-chemicals by
training targeted farmers on composting and appropriate use of farmyard manure and
IPM. During Gramya I and SLEM implementation, progressive FIG members were
identified and trained as IPM resource persons, and information was made available at
the division level at Farmer Development Centers under the Department of Agriculture.

2.4.4 The Transhumant Action Plan supported sedentary or semi-sedentary transhumant
communities migrating through or residing in the targeted GPs. They were Bhotiya,
Anwals, and Gujars and composed approximately 6.5 percent of the total Gramya I target
population. The project provided veterinary support, insurance facilities, fodder blocks,
and education for children at a total cost of Rs. 132 million (approximately US$ 2.64
million).

2.4.5 Financial Management. Financial management is rated Satisfactory. The overall
accounting and reporting system was functional at the state, division, and district levels
throughout Gramya I and SLEM implementation. Each GP managed an average of Rs. 4
million (approximately US$80,000) plus the Vulnerable Group funds (about US$ 20,000).
In supporting GP financial management, university graduates in commerce were hired as
accounts assistants in all 468 targeted GPs. The assistants underwent continuous training
given by WMD and ensured GP-level accounting and auditing. They ensured 100 percent
submission of satisfactory GP audit reports.

2.4.6 The project submitted interim unaudited financial reports (IUFRs) on time. The
external audit reports were also submitted (albeit with some delays) and were clean in all
cases.

2.4.7 Procurement. Procurement also is rated Satisfactory. GPs executed about 80
percent of procurement under the project. Although the amount per transaction was
rather small, the sheer quantity of transactions across the 468 GPs had the potential for
substantial risk. WMD produced a Community Procurement Manual during project
preparation, and trained women village facilitators and other GP members on its contents.
For the GP investments, such as water harvest structures, the procurement was conducted



                                            9
and closely monitored by the water user groups. For the larger public goods, such as
roads and bridges, GP members monitored the procurement through PME. WMD
conducted the remaining 20 percent of procurement, including large contracting of the
PNGOs and FNGOs. Some delays in procurement of PNGOs occurred but did not
impact overall implementation significantly.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 In 2009, GoUK developed a Perspective and Strategic Plan 2009-2027 with an
aim to treat 537 micro-watersheds in the hills (about 1.9 million ha) by 2027. A repeater
project, the Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Project II (Gramya II)
has been negotiated with GoI and is slated for Board presentation in March 2014.
Gramya II would treat an additional 280,000 ha in 507 GPs and inter-GP areas. Building
on the lessons learned from Gramya I and SLEM, Gramya II would continue the
participatory approach in watershed treatment, while strengthening technology and
science in natural resource conservation, hydrology, rainfed agriculture development,
climate change mitigation, and MIS (see Section 6). Gramya II will also support the
farmer federations formed under Gramya I to improve their sustainability by building
their capacity in managing agribusiness.
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The objectives, design, and implementation of both Gramya I and SLEM were
highly relevant. The objectives were consistent with the India Country Assistance
Strategies (CAS) 2001-2004, 2005-2008, and remained so for the Country Partnership
Strategies (CPS) of 2009-2012 and 2013-2017. GoI classified Uttarakhand as a Special
Category State, due to hilly terrain and low population density and the challenges related
to water availability, soil erosion, and natural resource management. Gramya I aimed at
addressing these challenges through decentralized, participatory watershed development,
enhanced by the SLEM with its focus on climate change mitigation and resilience.

3.1.2 The project was multi-sectoral and contributed to sustainability by ensuring
community participation across watershed development, rural development, forestry
agriculture, horticulture, and livestock sectors. The State Government’s development
policy supported the project’s decentralized watershed development planning and
implementation, which built GP capacities in inclusive local governance. The design was
also inclusive of economically and socially marginalized groups, such as marginal
farmers, landless, women, and transhumance, who were assisted by the Vulnerable Group
funds or the Transhumant Action Plan. In managing reserve forests, the SLEM mobilized
VPs, which were mandated to manage community forests and later authorized under a
new Government Order to undertake source treatment (e.g., drainage line treatment and
check dam management) and natural resource conservation (e.g., afforestation, natural
oak regeneration, and other plantation management) in reserve forests.




                                           10
3.1.3 Project implementation was consistent with India’s development priorities. The
combination of watershed treatment (i.e., land degradation control, natural resource
conservation, and water harvesting), agriculture demonstrations, and agribusiness
development contributed an average 15 percent increase in beneficiaries’ income.
Inclusive growth was also achieved as there was a 30 percent increase in income among
Vulnerable Groups, with support from the Vulnerable Groups fund.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

3.2.1 The achievement of both the PDO and GEO were Satisfactory. The Gramya I
and SLEM treated an overall area of 234,787 ha with resource conservation treatments,
by adopting a decentralized watershed management in 76 MWS’, covering 468 GPs. Of
this, SLEM adopted much more comprehensive ridge-to-valley treatment in 60,823 ha by
including the inter-GP areas.

3.2.2 In response to its theme 1, Gramya I successfully increased water flows and
improved water availability by 12 percent for agriculture and domestic use. This,
combined with various plantation activities in non-arable lands, contributed to a 10
percent increase in vegetation and biomass index in the targeted areas. Moreover, there
was a 15 percent increase in income among targeted households (on average), which was
supported by rainwater harvesting, agribusiness pilot, and Vulnerable Group funds.
Gramya I outcomes in natural resource conservation were augmented by SLEM’s ridge-
to-valley treatment, such as land degradation control and water source sustainability in
reserve forests in the targeted 20 micro-watersheds. This outcome alone may provide a
major opportunity for targeted scaling up of community-led interventions in South Asia
and other regions, to combat the recently reported forest declines due to climate change
moisture stress in tropical montane forests.

3.2.3 The SLEM also made substantial outcomes in achieving its GEO. 20 micro-
watershed management plans were developed and implemented. There was a 50 percent
increase in the number of beneficiaries engaged in the alternative livelihood activities that
reduced their dependency on the natural resource base through pine needle briquetting,
traditional water mills, and medicinal and aromatic plan cultivation. The key project
outcomes and outputs, which contributed to the achievement of both the PDO and the
GEO are highlighted below (detailed in Annex 2).

3.2.2 Community participation in watershed development and management aimed
at integrating land-water management with the objectives of increased soil moisture
retention and improved biomass production, while simultaneously enhancing
incomes and livelihood options (PDO theme 1). A total of 468 GPWDPs and 20
MWDPs were successfully prepared and implemented by the targeted GPs through a
participatory approach. Some 65 percent of the planned activities under the GPWDPs
were related to water and natural resource management (relative to a target of 60 percent),
such as off-farm and on-farm soil conservation and drainage line treatment, water




                                             11
harvesting, afforestation, and fodder development. 12 Meanwhile, the SLEM MWDPs
focused on stream source treatment and rejuvenation, soil conservation, and forestry
(afforestation and assisted natural regeneration of oak forests) in inter-GP areas, most of
which were reserve forests. For their excellent work in comprehensive stream
rejuvenation and drainage line treatments to stop and reverse stream bank erosion and
gully formation with the SLEM financing, Selalekha GP in Nainital division was
awarded in 2010 the National Ground Water Augmentation Prize by the Ministry of
Water Resources. The beneficiary contribution was about three times more than the
appraisal estimate, and the cost sharing facilitated ownership and sustainability in the
project investments, in particular, water harvesting structures. In operationalizing and
maintaining these structures as well as plantations (see below), Gramya I and the SLEM
formed almost 2,000 user groups (more than 15,800 farmers or community members). 90
percent of these groups saved Rs. 1.6 million (approximately US$ 32,000) for operation
and maintenance and used about 20 percent of these savings to maintain irrigation tanks
and channels during the Gramya I implementation.

3.2.3 In integrating land-water management and source rehabilitation by enhancing
moisture retention and biomass production, , Gramya I and SLEM interventions
contributed directly to rehabilitate dried up stream sources and capillary-based water
springs, by establishing rainfall runoff capture and infiltration ponds at strategic locations
in the watersheds. The additional water retained at higher levels of the catchments
resulted in about 68 percent increase in water discharge rate. It also resulted in increased
water flows throughout the year as opposed to only seven to eight months of the year
before the project. In addition, as flow rates were more even over the year, the erosive
power of sudden discharges that result from storm events was also mitigated, resulting in
reduced soil erosion and reduced losses of soil carbon. The treatment of 167,556 ha of
non-arable lands by Gramya I and SLEM reduced runoff and soil erosion. The outcome
of SLEM soil conservation was an estimated 142,438m3 of soil loss reduction, which
protected topsoil on 185 ha and increased gross cultivable land to 278 ha.

3.2.4 Gramya I investments were significant in developing rainfed agriculture. The
water harvest structures developed by both Gramya I and SLEM created additional water
holding capacity of 671,536 m3. As a result, 9,402 ha of arable lands were irrigated by the
projects. Combined with Gramya I’s demonstrations in rainwater harvesting, an
additional 6,908 ha came under cultivation. Crop yields in the arable lands increased by
35 to 60 percent. The annual production of cereals increased by 79 MT, while that of
pulses increased by 2 MT.

3.2.5 The small timber and fuel wood plantation and fodder development by Gramya I
and SLEM increased the biomass production in 17,475 ha in the targeted areas. The
plantations increased annual production by about 121 MT. In the 468 targeted GPs, the
2010 remote sensing survey confirmed an increase of about 10 percent in the biomass and
vegetative coverage. It is plausible that Gramya I surpassed its target (10 percent


12
  The remaining 35 percent of the activities were related to improving rural access, such as rehabilitation
or construction of rural roads, bridges, etc.


                                                     12
increase) in 2013, after the seven years of implementation. Over two years, the SLEM
interventions increased the biomass coverage by an estimated 5.5 percent in the targeted
125 GPs. The SLEM also contributed to biodiversity conservation in the targeted areas,
as the richness in shrubs was significantly higher than the baseline values. 13

3.2.6 In enhancing incomes and livelihood options, the project adopted various
innovations in rainfed agriculture, which accounted for 80 percent of the arable land,
including use of improved rainfed seeds developed by local institutions/universities As
the rainfed areas accounts for 80 percent of the arable land in the State, the project made
conscious efforts to enhance partnership with local universities and research institutions
in providing targeted farmers with improved rainfed seeds and initiating exposure visits
by progressive farmers in farmer field schools in improving productivity. These resulted
in a four-fold increase in cropping intensity. In the irrigated areas, Gramya I
demonstrated improved farming practices, such as the cultivation of high value crops
(3,105 ha) and off-season vegetables (3,081 ha), with beneficiary contributions
amounting to US$3.2 million. As a result, improved varieties and high value crops were
cultivated in 7,464 ha, which contributed to a 21 percent increase over baseline (while the
target was 10 percent). Gramya I piloted agribusiness in 327 GPs (about 70 percent of
targeted GPs). Some 690 FIGs were formed, 85 percent of which were aggregated into
27 farmer federations. These federations represented 8,408 farmers and facilitated the
sale of 41 MT of high value crops, off-season vegetables, and processed farm products in
19 facilities financed under the project, resulting in total sale volume of Rs. 486 million
(about US$ 9.7 million). 6,743 farmers participated in processing, 42 percent of whom
were women SHG members. These farmers realized a 27 percent increase in net revenue,
which was 80 percent more than the 15 percent target.

3.2.7 Strengthening administrative capacity of GPs to manage project financial
resources, implement sub-projects, deliver legally mandated services and sustain
these services beyond the duration of the project (PDO theme 2). Gramya I
substantially improved administrative capacity in targeted GPs through its participatory
approach and capacity building activities, including training, exposure visits, knowledge
management, and participatory monitoring and evaluation (PME, detailed in section 3.5).
As a result, the Gram Sabha participation by women and vulnerable households increased
substantially, by four times for women (from 11 percent to 45 percent) and double for
vulnerable households (from 16 percent to 32 percent). The increase in women’s
participation was facilitated by women village motivators, who supported establishment
of Aam Sabha (women’s assembly) (detailed in section 3.5). There also were substantial
increases in the number of GP meetings, which had more than doubled from 4.8 to 11.1
meetings per year, and attendance in Gram Sabha meetings by 62 percent. Three rounds
of PME were undertaken, as planned. The project awareness rate was as high as 91
percent in targeted GPs (while the target was 50 percent). Almost 50 percent of targeted
GP constituents became more aware of GP annual budget and expenditure (on target).
Moreover, 305 village-level project staff and group members were elected for local



13
     According to the species richness index (source: SLEM final impact evaluation)


                                                     13
government positions, 73 percent of whom were women SHG/FIG members, village
motivators, or Vulnerable Group members (detailed in section 3.5).

3.2.8 Ensuring equitable participation by all groups, especially the landless and
women who rely disproportionately on common-pool resources for fodder, fuel, and
other forest products (PDO theme 3). Both Gramya I and SLEM ensured that women
and vulnerable households not only participated in local governance but also benefitted
from livelihoods development. Under Gramya I, 8,819 vulnerable individuals benefitted
from the Vulnerable Group fund (US$1.7 million in total), which financed 3,819
individual and 754 group entrepreneurial activities. These activities increased their
income by 30 percent (on average). Some 49 percent of these beneficiaries were women.
About 50 percent of their income generation activities were in the livestock sector, 14 and
they also benefitted from the project’s livestock interventions, including fodder
development that increased the production by almost 10 percent. Moreover, 536 SHGs
were formed prior to the Mid-term review (see Section 2.2), which saved Rs. 12.5 million
(about US$ 208,000). About 190 of these SHGs (or some 2,800 women) took part in
value addition at processing centers. Most of the income generation activities financed by
the Vulnerable Groups fund were still active at the closure of Gramya I.

3.2.9 Enhancing climate change mitigation and resilience in the watershed
ecosystem (GEO theme). Besides supporting 125 targeted GPs in planning and
implementing 20 MWDPs (incremental benefits detailed above), the SLEM significantly
scaled up the alternative livelihood options that would reduce dependence on the natural
resource base, such as pine needle briquetting and gharats (traditional water mills). The
pine needle briquetting reduced fuelwood extraction by about six percent per producer
household. 192 SHGs (2,880 women) produced about 420 MT of briquettes, 80 percent
of which were consumed by these SHG member households, while the rest was marketed
on pilot basis in the villages (sold for about Rs. 3 million or about US$50,000). The
SLEM also provided plantation management and fire control training in the pine forests.
As a result, the fire affected areas were reduced by 61 percent in the targeted forests,
which also contributed to reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs).

3.2.10 The refurbishment and use of gharats was another innovation in climate change
mitigation. With SLEM interventions contributing to both an increase in and the duration
of water flows throughout the year, the milling capacity of the refurbished gharats
increased by 32 percent, and the income of 78 SHGs (418 members, 23 percent of whom
were women) increased by 28 percent. In partnership with the Uttarakhand Renewable
Energy Development Agency, these refurbished gharats were equipped with micro hydro
electricity generators, which generated 2.5 kw of clean energy. The communities saved
an estimated 78,247 liters of diesel annually, equivalent to about Rs. 4.3 million
(approximately US$ 71,700). The gharats, therefore, contributed to reduction in fossil
fuel GHG emissions and made a local contribution to climate change mitigation.



14
  This comprises of 21 percent goat rearing (including breed improvement), 16 percent poultry, and 14
percent dairy.


                                                 14
3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 The efficiency is rated Substantial. Cost-benefit analysis of the project was
conducted over a 30-year horizon. Costs and benefits were estimated at 2013 prices with
a 12-percent opportunity cost of capital. The present value of discounted project
financial benefits was estimated at Rs 6.4 billion distributed among watershed services
(20 percent), plantations (40 percent), agriculture (33 percent), and enhanced livelihoods
(7 percent). Total project costs, including contingencies, were Rs 6.8 billion. Beyond the
project implementation period, annual recurrent costs and replacement costs are provided
for the assets like water harvesting infrastructures. Financial analysis was done at market
prices. The estimated financial rate of return (FRR) for the project as a whole is 17.7
percent and the Net Present Value is Rs 2.4 billion.

3.3.2 Economic analysis was conducted after making appropriate adjustments to financial
benefits and costs. Economic project costs are estimated at Rs 6.1 billion after adjusting
for transfers, taxes, subsidies, and converting financial prices to economic prices.
Economic prices for internationally traded commodities (e.g., fertilizer, paddy and wheat)
are derived and applied. The difference in economic and market prices for fertilizers and
use of human labor by small farm holders in the project area has resulted in economic
rate of return (ERR) marginally lower than financial rate of return. The present value of
discounted project benefits over the project life, due to the project interventions, are
estimated at Rs 5.4 billion distributed among watershed services (21 percent), plantations
(42 percent), agriculture (31 percent), and enhanced livelihoods (6 percent). The
estimated economic rate of return for the project as a whole is 16.7 percent, which aligns
well with the estimate at appraisal of 16.9 percent. The Net Present Value at 12 percent
opportunity cost of capital for 30-year project life is Rs 1.8 billion.

3.3.3 The decentralized comprehensive watershed development approach adopted by the
project is cost effective. Water harvesting structures and resource conservation
investments under Gramya I and SLEM, covering irrigation tanks, DLT works, irrigation
channel, plantations, and village ponds were analyzed and compared with similar
publicly funded investments. Community-led investments generated asset creation with
unit costs (at 2013 prices) from 2 to 57 percent higher (in the case of plantations,
irrigation tanks, village ponds and DLT works) and 4 percent lowers (in case of irrigation
channels). However, in terms of performance, plantations registered a 45 percent
survival rate in the Gramya I/SLEM areas, as against no survival in the control areas.
The economic life of community-led assets under Gramya I increased by 40 to 100
percent, when compared to the control. Annual operation and maintenance cost in
Gramya I/SLEM areas also 60 to 67 percent less than the control areas. Annual
amortized investment costs and O&M costs together were 10 to 30 percent less,
compared to the control.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 Gramya I, which was augmented by the SLEM, was highly relevant to India’s
development priorities by supporting participatory water and natural resources
management, rainfed agriculture, and GP capacity development. The project met almost
all targets and even exceeded some, with key development outcomes in the increase in
water discharge rate, area under irrigation, biomass production, crop diversification (in
particular, production and productivity of high-value vegetable crops), rural income, and
participation of women and Vulnerable Groups in local governance. The GEO targets
were also met or exceeded. The SLEM contributed to the reduction of GHGs emissions
from reduced forest fires, reduced fuelwood extraction and burning, and reduced soil
erosion (loss of soil carbon). In addition, there was a rejuvenation of ecosystem services
(e.g., hydrological flows), and increase in biodiversity. The efficiency of the UDWDP
and the SLEM was substantial, as the economic rate of return met the estimate at
appraisal. These investments are also likely to be sustained by GPs, VPs, user groups,
SHGs, and farmer federations, all of which were supported extensively by Gramya I and
SLEM.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Both Gramya I and SLEM supported women, marginal land holders, landless, and
other vulnerable households in the targeted GPs by providing the Vulnerable Group funds
as well as facilitating their participation into the mainstream project activities in livestock
and agribusiness. The transhumant populations in the targeted GPs were given livestock
production, human health and education support through the Transhumant Action Plan.

3.5.2 Poverty impacts. Implemented in the hills districts, where 38.5 percent of the
population lives below the poverty line, Gramya I and the SLEM were clearly poverty
focused. Socio-economic status was one of the project selection criteria for GPs, and
about 45 percent of the households in the targeted GPs were small and marginal farmers.
When compared to the control group, project HH real incomes increased by 17 percent,
exceeding the PDO indicator. These farmers benefitted from the major Gramya I
interventions in soil conservation, water harvesting, terrace repair, agriculture
demonstrations, and agribusiness support. As a result, when compared to without-project,
per hectare revenue for rainfed crops increased by 44 percent.

3.5.3 Moreover, Gramya I also supported the 8,819 poorest of poor, including women,
marginal farmers (whose lands were too scattered for the above interventions), and
landless, with the Vulnerable Group fund, which increased their income by 30 percent
(on average). The fund was an integral part of the GPWDP, and the GPs were
accountable for its management. Each GP identified the fund beneficiaries through
participatory rural appraisal (PRA) during the GPWDP preparation, supported
procurement, and ensured environment and social safeguard compliance. . About 50


                                              16
percent of the Vulnerable Group activities were in livestock, such as dairy, poultry, and
goat rearing, which was followed by the service sector activities (e.g., party tent
house/equipment rental and shops). The SLEM also had the Vulnerable Group fund
provision, which benefitted 2,470 persons, who were mobilized in SHGs under the
Gramya I prior to the Mid-term Review thus did not initiate entrepreneurial activities (see
Section 2.2). 29 percent of these beneficiaries undertook tent house rental, 27 percent
managed gharats, and 9 percent reared livestock. The SLEM was truly pro-poor, as it also
supported other such SHGs in the climate change mitigation and resilience interventions,
such as reducing dependency on natural resource base (e.g., pine needle briquetting and
biogas) and conserving biodiversity (e.g., medicinal and aromatic plant cultivation).
Additional 5,565 vulnerable persons benefitted from the alternative livelihood
opportunities.

3.5.4 Gender. Both Gramya I and SLEM had substantial gender outcomes in local
governance and livelihood development. Women’s participation in GPWDP or MWDP
planning and implementation was fostered by 1,017 women village motivators, who were
recruited from within the targeted villages. Gramya I established women’s Aam Sabha at
the GP level to ensure women were effectively represented and participated in decision
making discussions at Gram Sabha in GPWDP or MWDP planning. In implementing
GPWDPs or MWDPs, women ward members were co-signatories in fund management in
every targeted GP, and women were actively engaged in PME (detailed below in Social
Development).

3.5.5 In livelihood development under Gramya I, about 50 percent of the Vulnerable
Group fund beneficiaries were women, while it was about 70 percent under the SLEM.
In Gramya I-established processing centers, 42 percent of the processors were women
SHG members (more than 2,800 women). The SLEM’s alternative livelihood
development was women focused, in particular, pine needle briquetting: all of the 2,800
beneficiaries under this activity were women. Women also played a key role in the
assisted natural oak regeneration, preservation and maintenance. This was one of
SLEM’s key activities in climate change mitigation and resilience in the forestry sector.

3.5.6 Women’s active engagement in the project activities resulted in their increasing
participation in local public administration. Fifty percent of GP representatives were
women (while the national average was 33 percent). In the Panchayat elections, 304
village-level project staff (village motivators or account assistants) and project-formed
SHG or FIG members were elected for various positions in PRIs. Some 73 percent of
those elected were women (detailed in Annex 2).

3.5.7 Social development. As described above, the project’s participatory approach
effectively engaged with Vulnerable Groups, particularly women, in local governance
and livelihood development. The project design emphasized a natural resource
management approach in GPWDP and MWDP preparation and implementation, which
was successfully demonstrated within hydrological boundaries of micro-watersheds and
completely executed by communities under the overall guidance of PRIs in which the
participatory approach provided an integral part. There was proper accountability in



                                            17
terms of benefit sharing of all resources, built in the micro plan at the design stage. The
PME improved communication between the project and beneficiaries, in particular,
women and other Vulnerable Groups in the targeted GPs. PME was facilitated by partner
NGOs and all targeted GPs participated in three rounds of PME. Early in the project,
PME was a tool to improve project awareness, while at later stages it gave voice to GP
members in redressing grievances or undertaking social audits of sub-projects, such as
rural access roads. The PME was considered an effective social accountability tool at the
state level and was adopted by the Bank-financed SWAJAL and the GoI-supported
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). 15

3.5.8 The grievances received through PME were channeled to the project’s grievance
redress mechanism. Some 38 grievances were received (nine were from PME), and all of
them were resolved. The project was also in compliance with the GoI’s Right to
Information Act (detailed in Annex 2).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.9 Both Gramya I and SLEM built GP capacity in participatory decision making,
planning and implementation, transparency and social accountability, financial
management, procurement, and safeguards. Gramya I also formed a number of
community-level institutions, including water user groups, FIGs and SHGs (see Section
3.2). The project also provided GP and these group members with various training and
exposure visits. These were enhanced by the SLEM, which engaged 20 in- and out-of-
state organizations, including academic institutions in water, agriculture, forestry, and
other sectors (detailed in the Annex 2). The group members actively participated in PME
and held the GP accountable for GPWDP or MWDP implementation.

3.5.9 Gramya I initiated Van Panchayat (VP, village forest council) capacity building in
maintaining plantations and drainage lines in reserve forests. The SLEM scaled this up by
engaging VPs in MWDP planning and implementation. The VPs were strengthened at the
policy level by the Government Order of December 2009.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.10 Gramya I informed GoI in developing the Common Guidelines for Watershed
Development Projects in 2008, 16 in particular, on the aspects of rainfed agriculture
development in combination of watershed treatment technologies (rain water harvesting,
etc.), decentralization, participatory approach, and inclusiveness (gender as well as
resource poor).

3.5.11 Because of the introduction of high value vegetable crop production, there was
feedback from the beneficiaries that the targeted GPs had better food and nutrition
security, even among vulnerable households and that reverse migration was observed in

some project GPs. 17 It was also observed that the improved farming practices
demonstrated by Gramya I were replicated by farmers in non-targeted GPs, and that there
were increasing access by targeted farmers to other government programs, such as
subsidy for poly house. 18

3.5.12 Gramya I has provided climate change mitigation and resilience co-benefits, by
inducing crop diversification and introducing locally relevant appropriate technologies,
like pine needle briquetting. The SLEM was designed to further increase the co-benefits
in the selected 20 Gramya I micro-watersheds, with the GEF grant allocated by the
Sustainable Land and Ecosystem Management Country Partnership Program in India.
The SLEM took four years from concept to appraisal (from 2005 to 2009), because India
SLEM CPP was approved in end-2007 by the GEF Council. The Uttarakhand SLEM was
effective in November 2009.

3.5.13. The SLEM planned to undertake a study on the climate change impact on
mountain ecosystems and develop a mitigation strategy. These were not completed
because of delay caused by the limited capacity in developing highly technical ToRs.
This was also coupled with the delay in state government clearance and identification of
an appropriate institution to conduct the study. The shelving of this study was
unfortunate given emerging scientific evidence of the decline of mountain forests in the
Himalayas as a result of increased mean ambient temperatures in recent decades. 19

3.6 Summary of Findings of Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Both Gramya I and SLEM organized exit workshops at the division and GP levels,
with various stakeholders, including Gram Pradhans (GP heads), account assistants,
water user groups, FIGs, and SHGs. A number of positive comments were made on (a)
the participatory approach e.g., decision making in open meetings, (b) transparency on
budget and work progress, (c) employment opportunities in the village through civil
works, agriculture interventions, and self-employment for women and Vulnerable Groups,
(d) learning through exposure visits to universities and research institutes, (e) project
interventions in natural resource management e.g., increasing water availability, and (f)
the importance given to women’s involvement (detailed in the Annex 5).
4.    Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1     The risk to development and global environment outcomes is moderate. Because
of the cost sharing, the beneficiaries have an incentive to maintain the water harvest
structures and/or demonstration plots. A Government Order was issued in December
2011 to hold GPs accountable for sustainability of the assets created by Gramya I and the

SLEM, such as water harvesting structures and livelihood activities by the Vulnerable
Groups. This is bounded by Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between
WMD and the targeted GPs. The Water user groups will maintain the water harvesting
structures, because of their own investment through cost sharing. The users also saved
and used some of the funds for operation and maintenance during the Gramya I
implementation. The livelihoods activities are highly likely to continue, as 90 percent of
these activities have been sustained for more than two years. SLEM’s alternative
livelihood activities, such as gharat, medicinal and aromatic plants, and pine needle
briquetting, are also likely to continue, as there is effective market demand for these
goods and works. Both Gramya I and SLEM also made substantial investments in
building GP administrative capacity in GPWDP and MWDP participatory planning and
sub-project management.        This translated into increased participation and fund
disbursement by GPs in the implementation of GoI- or other donor-financed projects. 20
The participatory approach in local governance would likely be maintained in targeted
GPs with the 304 project-related staff at village level that was elected for local
government positions.

4.2     However, there remains a need for technical support to FIGs and agribusinesses to
improve their institutional capacity and ensure their economic sustainability. Because of
the delays in the initial Gramya I implementation, some farmer federations were not fully
operational at project closing. The proposed Gramya II would build farmer federation
capacity in self-managing value addition and marketing and scale up the activities begun
under Gramya I.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank team ensured that Gramya I incorporated the lessons learned from the
relevant Bank-supported projects in Uttarakhand (e.g., IWDP, DASP, and SWALAJ), in
supporting the State Government’s decentralization and agribusiness pilot. The project
design strengthened GP administrative capacity building through the participatory WDP
planning and implementation. The design also incorporated development of an
agribusiness model that built on increased water availability through watershed treatment
and source sustainability by demonstrations and extension services, FIG mobilization,
and engagement of NGO DSAs at the district level. The SLEM strengthened climate
change mitigation and resilience in Gramya I design by piloting ridge-to-valley treatment
in watersheds, including land degradation control and increased source sustainability, and
alternative livelihoods that supported reducing dependence on the natural resource base,
thereby conserving biodiversity. The project design was complex overall with the
mobilization of a number of village-based groups in implementing GPWDPs and the



20
     This was observed by senior government officials (source: January 2011 mission Aide Memoire).


                                                    20
varieties of interventions in the watershed, agriculture, horticulture, livestock and service
sectors. Nevertheless, both Gramya I and the SLEM achieved substantial results. In
hindsight, the Bank team could have made more allowances at appraisal for physical and
price contingencies.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2 The Bank invested in 245 staff weeks in support of the Gramya I and SLEM
implementations. 12 implementation support missions were carried out, and additional
technical support was provided by the Delhi-based Bank team in social mobilization and
institution development, water management, irrigation, forestry, agriculture, financial
management, procurement, and safeguards. Considering the complexity in implementing
this multi-sectoral project, the Bank’s implementation support was adequate. While the
emphasis on the participatory approach was maintained and strengthened through the
social accountability tools, such as PME, the Bank team took opportunities to enhance
the balance between participation/CDD and science/technologies in watershed treatment
by supporting WMD to strengthen rainfed agriculture development 21 and outcome data
collection and analysis in hydrology and other technical aspects. The ridge-to-valley
watershed treatment was initiated in Gramya I, including land degradation control and
water source treatment at the micro-watershed level. The Bank team supported its scale-
up by mobilizing the GEF grant and, at the same time, piloted alternative livelihood
activities that enhanced climate change mitigation and resilience in the mountain
ecosystem.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.3 Overall Bank performance is rated Satisfactory. The team provided adequate
implementation support and follow-up, in particular, technical assistance from the Delhi
office. The team took opportunities to enhance project outcomes by strengthening the
watershed development outputs and proactively addressing bottlenecks in slow
disbursement and project staffing at MTR. The SLEM was an innovative pilot, which
enhanced Gramya I’s design in climate change mitigation and resilience through land
degradation control and improved water source sustainability.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 GoUK was highly committed to Gramya I and the SLEM. Drawing lessons
learned from Gramya I and SLEM implementation, the GoUK prepared the Perspective
and Strategic Plan 2009-2027, which aims to treat 537 micro-watersheds by 2027.
Moreover, the GoUK provided 15 percent more counterpart financing (about US$3

                                                    21
million) than agreed in Gramya I project documents. 22 Also, in support of Gramya I and
SLEM implementation and sustainability, GoUK issued two Government Orders, which
(a) allowed VPs to manage plantations and natural resource conservation in reserve
forests and (b) ensured the responsibility of the maintenance of the assets created by these
projects. The GoUK prioritized adequate staffing of a multi-disciplinary team at WMD
by enabling secondments from relevant departments, despite an overall staffing shortage
in the state. 23

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2 WMD implemented the predecessor IWDP and strengthened Gramya I
implementation by contracting 10 partner NGOs in project management, GP mobilization,
and the agribusiness pilot. WMD also capitalized on the experienced and dedicated
project staff at the state and division levels and ensured staff at the village and GP levels,
such as women village motivators and youth account assistants, were adequately trained
in the project’s concept and activities. Despite the complex project design and the
enhancement by the SLEM, there was no confusion among the project staff in the project
implementation. Moreover, the WMD initiated and scaled up the innovative alternative
livelihood activities by reviving local traditions with improved technologies, such as pine
needle briquetting, gharat, and bamboo baskets. These activities were truly in line with
the climate change mitigation and resilience and gave opportunities to WMD to build
capacity in this important emerging subject.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3 Overall Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory. The Borrower was
committed to watershed development and had strong ownership in the project as
evidenced by the higher than expected counterpart contributions and the various
Government Orders issued to ensure sustainability.
6. Lessons Learned

6.1   The project provides the following lessons learned in project design and
implementation:

•       Fiscal decentralization and community empowerment are necessary but not
sufficient to promote improved community management of natural resources. The
massive increase in transfers from GoI to PRIs potentially provides communities,


22
   The agreed counterpart financing for Gramya I was US$ 19.1 million (US$ 16.62 million for the original
project and US$ 2.51 million for the Additional Financing). GoUK contribution amounted to US$ 22
million. There was no counterpart financing for SLEM.
23
   The Government of Uttarakhand is building human resource capacity since the independence from Uttar
Pradesh in 2000. There also were staff exchange issues with the Government of Uttar Pradesh, but this was
resolved in the second year of project implementation (2005).


                                                   22
particularly GPs, with a source of funds for needed watershed treatment. Successful
implementation of GPWDPs also requires training in financial management as well as
technical knowledge transfer to GPs to both maintain and sustain these investments.
Gramya I promoted a participatory approach in preparing and implementing GPWDPs,
which strengthened GP administrative capacity, including social accountability. The
youth engagement was particularly effective as account assistants. The participatory
approach also fostered ownership among water users, FIGs, SHGs, and the Vulnerable
Group in targeted GPs, which helps to ensure the sustainability of project investments.

•      Science and cutting-edge technology in hydrology cannot be overemphasized:
watershed development should balance participation and science in its design and
implementation. The Gramya I was designed and implemented with an emphasis on
decentralization and participation, which was appropriate considering the GoUK priority
at the design phase. However, science and technology should not be compromised in
GPWDP or MWDP development/implementation and outcome monitoring in the results
framework. The science and technology were enhanced in the project design and
implementation and highlighted in the results framework in the proposed Gramya II,
without compromising the participatory approach.

•       Watershed development projects are a relevant response to the needed
increase in rainfed agricultural productivity in India. GPWDP investments increased
the water holding capacity, and comprehensive watershed treatment at the micro-
watershed level, including reserve forests, has proven effective by SLEM, in sustaining
natural water source. Building on these investments, Gramya I demonstrated the
effectiveness of rainwater conservation and harvesting in rainfed areas, when combined
with improved seeds and management practices. More attempts must be made to quantify
costs and benefits relative to alternative interventions. Impact evaluation and economic
analyses of Gramya I quantified the relevant costs and benefits accruing to the GPWDPs
and by WMD in watershed development and considered these relative to alternatives.

•        Revival of traditional energy sources can address climate change mitigation,
boost resilience and contribute to livelihoods. Gramya I initiated pine needle
briquetting, which was scaled up by the SLEM. The SLEM piloted other traditional
activities, such as gharat power generation, natural regeneration of oak, and bamboo
basket making, and promoted local plants. All these activities demonstrated the potential
for not only increased incomes, but also diversified income sources, thereby contributing
to added resilience of livelihood and market options, which were developed in
partnership with the public and private sectors.

The PDO Indicator 5 was “20 percent improvement in administrative capacity of GPs as
measured by performance indicators”. The project exceeded its target in all of these
performance indicators, in particular, inclusion of women and Vulnerable Groups in
decision making: participation of women in Gram Sabha meetings (from 11 percent at
baseline to 45 percent at the end of the project); and that of Vulnerable Groups (from 16
percent to 32 percent). The performance indicators and achievements by mid-term and
the end of the project were as follows:

Targeting: The number of targeted GPs was four percent more than originally planned,
while the area under the treatment was about 21.7 percent less than originally planned.
According to the PAD, Gramya I was to support 450 GPs in 19 development blocks to
treat 300,000 ha in 76 target micro-watersheds in the following 19 development blocks:
Augustmuni, Bageshwar, Bhikiyasain, Chinyalisaur, Choukhutiya, Dwarhat, Dwarikhal,
Gairsain, Gangolihat, Garur, Jaiharikhal, Jaunpur, Kalsi, Kapkot, Karnprayag, Lohaghat,
Munakot, Thouldhar, and Vin. Gramya I was not implemented in Bhikiyasain,
Karnprayag, Munakot, and Vin but in Barakot, Dhari, and Okhalkhanda instead (in 18
blocks in total). In maintaining the number of targeted GPs at 450, the target area was
adjusted to 234,000 ha (22 percent less than originally planned) in 18 blocks in June 2007
(acknowledged in the June 2007 mission Aide Memoire). In the revised target areas,
118,000 ha of land was available (excluding reserve forest), which was composed of
67,000 ha of arable land, 25,000 ha of non-arable land, 5,000 ha of bio-carbon forestry,
5,000 ha of degraded un-demarcated forest, and 16,000 ha of inter-GP areas. At the Mid-
term Review in November 2008, the number of targeted GPs was increased to 468 (four
percent more than originally planned) to fully treat the target 76 micro-watersheds.

Component A. Participatory Watershed Development and Management

Sub-component A.1. Promotion of social mobilization and community driven
decision making.

Under Gramya I, all targeted 468 GPs had prepared watershed development plans
(GPWDPs) by 2010 (Table A2.4), and ensured participation by the poorest of poor and
socially marginalized (including marginal farmers, landless, women, and scheduled
castes/tribes). Within the envelope of about US$ 80,000 per GP, 65 percent of the sub-
grants were invested in water and natural resource management, such as soil conservation,
drainage line treatment, and water harvesting (outputs detailed in the Table A2.5). Some
80 percent of households in the targeted GPs participated in the GPWDP preparation.

Building on Gramya I’s efforts, SLEM supported 125 GPs in preparing and
implementing 20 MWDPs, which focused on land degradation control, water source



                                            28
sustainability, and forestry by treating inter-GP area, most of which were reserve forests.
All 20 MWDPs were prepared in a participatory manner by 2011.

Sub-component A.2. Watershed treatments and village development.

The Table A2.5 summarizes key outputs by the GPWDP and MWDP implementation.
The UDWDP was more focused on soil conservation and drainage line treatment, water
harvesting structures, afforestation, and fodder management in the targeted GP areas. On
the other hand, SLEM, because of its emphasis on the ridge-to-valley treatment in reserve
forests, invested more on forestry (in particular, assisted natural regeneration of oak
forests), off-farm soil conservation (contour trenches and retaining wall), and water
source rejuvenation (rainfall runoff capture and infiltration ponds and village ponds,
which recharge springs and irrigation water).

                Box.1 Rejuvenation of traditional natural water sources

Residents of Selalekh GP in Nainital District faced domestic water scarcity due to
reduced discharge in four traditional natural water sources in the area. Water was
available only for seven months annually. Community-led catchment treatment of the
area was undertaken by the Van Panchayat. Under the SLEM, four village ponds, 1,166
staggered contour trenches, 8 vegetative check dams, 63 dry stone check dams, and 9
crate wire check dams were constructed. Local species, such as oak, bhimal, utees,
majnu, tejpat, along with lemon grass, were planted on 5 ha. Climate change over recent
decades appears to be favoring the invasion of pine species in areas that were previously
dominated by oak species. The assisted natural regeneration of oak forests thereby
contributes to conserving natural ecosystem level species diversity.
This treatment resulted in the revival of four traditional water sources. The project
impacts were as follows:

 •   Average water discharge increased from 7.5 to 12.6 lpm.
 •   Water discharge is sustained throughout the year.
 •   The households dependent on traditional water sources increased from 122 to 127.
 •   Before the project, women walked an average distance of 1.5 km per trip to fetch
     water due to low discharge (seven months) and no discharge (five months). They
     now have access to the revived traditional water sources in the villages throughout
     the year.

Moreover, the improved soil moisture regime in middle and lower ridges and project led
irrigation tank investments effected change in irrigated crop pattern towards high value
seasonal/off-seasonal vegetables.

Similar evidence is also documented by the project in other villages and GPs in Nainital
and Agastyamuni Divisions. 24 Box 2 assesses the impact of watershed treatment under
the SLEM.
                   Box. 2 Watershed treatment impacts of SLEM

Under SLEM, MWDPs were prepared and implemented by the targeted GPs. Technical
and social facilitation was provided by the project. This has resulted in greater
sensitization of the community to issues of natural resource conservation and sustainable
management. The project has documented the watershed treatment impacts in Tala
Kanda, Katna,Thali and Selalekh GPs of Nainital Division. Comprehensive treatment
using integrated watershed approach was followed by carrying out soil moisture control,
drainage line treatment, afforestation, water harvesting, and river bank protection works.
This has helped in arresting 580 MT of soil loss and providing protection to 15.5 ha of
farm land, which is currently cultivated with 200 percent cropping intensity.

In maintaining these investments, Gramya I formed almost 2,000 water user groups of
more than 15,800 farmers for water harvesting structures. Ninety percent of these groups
started saving, which amounted to Rs. 1.6 million (approximately US$ 32,000). About 20
percent of these savings were used to maintain irrigation tanks and channels. Moreover,
SLEM built capacity of Van Panchayats (VPs, village forest councils) in maintaining the
investments in reserve forests, including plantations and drainage lines. While the reserve
forests are under the State Forestry Department, VPs were authorized to work there by
the Government Order (Box 3).

      Box 3. Government Order allowed Van Panchayats to treat reserve forests

 A first of its kind Government Order, dated December 2, 2009 and allowing the VPs to
 work in reserve forest areas within the watershed, added to effective implementation of
 the project activities. VPs manage village forests and are among the oldest institutions
 in the state: they were created under the Indian Forest Act of 1927. The VP executive is
 an elected body of the villagers, and the usufruct and revenue-sharing arrangements are
 defined by the rules known as Uttarakhand Van Panchayat Niyamawali, 2005. VPs are
 also the solely authorized institutions which can act as partners with the Forest and other
 Departments under Joint Forest Management. During the SLEM implementation, GoUK
 initiated this unique model which enabled holistic treatment of micro-watersheds.

Component B. Enhancing Livelihood Opportunities

Under this component, Gramya I provided demonstrations of improved technologies in
agriculture, horticulture and livestock, and piloted agribusiness development. Gramya I
also piloted pine needle briquetting to reduce fuel wood dependency, which was scaled
up by SLEM. The SLEM also piloted other alternative livelihood activities that would
reduce pressure and dependence on natural resource base, including biogas installation,
gharat revival (traditional water mills with coupled, modern electricity micro generators),
solar energy, and medicinal and aromatic plant cultivation. Both Gramya I and SLEM
provided small grants to Vulnerable Groups in support of their entrepreneurial activities.

Sub-component B.1. Farming systems improvement

This sub-component built on the increased water availability in irrigated and rainfed areas
and other Gramya I investments, such as 242,164 m3 terrace repair. It supported transfer
of improved technology with a focus on agribusiness development in selected 327 GPs
(about 70 percent of all targeted GPs). This included forming 690 FIGs and providing
demonstrations on high-value crops and off-season vegetables.

FIGs and farmer federations. In forming FIGs, the sub-component clustered two to
three villages and provided demonstrations on one to two crops for bulk production.
Gramya I also built FIG capacity by training 2,070 FIG members on group formation,
accounting and record keeping, and bank linkage. More than 8,000 farmers saved a total
of Rs. 285 million (approximately US$ 5.7 million). Moreover, 85 percent of these FIGs
were aggregated into 27 farmer federations, all of which were registered under the Self
Reliant Cooperative Act, 2003. Table A2.6 provides FIG and farmer federation
breakdown by division.

Demonstration of improved technologies. The sub-component provided agribusiness
input support worth Rs. 13,000 per ha (approximately US$ 260 per ha) 25 through
demonstrations. Demonstration outputs included: high-value crops (3,105 ha), off-season
vegetables (3,081 ha), bio/vermi compost (4,805 demonstrations), poly-tunnel (1,247
demonstrations), and poly-house (834 demonstrations). 26 These demonstrations covered
about 50 percent of the project areas under irrigation and were co-financed by FIGs,
amounting to US$ 3.2 million. 27 The demonstrations, combined with the increased water
availability (by the sub-component A.2), resulted in cultivation of high-value crops in
7,464 ha (Table A2.7). As a result of these demonstrations, the farmer federations
produced and sold 41,474 tons of high-value crops and off-season vegetables. Prior to the
UDWDP, these crops were not cultivated in the targeted GPs.

protection equipment, crates and packaging material, etc.
26
   There were also other demonstrations related to tree crops, such as orchard development (2,121 ha) and
community fruit plantation (453 ha).
27
   The beneficiary contributions were 20 percent for poly house and poly tunnel and 30 percent for other
demonstrations, such as compact area, vermi-compost pit, high-value crops, seasonal and off-season
vegetables, and community fruit plantation.

percent increase in fodder availability in the targeted GPs. The fodder strips have the
added benefit of trapping nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that are susceptible
to removal via surface runoff, leaching and/or erosion and converting these nutrients into
high value fodder thereby increasing not only total production but also the nutrient use
efficiency of production. This issue is important because lost nitrogen can result in the
emission of nitrous oxide – a greenhouse gas that is 310 times more potent than CO2.

Livestock. In improving breeds, Gramya I set up 265 natural breeding centers and 71
artificial insemination centers. The natural breeding centers were established with 15
percent beneficiary contributions. These centers produced a total of 20,527 improved
breed animals with average success rate of 58.3 percent (Table A2.8).

The sub-component also introduced stall feeding and provided 5,066 animal shelters,
3,925 mangers and 1,105 chaff cutters. In enhancing animal health, the project vaccinated
225,979 livestock against animal diseases. There was no outbreak of major animal
diseases during the project implementation.

Sub-component B.2. Value addition and marketing support

This was originally a pilot activity, yet it substantially contributed to an increase in rural
income in 327 targeted GPs and sustainability of the project investments. With the
implementation support from six DSAs, the 27 farmer federations produced and sold
41,474 tons of high value crops and off-season vegetables, which include 775.94 tons of
processed products at a total value of Rs. 486 million (approximately US$ 9.7 million).
These produce and products were sold not only at the local markets but also in urban
centers in the region, such as Delhi and Lucknow, through 17 private and public entities
(see a list of partners in the sub-component C.3).

Value addition. The sub-component set up 19 processing centers, which collected fresh
produce from 414 FIGs (84 percent of the targeted GPs for agribusiness) and produced
775.94 tons of processed products, which were graded, packaged, and sold with local




                                                 34
brand names 28. These were income generation activities, which emerged as a result of
Gramya I interventions. About 70 percent of these centers were established between 2009
and 2010. Forty-two percent of FIG/SHG members working in the processing centers
were women. In Augustmuni and Dwarahat divisions, women involvement was about 80
percent (Table A2.9). The SHGs were formed as a part of the Vulnerable Group
assistance prior to the Mid-term Review. The project, thus, created additional
employment opportunities in the villages, in particular, for vulnerable women.

 Each division made its own local brand. For example, Augustmuni used Mandakani Valley Fresh, and
Gangolihat had Hill Fresh. Lohaghat and Kotdwar branded themselves with the project name (Gramya
Masala and Gramya Fresh, respectively).

Sub-component B.3. Income-generating activities for vulnerable groups

Gramya I supported socially and economically marginalized Vulnerable Groups, such as
marginal farmers, landless, and women, by forming SHGs or financing income
generation activities through the Vulnerable Group fund. Building on Gramya I efforts,
the SLEM supported the SHGs in (a) piloting alternative livelihoods to reduce
dependency on natural resource base, including pine needle briquetting, gharats, biogas,
solar energy, medicinal and aromatic plant cultivation, and bamboo basket making, and
(b) financing income generation activities. The impact evaluation and PMU database
documented in detail the multiple impacts (social, environmental, and economic) of the
SLEM interventions in reducing the pressure on natural resources (Box 4). The scaling
up of alternative sources of energy reduced soil erosion and runoff, and increased
infiltration and soil moisture regime contributing to the sustainability of traditional
natural water source discharges. These were other significant environmental impacts
realized in the project villages.

                                Box. 4 Pine needle briquetting
Pine needle briquetting was initiated by Gramya I and scaled up by the SLEM. In the
targeted GPs located near pine forests, 665 briquette-making machines were acquired and
some 6,600 women were trained to operate them. SLEM, in particular, supported 192
SHGs, which produced about 420 MT of briquettes. 80 percent of the production was
consumed at the households (approximately 336 MT), while the remaining 20 percent
was sold for about Rs. 3 million (approximately US$ 50,000). The briquettes reduced the
fuelwood use by about six percent per producer household, which saved approximately
11 woman days per annum in collecting fuelwood in the forests. The SLEM trained the
women SHGs on the pine needle collection, coupled with plantation management and fire
control in reserve forests. As a result, by the project closure the fire affected areas were
reduced by 61 percent.

Some controls on the extraction of pine needles will likely be necessary to avoid
interference in the natural carbon and nutrient cycles. Nonetheless, the modest removal
of pine needles for fuel briquetting appears to be more than compensated by reduced
carbon and nutrient losses as a result of the reduced need for fuelwood and reduced forest
fire incidences in the dry season due to flammable pine needle forest littler.

SLEM survey of 25 SHGs involved in pine briquette production (Harsila, Uttrauda,
Gairkhet and Baisani GPs in Bageshwar division) documented that all these SHGs
produced and used 7.7 MT of briquettes annually, which helped the estimated CO2
reduction of 26 MT. Furthermore, over a period of three years (2010/11 to 2012/13),
they produced and marketed 78 MT of pine briquettes. The annual pine needle fall in the
forest is 4.6 MT per ha of pine forest. By using up 150 MT of pine needle waste, the
SHGs cleared 33 ha of forest area, where other plant species, such as fodder for cattle,
were able to regenerate.

                                             36
Gharats. The SLEM supported 78 SHGs (418 members, 23 percent of them were
women) in renovating gharats. With the rehabilitation and the increase in water
availability, the milling capacity of these gharats increased by 32 percent, and the income
of the SHG members increased by 28 percent. By using water power as an alternative
source of energy, the potential savings on diesel was estimated as 78,247 liters per annum.
Moreover, with the technical support from the Uttarakhand Renewable Energy
Development Agency, these gharats were able to generate electricity: one gharat reported
generation of 2.5 KW of clean energy, which was locally distributed.

Biogas. The SLEM installed 66 biogas plants in the targeted GPs. Some 66 user groups
of 990 households were formed. Biogas from animal manure reduces methane and
nitrous oxide emissions, while providing energy for cooking, thereby requiring less
fuelwood. The biogas reduced the use of fuelwood by about 75 percent per household
and generated savings of Rs. 5,900 per household (about US$ 100). This translated into
estimated savings of about 25 MT of biomass in the forest, which was estimated to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 140 tons. The residual substrate from the biogas
plants is an excellent fertilizer that enhances crop and fruit tree yields (Box 5).

                         Box. 5 Biogas as an alternative fuel

The SLEM has supported the installation of 124 units of floating drum type biogas
models in the project villages. Each unit is of 3 m3 capacity, costing Rs 41,000 (2012
prices). Biogas production is sufficient to meet the household demands except in winter,
when fuel wood is used (mid-Nov to mid-Feb).
Environmental gains: The household dependency on fuelwood as energy source is 100
percent without the project. With project, biogas reduced fuelwood use by 75 percent. In
Uttrauda GP, installation of 17 biogas plants in 2011 and 2012 reduced resulted in a
reduction of 35 MT in CO2 emissions. Annually, 230 MT of cattle dung used in the
biogas plants is now recycled into 563 MT of slurry, a by-product which improves the
soil texture and water holding capacity in 8 ha of farm lands. This has increased
vegetable production by about 20 percent.

Social impacts: Based on the SLEM primary survey, saving in collection of firewood,
cooking and cleaning of utensils are estimated at 3 hrs per day. After netting out time
needed for biogas plants, net saving of 2.5 hrs per woman per household is reported.
Overall annual drudgery firewood collection has decreased from 120 days to 35 days for
these women. Saved time has high opportunity social cost for household activities and
economic cost in other income generating activities.

Economic benefits: Each biogas plant is annually producing the equivalent of about 14
LPG cylinders per household. Annual production of slurry per plant is 3.5 MT. Net
annual returns from each biogas plant are estimated at Rs 10,550.

Solar energy. Another clean energy promoted by the SLEM was solar energy. The
project provided 3,378 solar lanterns, 190 solar street lights, and 69 solar cookers in the
targeted GPs.

Medicinal and aromatic plants. The SLEM piloted cultivation of 12 medicinal and
aromatic plants in targeted rainfed areas, including ginger, turmeric, stevia, aloe vera,
lemon grass, aonla, cardamom, stevia, satavar, sarpgandha, rosemary, and tejpatta.
Nineteen nurseries were set up on 582 ha of targeted rainfed areas, including 1.25 ha of
barren land. Some 179 FIGs were formed and 247 poly houses were set up. Market
linkages were created for ginger and turmeric. The production of ginger and turmeric
reached 1.3 MT and 5.3 MT respectively, which generated net household income of Rs.
15,346 (about US$ 256) and Rs. 8,681 (about US$ 145), respectively. In addition,
Hedychium spicatum (locally known as Kapur Kachari or Sathi in Ayurvedic classics, is
documented for the treatment of cough, hiccup, fever and asthma) plantation was piloted
in the targeted GPs. 29 The cultivation of medicinal and aromatic species is especially
relevant for the protection of these species from predatory harvests that deplete the
natural gene pool.

Bamboo basket making. Building on the 33 ha bamboo plantation financed under
Gramya I, 15 SHGs (77 beneficiaries, 31 percent of them were women) used Vulnerable
Group funds for bamboo basket making. Local controlled harvests of native bamboo for
basket making contributed to preservation of age-old basket weaving traditions and value
addition to local botanical resources and set the right incentive for sustainable
management of bamboo.

Vulnerable group funds. Gramya I and SLEM supported almost 11,300 vulnerable
persons in the targeted GPs. Both projects provided enterprise development training and
a one-time grant to enhance income generation activities at a total cost of Rs. 95 million
(approximately US$ 1.6 million). Overall, women comprised 54 percent of the
Vulnerable Group fund beneficiaries. However, the SLEM alone accounted for 71
percent, because of its targeting of women SHGs formed under Gramya I. About one-
half of the income generation activities in Gramya I were livestock (e.g., dairy, poultry,
and goat rearing). These vulnerable populations also benefitted from investments in
fodder development, natural breed improvement, and stall feeding. In the SLEM, the tent
rental (29 percent) and gharat (27 percent) were the most popular activities.




29
  The plant was highly traded from the Himalayan region, as its rhizome was used in Ayurvedic and Unani
medicine. Haphazard harvesting in natural forests was resulting in depletion of the native gene pool. By
planting the species in deforested and degraded areas, the communities were not only conserving the native
germplasm but also providing and more controlled and reliable source of raw material and have secured a
more favorable contract for the supply of Hedychium root to local pharmaceutical industries. This would be
followed up by the proposed Gramya II.

Component C. Institutional Strengthening

Sub-component C.1. Capacity building of Gram Panchayats and local community
institutions

Each targeted GP under Gramya I managed approximately US$ 100,000 in implementing
the GPWDP, including the Vulnerable Group fund. 30 The project provided extensive
orientation training at the village and division levels, on the watershed concept, budget
envelope, participatory planning and implementation, financial management, and
safeguards. Gramya I also provided technical training to more than 32,000 GP members
and female village motivators (on participatory rural appraisal), 468 youth account
assistants (accounting and auditing), and 7,020 community members (PME). In addition,
more than 60,000 community members and 3,000 project staff had exposure visits in and
outside of Uttarakhand in partnership with academic institutions and specialized
government agencies.

Participatory monitoring and evaluation (PME). Gramya I conducted three rounds of
PME between 2006 and 2012, facilitated by the FNGOs. All 468 targeted GPs
participated in at least two rounds. A 15-member PME team was established in each GP,
representing project beneficiaries. 31 The team obtained feedback from community
members, initially more on project awareness (PDO, GP budget, and expenditure) but
later on inclusiveness in beneficiary selection and benefit sharing. Nine grievances were
filed and resolved through PME (six project related e.g., payment delays, and three staff
related), but there were none in the third round. The PME team also conducted social
audits for the project-financed infrastructure (e.g., irrigation canals, roads).

Active local governance participation. The project’s participatory approach and
capacity building seemed to have encouraged the village-level project staff as well as
various project-formed group members to participate in local government elections. The
results indicate that 304 of them were elected, 73 percent of whom were women. Fifty-
two percent elected Gram Pradhans (GP heads) were either women SHG members or
village motivators. Likewise, 66 percent of Block Development Committee members
were women SHG members, village motivators, or Vulnerable Group activity presidents.
Table A2.10 provides the details.




30
   On the average, the targeted GPs had an allocation of Rs. 4 million (approximately US$ 80,000). The
sub-grant allocation was determined by potential treatment area and populations (70 and 30 percent
weightage respectively). The allocation varied between Rs. 3 to 7 million.
31
   The team is widely represented, including Gram Pradhan, ward member, 2 RVC members, 2 FIG
members, 2 water user group members, 2 Van Panchayat members, 2 VG/SHG members, and 3 community
members.

Sub-component C.2. Information, Education, and Communication (IEC)

The sub-component developed a communication strategy in February 2004. The
communication activities focused on raising awareness in targeted GPs, in particular, on
the project’s objective and participatory approach through various media, including video
and print newsletters, folk theatre and wall paintings. The newsletters, in particular,
facilitated learning and technical knowledge sharing among GPs, in addition to exposure
visits. The project name, Gramya I, was given in local language, which was widely used
and      recognized    by    the     project   beneficiaries.   The     project   website
(http://wmduk.gov.in/index.html) was set up and provided comprehensive information
and implementation update. These activities contributed to the project awareness being as
high as 91 percent.

As a part of knowledge management, SLEM produced 11 good practice notes on natural
resource conservation and land degradation control, which were distributed at local,
division, and state levels. The notes were on: (a) pine needle briquetting, (b) solar lights,
(c) solar cookers, (d) biogas plants, (e) gharat renovation, (f) medicinal and aromatic
plant cultivation, (g) rejuvenation of nala/khala, (h) roof water harvesting, (i) river bank
protection, irrigation tanks and delivery system, (j) village ponds, percolation tank, and
contour trenches with bunds, and (k) forest management (fire control, plantation, and
assisted natural regeneration).

Sub-component C.3. Project coordination, monitoring, and management.

Grievance Redress Mechanism. In 2007, Gramya I established a grievance redress
mechanism and received 38 grievances, 9 of which were received through PME exercises.
They were all addressed at the district level. Following the GoI’s Right to Information
(RTI) Act, Gramya I prepared a citizen charter in 2005 and designated a Public
Information Officer at the state, division, and district levels. A total of 39 appeals were
received and addressed at the state level, while there were 250 requests for information,
which were also addressed at the state level.

Staffing. WMD was slow in staffing Gramya I, completing it only by the Mid-term
Review. The project had 509 posts, about 40 percent of which were occupied by state
government staff through secondments from the Departments of Agriculture, Forestry,
Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Irrigation, and Rural Development. Because the State
of Uttarakhand is a relatively new state, there is an acute shortage of state government
staff, in particular, for the Agriculture and Horticulture Departments. The staffing for
these technical positions was around 70 percent. To ensure project implementation,
WMD contracted various service providers, including NGOs, in overall project
implementation, social mobilization, and PME, and new graduates for junior engineers
and accounting assistants.

Partner agencies. One of the strengths of Gramya I and SLEM was the outreach and
partnership with NGOs, academic institutions, and the private sector. Fifty-five agencies
provided overall project implementation support, social mobilization and PME, value
addition and marketing, and/or technical assistance in water, land degradation control,
agriculture, horticulture, livestock, forestry, and energy (Table A2.11).

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A. ICR Estimation Methodology

The Gramya I and SLEM treated an overall area of 234,787 ha with resource
conservation treatments, by adopting decentralized watershed based ridge-to-valley
approach in 76 MWS’, covering 468 GPs. Out of this, SLEM project adopted much more
comprehensive treatment in 60,823 ha by including the inter-GP areas also. SLEM
project covered 20 MWS’ spread over 125 GPs. The Gramya I supported predominantly
small and marginal farm holdings in the project area. Only 13 percent of the farmers had
access to irrigated land, and the remaining 87 percent depended on rainfed land. Marginal
farmers (< one hectare) comprise some 78 percent of project farmers, of which two-thirds
had less than 0.5 ha.

Project benefits were generated from multiple sources: (i) arable land benefits from
irrigated and rainfed farming, (ii) non-arable land benefits from afforestation,
silvipasture, and fuelwood plantations, (iii) resource conservation benefits from treated
arable and non-arable lands, (iv) improved eco-system services from treated MWS’, (v)
enhanced price margins for farmers due to agri-business linkages, and (vi) improved
livelihood through individual and group income generation activities (IGAs) for resource
poor and vulnerable households in the project MWS’.

The database for the ICR analysis was compiled from Gramya I and SLEM documents,
including (i) study reports compiled periodically by the PMU, (ii) secondary database
publications, and (iii) baseline and impact evaluation reports and database compiled by
external M&E agencies contracted by WMD. The impact evaluations for Gramya I and
SLEM covered a treatment sample of 2,087 households drawn from 90 GPs and a control
sample of 700 households from 35 GPs, representing socio-economic and topographic
diversity in the project area. The quality of the impact evaluation survey instruments and
data analysis proved to be inadequate to capture the project intervention specific benefits.
The study report restricted the analysis to the sample data and failed to project the
realized values for some of the results indicators based on their analysis, which was left
to the ICR team to fill this gap. Supplemental field visits were utilized to objectively
capture the project-led benefits.

B. PAD Estimated Project Benefits and Rate of Return

At appraisal for both Gramya I and SLEM, no economic and financial analysis was done
for the proposed project investments. Rather, the Gramya I PAD quoted the positive
impacts of the predecessor project (IWDP II), which was documented in its ICR to justify
the economic and financial worthiness of the proposed investments in Gramya I. The
IWDP II ICR estimated its impacts as follows: (i) ERR for the project as a whole was
15.7 percent; and (ii) incremental farm financial income impacts varied from 94 to 152
percent across diverse farming situations.

 C. Project Benefits:

Major benefits due to project interventions are summarized in Table A3.1, in the areas of
(i) watershed treatment and source sustainability, (ii) rainfed agriculture development,
(iii) irrigated agriculture and agribusiness development, and (iv) income generating
activities.

  i. Watershed Treatment and Source Sustainability

The two major benefits were increased resource conservation and ecological functions,
including biomass production from plantations. Gramya I and SLEM (i) reduced runoff
and soil erosion by treating non-arable lands; (ii) increased water discharge by 68 percent
by rejuvenating traditional natural water sources, (iii) developed 17,475 ha of small
timber/fuel/fodder plantations, and (iv) improved watershed services by Rs. 46,420/ha.
On the average, the plantations increased annual fuelwood production by 10,364 tons,
fodder production by 27,226 tons, and small timber production by 83,631 tons.

Non-arable lands covered 71 percent of the project area and were treated with resource
conservation measures. About 15 percent of the projects’ total MWS area was
categorized as moderately erodible (E-1) and 85 percent as medium to highly erodible.
Annual soil loss ranged from 11 tons/ha (moderate) to 65 tons/ha (high). Prior to the


                                                44
project, traditional natural water sources had become unsustainable, with many
completely dried up. Project interventions reduced sedimentation and runoff losses and
rejuvenated traditional natural water sources. Enhanced biomass production from the
non-arable lands resulted in increased small timber, fuel and fodder production.

The SLEM implemented soil and conservation measures including 536 vegetative check
dams, 72,445 cum of stone check dams, 10,755 m of diversion drains, and 91,711 contour
trenches. Based on the secondary data sources available for similar eco-systems, it is
estimated that these SLEM investments in soil moisture control, drainage line treatment,
and river bank protection have the potential to arrest the soil loss of 142,438 m3. This
provides protection to 185 ha of farm lands. A gross area of 278 ha of farm lands is, thus,
saved from getting out of cultivation in the future, due to continuous soil erosion. At
2013 prices, about Rs 45 million worth of cereal production is saved annually due to the
watershed treatment.

Watershed Service Benefits: Valuation of forest ecosystem services are based on the
study of Himachal Pradesh state 35 by converting them to constant 2013 prices. Annual
net benefits of forest ecosystem services is estimated at Rs 82,100 per ha, contributed by
watershed services, carbon storage, biomass production, and ecotourism. Watershed
services, including the value for natural resource conservation and hydrological services,
accounted for nearly one-half of the value of forest ecosystem services, followed by
carbon storage, which accounted for 28 percent. Biomass production, including fuel,
fodder, timber and NTFP is underestimated, since the study considered only unprotected
forest areas. For this analysis, only watershed services and carbon storage are valued and
included in the project benefits. Biomass production (fodder, fuel and small timber)
values are estimated separately. Forest cover in project area is classified into very dense
(15 percent), moderately dense (55 percent) and open forests (30 percent). Using
Himachal Pradesh study36 and forest cover types in the project area, annual net benefits
from watershed services and carbon storage for the project area is assessed at Rs 46,420
per ha at constant 2013 prices at full development. Incremental area covered under
afforestation, silvipasture and fuel wood plantations are 17,475 ha. The survival rate for
these plantations is estimated at 45 percent. 37 As such, annual net financial benefits from
watershed services and carbon storage are estimated at Rs 365 million per year, at full
development.

Afforestation: As a part of watershed treatment and source sustainability, about 17,475 ha
of plantations were taken up in the project MWS’. The treatment was as follows: (i)
afforestation model in 5,676 ha, (ii) silvipasture model in 5,340 ha, and (iii) fuelwood
model in 6,459 ha, with the plant density varying from 800 to 1,600 plants per ha. No

systematic documentation of plant establishment, growth, and yield assessment was done
by the project. Given the plantation survival rate of 45 percent, yield projections are
calculated based on the available WMD database resulting from afforestation
interventions which are similar to the Gramya I interventions. Across the plantation
models, annual yields were as follows: (i) fuelwood (3 to 15 MT/ha); (ii) fodder (2 to 6
MT/ha); and (iii) small timber (100 to 450 MT/ha). Annual average production from
plantation area is therefore projected at 10,364 MT of fuelwood, 27,226 MT of fodder
and 83,631 MT of small timber. Valued at constant 2013 prices, average annual benefits
(undiscounted) from the plantation area is projected at Rs 73 million from fodder, Rs 134
million from fuelwood, and Rs 2,245 million from small timber. At 45 percent survival
rate, incremental annual financial benefits from plantations in the project area are
projected at Rs 1,103 million, at full development.

 ii.       Rainfed Agriculture

The major benefits here were the increased production of cereals, pulses, and vegetables
from arable rainfed lands (net area, 50,103 ha) and arable irrigated lands (net area, 13,430
ha). As a result, incremental revenue from rainfed crops increased by 44 percent.

       •   Incremental arable land area cropped (gross area, 6,908 ha)
       •   Incremental arable land area irrigated (gross area, 9,402 ha)
       •   Increased crop yield by 35 to 60 percent in arable lands (gross area, 98,356 ha)
       •   Annual cereals production by 79,488 tons
       •   Annual pulses production by 2005 tons
       •   Annual vegetables production by 65,621 tons

The project area farmers are currently cultivating 67,231 ha of arable lands, of which, 77
percent is rainfed, 12 percent is irrigated, with the remaining 11 percent left fallow.
Rainfed cropping patterns are dominated by
cereal, millet and pulse crops (Table A3.2). Table A3.2 Rainfed agriculture area impacts

Irrigated area (measured in ha) increased by

Adoption of conservation practices and improved production technologies is assumed to
stabilize at 50 percent at full project development. Diversion drains and river bank
protection works helped in protecting farm lands from erosion, thereby preventing the
likely loss of lands for future production. Given the small size of farm holdings in the

impact.

technologies demonstrated in the project villages.

WP yields are higher than WOP by 35 to 40 percent across cereals, pulses and oilseeds.
Still, actual crop yields are only 55 percent of the potential crop yields in rainfed
agriculture, indicating a remaining technological gap that could be closed. Average
annual rainfall in the project area is over 180 cm, ranging from 100 to 270 cm across
project districts. About 75 percent of annual rainfall occurs during June to September.
Improved inter- and intra-terrace conservation techniques through farm level in situ
moisture conservation practices are critical to recover this yield gap and stabilize the
productivity across diverse rainfall situations in the project area. While the project has
promoted improved production technologies through organized demonstrations, it is
important to bundle this with in situ moisture conservation practices to get the maximum
yield during normal rainfall seasons and minimize yield loss during intra-seasonal dry
spells. In other words, demonstrations need to focus more on efficient resource
conservation practices within the terrace along with less monetary inputs like quality
seed, optimum plant population, and contingency plans for varying soil moisture
scenarios during the crop growing season to recover the remaining 45 percent yield gap
through various stages. The project-led initiatives through watershed treatment and
promoting agriculture technologies contributed to improve farm financial income
(INR/ha) by 40 percent. Rainfed agriculture interventions generated incremental
financial benefits of Rs 183 million per year, at full development.

 iii.   Irrigated Agriculture and Agribusiness Development

The annual incremental financial benefits from irrigated arable lands were increased by
75 percent. Moreover, the average income increased by Rs 14,598 for 8,408 farmers
because of marketing support and value addition, of which:

    •   85 percent of the farmers benefitted by agribusiness linkages;
    •   68 percent of the farmers benefitted by farmer federation linkages; and
    •   51 percent of the farmers benefitted by value addition.




                                            47
Irrigated farming is practiced in 12 percent of the arable lands. Project-supported
investments in location-specific water harvesting structures permitted efficient recycling
of runoff for irrigating additional farmland. High-value crops are produced, which
further enhanced farm incomes. A total of 23,516 water harvesting structures and 579
km of irrigation channels were financed in the project villages (Table A3.4) benefitting

individual as well as groups of farmers. Collectively, all irrigation infrastructures
completed by the project had a total storage capacity of 237,705 m3. Most of these
structures are filled several times during the rainy season, in addition to inflows from the
rejuvenated traditional water sources to support the cultivation of off-seasonal vegetables.
Consequently, net irrigated area has increased by 5,360 ha and gross irrigated area has
increased by 9,402 ha, which is two-thirds more than the WOP-irrigated area. 38 Irrigated
cropping patterns are dominated by cereals, followed by vegetables and potato.

Irrigated cropping intensity is 171 percent. Potato and vegetables account for 21 percent
of the gross irrigated area. Project MWS’ receive average annual rainfall of 180 cm in
about 90 rainy days. Project interventions (Table A3.4) helped in capturing, storing and
recycling rainwater. Average irrigated cropping intensity marginally improved to 173
percent, but area under vegetables and potato increased to 35 percent of the gross
irrigated area, aided by agribusiness linkages supported by the project through 690 FIGs
covering 9,850 farmers.

During the project implementation period, a total of 46,315 demonstrations
(demonstration area varied from 0.04 to 0.2 ha) covering 3,575 ha of area were organized
to promote improved irrigated crop production technologies, covering high-value crops,
seasonal and off-seasonal vegetables in all project villages. About 2,189 poly houses and
poly tunnels; and 8,102 bio/vermi compost production units were supported by the
project to ensure quality seedlings of short duration off-season high value crops for the
farmers. At full development, about 65 percent of the irrigated farmers are projected to
adopt and sustain efficient crop production technologies demonstrated in the project
villages. Crop productivity at full development is estimated at 49 to 60 percent higher
than WOP productivity levels across major irrigated crops (Table A3.5). The project-led

   Net irrigated area refers to actual hectares irrigated, while gross irrigated area counts actual crops under
irrigation annually.

In the project area, 27 farmer federations (FFs) were formed with 690 FIGs to benefit
9,850 farmers. Out of this, 8,410 farmers through 589 FIGs were involved in
agribusiness activities (e.g., product aggregation, processing and marketing), of whom
6,745 farmers from 410 FIGs were directly linked with FFs by the end of the project.
Collectively, they marketed 41,475 MT of products consisting of vegetables (89 percent)
and fruits (11 percent) produced by the project farmers, valued at Rs. 462 million (Table
A3.6). About 5,040 farmers from 315 FIGs benefited due to value addition during
Gramya I implementation, collectively producing 776 MT of processed products, valued
at Rs 25 million. At constant 2013 prices, weighted average price realized varied from Rs
11.1 (vegetables) to 31.6 (value added products). Across products, about 35 percent of
the sale price is accounted for FF/processing unit related costs. Average annual turnover
is estimated at 500 MT, since (i) most of the FFs were formed during the later period of
the project implementation with only three to four years of functioning; (ii) only one-
fourth of FFs were fully functional by the end of the project; and (iii) many FFs suffered
from inadequate working capital. If only fully functional FFs are considered, annual
turnover is over 1,700 MT.

                                                                              percent           of
wholesale price and 31 percent of consumer retail price at constant 2013 prices. At the
end of the project, only 20 percent of the major vegetables produced by FFs were sold
through organized marketing. Organized marketing of vegetables generally fetches
higher price for the producers by about 30 percent over unorganized marketing of their
products. On an average, about 8,408 farmers in FFs realized higher producer prices,



                                                      49
which were 74 percent of whole sale price, as compared to 54 percent under WOP.
Incremental financial benefits due to agribusiness support to 8,408 farmers are estimated
at Rs 123 million per year. Incremental financial benefit per farmer is Rs 14,598 per
year, which is 43 percent more than the WOP situation. In the absence of data on
sustainability of agribusiness initiatives, the same adoption rate of 65 percent used for
irrigated crop technology was applied since in the initial phase most of the beneficiaries
due to agribusiness support are irrigated farmers.

 iv.      Income Generating Activities (IGAs):

The annual income increased by Rs 3,079 to Rs 7,849 for 11,289 vulnerable families due
to group and individual income generating activities (Table A3.7). Average IGA
investment came to Rs 20,109 for individual IGA and Rs 62,183 for group IGA at 2013

prices. The Gramya I impact assessment sampled 340 individual and 16 group IGAs in
the project villages. Based on this sample, overall average annual income from IGA
across diverse activities was Rs. 7,184 for individual and Rs. 19,892 for group IGA.
These were realized at full development in the second or third year from the start of IGA.
The final impact evaluation assessed that 80 percent of beneficiary households continued
in their respective IGA. About one-half of beneficiary households are able to maintain
the IGA to generate sustainable returns that supplement household incomes. Over time,
it is projected that about two-thirds of the targeted vulnerable households will continue
with the IGAs to generate sustainable returns to supplement their income levels.
Incremental financial benefits from IGA are projected at Rs. 35 million per year, at full
development.

D. Economic and Financial Analysis:

Cost-benefit analysis is conducted for a project life of 30 years. Costs and benefits are
estimated at 2013 prices over 30 years with 12 percent opportunity cost of capital.
Present value of discounted project financial benefits over the project life, due to the
project interventions are estimated at Rs 6.4 billion, contributed from watershed services
(20 percent), plantations (40 percent), agriculture (33 percent), and enhanced livelihoods


                                                  50
(7 percent). Total project costs, including contingencies, are Rs 6.8 billion. Beyond the
project implementation period annual recurrent costs and replacement costs for the assets
like water harvesting infrastructures are provided for. Financial analysis is done at market
prices. The estimated financial rate of return (FRR) for the project as a whole is 17.7
percent. Net Present Value at 12 percent opportunity cost of capital for 30-year project
life is Rs 2.4 billion (Table A3.8).

   Project as a whole             5.4     3.6      1.8   16.7%        6.4     4.0      2.4      17.7%
 Present value of benefits (PVB), Present value of costs (PVC), Net Present Value (NPV) are in Rs Billion.


Economic analysis is conducted after making appropriate adjustments to financial
benefits and costs. Economic project costs are estimated at Rs 6.1 billion after adjusting
for transfers, taxes, subsidies, and converting financial prices to economic prices.
Economic prices for internationally traded commodities (e.g., fertilizer, paddy and wheat)
are derived and used. While deviation between the parity prices and market prices for
paddy and wheat is marginal (less than 8 percent), parity prices for fertilizer nutrient is
two and half times that of market prices. This difference in economic and market prices
for fertilizers and use of human labor by farmers in the project area has resulted in
economic rate of return (ERR) marginally lower than financial rate of return. Present
value of discounted project benefits over the project life, due to the project interventions,
are estimated at Rs 5.4 billion, contributed by watershed services (21 percent),
plantations (42 percent), agriculture (31 percent), and enhanced livelihoods (6 percent).
The estimated ERR for the project as a whole is 16.7 percent. Net Present Value at 12
percent opportunity cost of capital for 30-year project life is Rs 1.8 billion.

E. Cost Effectiveness Analysis:

Decentralized comprehensive watershed development approach adopted by the project is
cost effective. Water harvesting structures and resource conservation investments under
Gramya I and SLEM, covering irrigation tanks, drainage line treatment, irrigation
channel, plantations, and village ponds were analyzed and compared with publicly-
funded similar investments. Community-driven investments led to asset creation, with
unit costs (at 2013 prices) higher by 2 to 57 percent in case of plantations, irrigation
tanks, village ponds and drainage line treatment; and lesser in case of irrigation channel
by 4 percent. Yet in terms of performance, plantations registered a 45 percent survival
rate in the Gramya I/SLEM areas, as against no survival under control, necessitating
repeat plantation. The economic life of these assets is therefore higher by 40 to 100
percent across diverse investments in the Gramya I/SLEM areas as compared to the
control. Annual O & M costs in the Gramya I/SLEM areas are consequently less by 60 to
67 percent. At a 12 percent opportunity cost of capital, annual amortized investment
costs and O&M costs together registered a 10 to 30 percent reduction as compared to the
control across diverse water harvest and conservation structures.

Annex 5. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Both Gramya I and SLEM organized exit workshops at division and cluster levels. Below
is a summary of feedback from the participants of SLEM exit workshop held on August
29, 2013 in the Nainital Division.

1. Villagers were taken to G. B. Pant University of Agriculture & Technology,
   Pantnagar on Exposure visit to Kisan Melas; it was for the first time that the villagers
   were given information regarding the Budget and Works to be carried out in the Gram
   Panchayat. This was never done in any project before. Villagers were provided
   employment opportunities within the village itself, which helped them to carry out
   their livelihood well. Works done in the fields of Water Resource regeneration, water
   recharge by the way of contour trenches, dug-out ponds etc. was beneficial in
   improvement of water availability in the village. (Account Assistant)
2. All the works in the GP are carried out in a participatory mode and the works are first
   approved in the open meetings of the respective GP. (Gram Pradhan)
3. Keeping in view the safety of the environment, such projects should be given in the
   area again and again. The works done for the upliftment of vulnerable groups are
   commendable. Villagers were given training on the activities of their choice and were
   encouraged for self-employment. (Gram Pradhan)
4. This project had enormous possibilities of work. People were benefitted to a great
   extent. All the things were decided in the project through open meetings. Since the
   things were decided in the open meeting, no disputes took place. (Gram Pradhan);
5. Project was extremely beneficial for vulnerable groups, Labour class and women.
   Similar projects should be planned in future also. (Gram Pradhan);
6. Soil conservation, Water conservation works were the speciality of this project. This
   project should be implemented in the entire state. Employment was created in the
   Gram Panchayat. (Gram Pradhan);
7. This project was different from the other projects. The common man has a place in
   this project. Works are carried out with the consent of all the residents of the village.
   Budget is head wise discussed openly; transparency and participation are taken into
   account. (Gram Pradhan);
8. Villagers were taken to Kisan Melas in Pant Nagar University for exposure to
   improved agriculture techniques, and animal husbandry. For the first time, the Budget
   and works are discussed in the open meetings of the Gram Panchayat. Villagers were
   given ample employment during the project period, which was extremely helpful in
   improving their livelihood. Project was extremely beneficial for the people. (GP
   member);
9. Importance was given to women in both Gramya and SLEM projects. Works were
   decided through open general meetings in the village, every individual has benefited


                                            54
    from the project. High value crop seeds, High yielding varieties and Breed
    improvement programmes for cows and goats were an important feature of this
    project. We believe that more such projects will be implemented in our area in near
    future. (Account Assistant);
10. Works are planned by the villagers themselves through open meetings in the village
    and they are implemented in participatory manner. (Gram Pradhan).
11. This was a unique project where all the accounting and record keeping was done by
    Account assistant- an individual, appointed from the village itself to help the Gram
    Pradhan. All the works were implemented in transparent manner and plans were
    finalised in open meetings. (Gram Pradhan);
12. This was a very good project, people got employment within the village and
    vegetable production was promoted. People were given information regarding each
    and every work. (Gram Pradhan);
13. Gramya I has benefitted each and every family of our village. Production was
    improved through high yielding seeds; irrigation tanks improved the agricultural
    produce. Options for Self employment, especially for the women, were created within
    the village; village inhabitants were taken on exposure tours to various institutes
    which improved their vision regarding modern techniques of farming, which also
    improved the production. The support shown by the Gramya project in our village is
    commendable, our villages had immense development.(Account Assistant);
14. Every person was given due importance in these projects. Proposals were approved
    through the open meetings of the Gram Panchayat. Separate Mahila Aam Sabhas
    were also organised and their proposals were given place in the open general
    meetings of the Gram Panchayat. (Gram Pradhan);
15. People got self-employment through Gramya project. Gramya & SLEM projects were
    instrumental in improving the water availability in the village through the water
    recharge, contour trenches and dug-out pond related works. Women were motivated
    into forming self-Help groups which made them self-sufficient and improved their
    self-esteem and confidence. Each and every family was benefitted through the
    project. (Gram Pradhan);
16. Proposals for work were given in open, general meetings and priorities were set in the
    meetings, payments were also made in the Gram Panchayat. Project was transparent.
    (Gram Pradhan);
17. People were given an opportunity for planning of the project through open meetings
    in the Gram Panchayat. Each and every person was given the information of budget
    and expenses in the GP. We have never experienced such transparency as we
    witnessed in this project. People were taken for exposure trips to various universities
    and institutes which improved our knowledge regarding water source regeneration,
    water recharge etc. Opportunities for self-employment were created in the village




                                            55
    itself through financial assistance from the project. Gramya & SLEM projects were
    beneficial for each and every villager.(Gram Pradhan);
18. Proposals were approved through general meetings in the Gram Panchayat and works
    were carried out in participatory mode.(Gram Pradhan);
19. Works like Afforestation, Assisted Natural Regeneration of Oak etc. were carried out
    through the projects. Digging of contour trenches, afforestation and fodder plantations
    were helpful in catering to the fodder needs of the village; Villagers got self-
    employment within the village. Project was extremely beneficial for the
    people.(Gram Pradhan);
20. Gramya I has benefitted the vulnerable group people a lot; funding given as grant for
    nurseries, Tent House, Knitting, weaving etc. were extremely helpful in upliftment of
    the poor. Women Aam Sabhas were important as they were able to build the
    confidence of village women; we witnessed such a project for the first time which
    gave such importance to the common man by providing those tanks, shelters, compost
    pits, energy conservation and self-employment within the village. (Gram Pradhan);
21. This project, besides being transparent, was acceptable to all. People had a wonderful
    experience related to these projects. I was from the village itself and was chosen as
    the account assistant, which was instrumental in maintaining the transparency.
    (Account Assistant);
22. This was the first project of its kind, in our area, in which importance is given to the
    each and every individual. (Account Assistant);
23. Works in both the projects were carried out in participatory mode; employment
    opportunities were created within the village, women were made self-reliant through
    formation of Self Help groups and by providing work-opportunities within the
    village. People were informed about the budget, and work plan through open
    meetings and beneficiary selection was transparent. (Gram Pradhan);
24. This is one such project wherein the concepts of holistic village development were
    realized. Water conservation, source rejuvenation, recharge and soil conservation
    were given due priority in the project. Employment was increased through the project
    interventions. Development was the keyword, during the project and even after the
    project. (Gram Pradhan);
25. All the works in the village were carried out through general consensus in the village,
    which was never seen in any other project. All the government schemes should be
    designed in this fashion only. Project is a mile stone in the development of Jal, Jangal
    and zameen, development was the keyword of this project.(Account Assistant)

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR

The Borrower submitted the Bank two separate ICRs for Gramya I (dated March 2012)
and SLEM (dated August 2013), which are summarized below.

I.     Summary of UDWDP Government ICR

World Bank funded Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Project (Gramya
I) (Project ID: P078550, Credit No. 3907-IN) was implemented by Watershed
Management Directorate, Uttarakhand. The project became effective from September 24,
2004 and closed on 31st March 2012.

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE

The Project was conceived with the objective to improve the productive potential of
natural resources and increase incomes of rural inhabitants in selected watersheds
through socially inclusive, institutionally and environmentally sustainable
approaches.

PROJECT COST

The total project cost was US$ 89.35 million of which the International Development
Association (IDA) share was US$ 69.62 million (47.4 million SDR), State share was US$
16.62 million and Beneficiary share of US$ 3.11 million. Additional Financing (Credit
No 4850- IN) for a total IDA Credit of US$ 7.98 million (5.1 million SDR) and state
share of US$1.22 Million amounting to a total of US$ 9.20 million was availed w.e.f. 17th
June, 2011.

PROJECT AREA

The project was spread over an area of around 2348 sq Km. in 76 selected MWS in
Middle Himalayas. 468 identified Gram Panchayats in 18 Development Blocks of 11
Districts participated in this project. An estimated 258,000 population of the project area
was proposed to be benefited from the project outcomes.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

The project was community owned and demand driven and managed, planned and
implemented by the community and the GPs. The village communities were the true
owners of the project and the role of government and NGOs was as facilitators. The
Gram Panchayat Watershed Development plans were need based and demand-driven
keeping in view Environmental and Social safeguard Guidelines. Allocation of funds for
watershed treatment to each GP was decided on the basis of area under GP’s jurisdiction
and population of the GP. Socio-economic equity was a cornerstone of this project.
Women's participation in project interventions was sought to be enhanced by way of
ensuring up to 50% representation of women in village level committees and inclusion of
their concerns, needs and emerging issues in women Aam Sabhas into the GPWDPs. To


                                            57
provide functional autonomy to local government, withdrawal and disbursement of funds
from the watershed account for the project was vested with Gram Pradhan and one of the
elected women ward members of the GP.

PROJECT COMPONENTS

1. Participatory Watershed Development and Management.

Promotion of social mobilization and community driven decision making: Social
mobilization of the community was done with the help of field NGOs and village
motivators placed at the village level. Through social mobilization the community was
made aware of the project objectives, implementation and management.

Watershed treatments and village development: In GPWDP activities such as soil and
moisture conservation, afforestation, water harvesting, agriculture terrace repair,
agriculture interventions like introduction of high value crops and value addition of farm
produce, horticulture, livestock management and breeding activities, fodder production,
repair of roads and culverts, non-conventional energy programs etc. were included. The
Environmental and Social Guidelines (ESG) were made an integral part of the GPWDP
and sub-projects. Through these guidelines the objective was to minimize or mitigate the
negative environmental and social impacts and to enhance the positive impacts.

2. Enhancing Livelihood Opportunities

Farming systems improvement: It focused on enhancing incomes and livelihood
options by ensuring equitable participation by all groups like farmers, users groups and
especially the landless and women who rely disproportionately on common-pool
resources for fodder, fuel and other forest products. Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) of
progressive/ interested farmers keen on taking up innovative agribusiness activities were
formed at GP level. Demonstrations of improved varieties of cultivated crops through
FIGs were taken-up. Orchard development orchard rejuvenation, cultivation of off-season
vegetables, use of poly house/ tunnels and bio/ vermi-compost demonstrations were
carried out for better returns.

The objectives of livestock component were concerned with improvement of genetic
potential of local indigenous livestock and to increase availability of feed and fodder. The
thrust was on reducing the livestock pressure on farm land and forest for grazing and
green fodder requirement. The improved livestock health care facilities were helpful in
increasing the productivity of animals.

Under forestry component the farmers were motivated to establish forest nurseries
(indigenous fuel wood, and small timber species) and fodder nurseries (Ginni, Hybrid
Napier, Hybrid maize, Cenchrus) on community and private land to fulfill the
requirement of seedlings in the project.




                                            58
Value addition and marketing support: Under agribusiness interventions sub-
component, main thrust was given to (i) dissemination of technologies and provision of
advisory services; (ii) production and distribution of quality seeds and seedlings; and (iii)
establishment of linkages between FIGs and suppliers for processing and marketing of
off-season vegetables and high value crops. Formation of FIGs was introduced to
facilitate the production, processing and marketing of high value crops. Six specialized
agencies (Divisional Support Agencies for Agribusiness) were hired under the Project to
provide support for value addition, marketing and to develop forward and backward
linkages. Till March 2012 about 41,474 ton vegetables and value added products had
been marketed from the project area. Total turnover through this activity was reported to
the tune of about Rs.48.69 crores. For the value addition of the produce 19 processing
centres' were established in the project area.

Pine Briquetting: Pine forests are spread over throughout the Middle Himalayas. Pine
needles are locally used for cattle bedding. The project demonstrated pine needle
briquetting as alternate fuel for the local community. About 85% of the rural households
are engaged in the collection of fuel wood. In each household annual consumption of fuel
wood is 2.7 MT collection which requires 183 women labor days. 260 Pine needle
briquette making facilities (machines) have been installed. 8,020 household of 337
revenue villages are benefitted by this program. 3 to 3.5 kg needles are required for each
kilogram of briquette and about 40 kg briquettes per hour can be produced. The response
from womenfolk is quite encouraging, as the frequency to visit forest for firewood has
been significantly reduced and they can now spend more time in the household on other
less manually demanding chores.

Income generating activities for vulnerable groups: The objective of vulnerable group
fund was to enhance social equity in villages through the project and further assist those
who either get left out or receive very little benefit from watershed development activities.
Until March 2012, a total 754 vulnerable groups and 3,819 vulnerable individuals
received grant for other livelihood investments (e.g., goat breed improvement and rearing,
etc). A total of 8,819 vulnerable members (4,499 male and 4,320 female members) were
benefitted by this program. The total fund disbursed for vulnerable activities is INR
85,383,228. This fund was allotted to 49% female and 51% male members.

3. Institutional Strengthening

Capacity building of Gram Panchayats and local community institutions: Capacity
building of all the community based institutions was carried out in different aspects
regularly throughout the project. The project also formulated the withdrawal plans for
each GP. A copy of each of the management plan was provided to the RVC chairperson,
Gram Pradhan, Block Pramukh, ZilaPanchayat President, Deputy Project Director,
Project Director and Directorate. This would aid in developing coordination and
convergence with other programmes.

Information, Education and Communication: IEC activities were undertaken for
informing and shaping opinions within the community as regards participatory watershed



                                             59
development and their roles in decision making, planning and management of project
activities, transparency and accountability, dissemination of technical know-how and
documentation of best practices.

All forms of media from the verbal to the visual were used. Wall paintings, writings,
flyers, boards, puppet shows, folk theatre and audio visual shows were undertaken at GP
level. Video GramyaDarpan (six monthly Video newsletter)–‘GRAMYA DARPAN’,
GramyaDarpan (quarterly newsletter), HamaraAkhbar (Community newspaper),
Thematic short Films were also produced on various interventions in the project.

Project Management and Information Management Monitoring and Evaluation
(IMME): Monitoring Arrangements: Internal Monitoring: The progress of annual
works plan was monitored on monthly basis through monthly progress report (MPR)
generated at the divisional level and consolidated at WMD level.

External Monitoring (Baseline, MTR and Final Impact Assessment consultancy): The
Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) New Delhi was the External M&E Consultant for
Baseline, MTR and Final Impact Assessment consultancy for UDWDP.

Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PME): PME was introduced in project not only
to gauge the performance of the project but, more importantly to make timely
improvement in the working of all stakeholders. PME exercise was done on six monthly
basis on the basis of nine broad objectives, i.e., Awareness, Inclusiveness and equity,
Transparency and accountability, Financial management, Performance of committees and
Group, Inputs by Multi disciplinary team, Grievance redress and Execution of withdrawal
Strategy. The PME performed as a progress measuring and community feedback
assessment tool.

The Final Impact Assessment (report of TERI study):

Improving the productive potential of natural of natural resources

•   The productivity and irrigated area under almost all key crops show an increase. The
    increase in area (21%) and value (27%) are significantly higher than the target values.
    The key reasons for such increase are the increased availability of water (amounts and
    flows throughout the year) due to SLEM soil and water conservation activities.
•   Poly houses and poly tunnels have been a major contributing factor to the growth of
    offseason vegetables.
•   Wherever processing centers have been established, post harvesting operations have
    been successfully adopted in the grading and packing of vegetables, spices, pulses
    etc. Commercial packing with different trade names proved to be attractive for sale
    of these products in local markets, fairs and even in the outside market.
•   Agribusiness ventures have been successful in several places and there exist several
    innovative cases. The agribusiness activity in Garsain deserves particular mention on
    account of its innovative arrangement of 'reverse profit'.



                                            60
•   The number of livestock belonging to improved breeds shows a notable increase.
    Members of Vulnerable Groups have been major beneficiaries. On the whole, there
    have been 19% and 191% increases in the holdings of improved breed cows and
    buffaloes respectively in the sampled GPs.
•   There has been an overall 9.6 % increase in fodder availability over the baseline. The
    average fodder production ranged between 0.5 -5.67 q/ha/year across different land
    uses. The highest percentage change (24.18%) in availability of fodder was recorded
    for irrigated agriculture land suggesting that farmers in the project area have been
    motivated to grow fodder crops / trees on the bunds / risers of their agriculture
    resulting in increase in fodder availability.
•   The percentage change in household dependency for fodder and grasses from private
    agricultural/barren land/other land is the highest (13%), while dependency on fodder
    from forests and feed purchased from market have declined by 8% and 5%
    respectively. On an average, there has been an 11% reduction in time spent on
    collecting fodder by a household.
•   It was observed that the biomass of the treated areas has increased by 9.37% from
    2004-05 to 2011-12 (across treated micro watersheds). These changes were on
    account of increase in vegetation cover due to new plantations under the project and
    natural regeneration of grasses, shrubs and tree seedlings because of the protection
    against grazing and over usage. The average survival percentage within the surveyed
    sites was around 45% in a range of 23% to 85%.
•   The impact of soil and water conservation measures is seen in terms of increased
    amount of irrigated land (increase of 24.7%), an increase in crop yields and an
    increase in access to domestic water.
•   The time spent in collecting water has significantly reduced with a sharp increase
    (48%) in the number of households taking < 1 hour to collect water and a similar
    decrease (39%) in the number of households taking between 1-2 hours.
•   In terms of efficacy of impacts, it is seen that turbidity levels during monsoon months
    have reduced significantly in the case of successful catchment treatments.

Increase in incomes of rural inhabitants

•   The total increase in income across all categories is 57%, but increase in farm income
    is overall higher (61.1%) than non-farm incomes (56.6%). The total increase in
    income of 57% translates to a real income increase of 17% when adjusted for
    inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for rural laborers, using agricultural
    year average values, and accounting for the impact of non-project interventions.
    There is almost a doubling in the ownership of consumer durables, indicating a
    general increase in living standards.
•   The economic analysis of the project includes benefits from agriculture, livestock,
    horticulture, forestry, soil conservation, domestic water and employment. Following
    the approach used in the PAD, aggregate level economic analysis has been done. The
    Benefit Cost Ratio (r=8%, t=10 years) works out to 2.63 including the employment
    benefits. The Economic Rate of Return is estimated at 18.5%.
•   Economic analysis has also been done for selected interventions as well as for
    selected IGAs. Irrigation channels and irrigation tanks return BCR values of 1.36 and


                                            61
    1.54 respectively over a 10 year horizon, indicating their economic viability even in
    the medium run.
•   Participation in Gram Sabha and Gram Panchayat meetings show a sharp increase.
    For example, the attendance percentage in Gram Sabha meetings has doubled and the
    attendance percentage of women in Gram Sabha meetings has increased fivefold. The
    average number of GP meetings has increased from 5.28 in a year to 11.14 in a year.
•   The assessment also points towards a high degree of transparency in various project
    processes. An average of 78.96% of total households in a Gram Panchayat has been
    involved in the preparation of GPWDP. An average of 48.7% of the community
    members was aware of GP budget and expenditure and 91% of households were
    aware of project objectives, activities and methodologies.
•   Though the initial response to the process of FIG formation was low, as the produce
    of off-season vegetables and cash crops increased and farmers started selling the
    surplus, the response picked up and helped establish the necessary market linkages.
•   The level of transparency in the project has been quite high largely on account of
    different levels of auditing (CA, internal and CAG) and regular Participatory
    Monitoring and Evaluation (PME).
•   Most of the interventions undertaken under the agriculture and horticulture
    component have strong potential of sustainability. For instance, minikits have been
    effectively utilized by almost all the farmers and wherever the productivity has
    substantially increased, the farmers have retained the seeds to be used for the next
    agriculture season.
•   The soil conservation structures that withstood the heavy rainfall in 2010 and 2011
    have served their purpose to a large extent, and the formation of UGs for maintenance
    of these structures is a step towards ensuring post-project sustainability.
•   In case of plantations, most of the activities have been taken up in Van Panchayats,
    managed by Van Panchayat committees with strict codes of conduct and usufruct
    sharing. It could be expected that these institutions would ensure adequate upkeep of
    the plantations.

PROJECT LESSONS LEARNED: The learning's from the project were as follows:
•   Partnering with NGOs for social mobilization, project implementation and support
    for Agribusiness was a successful initiative in the project. The human resource
    development by the project would be useful for central sponsored Integrated
    Watershed Management Program as well as for follow on projects. Such experience
    would also be replicated in other community-based programs.
•   Involvement of Women Social Mobilization Workers: In the project a number of
    facilitators for a cluster of Gram Panchayats and village motivators at the village level
    were engaged. These village motivators and facilitators visited villages, assisted in
    PRA and organized women along with other stake holders into groups. These village
    motivators would prove to be resource persons for other programs.
•   Women Aam Sabha: These Sabhas served as a platform for women to bring up
    issues of concern, identifying needs and redressing grievances. Women Aam Sabhas
    were held prior to finalization of Gram Panchayat plans to identify and prioritize




                                             62
    issues impacting the women locally. It helped in addressing gender issues in a
    transparent way.
•   Involvement of Women in Governance: Woman Ward member was made a co-
    signatory with the Gram Pradhan for the operation of the dedicated watershed account
    of the project.
•   Livelihood Interventions: The project was designed to target all the rural
    inhabitants of the project area thus sharing the benefits of the project. The poorest and
    the most vulnerable sections of the community were addressed through the support of
    vulnerable group fund.
•   Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) were carried out in the project as
    a social audit process. PME proved to be an important feedback and learning
    mechanism for the community in the project area.
•   Pine briquetting: The project introduced pine briquetting as a pioneer venture to
    meet the objective of reducing drudgery of women and forest fires. The pine briquette
    was also an income generating activity where the user groups could sell the briquettes
    in the village and in the nearby market.
•   Cost Sharing: To ensure sustainability of activities that enhance productivity and
    incomes of the rural population, the project laid emphasis on sharing of costs by the
    individual beneficiaries, for this the cost sharing norms were clearly defined.
•   Enhancing the capacity of the GPs: To ensure proper, effective and efficient
    management of the project funds the project funded for the appointment of Account
    Assistant in each Gram Panchayat. This Account Assistant was generally a local of
    the village having knowledge in accounting procedures. This experience would
    benefit to other Govt. programs such as MNEREGS, IWMP etc.
•   Sustainability through User Groups: In the project for future sustenance and O&M
    of common assets user groups were formed. In the project user groups were
    especially for water based structures such as irrigation tanks, roof rain water
    harvesting tanks, irrigation channels/guls, naula and ponds. The members of user
    groups conducted regular meetings and generated fund for operation and maintenance
    of created common assets. The funds were collected on monthly basis or on crop
    basis depending on the rules and regulations of that particular user group.

BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE

Government of Uttarakhand- The performance of Govt. of Uttarakhand (GoUK) was
highly satisfactory. GoUK extended full support to the project right through preparation,
implementation to closure. The release of the counterpart funds was timely and adequate.
The policy support as and when required was provided for. The continuity of staff both
administrative and technical was maintained throughout the project with few exceptions
towards the end. The GoUK allowed WMD substantial flexibility and authority for
implementing the project activities.

Implementation Agency - The Watershed Management Directorate was the
implementing agency for the project and the performance is rated as highly satisfactory.
The project could be launched well in time due to timely preparedness and completion of
pre-project activities. The financial targets for the original project were completely


                                             63
achieved and the utilization of additional financing was also highly satisfactory. The
highly satisfactory implementation of the project resulted in obtaining co-financing under
GEF. All the activities envisages under the three sub components of the project were
initiated and successfully completed. The project design and implementation
arrangements were widely accepted by all the stakeholders and no major conflict related
to implementation was reported. The project largely achieved/ exceeded outcome result
indicators under various components.

The implementing agencies at all the levels reflected enormous commitment in achieving
the project outputs and goals. Implementation of the project through the Gram Panchayat,
the lowest administrative unit under the Panchayat Raj Institution and introduction of
women ward member as a co signatory at WWMC level was a successful experience
which is being mainstreamed in to the Integrated Watershed Management Program
(IWMP) a CSS of Govt. India. The NGOs as project implementation agencies, social
mobilizers and as supporting agencies for various interventions played key role in project
implementation. The Financial management systems put in place at the community level
were also satisfactory, as the annual Gram Panchayat audit reports were satisfactory. The
concept of implementing the project through the Environment and Social guidelines
helped mitigate any negative impacts of the project. The Project introduced the concept
of women Aam Sabha and participatory monitoring and evaluation (PME) which ensured
social equity, transparency and accountability at the village level. To ensure sustainability
user groups and withdrawal plans were put in place. Through this project farmers were
organized into farmer interest groups and farmer federations so that strong and
sustainable forward and backward linkages could be developed and they started viewing
agriculture as a viable business option.

BANK'S PERFORMANCE

Lending – Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory. The project preparation ensured
adequate consultations with borrowers and other stakeholders. The preparation mission
gave a lot of support in finalizing the projects objective, components and implementation
arrangements. The subsequent missions were also of great help in prioritizing the
activities, finalizing the various operations manuals and the institutions arrangements for
implementation. The project design provided for a lot of flexibility, which allowed
location specific interventions and some very good results were achieved. The PDO
indicator and log frame were inadequately formulated and hence could not completely
capture the project impact and outcomes.

Supervision-The Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory. Though in the initial phase
there was a change in the team leaders but the task team more or less remained the same.
There was a continued focus on social, equity, participatory, environmental, agriculture,
financial and procurement issues by the Bank team. Any issues raised by the project
regarding implementation, management and sustainability were effectively and
efficiently addressed by the Bank team. The Bank fielded 11 missions, one MTR mission
and supportive missions. The six monthly supervision mission's field visits and Aide-
memoires provided guidance and suggestions to the implementing agency towards



                                             64
achieving the project objectives and outputs. The MTR mission was very supportive and
appreciative of the project team's view point and agreed to the changes sought in the
result framework and allocation. Bank also highlighted the critical issues in meetings
with the Chief Secretary, Forest and Rural Development Commissioner and Secretary
Watershed, Govt. of Uttarakhand as well as in the Annual Portfolio Reviews with the
Department of Economic Affairs, Govt. of India and Govt. of Uttarakhand.

II.     Summary of SLEM Government ICR

The Government of Uttarakhand through the Watershed Management Directorate
(WMD) has received a grant from Global Environment Facility (GEF) Trust Fund for
7.49 million US$ for implementing the project on Sustainable Land, Water And
Biodiversity Conservation and Management For Improved Livelihood In
Uttarakhand Watershed Sector (SLEM). This project is an additional financing to the
World Bank aided Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Project
(UDWDP) which was implemented from 2006 to 2012 in 76 MWS covering 468 Gram
Panchayat in 11 hilly district of the State at a project cost of 106.89 Million US$
(consisting of 75.44 million US$ IDA financing, 21.99 million US$ state govt. share and
9.46 million US$ beneficiary share).

The global environment objective (GEO) is : To restore and sustain ecosystem functions
and biodiversity while simultaneously enhancing income and livelihood functions, and
generating lessons learned in these respects that can be up-scaled and mainstreamed at
state and national levels.

The GEF additional financing has been utilized for sustainable bio-diversity
management, land and water source protection and creation of sustainable livelihoods
through community participation. The Project specifically aims at assisting the
vulnerable regions to cope with the projected impacts of climate change.

Out of the 76 micro-watersheds covered in the parent project (Gramya I), the SLEM
Project was implemented in 20 selected MWS covering 60,823 ha in 126 GPs in the
middle Himalayan region between 700-2000 m in the hill districts of Rudraprayag,
Bageshwar, Uttarkashi (Chinyalisaur), and Nainital. About 74,000 population has
benefited from project interventions. Micro-watersheds included in this project were
identified based upon the severity of erosion, poverty and lack of infrastructure facilities.

PROJECT COMPONENTS

1.    Watershed planning through community participation.
2.    Controlling land degradation through the SLEM approach at watershed level.

FOCUS AREAS AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

The conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and poverty eradication are two of the
major global challenges of our time. Our watersheds are repositories of rich biodiversity
and support a variety of forest eco systems. Further watersheds in general and hilly areas in
particular, constitute a major source of livelihood and income for people living in and
around them. Over the years, these watersheds have become degraded due to increased
anthropogenic interventions which are seriously impacting the sustenance of people living
in these watersheds.

The parent project Gramya I focused on improving the productive potential of natural
resources and increasing incomes of rural inhabitants in selected watersheds through
socially inclusive, institutionally and environmentally sustainable approaches. Participatory
planning resulted in the formulation of Gram Panchayat watershed development plans
(GPWDP) at the GP level. The GPWDP comprised of activities prioritized by the
community for soil conservation works on arable & non arable land, drainage line
treatment, afforestation, improving irrigation facilities and improved horticulture and
agriculture practices in the Gram Panchayat area only. The inter GP areas which are the
reserve forest areas under control of forest department could not be taken up for treatment
works for water source sustainability, drainage line treatment, water recharge, plantation
and other such interventions. As an additional financing the SLEM project was
implemented in the selected 20 MWS of Gramya I. The focus of the SLEM project was on
biodiversity conservation through land and water source protection, sustainable livelihood
development, use of alternative energy resources and capacity building of communities on
biodiversity issues through demonstration, documentation and dissemination of good
practices. The SLEM project followed an integrated approach to watershed management
where by all the GPWDPs were integrated at the MWS level. MWS level watershed
development plans where formulated in which interventions were proposed by the
community for both inter GP areas (RF) and GP areas. With a focus on biodiversity
conservation, the community with the technical and social facilitation of project team
carried out soil conservation works on arable & non arable land, drainage line treatment,
afforestation, assisted natural regeneration, fire management, water recharge and harvesting
activities and water source sustainability works. The project also successfully promoted the
use of alternative energy through Pine Briquette, Bio gas, Solar energy. Special emphasis




                                            66
was placed on capacity development of community on bio diversity issues, land and water
source protection and livelihood issues through a dedicated capacity building program.

Community participation in all project intervention was achieved through Gram Panchayat
(GP), revenue village committee (RVC), Van Panchayat (VP), Self-help groups (SHG) and
user groups. In addition to above, the project has been successful in bringing about policy
change in the paradigm of forest management in the state whereby the Van Panchayat
which are the oldest people’s institution involved in local management of natural resources
have been authorized by the State Govt. (Vide GO Dated 2nd December, 2009) to treat the
reserve forest area, under any project, within a prescribed plan, so that the holistic
treatment of any micro watershed can be achieved.

Baseline survey and impact assessment of the project was conducted by The Energy and
Resources Institute (TERI) New Delhi. Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PME)
was carried out in all project GPs by a GP level PME team representing all stake holders.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT BY TERI - HIGHLIGHTS

•   Use of a truly participatory approach from planning to implementation stage has been
    a hallmark of the project.
•   About 21% of eligible area under the selected MWS has been brought under SLEM
    techniques involving soil moisture conservation works, drainage line treatment
    works, afforestation, medicinal and aromatic plant cultivation, water augmentation
    and water source sustainability works.
•   82.34% of households spend less than 1 hour to access water in dry season as against
    68.37% at the start of the project.
•   7% increase in house hold income in real terms due to promotion of livelihood
    activities
•   Reduction of fuel wood dependence on forest has been a major impact largely on
    account of promotion of alternative energy sources such as pine briquettes, biogas
    and solar energy devices. About 19% of households have partially shifted to
    alternated energy use viz pine briquettes, biogas and solar energy.
•   31% of SHGs making pine briquettes are marketing them and earning incomes.
•   Increase in bio mass production due to afforestation activities
•   The revival of traditional water mills (Gharat) has also been a major success and has
    yielded high economic return.
•   Capacities of local level institutions viz GP, VP, RVC, SHG and User groups have
    been strengthened due to their participation from the planning stage to O&M.
•   State Govt. initiative in authorizing Van panchayat as work agency in reserve forest
    area through govt. order is a progressive step toward involvement of community
    institutions in natural resources management.

PROJECT LESSONS LEARNED

•   SLEM project focused on biodiversity conservation and sustaining of ecosystem
    functions while simultaneously enhancing livelihood opportunities for the rural
    inhabitants. All project interventions directly and indirectly resulted in conservation
    of biodiversity at the MWS level in the project area.
•   Watershed development planning with community participation was done at the
    MWS level and interventions were proposed by the community for both inter GP


                                            68
    areas (RF) and GP areas. This integrated approach has resulted in comprehensive
    watershed treatment at the MWS level. The MWS plans also provide for convergence
    with other departments at the MWS level.
•   Involvement of community institutions such as Van panchayat and Biodiversity
    groups constituted under Biodiversity act 2002 in natural resources management
    activities at the local level is a progressive step resulting in greater ownership at the
    community level.
•   Drying up of the traditional water sources such as Naula, Dhara is a major concern in
    the state of Uttarakhand with some of the areas facing drought conditions in summer
    months. SLEM project focused on improving water source sustainability in MWS
    areas where the discharge in the traditional water sources had been reduced or had
    dried up. About 423 such sources were treated and water availability was improved.
    Interventions for waters source sustainability should be an important component
    related to land development in the hill state in future projects.
•   Decentralized approach to watershed management with the local institutions as de
    facto planners and implementers resulted in greater ownership of project at local
    level.
•   Capacity development of Gram panchayat and other local institutions (viz RVC, User
    Groups, SHGs, Van panchayat) has resulted in strengthening of these institutions vis
    a vis administrative capacity, financial working and skill development. This has
    resulted in improvement in governance.
•   The project had a definite focus on women related issues. SLEM project provided
    mandatory 50% representation of women in project committees, separate Mahila
    Aam Sabha for integrating women concerns in MWS plans, women ward member as
    cosignatory for operating project account, drudgery reducing interventions, local level
    employment generation and financial assistance for taking up income generating
    activity. All these interventions have led to capacity building of women in the project
    area.
•   SLEM project successfully promoted the use of alternative energy fuels like pine
    needle briquettes, biogas and solar cookers. This has resulted in reducing dependence
    on forest based fuel wood to some extent. Due to high adoption rate, these activities
    can be scaled up in future projects.
•   Pine briquetting can become a major livelihood activity with an efficient marketing
    system. The marketing system should be strengthened to attract enough people to
    scale up pine briquette production as a viable IGA.
•   Project has resulted in the revival of traditional water mills (Gharat) which has been a
    major success and has also yielded high economic return. Convergence with the state
    agency for renewable energy development (UREDA) was successful in conversion of
    traditional Gharats for micro hydro electricity production at the village level which
    has helped in rural electrification and reduced GHG emissions via substitution of
    diesel and fuel wood .
•   Uttarakhand has tremendous potential for cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants
    while simultaneously contributing to the conservation of wild germ plasm of these
    plants that had been depleted in recent years by predatory harvesting practices.
    Cultivation and marketing of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP) was promoted in
    the project through package of practices, marketing support and linkage with State


                                             69
    Medicinal Plant Board (SMPB). All these interventions will go a long way in
    enabling the MAP growers and FIGs to get technical support, extension facilities,
    quality planting material and viable market linkages.
•   Under the SLEM project, the importance of post project sustainability of project
    interventions was duly recognized and the sustainability issues were addressed right
    from the project conceptualization and design stage to project implementation at field
    level. The state government order vide letter no. 251/XIII (II)/2011-31(05)/2011
    dated 08 Dec. 2011 regarding the utilization and maintenance of the various assets
    created during the project period has resulted in convergence with line departments
    for Operation and maintenance of assets.

Annex 7. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments - State of Uttarakhand/ WMD:

1.     The hill state of Uttarakhand is prone to natural disasters like- flash floods,
landslides, cloud bursts etc. which leads to soil erosion, loss of productive land and
availability of water. There is a need to continuously address the issues of sustainable
management of the eco-system and livelihood of the local inhabitants. In the above
perspective, projects like Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Project-1
and GEF funded SLEM project have proved to be a boon for the sustainable
management of natural resources and inhabitants of the project areas. The
implementation strategies and decentralized approach in which community is involved
and sensitized to plan, implement and manage the project assets built the administrative
and financial management capacity with social accountability of the community and
PRIs. Initiatives at integrating gender issues in project implementation and management
through involvement of female social workers, women specific Aam Sabhas, mandatory
50% participation of the women and focus on livelihood issues addressed inclusiveness
and equity issues in the project.

2.     The Borrower i.e. the state government also proactively contributed to successful
and smooth functioning of the project by issuing government orders for the decentralized
and participatory approach in the management of the state owned reserve forests.
3.      With the objective of ensuring the sustainable maintenance and operation of the
community assets created in the project the state issued govt. orders for the sustenance of
all these community assets through various government programmes.
 4.     The implementation agency i.e. the Watershed Development Department (WDD)
through its multidisciplinary approach wherein the issues of participation, sensitization,
orientation and social mobilization of the communities were addressed with the support
of various field based NGOs, the panorama of issues related to watershed management
were dealt by project staff of various disciplines like forestry, agriculture, horticulture,
animal husbandry, minor irrigation, alternate energy etc.
 5.    The objective of promoting and assuring agriculture as a viable business option in
the project was a success. The project engaged NGOs as divisional support agencies in
the project areas for this purpose. Sustainable livelihood options for the landless and the
poor were also provided for in the project. The implementation agency i.e. the WDD also
took an initiative of partnering with NGOs as implementation agency in two project
areas. The results were satisfactory and will be continued in the up-coming UDWDP
Phase-II project.
 6.     The ridge to valley concept of treatment of micro watersheds was piloted in the
SLEM project with preparation of comprehensive MWS treatment plans. This scientific,
technical, and community need based approach will be up-scaled in the UDWDP Phase-
II project. The sustainable and judicious management of water resources is a key to
ensuring sustainability of the fragile eco-system.



                                            71
7.     Participatory monitoring and evaluation as a mechanism of social audit and
grievance redressal emerged as best practices and helped in ensuring greater transparency
and accountability in project implementation.
 8.      The UDWDP phase-I and SLEM project achieved most of the project
development objectives and it proved to be a platform for introducing various new
initiatives like involving Van Panchayats for treatment of watershed in reserve forest
areas, gram panchayats as PIAs at the gram panchayat level, financial autonomy to the
community, greater participation of women, involvement of NGOs at various level of
project implementation, capacity development of local institutions, focus on increasing
productivity in rain-fed agriculture areas, revival of traditional water sources and water
mills (Gharats) and promotion of alternative energy sources like pine briquetting, bio-gas
and solar energy devices to address climate change issues, government order for
sustainability and convergence arrangements with line department for future O&M. The
satisfactory completion of these projects was widely acclaimed at various levels and was
instrumental in getting the second phase of Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed
Development Project and a participatory watershed development component in the IFAD
funded Integrated Livelihood Support Project (ILSP).
9.     The Bank supported the project management team through their regular
supervision, appraisal and technical missions throughout the project period.


Comments – Global Environment Facility Secretariat, GEF:
10.    From the 12 to the 25 of November, 2013, a team from the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) Secretariat undertook a learning mission to the India Sustainable Land
and Ecosystem Management Country Partnership Program (SLEM-CPP). The team was
composed of Mohamed Bakarr (Coordinator for the Land Degradation Focal Area),
Jean-Marc Sinnassamy (Program Manager, Land and Forests), Andrew Chilombo
(Program Associate, Land and Forests), Patrizia Cocca (Communications and
Knowledge Management), and Omid Parhizkar (Results-Based Management). The
mission was jointly organized with the World Bank as lead GEF Agency for the
program and with full support of the Ministry of Environment and Forests and State
Government Agencies involved in the Program.

11.    The considered project, “Sustainable Land Water and Biodiversity Conservation
and Management for Improved Livelihoods in Uttarakhand Watershed Sector”
(Uttarakhand-SLEM), was one of the six projects financed by the GEF in India as part of
a programmatic approach developed at national level – the Sustainable Land and
Ecosystem Management Country Partnership Program (SLEM-CPP). This project was
financed under three main strategic objectives related to land degradation, biodiversity,
and climate change adaptation 39.



39
  These objectives were: Land Degradation Strategic Objective 2 that supports sustainable forest
management in production landscapes; Biodiversity Strategic Objective 4 that strengthens the policy and


                                                   72
12.    This Uttarakhand-SLEM project provided an important learning opportunity to
highlight the added value of the GEF in generating global environmental benefits,
its catalytic effect, and how GEF resources are programmed to complement
development-focused projects such as the Gramya I. The World Bank financed projects
on decentralization and agriculture with the Rural Water and Sanitation Project and the
Diversified Agriculture Support Project prepared the context for the Uttarakhand-SLEM
project. The baseline scenario was provided by the Gramya I (US$70 million)
supporting 75 watersheds and additional government contribution (around US$22
million). The GEF support of $7.49 million focused on 20 sub-watersheds,
demonstrating an incremental reasoning by linking development priorities to global
environmental benefits. Additionally, the project employed an integrated ecosystem
management approach with climate change adaptation as an entry point, and involved
local stakeholders and local communities as beneficiaries. The GEF catalytic role was
reflected in specific activities related to the protection and management of agro-
ecosystem services such as surface water harvesting, groundwater recharge, forest
landscape restoration and management. Lastly, interventions were defined through
participatory processes and were multidisciplinary, targeting drivers of ecosystem
degradation. The diversity of interventions reflected the dependence of livelihoods with
the quality of natural resources and inspired opportunities for the GEF to support local
livelihoods while generating global environmental benefits.

13.     The leadership of the State government, the Watershed Management Directorate,
and the local stakeholders were a cornerstone in the reinforcement of capacities in the
Gramya I and Uttarakhand-SLEM Project. Noteworthy also during the learning mission
were best practices related to capacity development: the secondments of staff from line
departments to the watershed authorities created a favorable environment for
multidisciplinarity and integrated decisions. Gender issues were seriously considered
from various angles: including women in decision-making processes and equity
concerns, highlighting women’s specific roles and activities, as well as social
mobilization. Lastly, the Uttarakhand-SLEM project used various participatory
approaches for planning, implementation and monitoring. The project empowered
traditional authorities to manage forest reserves, engaged NGOs on some project sub-
components, and empowered local stakeholder groups, especially women.

14.    From a GEF perspective, the project has demonstrated great potential to generate
multiple global environment benefits and increase the sustainability and resilience of
agro-ecosystems. The activities undertaken in the project are related to land
rehabilitation, forest management, water works recharging systems, and the uptake of
alternative energies. Given the variability of ecosystems in the catchment area and the
project life span, the monitoring and quantification of generated global
environmental benefits remains challenging. However, it is hoped that future




regulatory framework for mainstreaming biodiversity; and the Climate Change Strategic Program for
Adaptation.



                                                  73
investments in the region will take into account this challenge for improvement and
innovation.

15.    Sustainability of interventions was recognized and addressed right from the
project conceptualization and design stage to project implementation at field level.
Knowledge sharing, documentation, and communication were important attributes of the
project approach, providing the foundation for sustainability, increased awareness and
potential of scaling-up integrated ecosystem management at state as well as national
levels. Coupled with the satisfactory completion of the Uttarakhand-SLEM project and
the success of the approach, conditions are gathered for another phase of Decentralized
Watershed Development in Uttarakhand.
