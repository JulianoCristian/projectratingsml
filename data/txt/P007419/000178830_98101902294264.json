rehabilitation, and\n            to raise the sugar industry's efficiency from the\n            present unsatisfactory levels. The project provides for the\n            rehabilitation of the physical works for Jamaica's only\n            sugar refinery and its three largest raw sugar factories and\n            a technical assistance program to improve the efficiency of\n            cane and sugar production. The physical works consist of a\n            large number of individual jobs to replace and/or renovate\n            worn-out or outmoded facilities, and improve efficiency. The\n            technical assistance consists of studies leading to\n            improvement in (a) cane harvesting, loading and quality\n            assessment, and (b) factory operations, maintenance and\n            management. The project also includes training elements."}, "docdt": "1978-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
