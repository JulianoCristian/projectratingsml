The special rate was moved from US$1=J$1.25 to J$1.28 on October 21, 1977, and
to J$1.35 on January 13, 1978, when the basic rate was also changed from US$1=
J$0.909 to J$1.05. Project costs and financial projections, originally prepared
using the initial special rate, were not revised to reflect the current rate
because the effect of the subsequent devaluations on project analysis is not
significant.

JAMAICA
SUGAR REHABILITATION PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A.   The Place of Agriculture in the Economy
1.01      Agriculture is still a major source of income and employment in
Jamaica. In spite of continuous migration from the rural to the urban areas
in recent years, about 60% (1.2 million) of the population lives outside
the urban centers. Hence agriculture, especially sugarcane cultivation,
has considerable impact on the economic and social development of Jamaica.
It currently contributes approximately 7% to the gross national product,
over 30% to national employment and about 13% to export earnings.
B.   Rural Poverty
1.02      There is considerable poverty, underemployment, and unemployment in
the rural areas. About 80% of the rural population have incomes less than a
third of the national average (relative poverty) and at least a third of the
rural population earns less than the income considered necessary to provide
minimum calorific requirements (absolute poverty). There are however excep-
tions such as the sugar industry and the larger export-oriented agricultural
enterprises, where, principally as a result of strong union pressure, the
income levels are equal to or above the national level of US$1,070. Rural
unemployment is said to be only 7%, as against 25% in the urban area, the
discrepancy in the figures being due to the fact that there is a constant
migration of the rural unemployed to the urban centers, in particular to
Kingston. Traditionally the country's economic development policies have
been industry-oriented, and only in recent years has Government directed
substantial financial resources to the rural areas, especially for the
improvement of rural housing, water supply, electrification, and vocational
training. (Again, the sugar industry has been an exception since it has
traditionally provided housing, infrastructure and training for many of
its workers.) By these methods Government is trying to slow down urban
immigration, but it is still too early to judge the success of such efforts.
C.   Resources and Land Use
1.03      Out of a total surface area of 2.7 million acres, about 1.5 million
acres in Jamaica are designated as "land in farms", the remainder being
mostly forest. A third of the agricultural "land in farms" is of very
limited agricultural potential and, in effect, Jamaican agriculture is based
on about one million acres of land. Of this only about 25% is flat to un-
dulating, the remainder being very hilly and requiring good conservation
practices if it is to be utilized intensively. There is ample rainfall
(about 2,000 mm annually on average) but its distribution is uneven and
partial droughts are frequent. Of the million acres of agricultural land,



- 2 -
about 60% is utilized for crops and 40% for pasture, mostly unimproved grass-
land. The largest proportion of cropland is under sugarcane (30%), followed
by coconut (19%), citrus, coffee, cocoa and other tree crops (20%) and bananas
(16%). The remainder (15%) is used for various food crops (legumes, yams,
pineapples and vegetables) and tobacco. The national herd comprises about
280,000 head of cattle, 200,000 each of sheep, goats and pigs, and 4 million
poultry.
D.   Structure
1.04      Jamaican agriculture has traditionally consisted of two sectors
namely (a) the export-oriented, large-scale plantation sector engaged in the
production of cash crops and beef cattle, and (b) small-scale farmers, produc-
ing food crops and livestock largely for domestic consumption. In recent years
economic, social and political factors have changed this pattern into a more
diversified structure. Thus, the importance of the plantation sector has
declined, while at the same time, a small to medium-sized, more capital-
intensive commercial farm sector has emerged. In addition, Government has
developed agricultural cooperatives on a large scale, especially in the sugar
industry. Parallel to this, many holdings are no longer farmed full-time
and serve primarily as rural dwellings although they are still classified
as small farms.
E.   Land Distribution
1.05      Agricultural land is very unevenly distributed among 192,000 holdings.
About 15% of the land is in 150,000 farms of less than five acres, 22% in
37,000 farms of five to 25 acres, 3% in 1,755 farms of 25 to 50 acres, 5% in
1815 farms of 50 to 100 acres, 13% in 800 farms of 100 to 500 acres, and 42%
in 630 farms of 500 acres and above. Two-thirds of the farms over 500 acres
are owned by Government, the bauxite companies, and (since 1976) the sugarcane-
growing cooperatives. In recent years Government has, however, distributed
sizeable tracts of land to about 20,000 smallholders and landless laborers
under its Project Land Lease. Similar land distribution schemes, including
those under the Bank-financed First Rural Development Project (Loan 1464-JM),
are expected in the future. The skewed distribution of land, with the consider-
able underutilization of resources that has resulted, has been a major impedi-
ment to the development of agriculture and the prosperity of rural areas.
F.   Production and Performance
1.06      Traditionally, Jamaica's agriculture has been export-oriented, with
sugarcane and bananas being the most important crops. In recent years, how-
ever, agricultural exports have declined considerably, although this has
been compensated for to some extent by increasing production of crops for
domestic market. Sugar output has declined from a peak of over 500,000 tons
in 1965 to under 350,000 tons in 1976. This has been due to a number of
problems (detailed in Chapter 2) including poor management, labor diffi-
culties and lack of investment. Total banana production is estimated to
be about 250,000 tons, but exports declined sharply from a peak of 127,000



- 3 -
tons in 1972 to 77,000 tons in 1976, largely because of increased domestic
consumption. Similarly, exports of fresh citrus products have decreased,
though total production has increased slightly.
1.07      In spite of the potential productivity of its tropical pastures,
Jamaica imports 75% of its milk and 40% of its meat. Dairies are concentrated
mainly in the eastern part of the island because of a lack of processing
capacity in the western portion, but a new plant being built in Montpelier
is expected to improve the situation. Lack of refrigeration and pasteuriza-
tion facilities results in large sales of raw and condensed milk. Beef
production is limited largely because of low returns per acre and the lack
of suitable processing and distribution facilities. Nor do small livestock
such as pigs, sheep and goats make significant contributions to the meat
supply. An increasing proportion of Jamaica's requirement for meat is
however being met by an efficient broiler industry, based on imported feed,
which is largely in the hands of five companies who deal with about 300
contracted farmers.
1.08      The overall performance of the agricultural sector has not been
commensurate with its physical potential. Over the last decade, production
has remained stagnant, resulting in a decline in agricultural output and
food production per capita. This has been particularly evident for export
crops, which have been decreasing at an annual rate of 5% in constant
prices. Although food-crop production has increased in the last few years,
it has not kept pace with domestic demand. As a result, food imports have
increased at an annual rate of 5% to reach J$120 million in 1975. More
recently restrictions imposed by Government in 1976 reduced food imports
to J$80 million.
1.09      The unsatisfactory performance of the agricultural sector may be
broadly attributed to:
(a) its long-standing neglect by Government;
(b)  the reluctance of the plantation sector to adjust to changing
socio-economic conditions;
(c) highly skewed land distribution;
(d) the lack of adequate agricultural services, especially
extension and applied research, to provide support to
small and medium-sized farms;
(e) deficient infrastructure and social services in rural areas;
(f) deficient marketing arrangements for both food and some export
crops;



- 4 -
(g) inertia regarding the application of improved farm practices
and failure to intensify land use and cropping patterns; and
(h) inter-related problems of low capital formation and the private
sector's reluctance to invest in agriculture.
G.   Government Support Services
1.10      Numerous government agencies are involved in the agricultural sector
and this poses serious administrative problems. The Ministry of Agriculture
has principal responsibility, but a number of other agencies control important
subsectors or special agricultural development programs. For instance agri-
cultural marketing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce and Trade
and various virtually autonomous Commodity Marketing Boards, while the main
credit agencies such as the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) and the Agricul-
tural Credit Board (ACB) are largely controlled by the Ministry of Finance.
Irrigation is partly under the Ministry of Public Utilities and partly under
the Ministry of Mining and Natural Resources, while extension services to the
farmer reported until recently to 13 semi-autonomous Land Authorities - relics
of the former Ministry of Rural Land Development. The Commodity Boards also
provide extension services, each in their specific fields of interest. This
situation has led, and still does lead, to inefficient use of scarce human
and financial resources and to uncoordinated and fragmented, and therefore
inadequate, services to the farmer. Government has recognized these short-
comings and, with Bank assistance through the Rural Development Project,
has initiated a reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture.  The Ministry
is to be reorganized along functional decentralized lines, and will re-
incorporate all extension services. It will take some time to complete this
reorganization and consequently improvements in services to the agricultural
sector will materialize slowly.
H.   Government Policies
1.11      Government is well aware of the problems outlined and, with Bank
assistance, undertook in 1973 an in-depth agricultural sector study. This
resulted in a Cabinet-approved policy for improving agricultural production,
rural infrastructure and enhancing rural living conditions. Based on the
recommendations of this study, Government has initiated an agricultural
development program which has the following objectives:
(a)  intensification of land utilization by introducing a progressive
land tax and by reactivating the Land Development and Utilization
Commission, which requires owners of idle or underutilized
holdings in excess of 50 acres to intensify land use or to rent
or sell the property to Government for subsequent distribution
to landless people or smallholders on a lease basis (Project
Land Lease);
(b)  increasing credit availability through programs administered by
ACB and JDB;



-5-
(c)  introduction of improved farm inputs and practices through
subsidies for better planting materials, fertilizers, and
soil conservation;
(d)  encouragement of production of sugar, bananas, and citrus
by subsidized marketing services through the Agricultural
Marketing Corporation and guaranteed minimum prices;
(e)  expansion of food crop and livestock production through
special development projects and through the Government-
owned Agricultural Development Corporation;
(f)  improvement in the effectiveness of the Ministry of
Agriculture by centralizing its policy functions and
decentralizing its program implementation and service
functions; and
(g)  improvement of rural infrastructure.
1.12      The implementation of this program was initiated with enthusiasm
but has unfortunately run into difficulties, caused by the financial problems
experienced since mid-1976. It has also proved very difficult to provide
employment opportunities for as many as 40,000 new job-seekers annually.
Government nevertheless recognizes the vital role of agriculture and
reemphasized its importance in April 1977 by formulating an Emergency Produc-
tion Plan which called for immediate increases in food production and for a
long-term agricultural strategy to be completed by the end of 1977. A prin-
cipal objective of the Plan would be to bring 50,000 acres of presently
unutilized land into production. This would be accomplished by: expanding
credit availability for small holders (5 acres and less) who are not able
to farm their entire plots because of capital shortages; making available
25,000 unutilized acres to small farmers through Project Land Lease. These
programs are indicative of Government's commitment to agriculture, but
ultimate success will depend on the ability of the public sector to: imple-
ment the proposed schemes effectively; provide a timely supply of agricultural
inputs and adequate technical services, especially for the development of
the small-farm sector; and maintain a favorable investment climate to facili-
tate expansion of the medium-sized commercial farm sector.

II. THE SUGAR INDUSTRY
A.   Historical Background
2.01      Sugar has been produced in Jamaica for centuries.  The sugar industry
has long been a cornerstone of the economy: a major employer, an important
source of foreign exchange and, all too often, a center of social and political
controversy. Throughout the industry's history there have been periods of
growth and decline, determined by prevailing economic and social conditions,
but it has always adapted to these changes. The last cycle began at the end
of World War II, and the period thereafter has been marked by contrasting
developments. Sugar production increased from 178,000 tons in 1946 to an
all-time record of 506,000 tons in 1965, when the industry employed directly
over 60,000 people, and over 30,000 independent cane farmers delivered cane
to 18 factories. Since 1965, however, the acreage devoted to cane cultivation,
cane yields, and total cane production have all steadily declined as shown
below:

2.02      The sugar industry has traditionally been a controversial one in
the Caribbean in general and Jamaica in particular.  In the case of Jamaica
successive Governments appointed between 1944 and 1966 no fewer than five
Commissions to inquire into various aspects of the industry and to propose
solutions for current problems. The most recent Commission was appointed
in December 1966 at a time of great technical expansion and social tension
in the sugar industry. Its findings were published in October 1967 in the
Mordecai report (named after the Commission's chairman) and is considered
one of the most significant and authoritative reports ever produced on the



- 7 -
Jamaican sugar industry. Acting on its recommendations, the Sugar Industry
Authority (SIA) was established by Government in April 1970 as a regulatory
and marketing body, improvements in cane and sugar production were initiated,
harvesting committees of manufacturers and cane farmers were installed and
the rationalization of factory ownership started. However, many of the
Mordecai Commission's recommendations were not put into effect, and the
industry's basic problems remained unresolved.
2.03      At the time of the Mordecai Report (1967) the structure of the
industry was relatively simple, there being three groups of interested parties:
estate owners, independent cane farmers and sugar workers. The total acreage
of cane grown was about 175,000 acres, but of this only about 155,000 acres
were actually reaped in any one year. Approximately half of the cane acreage
was owned and operated by estates, the largest of which were owned by foreign
interests and owned the 18 factories then in existence. The other half was
owned by approximately 30,000 independent cane farmers. Of these a large
number grew only a few acres of cane, but at the other end of the scale were
farmers who grew as much as 1,500 acres. The latter were virtually small
estates but were not classified as such because they did not have their own
sugar factories. Workers were employed both by the estates (in their fields
and factories) and by the larger farmers. The estate owners were all members
of the Sugar MIanufacturers Association (SMA), the independent farmers were
usually members of the All Island Jamaica Cane Farmers Association (AIJCFA),
while the workers were members of the two largest unions on the island, the
Bustamante Industrial Trade Union and the National Workers Union. At that
time Government did not have a dominant role in the industry. In the last few
years however a number of events have occurred, the most important being the
relatively rapid decline of the estates and increasing Government participation
and control. This control has been exercised by the formation of the SIA, the
purchase of estate-owned cane lands, and more recently by the acquisition of
five of the remaining twelve sugar factories.
2.04      Government ownership of significant sections of the industry began
in 1970 when it bought the three largest estates on the island, namely Frome,
Monymusk and Bernard Lodge. At that time Government bought only the land
and not the three factories attached to the land, the original idea being
to subdivide the land into medium-sized parcels and sell it off freehold to
independent cane farmers. To manage its new assets while this was being
done, Government established the Frome Monymusk Land Co. (FMLC). However,
shortly after the purchase the Government changed, and with it policies
also changed. The new Government was averse to the concept of selling off
the land freehold and instead favored cooperative or leasehold titles.   FMLC
did not have the facilities to operate the acquired cane lands (about 57,000
acres), and, since Government wished to avoid a disruption of cane supplies to
the three factories, the bulk of the newly-acquired lands were leased back to
their original owners. Three sections, one per estate, were however retained
by FMLC, and on these were established in 1974 three pilot cane-growing
cooperatives.  It was initially envisaged that the three pilot cooperatives
would be run on an experimental basis for several years, and that if they



were successful additional cooperatives would be formed. Later it was decided,
largely on political grounds, to accelerate the formation of cooperatives.
Accordingly in 1975-77 all the erstwhile estate lands were subdivided into
23 cooperatives (see Chapter 3 for further details).
2.05      Originally Government had no intention of buying sugar factories,
its interests being mainly in the land, and assumed that economic circumstances
and conmmercial logic would lead to a policy of rationalization and the closing
down of the smaller uneconomic units. Policies and circumstances however
changed, the factory owners were not averse to selling, and after a series of
lengthy and complicated manoeuvers by 1977 Government had become the sole
holder of the equity of the Frome, Monymusk and Bernard Lodge factories (see
Chapter 3). By doing so it in effect became the owner of 65% of the
sugar-processing capacity of the country.
B.   Problems of the Sugar Industry
2.06      The sugar industry has been beset by many problems and there have
been a variety of reasons for its recent decline, namely:
(a)  The management of the industry, which has been dominated by
the owners of the large estates, has been slow to adjust to
changing economic and political circumstances and has on
occasion followed policies that have antagonized Government
and led to confrontation with labor.
(b)  The activity of the trade unions, which are closely affiliated
to the two political parties, has had a significant influence
on the decline of the industry through the encouragement of
lax industrial discipline, excessive wage demands without
reference to productivity, unnecessary employment creation,
incessant strike action and industrial arson.
(c)  Excessive wage increases, difficult labor relations and
competition from other crops have led to a decline in the
areas under cane, particularly cane grown by the individual
farmers.
(d)  Failure to change the formula for splitting sugar revenues
between cane farmers and sugar factories to reflect current
costs, which has reduced the amount of finance available for
on-going replacements in the factories. This has, in turn,
led to poor factory operation, long harvest duration and low
productivity, especially in the wetter areas.



- 9 -
(e)  The burning of cane in some areas, push-pile loading and the
poor management of many aspects of harvesting and cane
transport have reduced the quality of cane and lowered both
sugar production and industrial efficiency.
(f)  The rapid growth of the bauxite and tourist industries has
competed for scarce management and labor skills during a
critical period and set wage levels within the island which
the sugar industry could not afford to match.
(g)  Government policies emphasizing public-sector participation
have caused reluctance on the part of private factory and
farm owners to make investments necessary to maintain effi-
ciency.
(h)  Recent foreign-exchange shortages have necessitated the conti-
nuation of underinvestment even in properties which have passed
from the private to the public sector.
C.   Economic and Social Importance
2.07      Despite its most recent decline, sugar is still vital to the
Jamaican economy and social fabric: its cultivation represents the biggest
area under a single crop (30% of "land in farms"); it is still the most
valuable export crop, and it produces the raw material, molasses, for the
production of rum and alcoholic beverages. Although the total value of
sugar and sugar products declined from 50% of total export value in 1948
to about 10% in 1976, they still provide over 50% of all agricultural export
value. Sugar therefore remains the economic cornerstone of Jamaica's agricul-
ture. Many observers within and outside Jamaica, foreseeing a further decline
in sugar production, advocate a timely diversification into other crops.
Certain other specialty crops, such as vegetables, bananas, some exotic plants
and flowers, spices and food crops, could possibly generate a higher rate of
return per acre if intensively cultivated. However, such crops are market-
sensitive, highly sensitive to climatic fluctuations, and require optimal
water supply and considerable managerial skills. Moreover, they represent
no real alternative to sugar cultivation, since: they have limited markets;
their expansion is still feasible on other available unutilized lands in
Jamaica; and, finally, many of the cane lands are not suitable for them.
The issue now in the cane area is not so much diversification from sugar, but
the restoration of productivity and efficiency.
2.08      The social importance of the sugar industry is illustrated by: its
employment directly and indirectly of about 50,000 people or 6% of the total
labor force and almost 20% of the labor force in agriculture; the opportunity
it provides for technical training; and the security it gives to many small
farmers by guaranteeing the take-off of a crop they can easily grow. The
sugar industry provides employment directly to 43,000 people and indirectly
to 7,000 in related enterprises (such as workshops, transport, construction,



- 10 -
distribution). It is recognized however that the factories are overstaffed
(see para 2.49) and that the cooperatives have too large a membership (see
para 3.17); according to rough estimates there is a total industry over-
staffing of about 3,000 individuals.
2.09      The sugar industry is in fact a heavy industry, and, as such, it
needs the services of and provides contracts to many ancillary industries.
In these industries many technical people of various skills are employed,
and the sugar factories also employ a great number of highly trained people.
Further contraction of the industry would not only mean less employment
opportunity, but also less technical training and know-how on the island.
2.10      Union pressure in the sugar industry and the influence of the
bauxite and tourist industries have led to continuous wage increases and the
granting of many fringe benefits to the sugar workers and staff. Consequently,
the income level is high. The average yearly cash earnings of factory laborers
are estimated at J$2,860, which is above the average urban income of J$2,440.
The averages for field and factory staff (overseers and above) are J$6,300 and
J$8,800 p.a. respectively. The average income for field labor and for coopera-
tive members, which is still based on collective union agreement, is somewhat
lower, but also well above the overall island average. The average income,
direct and indirect, of all sugar industry employees is about J$3,000 per
year. At present the industry cannot bear the excessive costs resulting from
too many employees and high salary levels, nor can it await the effect of
natural attrition, even though the average age of sugar workers is more
advanced than that of the general labor force.
D.   Government Policies
2.11      Government, aware of the very difficult situation in the sugar
industry and convinced of its continuing vital role in the country's economy,
has channelled most of its recent efforts to rehabilitate the industry through
the SIA.  The latter has centered the recovery around the following measures:
(a) maintaining a guaranteed price;
(b) rationalization of factory ownership;
(c) full participation of all interested parties in the
development of the industry;
(d) measures to improve agronomic practices;
(e) modernization of factories;
(f) factory-standard legislation;
(g) personnel training.



- 11 -
2.12      The guaranteed price is designed to assure cane and sugar producers
a steady income to build up confidence and permit long-term planning, there-
by encouraging farmers to continue producing cane. This price policy is
further discussed in para 2.39 ff. The underlying assumption of this policy
is that the guaranteed price should be remunerative for reasonably efficient
producers.  The criteria, however, for reasonable efficiency are not spelled
out, and this leaves much room for ad hoc adjustment, which is expected to
continue.
2.13      The fragmented ownership of the past has been reduced by the
recent formation of the National Sugar Company Ltd. (National Sugar) to
operate five sugar factories controlling 65% of the country's sugar produc-
tion and other installations. The company, more fully described in Chapter
3, provides a vehicle for the objective of promoting mergers in the sugar
industry where appropriate and taking over unprofitable operations which
might otherwise go out of production. The concept behind its formation
was that certain aspects of sugar production, such as maintaining industrial
relations and allocation of capital resources, must be organized centrally
under Jamaican control to achieve maximum efficiency. It is likely that
National Sugar, which already exerts a major influence in various regulating
bodies, will increase its control over the industry.
2.14      The past confrontation between employers and employees has inflicted
heavy losses on the economy and weakened the competitive position of the sugar
industry. Government is convinced that only worker participation in sugar
production can lead to stable industrial relations and development, and there-
fore it has precipitated the creation of cooperatives in major cane-growing
areas and fostered worker representation in factory management. As discussed
in para 3.13 ff, the speed with which cooperatives have been created has
exacerbated an already difficult situation, which does not lend itself to
quick or easy solutions.
2.15       Many of the problems of the factories stem from the field, since
the cane quality determines in large part factory efficiency and productivity.
SIA has taken several measures to improve the quality of the cane supply:
legislation covering extraneous matter; introduction of quality cane payments
and improvement of field/mill communications through the harvesting committees
(para 2.02). However, the desired improvement has not occurred, principally
because strong enforcement of existing measures has been lacking and stronger
incentives to produce high-quality cane are needed (see para 2.34 ff).
2.16       The modernization of factories will help to improve their reli-
ability, which is an important condition for a successful harvest campaign
and for better cane quality. The rehabilitation of the three major factories,
producing 65% of the total sugar production, is the subject of this project,
and Government through SIA is expected to assist other factories in this
respect. The success of the rehabilitation program will also depend on the
quality and attitude of factory personnel. To improve this situation, SIA
(through its research/extension division, the Sugar Industry Research
Institute - SIRI) has started a training program for factory employees, which
National Sugar would continue (see para. 2.50).

E.    Current Structure of the Industry
2.17       As already mentioned (para 2.03), at the time of the Mordecai
report, the industry structure was reasonably simple. Estates, cane farmers,
and labor were organized in national organizations, namely the estate owners'
association (SMA), the cane farmers' association (AIJCFA) and the two labor
unions. As a result of industry transition (paras 2.04-05) various new
institutions have been created without the old ones being phased out, and the
industry structure at the moment appears overly complex. The principal
institutions involved in the industry and their main functions are listed
below. Their interrelationships are illustrated in Chart 1 on the following
page and a more thorough description of the more important ones is provided in
Chapter 3.
1)    Overall Coordinator                           Functions
SIA                                     Financing (see para 2.29);
marketing; research, extension
and training (through SIRI)
2)    Sugar Production
a.  National Sugar                      Operation of five factories
(see Table 2.2 on page 14) and
ancillary facilities
b.  Sugar Manufacturers Corporation   The successor to SMA, its
of Jamaica (SMCJ)                   principal function now is
acting as SIA's marketing
agent. It is expected that
National Sugar will eventually
take over its staff and
functions
c.  Independent Factory Owners          Operation of seven factories
(see Table 2.2), canefields and,
in many cases, distilleries
3)    Cane Cultivation
a.  AIJCFA                              Represents all cane farmers
b.  Cooperatives                        Operation of 23 farms supplying
about 50% of cane requirements of
the three major factories
c.  United Sugar Workers'               Represents the cane-growing
Cooperative Council (USWCC)         cooperatives (see para 3.14)

2.18      Rainfall and water supply.  Most cane-growing areas of the island
receive adequate rainfall, the exception being the southern plains, where two
of the three factories to be rehabilitated under the project (Monymusk and
Bernard Lodge) as well as two small ones (New Yarmouth and Innswood) are
located (see map), and where cane supply was reduced by about 30% as a result
of severe drought conditions in 1976-1977.
2.19      In the Monymusk area, rainfall has generally been below the 70-year
40-inch annual average during the past decade; the most recent ten-year
average is about 30 inches. Assuming an average rainfall of 30 inches and
continuation of the presently low irrigation efficiency of 40% (which is
general for the area), annual water supply is only 72% of annual water require-
ments. In July, the month of maximum demand, only 43% of the cane's water
requirements is satisfied. If the efficiency could be improved to a more
acceptable level of 60%, then the annual water supply could equal annual
requirements, and in the month of peak demand 64% of the plant's water re-
quirements would be met. If future annual rainfall returned to the 40-inch
level, present water supplies applied at the higher efficiency would be able
to cope with expected demands. The shortage of water is exacerbated by its
quality. The pumped water is classified as highly saline (average conductivity
of 3,000 micromhos) but with a low sodium hazard (average adsorption rate of
four), which results from excessive pumping during the past decade and conse-
quent sea water intrusion into the aquifer.

2.20      Improvement of irrigation efficiency without major capital expendi-
ture depends in large part on the Monymusk cooperatives, whose physical dis-
tribution systems are out of date and whose water management practices are
wasteful; while some efforts to improve the situation have begun, significant
improvements would have to await overall changes in the cooperative. Further
irrigation efficiency could be achieved by installation of different distribu-
tion systems, which require both capital expenditure and management. As a
last resort because of the very large capital expenditure, water supply could
be increased by the construction of a dam on the Rio Minho at Pinders. Pre-
feasibility studies of this dam have concluded that it could make an additional
70,000 acre-feet/year of water available to the Monymusk area, which would
satisfy the needs of about 6,000 acres. If none of the above solutions is
feasible, it is estimated that at least 3,000 acres will go out of cane
production.
2.21      The water-supply situation in the Bernard Lodge area is similar
to that around Monymusk, but the solutions are less clear. Irrigation effi-
ciency is high enough to leave less room for improvement (except by highly
capital-intensive application methods, such as overhead sprinkler or trickle),
no untapped nearby water sources exist, and the competition from nearby
Kingston for possible future sources of water from more distant sources would
be keen. Artificial re-charge of the aquifer through diversion of surface
water to sinkholes and construction of minidams has begun, and feasibility
studies for pumping second-stage treated effluent from Kingston are underway.
2.22      To improve the situation, SIA representatives have proposed the
transfer of responsibility for water management from the Monymusk cooperative
to SIRI. In a Plan of Action for the project, Government would indicate that
it would support this transfer, and SIA through SIRI would redesign field
layout and take other steps necessary to improve irrigation efficiency, send
annual reports detailing measures taken and irrigation-efficiency levels
achieved during the past year to the Bank and discuss its reports with the
Bank.
2.23      To define the extent of the salinity problem, estimate the speed
of future incursions of salt water and thereby assess future agricultural
losses and compare them with alternative means of providing water, soil
and groundwater salinity surveys of the Monymusk and Bernard Lodge areas
are to be undertaken by SIA under the Plan of Action, in which SIA would
confirm that it will make the tests in 1978, deliver its findings on the
subject to the Bank by March 31, 1979 and discuss them with the Bank.
2.24      At Frome, the problem is not water but drainage.  Maintenance of
regional drainage of the Cabarita river basin is of significant importance
in that area of comparatively high rainfall (about 80 inches/year), slight
grades and heavy soils. In the past, the estate maintained the drainage
systems, but now the estate has been subdivided into independent cooperatives,
which do not have the funds to maintain the drains. In the Plan of Action,
SIA would confirm that it would cause proper annual drain maintenance to be
carried out.

2.25      Cane Production.  Cane is currently produced by eight sugar estates,
23 primary sugarcane cooperatives, and about 20,000 independent cane farmers.
Cultivation and the harvest and transportation system range from highly
efficient (in the case of some private operations) to extremely deficient.
The estates and independent cane farmers generally utilize private contractors
for harvesting and transport, whereas the cooperatives at two of the three
major installations use their own forces (see para 2.38). Harvesting is
coordinated and regulated by 12 harvesting committees (one for each factory),
following the system established in 1970. These committees, which consist of
representatives of SIA, the factories, the cane farmers, and since 1974, the
labor unions, set the harvesting period and the cane quotas. Unfortunately,
frequent factory breakdowns and poor transport performance in the major cane
areas disrupt the harvest schedule and make the task of the committees very
difficult.
2.26      There are three general classifications of cane farms:
(a) Farms producing over 1,000 tons annually. The limit of 1,000 tons
is relevant, since farmers above this production level can deal
directly with SIA for development loans. Most of these farms
are above 100 acres.
(b) Farms with annual production between 500-1,000 tons of cane.
Most of these farms are between 15 and 30 acres.
(c)  Small farms in the plains and hills, mostly nonirrigated, with
plots below 15 acres (mostly below 5 acres) producing less than
500 tons cane per year.
While cost data are difficult to obtain, particularly from medium and small
cane farmers, it is generally conceded that present cane--price levels compen-
sate farmers sufficiently, as set forth in more detail i-a paras 2.39-41, but
that farmers dependent on irrigation may face difficulties in the future due
to the high costs of pumping water.
2.27      Cane varieties and diseases.  The principal disease problem in
Jamaica is sugarcane smut, first positively identified in November 1976.
The high-yield cane variety HJ 57/41 is particularly susceptible; this variety
occupies about 85% of the Frome cooperatives' acreage and lesser proportions -
generally 20-50% - of other cooperatives and large estates. Wlile the disease
was subsequently identified in many different areas over a short time span,
its level of infection has remained extremely low. SIRI's response to the
outbreak of the disease has been immediate and constructive, including island-
wide surveys, rogueing, guidance to cane growers through publications, seminars
and direct contact, and research on 26 alternative varieties to determine
susceptibility ratings. Initial tests have led to the expectation that seven
of the 26 may be sufficiently resistant, and SIRI is planning a four-year
replanting program to replace HJ 57/41 with less susceptible varieties. While
the direct losses from the incidence of smut are expected to be minimal, the
long-term indirect losses from substitution of cane varieties whose sucrose
yields are about 10% lower than HJ 57/41's would amount to about 3-4% of the



- 18 -
island-wide sugar crop, assuming that 30-40% of acreage is now in the higher-
yielding variety and that varieties as high-yielding as HJ 57!41 are not
developed.
2.28      Support Services.  Research and extension are provided by SIRI,
which replaced in September 1973 the Sugar Research Department of the largest
estate. In 1974 the institute was divided into two sections: one for agri-
cultural research, located in Mandeville, which also directs the extension
service for cane farmers and monitors crop loans for the SIA; and one for
factory technology, located in Kingston, which also directs an experimental
plant and training center at Bernard Lodge factory. Although there is an
extensive research program, SIRI is heavily engaged in statistical work and
monitoring for SIA. The field staff now consists of eleven officers for field
research and nine officers for extension service. To some degree, a large
cane production department at the Frome factory has overlapped SIRI's exten-
sion efforts, but National Sugar intends to transfer many of that department's
responsibilities and personnel to SIRI. While SIRI's monitoring duties for
SIA may overshadow its research activities, it has responded effectively to
the challenge presented by sugarcane smut disease; resolution of its organiza-
tional problems would be expected as a result of overall reviews of the indus-
try's structure (see paras 2.51 and 3.26).
2.29      Loan schemes.  Cane farmers obtain loans from two sources:  crop
financing from commercial banks and development loans from SIA.  The crop
financing is needed for out-of-crop expenses, is repaid out of crop sale pro-
ceeds and bears commercial rates of interest (at least 14% p.a., the current
prime rate). SIA's loan schemes are outlined in table 2.3 on the following
page. The loan schemes appear adequate to cover the farmers' needs for re-
planting, which is the principal use of funds, both in terms of total amount
available and in adequacy on a per-acre basis. Of the J$9 million annual
forecast loans from SIA's development fund (see para 7.08 ff for financial
forecasts), approximately J$4.5 million would be required for Jamaican cane
farmers" replanting loans if SIRI's goal of annual replanting of 16% of the
total cane acreage (23,000 acres out of 130-140,000) is to be met; the balance
would be available for equipment loans. The J$200/acre available is, if
properly controlled, sufficient incentive for farmers to replant, since this
amount should cover their costs, which are estimated as follows in J$/acre:
Minimum   Maximum
Land preparation; 4-D6 or 5-D4 hours        65        108
Seedcane:  3.5 tons                        70          70
Planting and re-covering                    20         27

While interest rates on SIA loans to farmers are less than recent annual
inflation rates, the resultant subsidy is more apparent than real, because
the price farmers receive for cane - also set by SIA recommendation - is
determined to provide for reasonably efficient cane farmers to meet all costs
and earn satisfactory profits (see para 2.39-41).
2.30      Equipment.  It is generally acknowledged that agricultural equip-
ment - cultivation, loading and transport machinery - throughout the island
is generally in need of replacement. However, until the serious deficiencies
of the cooperatives are corrected (see para 3.13 ff), there can be no assur-
ances that the portion of such equipment which might be made available to
the cooperatives would be put to good use. Consequently, the proposed project
specifically excludes any capital improvements for cane farmers.
2.31      Mechanization.  Primary cultivation operations involved in crop
production are carried out mechanically. Secondary operations, such as weed
control, fertilizer application and drainage, are carried out using both hand
and mechanical methods, probably to the extent of about 50% by each method.
Loading is completely mechanized over about 80% of the area. No mechanical
harvesting is at present carried out, but mechanical harvesting trials were
conducted in the early 1970s by SIRI's predecessor research organization.
While mechanical harvesters could cut and load green cane at lower cost (about
J$2.50/ton) than present costs for burned cane (up to J$4/ton), subsequent
increases in harvest-machinery prices have narrowed the cost difference. In
any event, introduction of mechanical harvesting would be totally unacceptable
to Government in this period of high unemployment throughout the island. This
Government attitude appears economically correct in Jamaica's current high-
unemployment situation; if labor costs were shadow-priced at 50% to reflect
the lack of alternative employment opportunities, the cost of existing methods
of cane loading/ harvesting would approximately equal that of mechanized
methods.
2.32      Inputs.  Because of shortages of foreign exchange, supplies of
fertilizers and other imported inputs have not been delivered to cane farmers
on time recently. Increased availability of foreign exchange and improved
Government procedures in issuing import licenses are expected to diminish
this problem in the future.
2.33      Cropping periods.  The optimum cropping period in the Frome area is
December through May; in the Monymusk and Bernard Lodge areas, December through
June or July. Principally because of extended factory stoppages, the harvest
season has been extended by two and ocassionally three months, with consequent
degradation of cane quality and lower juice extraction. Additionally, extend-
ing one hlarvest season often causes delays in starting the next because of the
time required for out-of-crop factory maintenance, which in turn necessitates
extending the next harvest season into months of heavy rainfall. Correction
of this situation would be a major goal of the proposed project.

G.   Cane Harvesting and Transport
2.34      Harvesting.  Over the past 20 years, cane harvesting and loading
practices in Jamaica have changed drastically. Whereas cane was once cut
green, de-trashed and bundled by hand to be passed into in-field trailers
and secured by sling chains, the practice now (because of past difficulties
in obtaining sufficient labor to cut green cane at the low pay scales then
prevailing) is to burn canefields, arrange the cut cane in rows on the soil
and gather the cane with a "push-pile" loader. The "push-piler" pushes
cane along the ground until enough has piled up so that it may be gathered
with a front-mounted grabber and loaded into in-field trailers. The principal
disadvantages of canefield burning is that the kill-to-mill time is increased
because cane fields are burned from 12 hours to several days before cutting,
which reduces sucrose content.
Push-piling effects are even more detrimental, because:
a.   The soil and other mineral extraneous matter harvested
with the cane damage the factory equipment and reduce
steam generation and sugar extraction;
b.   There is no method available for accurately measuring
the soil delivered with cane, so that farmers are paid
on the basis of total weight, including the soil;
c.   To reduce the soil content, factories have installed
cane-washing facilities, which are expensive to operate,
utilize precious water, and leach juice from the cane.
While difficult to quantify, it is felt that sugar output from green non-push-
piled cane delivered to the factories within 24 hours (in the case of nearby
farms) or 48 hours (in the case of more distant farms) would be at least 7%
and perhaps as much as 10% higher than from burned push-piled. In addition,
the factory operating costs - principally machinery wear and tear and cane-
washing - could be reduced significantly if push-piled cane were not accepted.
2.35      To improve the situation, SIA has implemented the following price
incentives to be paid to cane farmers for the 1978 crop (beginning in December
1977 - in J$/ton cane):
-    for cane harvested green (except for varieties
susceptible to smut disease, for which burning
is mandatory)                                                  1.00
-    for cane not push-piled and loaded with Toft-type
caliper                                                        1.25
-    for cane loaded with push-piler modified to
minimize collection of mineral extraneous matter               0.50

2.36      A preliminary estimate shows that the immediate results of the
recommended interim measure would be beneficial (except in areas of relatively
heavy rainfall, where increased disease risk might offset increased yields):

Net additional revenues per acre                                      47
2.37      To resolve the issue over the longer term, a study is required to:
a.   estimate the probable extent of the sugar losses being incurred
by the industry because of present methods of cane harvesting
and loading in the field, the factory yard and through the washing
plants, compared to traditional methods of cane handling and to
assess such costs/savings as are directly related to each method.
b.   determine the effectiveness of the present regulations governing
the purchase of cane, in promoting the delivery of fresh clean
cane.
c.   determine the technical feasibility and cost of returning to
a non-push-piling, green-cane regime, and to equate this to
increased recoverable sucrose, reduced in-factory processing
costs, and to the value of any agronomic advantages or
disadvantages which may be incurred.
d.   in the event that a system of harvesting which does not involve
push-piling and/or burning is feasible and economically advant-
ageous, to determine how best to eliminate these practices
and to substitute a recommended system.



- 23 -
e.   appraise the present method of estimating recoverable sucrose
in cane supplied by farmers and cooperatives and discuss:
i.   its accuracy
ii.   the degree to which it reflects the true relative values
of fresh clean canes and stale dirty canes
iii.   the degree to which it encourages factories to seek high
sugar recovery efficiency and to process canes at the
optimum daily rates.
f.   in the event of the above being unsatisfactory, give detailed
plans whereby the methods of determining recoverable sucrose in
cane can be improved.
Assurances were obtained from SIA during negotiations that it would: engage
consultants acceptable to the Bank to perform such a study under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank; make the study available to the Bank; and
discuss with the Bank the study's recommendations and the Jamaicans' program
to put into effect measures applicable to the 1979 and future crops. Because
of the desirability of putting the recommended measures in effect by October
1, 1978 so as to apply to the 1979 crop it is vital that the consultants be
engaged early in 1978. To ensure that this occurs, the Bank should not
declare the proposed loan effective until satisfactory arrangements (to be
defined in the Plan of Action as an outline of the scope and concept of the
study, a description of the qualifications of the personnel to be engaged,
and a timetable for study execution) for the retention of consultants have
been made. Draft terms of reference are included in the staff working papers.
SIA would also confirm in the Plan of Action that it will continue paying
incentives listed in para 2.35 until it puts into effect other incentives
resulting from the study and that it will consult with the Bank before
adopting new incentives.
2.38      Transport.  Except for the cooperatives at Frome and Monymusk,
cane farmers generally utilize contractors' services for transporting
cane from field to factory. Except at Bernard Lodge cooperatives, where
contractors' charges are excessive, this arrangement appears satisfactory.
At the other two estates, however, cane is hauled by transport cooperatives,
which are affiliates of the cane-growing cooperatives and are grossly in-
efficient: the management structure is severely understrength, overmanning
is rife, there is little discipline, and charge-out rates for equipment
compare unfavorably with outside contractors' rates to independent farmers.
Transport costs for most of the cooperatives' delivery are on the order of
J$4/ton, about double what they should be considering the distances involved.
To improve the efficiency of cane delivery to the three key factories, SIRI
and a McGill University team have begun a study pertaining to the Frome
factory and cane-growing areas under the Commonwealth Assistance Program of
the Canadian International Development Agency. SIA would confirm in the
Plan of Action that it would: deliver to the Bank all reports pertaining



- 24 -
to the study; undertake similar studies for Monymusk and Bernard Lodge, using
external assistance if possible and, providing the Bank with reports from those
studies; prepare an action program to put into effect the studies' recommenda-
tions; and discuss all findings and programs with the Bank.
H.   Cane Pricing
2.39      Under Jamaica's guaranteed-price system, Government (after SIA
recommendation) sets the ex-factory raw sugar price to cover the financial
requirements of reasonably efficient canefield and factory operations. Since
the system was initiated for the 1975 crop, the guaranteed price has been
fixed at J$270/ton sugar. Under the traditional West Indies formula, two
thirds of the guaranteed price is paid to cane farmers and the remaining
third is retained by the factory. Although there is considerable opinion
that the 2/3-1/3 formula is unduly compensatory to cane farmers (splits
ranging from 65-35 to 60-40 are prevalent in other areas of the world),
AIJCFA's effective representation has made Government reluctant to change
the split in Jamaica officially. At the same time, Government and SIA
recognize that increasing the guaranteed price would be unnecessarily bene-
ficial to the farmers while not sufficiently remunerative to the factories.
Instead, SIA has initiated ad hoc means of unofficially increasing the price:
a supplemental payment system was begun in 1975 (J$3/ton of sugar to the
factories and J$.50/ton of cane to the growers) to offset inflationary
forces; and special payments to cane farmers in the Monymusk area to offset
steep increases in electricity costs for irrigation pumping. While con-
tinuation of such ad hoc revisions to the guaranteed price system may not
be ideal, achievement of that ideal - annual revision of the guaranteed
price and split, based on objective determination of "reasonably efficient"
operating costs - would be extremely difficult to accomplish under present
circumstances, and further supplementary revisions are to be put into effect
(paras 2.35 and 7.02).
2.40      The present price for cane - J$180/ton of sugar content plus supple-
mentals -- provides sufficient incentive for farmers to stay in cane. To
illustrate this, SIRI has prepared examples for five large independent "reason-
ably efficient" cane farms operating under relatively disparate circumstances:
two irrigated in the southern plains, two non-irrigated in wetter parts of
the islarnd, and one non-irrigated in the relatively dry north. The summaries
(Table 2.4) show that cane-growing is particularly remunerative in the areas
supplying Frome and Bernard Lodge factories (the latter because of relatively
low irrigation charges). Drought conditions in 1976 resulted in extraordi-
narily high irrigation costs and reduced yields for Monymusk-area farmers;
under normal rainfall conditions, profits comparable to Bernard Lodge area
farmers could be expected. It is worth noting that the farmers' receipts per
ton of cane (about J$18) are relatively low, owing to the low juice content of
the cane delivered. This is caused by a number of circumstances which the
project would attempt to correct: poor harvesting practices (para 2.34) and
frequent factory stoppages, which increase the kill-to-mill time for cane
already cut and extend the harvest season beyond the optimum period, i.e. when
the cane's juice content is highest. If these situations were improved to the
extent that farmers received J$20/ton of cane (smaller private factories in
Jamaica Inow pay even higher prices), annual profit levels of J$5/ton or about
JS$150/acre would result, which would be satisfactory.

2.41      The examples, while illustrative for reasonably efficient large
cane farmers in an adverse climatic year, do not provide the whole picturp.
Costs of the cane-growing cooperatives, for example, are evidently consider-
ably higher because of overstaffing and poor management (see Chapter 3).
Part-time or absentee management, which is relatively common in Jamaica,
would presumably result in less efficient operations. Most importantly.
cost data for medium and small farmers are not available. To ascertain
that present and recommended cane-pricing was sufficientliy compensatory,
models for four smaller cane-growing operations have been prepared. As
shown below and on Table 2.5 on page 26, the models indicate that cane
growing is more remunerative for small- to medium-sized farmers than for
large ones:
Cost per ton cane -
present harvesting/
Farm Type                 Description                    loading methods
A          Over 200 acres, irrigated                     J$ 16.43
B          Over 200 acres, not irrigated                     14.19
C          About 30 acres, not irrigated                     13.00
D          Under 6 acres, not irrigated                      12.81
To be able to establish satisfactory cane-pricing policies (based on standard
costs) in the future, SIA should maintain current cost and yield data from all
cane farmers, not just from large independent ones. In the Plan of Action,
SIA would indicate that it would: continue to undertake annual surveys of
cane production costs, attempting to determine standard costs for respresenta-
tive types of cane farmers; and analyze the degree to which cane farmers
provide information to the survey, recommending and putting into effect
measures to improve compliance.
I.   Future Cane Availability
2.42      Tables 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 on pages 28-30 indicate the range of
possibilities of future cane production for each of the three factory areas,
assuming the solution or non-solution of the agronomic problems described
in the preceding paragraphs and the cooperative management problems discussed
in chapter 3. Under the worst-case assumption, i.e. if none of the problems
is resovled, cane availability for the Monymusk and Bernard Lodge factories
would be below the capacity which the proposed rehabilitation project is in-
tended to achieve. If this were to occur, a likely solution would be the
termination of operations at the nearby New Yarmouth and Innswood factories
and diversion of cane supplies from these factories to Monymusk and Bernard
Lodge.

satisfactory. Several of the small privately-owned factories, whose size

permits close supervision by their owner-managers, have continued to produce
sugar profitably eve! in years of adverse climatic and/or economic cir-
cumstances.  In somr  case- profits from rux pr,dictLon at distilleries co-
located with sugar factories have carried marginal sugar cperations. In the
case of the three largest factories, acute shortages of capital funds during
the past decade h>ve otriated replacement of ojer -ge or obsolete equipment
and improvements in operations which would have resulted from more efficient
plant layouts or modern equipment.  At the same time, higher-paying job.s -
principally in the bauxite industry - have lured a number of key management
and operating personnel from the sugar industry, thus leaving the factories
with less effective supervision at the very time when, because of equipment
deficiencies, more effective supervision was needed.
2.44      Cane Quality Assessment.  Neither the procedures for assessing cane
quality nor the execution of such assessment is adequate t:o promote optimum
juice extraction from cane. Current Government regulations (in effect since
January 1974) permit penalties which would be insufficient, even if carried
out, to discourage delivery of stale or dirty cane. For example: the cane
farmer records on the weigh bill the date of burning, but no mechanism exists
to prevent him from advancing the date so as to reduce penalties for excessive
kill-to-mill time; regulations requre that juice samples be taken from a
minimum of 10% of the cane delivered, but this statutory minimum - which is too
low - has become an effective maximum. While regulations permit the rejection
of cane containing more than 4% extraneous matter, it is doubtful if such
measures are routinely carried out. A standard factory efficiency of 91%
imposed by regulations may detract from cane quality assessment by promoting
the factory laboratory to demonstrate that the factory's actual efficiency
is equal to or better than the imposed target. These points and other related
ones would be examined in the study proposed in para 2.37, which would
suggest improvements in the procedures for and execution of this most vital
activity in the sugar-production process.
2.46      Factory mar-fgement and staffing.  A number of problems exist in
the management-labor situation at Jamaica's public-sector (and, to some
degree, at the privately owned) sugar factories. Principal among these are:
a shortage of highly qualified top-level managers; deficiencies in the
supervisory staff; excessive numbers of hourly-paid personnel; generally low
morale.
2.47      Management structures have been largely inherited from past private
owners' practices and do not necessarily meet National Sugar's immediate
and future needs. Company management has indicated that it would accept a
standard large-factory management structure (see chart 2 on the next page),
which the appraisal team suggested, as a general model for its three large
factories, allowing for minor variations at each factory. A key feature of
the suggested management structure is that each of the three large factories
should have an engineer specifically for plant inspections and maintenance
planning, assisted by at least two properly-instructed plant inspectors.
National Sugar would confirm in the Plan of Action that it would establish
and put into effect by June 30, 1978, satisfactory inspection and maintenance
procedures for the three key factories.

2.48      Management of some of National Sugar's factories has been weakened
by the loss of key personnel to other industries (para 2.06 f). However,
demand for key personnel by other industries has abated in the past few years,
and the company has begun to hire new factory and technical managers to make
needed replacements.
2.49      It is generally acknowledged that the three largest sugar factories
employ far too many people ineffectively; management in the past was unable to
resist pressure to employ excess quantities of manpower and present management
has not yet been able to resolve the situation. As a result of discussions
with the Bank, National Sugar management has analyzed its job requirements
at each of the three main factories to determine the optimum number of
employees. This analysis would result in reducing factory employment by 1980
as follows:
Frome factory                         298 people
Monymusk                              103
Bernard Lodge factory                  17
Total                            418
Assurances were obtained at negotiations from National Sugar that it would
carry out a satisfactory plan to rationalize manning levels, and from Govern-
ment that it would permit the company to do so.
2.50      Improvement of morale of factory employees - salaried as well as
hourly-paid - will require imaginative management attention, particularly with
the prospect of significant reductions in personnel. Worker participation, a
recent and relatively undefined event in Jamaican management-labor relations,
has provided both a further challenge to sugar-factory management and an
opportunity for improved relations. The challenge arises from the increased
power of the workers - through participation in management through their
representatives - and the resultant change in the relationship between the
worker and his line supervisor. At the same time, worker participation
provides management with a vehicle for instruction and guidance concerning
the need for increased diligence and care in performing job assignments,
which has been sorely lacking in recent years. This, together with increasing
technical training provided by SIRI - both via on-the-job instruction by
mobile teams and formal courses - presents an opportunity for significant
improvements in worker attitude and performance over the long run. To accom-
plish this, assurances were obtained at negotiations that National Sugar
would by December 31, 1978: (a) prepare detailed job descriptions for all
levels of company employees; (b) define the roles and responsibilities of
all levels of employees engaged in sugar production; (c) identify the train-
ing needs and prepare a training program to increase the technical capabili-
ties and improve job satisfaction and motivation of all employees; (d) iden-
tify organizational changes needed to improve the efficiency of sugar produc-
tion, refining and marketing and sugar by-products production; and (e) provide
the Bank with the four previous items.

2.51      Sugar milling.  The operating standards for milling require improve-
ment at all National Sugar factories. Insufficient attention is given to
obtaining proper settings of carriers and rollers, with resultant overspeeding,
sub-optimal sugar extraction and occasional damage to equipment. This is
caused primarily by inadequate supervision of the poorly-trained operators,
plus a lack of continued and timely information being provided to the
operators,. In the Plan of Action, National Sugar would confirm that it would
engage consultants with suitable experience in factory operations to:
(a) prepare suitable operating and maintenance standards, including
those relating to the provision of operating data; and
(b) provide in-factory training for milling operators.
2.52      Fuel oil consumption.  Consumption of fuel oil at the three largest
factories has reached excessive proportions for the following reasons:
(a) increasing power demands due to intensified or supplementary
operations;
(b) frequent factory stoppages, during which bagasse reserves
are consumed;
(c) boilers whose low thermal efficiencies were designed for
the original factories' less demanding operations;
(d) inadequate operating standards for boiler operations;
(e) the lack of sufficient information concerning boiler
conditions for the boiler supervisors.
While physical components of the proposed project would increase the boilers'
thermal efficiency (see Annex 1) and, in the long run, reduce factory out-
ages, additional effort and advice is needed to overcome items d and e above.
National Sugar has engaged a qualified engineer to prepare operating standards
for boiler operation, design means by which vital information could be conveyed
to operating personnel and provide in-factory training for boiler supervisors
at the three factories.

III. PRINCIPAL INDUSTRY ENTITIES
A.   Sugar Industry Authority (SIA)
3.01      The proposed borrower, SIA, is a statutory body established by an
August 1970 amendment to the 1937 Sugar Industry Control Act, which has been
amended subsequently. The authority, while nominally accountable to the
Minister of Agriculture, operates autonomously.
3.02      Responsibilities.  SIA is a regulatory body, responsible for the
balanced and orderly development of the industry. To this end it:
(a) directs the marketing of sugar both internally and for
export;
(b) makes loans to cane farmers and sugar factories from several
different funds (para 2.29).
(c) arranges financing to cover its loan schemes.
(d) proposes prices for cane and raw sugar to Government under
the guranteed-price scheme (para 2.39 ff).
(e) coordinates relations between industry components;
(f) participates in the direction of public-sector industry
entities;
(g) consolidates industry statistics and publishes a periodical
magazine;
(h) administers SIRI, which is responsible for research, exten-
sion and training related to both cane farming and sugar
production.
3.03      Management.  SIA's Board consists of its chairman, who is nominated
by the Minister of Agriculture, two representatives of SMCJ, two of AIJCFA
and one of each of the two principal labor unions. Day-to-day operations are
directed by the chairman who is assisted by a manager/secretary. The present
chairman formerly served on the Board as a representative of one of the two
unions. For periods of time the authority has operated without the services
of a full-time financial comptroller. While a qualified individual has now
been engaged to serve in that post, recurrence of this event might result in
substandard control over SIA's operations. To prevent this, assurances were
obtained from SIA during negotiations that it would employ a qualified full-
time financial comptroller at all times.
3.04      Finance.  Until 1975 SIA's operations were financed by a cess on
sugar production. Beginning in 1975 its expenses (after approval of its
budget by its own board and the Agriculture Minister) are charged against
the Crop Account for the current year. The flow of money among SIA's various



- 36 -
accounts and funds is illustrated in chart 3 on the following page. As
discussed in para 5.05, improvements in SIA's accounting and audit arrange-
ment have recently been initiated.
B.   National Sugar Company, Ltd.
3.05      The proposed loan's principal beneficiary, National Sugar was
formed on October 31, 1975 but did not become active until October 1, 1976.
A holding company with a small headquarters staff in Kingston, its shares are
effectively owned by government agencies - SIA and the Capital Development
Fund. As detailed below it now controls through wholly-owned subsidiaries
four sugar factories and related facilities. It also operates a fifth fac-
tory - Holland - which Government has owned for some time.
3.06      As a holding company, National Sugar's policy is to delegate res-
ponsibility to management of the operating units, except for financial and
staff matters. Budgeting, financial control, management accounting and inter-
nal control are all centralized in the Kingston headquarters, as are per-
"sonnel and industrial relations. Other services which the Kingston office
provides to the operating unit are:
- technical advice
- representation in industry organizations, e.g. SMCJ and SPF
- clearance of imported goods through customs
- overall direction and top management.
3.07      Management.  National Sugar's board of directors consists of the
chairman (who is in charge of the company's operations), the company's four
directors, three representatives of SIA, two of AIJCFA, and one of each of
the two unions. Its organization chart appears as chart 4 on page 38. The
company's top management, all with extensive experience in West Indian sugar
industry, is capable. Assurances were obtained from National Sugar during
negotiations that it would continue to employ an experienced and competent
chief exec:utive officer, technical director and financial director. As
noted in para 2.48, the company has begun making improvements in management
of its factories. However, until it attains sufficient management depth, the
company may encounter difficulty in achieving satisfactory operational results
from all its entities, particularly the smaller factories, and management may
be compelled to spread itself too thin instead of concentrating its efforts on
its three principal installations.
3.08      Past acquisitions.  National Sugar's first acquisition in March
1976 was 100% of the share capital of the West Indies Sugar Company Ltd.
(WISCO), i-ormerly controlled by the Tate & Lyle group of England, which owns:

- Frome factory
- two ports (Savanna-La-Mar and Salt River)
- half the ownership of the company which owns the
Monymusk factory, refinery, distillery and packaging plant.
The purchase was financed by SIA, which made a J$3 million interest-fr-e loan
to National Sugar and a J$1 million interest-free loan to ',MCJ, repayable by
transfer of National Sugar shares to SIA. SMICJ concurrentLy purchased
National Sugar's shares with the proceeds of the loan.
3.09      In the current fiscal year, National Sugar has azquired the share
capital of the companies which own the Bernard Lodge and Gray's Inn factories
and the remaining 50% of the Monymusk company. 1/ Financing for these
acquisitions was provided by SIA. National Sugar also operates the Holland
estate (canefields and factory), which Government owns.
3.10      Future expansion.  It is expected that National Sugar's scope of
operations will continue to expand, either by design or default. As the
recognized public-sector agent for sugar-factory operation, it is probable
that the company will acquire ownership of the Holland estate in the near
future. In keeping with Government's policy of maximizing sugar production
(and therefore keeping even unprofitable factories, e.g. Gray's Inn and
Holland, in operation) it is highly possible that National Sugar will acquire
the Long Pond (now owned by a Canadian liquor company) and Jamaica Sugar
Estates (whose shares are traded publicly in the UK) factories and canefields
at some future data. (Negotiations with the owners of the Long Pond have
been proceeding for two years).
3.11      As well as possibly increasing the number of operations, National
Sugar is expected to increase its scope, expanding into cane-farming.  It now
manages cane farms (leased from Government) supplying Gray's Inn. It expects
to take over management of the remaining Frome canefields which were not
cooperativized. If it takes over the Long Pond and Jamaica Sugar Estates
factories, it will most probably manage the respective canefields.
3.12      As noted in para 3.07, it is doubtful whether National Sugar has
sufficient management depth at this time to manage an incceasingly diverse
and extended sugar operation with optimum efficiency. This would be corrected
by new management talent at key factory positions (para 2.48), which would
release less-qualified managers to gain experience at smaller factories, and
by the training program to be provided (para 2.50). With the training to
be provided for its factory management, it would be in a better position
than any other entity in Jamaica to take on increased responsibilities once
the project is completed.
1/   To avoid confusion resulting from too many names, the companies are re-
ferred to in this report as the Bernard Lodge, 1Monymusk and Gray's Inn
companies.  Their proper names are Jamaica Sugar Manufacturing Co. Ltd.,
Clarendon Sugar Co. Ltd., and Gray's Inn Sugar Factory Ltd., respectively.

C.   The Cane-growing Cooperatives
3.13      The existence of cane-growing cooperat-ves which supply about half
the cane to each of the three major factories introduces a significant element
of risk into the project. Because of poor management and low worker/member
morale at some of the cooperatives and Government's limited action in address-
ing their problems so far, cane production at a number of cooperatives, parti-
cularly in tlhe Monymusk and to a lesser extent the Bernard Lodge areas, has
declined significantly since those cooperatives were formed.
3.14      The 23 cane-growing cooperatives are the basic units.  Called primary
cooperatives, they operate farms averaging about 2,000 acres which correspond
to the old sections of the former estates. Estate cooperatives at each of the
three areas provide administrative and technical services, including transport
(para 2.38) to the primary coops. While each estate coop is supposed to coor-
dinate the work of the primary coops within its area, the primary coops' exer-
cise of their autonomy often thwarts coordination efforts. All coops are
represented by USWCC in negotiations with Government and its agencies.
3.15      The primary cooperatives lease their lands directly or indirectly
from FMLC under a 49-year renewable lease with the obligation to continue
sugarcane cultivation according to sound cultivation principles and to main-
tain the existing blocking system, unless FMLC gives permission to do other-
wise. The annual rental, which includes all buildings and permanent struc-
tures, averages about J$26/acre (enough to enable FMLC or its successor to
service the indebtedness incurred for acquisition of the land).
3.16      Problems.  The principal problems of the coops are too many members
per cooperative, poor morale, inadequate management and inadequate financing.
Depending on the extent of these problems existing at each of the primary
coops, the results - declining cane production and financial difficulties -
range from moderately serious to acute.
3.17      When the estates were originally bought they were overmanned, partly
because the previous owners could not afford to pay the severance pay to which
workers were entitled if they lost their jobs and partly because of strong
union pressures. When the estates were cooperativized, each farm section
became a cooperative and the workers that had worked on that unit became
members of the cooperative. Hence the cooperatives inherited an acute over-
manning situation, there being too many people relative to the output of a
cooperative if union wage rates were to be maintained. The problem is
serious, as a 1976 study by SIRI shows. The study, prepared under the assump-
tion of no change in cultivation or harvesting practices or standards for each
of the then 20 primary coops, showed excess employment of about 25%, as
summarized below (at each estate results among the primary coops vary signi-
ficantly):

3.18     lWhile the Frome coops have the worst overpopulation problem, it
is generally acknowledged that management and worker attitudes there are
satisfactory and that the coops have a reasonably good chance of financial
viability, particularly once transport problems are resolved and increased
factory efficiency results in higher payments for cane. The situation of the
Monymusk coops is completely different, as the following observations indicate
(some of these observations also apply to the Bernard Lodge coops):
(a) personnel of the estate cooperative are considered to be
advisers to the agricultural management of the primary
cooperatives, without real authority to establish or direct
agricultural policy;
(b) the chairmen of the primary cooperatives play an operationally
active role in the affairs of their cooperatives, often not
working through or with the knowledge of their appointed managers,
but communicating directly with the members;
(c) agricultural staff meetings are not held routinely, adequate
operating plans or budgets are not prepared, and routine inspections
or reports are not submitted;
(d) normal production statistics are not being collated, cane
quality tests from individual fields are not being regis-
tered, water quality is not being logged, soil salinity
is not being monitored;
(e) great difficulty has been experienced in ensuring that fields
are surveyed for smut disease, and that rogueing is carried
out;
(f) the chief executive of the estate coop has no authority over the
tractor and transport cooperatives;
(g) the primary cooperatives have been loath to replant fields
and this year (to the end of May) only 1,000 acres out of a
program of 3,000 have been replanted, partially as a result
of drought conditions.



- 42 -
While estate-level management is aware of some or all of these problems and is
capable of taking appropriate action, it is unable to do so because of antago-
nism of many worker/members and because of a lack of Government support.
Most of the management staff are not coop members but former supervisors or
managers from the previous estate administrations, which may serve to accen-
tuate tlhe antagonism.
3.19      While the effects of bad morale and ineffective management are diffi-
cult to quantify, a comparison of cane production at the Monymusk coops with
othier farms in the southern plains (where severe drought conditions in 1977
have reduced all cane production) is illustrative: cane production at the
Monymusk coops decreased by 44% in 1977, as compared with decreases ranging
from 11 to 36% for large private estates.
3.20      Accounting and Finance.  Adequate budget and accounting systems
exist, but implementation ranges from adequate to nonexistent. Budgets are
supposed to be prepared by primary coops with the assistance of USWCC (which
acts as fiscal agent for the coops); the central coop then is supposed to
pay out funds on the basis of approved budgets. In practice, the coops of
one estate have prepared no budgets, but USWCC has had little choice but to
pay out the cash so that the coop members can meet their obligations.
Accounting reports are prepared late, if at all; audit arrangements exist,
provided there are financial statements to audit.
3.21      When they were formed, the cooperatives were financed principally
by members' deposits, which represented 50% of their severance pay from
FMLC and are repayable in two years. However, operating losses at most of
the cooperatives will have absorbed the deposits when they come due in
January 1978. Other loans - from SIA's several loan schemes and a J$10 mil-
lion crop-lien loan made by a commercial bank and guaranteed by Government -
have been required to finance the coops' losses, but the coops' ability to
repay those loans must be classified as doubtful.
3.22      A principal anomaly of the coops is that their members continue to
retain membership in one of tile two unions and to draw union-scale wages,
with consequently serious effects on the coops' financial situation. For
example, cane cutters tend to cut much more cane on Sundays at J$4/ton than
on weekdays at half that rate; withi receipts of J$18/ton, the coops cannot
show profits after excessive expenses of this nature.
3.23      Based on the most recent estimates of costs and cane production,
but assuming continuation of existing management, transport and cultivation
practices, the financial results of the cooperatives are estimated below
(as in the case of employment, conditions of each primary coop within each
estate vary significantly):

3.24      What the above data indicate is that the primary coops at Frome and
Bernard Lodge generally have a chance of achieving financial viability, but
those at Monymusk do not.  For example, if net cane revenue were increased by
J$2/ton by 1981 from more efficient transport, the approximate annual benefits
and resultant average net revenues 1981 would be as follows (in J$ millions):
Increase                Approx.

Bernard Lodge               0.5                    0.0
The above results could be improved further by better cultivation and manage-
ment, by streamlining personnel requirements and particularly at Monymusk by
more efficient utilization of irrigation water.
3.25      Government has begun to become aware of the cooperatives' problems
and to take action to improve them. It has:



- 44 -
a.   held exploratory conversations with outside experts
concerning possible technical assistance;
b.   published in mid-1977 a policy that no new canefield
coops would be created until the viability of existing
ones had been established; and
c.   established in the Ministry of Agriculture a Cooperative
Development Center, which is studying the organization,
management, manning, wage structure and training needs
cf the cooperatives.
3.26      Besides the already-recommended cane harvest and loading improve-
ments, the transport and water-utilization studies and the factory rehabili-
tation program itself, there are a number of measures available to Government
to improve the coops' performance, which the Cooperative Development Center
studies would presumably examine:
(a) provision of active support to coop management to provide
sufficient incentive for them to correct the deficiencies
listed in para 3.18, including the discharge of unproductive
worker-members;
(b) in cases where management is not capable, engagement of
outside assistance to manage the farms and train Jamaicans
to assume management duties;
(c) revision of remuneration procedures to do away with union-
scale payment to worker/members and substitution of a
"member surplus" concept, under which coop members would
divide among themselves the net revenues after payments
to outside parties; and
(d) improvements in coop members' roles and definition of
responsibilities.
In its Plan of Action, Government would confirm that it would consult with
the Bank on the results of the studies performed by the Cooperative Develop-
ment Center.
3.27      Until substantial improvements in the cooperatives' operation are
achieved, outside financial support will be necessary to keep them alive.
Government began such support in 1977 by guaranteeing a commercial bank
loan to the coops. While it may be socially or politically desirable to
continue to provide financial support for the coops - particularly when
alternative employment opportunities are not abundant - the sugar industry
cannot and should not bear the cost of subsidizing the cooperatives, much of
whose inefficiency has been allowed to continue because of Government policy.
Consequently, during negotiations assurances were obtained from SIA that



- 45 -
it would not make or guarantee loans to any cane farmers on terms and condi-
tions unavailable to other cane farmers whose operations are of a similar
size. Since each primary cooperative is considered by the law as a cane
farmer, such assurances would prevent special treatment for the coops.
3.28      Over the longer term, it is possible that Government may direct an
alternative form of organization for cooperatives that remain unviable. The
most likely possibilities are: dividing the primary coops into smaller
farm plots manageable by single families, which was the previous government's
intention; or having a government agency take over management. The latter
alternative seems the more likely under the present government.

IV. THE PROJECT
Origin of the Project
4.01      The project was first conceived in mid-1972 when Government requested
assistance in the preparation of a general strategy for agricultural develop-
ment in Jamaica and specific proposals for assistance to the sugar industry.
The Bank suggested that, insofar as the sugar industry was concerned, that a
comprehensive development plan should be drawn up. Such a plan, it felt,
should include factory rationalization and rehabilitation, research and exten-
sion needs, farmer credit requirements, improvements to sugar shipping termi-
nals, improved transportation arrangements and a number of other issues. It
recommended that such a plan should be drawn up by SIA, on behalf of the
various interests involved in the sugar industry, assisted by the judicious
use of outside consultants where necessary. However, despite several attempts,
it became apparent that under prevailing political, social and economic cir-
cimstances it was impossible to attempt to deal with all the problems of the
sugar industry simultaneously. The Bank came to the conclusion that, as
desirable as a comprehensive solution to the problems of the industry might
be, the only practical approach was a policy that tried to resolve one issue
at a time. It further concluded that a logical place to start was a program
that would rehabilitate the largest and most important of the island's sugar
factories, which by then were owned by National Sugar. SIA, which had already
concluded (with the aid of consultants) a detailed technical study of the
industry's rehabilitation needs, was in general agreement with this approach.
The study then became the basis for appraisal of the proposed project.
Project Oblectives and Purpose
4.02      Over the long run, it is hoped to increase sugar production to over
380,000 tons p.a. (the firm market under the new International Sugar Agreement
- see para 6.02) as a means of providing employment and foreign exchange.
In view of the acute financial and social problems facing the country, there
is no practical alternative to this strategy. However, Government and industry
officials have acknowledged the industry's need for improving productivity and
efficiency now if output is to be increased in the future.
4.03      The objective of the proposed project is not to maximize production
but to concentrate on increasing the industry's efficiency from currently un-
satisfactory levels.  This would be accomplished by:  re-equipping the three
key factories so that the deterioration in operating conditions, efficiency
and sugar output which has taken place over the past decade may be reversed;
and providing technical assistance to help the industry improve the efficiency
of its cultivation, harvesting and factory operations.
4.04      The three factories have been selected as the key to the sugar
industry's future because: comprising over 60% of the island's sugar-
producing capacity, they must remain in operation under any circumstances;
concentration on these factories is within the present capability of National



- 47 -
Sugar management; and experience gained in rehabilitation and operation of
these three factories may be used in the future for other factories in the
public sector, assuming that it is then economic to keep such other factories
in operation.
Project Description
4.05      The project consists of physical works to rehabilitate Jamaica's
only sugar refinery and three largest raw-sugar factories--Frome, Monymusk
and Bernard Lodge--and a technical assistance program to improve the effi-
ciency of cane and sugar production. As detailed in Annex 1, the physical
works consist of a large number of individual jobs to replace and/or renovate
worn-out or outmoded facilities, extend capacity and, where needed, improve
efficiency in all phases of sugar production--from cane-receiving facilities
to raw-sugar bagging--at the three factories and Monymusk refinery. Among the
more important jobs to be undertaken are:
a.   re-arrangement of cane-reception facilities at Bernard Lodge
and concreting of cane yards at all three factories;
b.   modification of cane carriers at Frome and Monymusk;
c.   installation of improved cane-preparation shredders
("Unigrators") at all factories and renovation of the
Frome milling train;
d.   urgently-needed rehabilitation of the boilers (see para
4.11) and installation of air pre-heaters at all three
factories;
e.   new turbo-alternators at Frome for in-crop electricity
generation and diesel sets at Frome and Monymusk for out-
of-crop standby capacity;
f.   installation of vacuum-pan boiling aids at Frome and Monymusk
and renovation of centrifugal stations at Monymusk and Bernard
Lodge;
g.   renovation of the cooling tower at Frome and doubling of the
spray-pond capacities of the other two factories;
h.   various replacements of outmoded refinery equipment and
installation of equipment to increase capacity from 10 to
15 tons/hour of refined sugar output.
The work would be carried out during the out-of-crop seasons (roughly from
July through November) from 1977 through 1982. The extended project-execution
period is necessary because of limits on how much rehabilitation work can be
carried out in the relatively compact space of each factory at the same rela-
tively short period of time that normal out-of-crop maintenance is being under-
taken.



- 48 -
4.06      The technical assistance consists of the following:
a.   design and engineering of certain factory components
(see para 5.02);
b.   studies of cane harvesting, loading and quality assessment
throughout the island (para 2.37);
c.   for milling operations at the three factories:  definition
of standards, improvement of communications, on-the-job
training of operators (para 2.51); and
d1.   a training program for factory personnel (para 2.50).
4.07      Because National Sugar's proposed training program would not be
presented to the Bank until the end of 1978, the Bank would not disburse from
the loan account for training-program expenditures until it has approved the
training program.
Project Costs and Financing
4.08      The project's estimated cost totals US$33.8 million with a US$18.9
million foreign component as summarized below and detailed in Annex 1. In
the cost estimate, consultants' services for technical assistance have been
designated as foreign costs, since it is expected that most, if not all,
consultants would be non-Jamaican. While Jamaican manufacturers may win some
bids (see para 4.15), the estimated cost of all material and equipment to be
procured under international competitive bidding is shown as foreign. No
local cost component for the training program is included because such costs
are part of the ongoing expenses of SIRI and National Sugar.

4.09      Foreign-cost estimates are based on recent actual quotations obtained
by National Sugar or its technical adviser, Tate & Lyle Technical Services
(TLTS) for the equipment to be acquired together with allowances for price
increases up to December 1977. To these have been added allowances for engi-
neering, insurance and shipping to arrive at the base-cost estimate. Local
cost estimates are based on prices of local materials and labor rates, also
updated to December 1977, plus local transportation of imported goods and
customs duties estimated at current rates, which average about 7.5% of the cif
value of most imported goods. Technical assistance (totalling 134 man-months)
costs are calculated on the basis of US$5,800/ month plus travel expenses for
consultancy assignments and US$5,000/month for on-site management assistance
and training, as detailed in Annex 1. Physical contingency allowances of
about 10% of the base cost have been included to allow for minor modifications
in project design. Price contingency allowances of 7% p.a. for the foreign
component, reflecting recent trends in prices of similar equipment, and 10%
p.a. for local costs, reflecting expected local inflation rates, were included.
4.10      The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign-exchange component
including fees paid to local consultants (para 4.08), except for US$0.9 million
of refinery equipment not obtained under the Bank's guidelines for procurement
and ordered prior to appraisal. As detailed in paragraph 7.05, net internal
cash generation of the National Sugar subsidiaries plus loans from SIA totalling



- 50 -
J$10 million would cover the local-cost financing requirements. As shown in
paragraph 7.10, SIA would be capable of providing this amount of financing
without Government support unless world sugar prices remained at the extremely
low levels prevailing during much of 1977, in which case Government would make
such funds available (see para 7.11). The proposed Bank loan would be made to
SIA, with Jamaica as guarantor, at the current Bank interest rate and a
17-year term, including 4 years of grace. SIA, which would bear the foreign-
exchange risk, would relend the portion of the loan (about US$17.6 million
equivalent--the remaining US$0.4 million equivalent would be for studies under
SIA's responsibility as discussed in para 5.01), pertaining to physical works
and factory technical assistance to National Sugar. The subloan would be
denominated in Jamaican dollars at an interest rate sufficiently high to
exceed expected future price inflation in Jamaica and for the same term and
grace period as the Bank loan. Based on currently available information,
indications are that 12% would be a sufficient relending rate to satisfy the
above condition, and Jamaican authorities have indicated acceptance of
that rate. A condition of loan effectiveness would be that SIA and National
Sugar had executed a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank.
Retroactive Financing
4.11      Most boilers at Frome have deteriorated to such a degree (mostly
from corrosion of tubes and drums) that the factory's operation would be
extremely unreliable for the 1978 crop (beginning December 1977) unless cor-
rective action is taken immediately. The least-cost solution is to rehabili-
tate two of Frome's boilers and to move a boiler now at Bernard Lodge (boiler
No. 6) to Frome, replacing certain of its parts.  At Monymusk, the drums of
one boiler are in need of immediate replacement if that factory's reliability
is to be maintained. Bernard Lodge boilers lack automatic controls and alarms.
Such a situation is unsatisfactory in any event but is untenable now that the
factory's extra boiler is to be removed to Frome. In addition, boiler No. 5
at Bernard Lodge is in need of rehabilitation for the next crop.
4.12      To correct these deficiencies in time for the 1978 harvest season,
National Sugar (with Bank concurrence) has placed orders for the following
items of equipment with the manufacturer of the original equipment, except for
the controls and alarms at Bernard Lodge, which have been purchased from the
manufacturer who provided best time and delivery quotations.

4.13      Because of the urgency of carrying out this rehabilitation in time
for the 1978 crop, it is recommended that the Bank include retroactive finan-
cing for the foreign cost (US$1.2 million) of these emergency needs, orders
for which were placed after June 30, 1977, in the proposed loan. The parts to
be obtained do not lend themselves to supplier financing because they consist
of a large number of small procurements (the largest being about US$350,000).
Assuming loan signing by early 1978, no additional retroactive financing
would be required.
Procurement
4.14      In addition to the equipment itemized in paragraph 4.12, National
Sugar would obtain the following equipment directly from manufacturers:
"Unigrator" cane-preparation knives for all three factories from Unice Niachine
Co. of the US for about US$450,000; and automated vacuum-pan boiling aids for
Frome and Mlonymusk from De Danske Sukkerfabrikker (DDS) of Denmark for about
US$200,000. These are relatively new devices made only by the respective
manufacturers.
4.15      All other contracts for Bank-financed plant and equipment (including
initial spare parts) would be awarded following international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement. Jamaican
manufacturers of equipment and material would be entitled to preferences
of 15% or the applicable tariff, whichever is lower, in bid evaluation.
Local manufacturers may be in a position to win contracts for air heaters,
de-aerators and various boiler parts and accessories with a total estimated
cost of about US$3 million. Because of Jamaica's shortage of foreign exchange
and import-control policies, all imports must be licensed. Assurances were
secured at negotiations from Government that import licenses for all plant and
equipment to be financed by the proposed loan would be granted promptly.



- 52 -
Disbursement
4.16      Disbursements from the Loan Account will finance:  100% of foreign
expenditures or 90% of total expenditures for consultant services (the latter
percentage to be applied to Jamaican consultants); 100% of the ex-factory
costs of equipment and materials in cases where Jamaican manufacturers win
contracts; and 100% of foreign expenditures for equipment, materials, super-
vision, erection, installation and the administrative fees of National Sugar's
Technical adviser, TLTS. Under existing arrangements, National Sugar and its
subsidiaries pay for such administrative fees (which are for liaison with
equipmernt manufacturers, expediting delivery and arranging for shipping) by
means of an add-on, rather than by specific contract. These arrangements,
which originated when WISCO was not under Jamaican control (para 3.08), are
still desirable because TLTS is in a better position to perform such services
than the company. Estimated loan disbursements are as follows, assuming loan
presentation in January 1978 and effectiveness in March 1978:

The closing date would be June 30, 1983, giving National Sugar seven months
after the 1982 out-of-crop season to finalize acceptance of and payment for
equipment installed during that season. Any undisbursed funds upon comple-
ting the project could be applied to acquisition of similar goods needed for
further improvements at the three factories and refinery after demonstration
of the technical and economic justification of such improvements by National
Sugar and their approval by the Bank.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Organization and Management
5.01      SIA would be responsible for overall project coordination and
for carrying out the portion of the project relating to canefield technical
assistance (item b of para 4.06). National Sugar would be responsible for the
execution of all physical works (para 4.05) and the factory-related technical
assistance (items a, c and d of para 4.06). The two entities maintain a close
working relationship--both through representation on each other's boards and
through frequent contacts of management and staff--so that no coordination
difficulties are expected.
5.02      National Sugar would assign to TLTS responsibility for design,
engineering, preparation of specifications and tender documents, and bid
evaluation of certain major items, e.g. installation of new types of cane-
preparation knives, where the company's engineering staff was not sufficiently
experienced to perform the tasks capably. Installation of equipment would
generally be done by local contractors, who are experienced in sugar factory
work, or by National Sugar's own factory staff, using techinical assistance
from equipment manufacturers' representatives as necessary for installaiton
supervision.  Studies and training would be carried out by consultants accept-
able to the Bank under acceptable terms of reference, drafts of which are
included in the staff working papers.
Plan of Action
5.03      Under the proposed Plan of Action, Government, SIA and National
Sugar would confirm that:
a.   steps would be taken to improve irrigation efficiency in
the Mlonymusk and Bernard Lodge cane-growing areas
(para 2.22);
b.   measurements of soil and groundwater salinity in the
Monymusk and Bernard Lodge areas would be carried out
(para 2.23);
c.   proper maintenance of the drainage system in the Frome
cane-growing areas would be carried out (para 2.24);
d.   arrangements for the retention of consultants to perform
the cane harvesting/loading/quality assessment study
would be defined, and incentives for green and non-push-
piled cane initiated for the 1978 crop would be continued
until implementation of new incentives after consultation
with the Bank (para 2.37);



- 54 -
e.   studies of cane transportation and handling similar to
those underway for Frome would be undertaken for Monymusk
and Bernard Lodge (para 2.38);
f.   future surveys of cane cultivation costs would attempt to
determine standard costs, and measures to improve cane
farmer compliance with the surveys would be put into
effect (para 2.41);
g.   inspection and planned maintenance procedures for the
three project factories would be put into effect
(para 2.47);
h.   acceptable consultants would be retained to improve milling
performance and provide in-factory training at the three
factories (para 2.51);
i.   studies pertaining to the problems of the cane-growing
cooperatives would be discussed with the Bank (para 3.26);
j.   the implementation schedule for actions to be taken under
the project shown in Annex 2 would be followed; and
k.   the indicators of factory performance and personnel levels
shown in Annex 2 would be used to monitor project execution.
The proposed loan would not be declared effective until the Bank had received
a satisfactory Plan of Action.
Accounts and Audit
5.04      Instead of preparing an integrated set of books, SIA accounts
for all its operations through a number of different funds, crop accounts
and other accounts, transferring excess cash from one fund when necessary to
cover deficits in another. Besides the confusion resulting from the lack
of consolidated accounts, other problems in its accounting and audit arrange-
ments exist: no provision for doubtful accounts has been made in any of the
funds set up to make loans to cane farmers and sugar factories; and the crop
accounts through 1976 were not subject to audit by its external auditors
(Coopers and Lybrand). To correct these deficiencies, assurances were obtained
from SIA at negotiations that beginning with fiscal year 1977:
a.   all its funds, crop accounts and other accounts would be made
available for audit to its external auditors;
b.   adequate provisions for doubtful accounts would be established;
c.   consolidated balance sheets, income statements and statements
of sources and applications of funds would be prepared and
made available for audit; and



- 55 -
d.   a complete set of financial statements audited by an inde-
pendent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and the audit report
prepared by that firm, would be made available to the Bank
within six months of the close of SIA's fiscal year.
5.05      Unlike those of SIA, the accounting systems of National Sugar and
its subsidiaries are adequate to provide suitable and timely information to
management. Each operating entity prepares a budget with the assistance of
the Kingston staff, and expenses are controlled against the budget. The
system is computerized, and internal reports are prepared promptly. The
accounts are audited by local branches or affiliates of international auditing
firms, as follows:
National Sugar               Price Waterhouse & Co.
WISCO                        Price Waterhouse & Co.
Monymusk company             Touche, Ross, Thorburn & Co.
Bernard Lodge company        Price Waterhouse & Co.
Gray's Inn company           Peat, lMarwick Mitchell & Co.
Assurances were obtained from National Sugar during negotiations that its
financial statements and those of its subsidiaries would be audited by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that such statements, along with
the auditors' reports, would be sent to the Bank within six months of the end
of each company's fiscal year.
5.06      Despite high rates of price inflation (above 20% p.a.) in recent
years, assets of National Sugar's operating subsidiaries have not been revalued
recently (or in the case of WISCO, ever). Consequently, the value of the
assets and the charges against income for depreciation may have been con-
siderably understated and as a result, reported profits, overstated. To
measure the companies' profitability more correctly, assurances were obtained
from National Sugar at negotiations that it would revalue its assets on the
basis of engineering studies or other methods acceptable to the Bank:
a.   as of the end of the 1978 fiscal year; and
b.   as of the end of any future fiscal year during which general
price levels as measured by a generally acceptable indicator
satisfactory to the Bank had increased 25% or miore from levels
existing at the most recent previous revaluation date.

VI. PRODUCTION AND MARKETING
A.   Production and Sales
6.01      There are three principal markets for Jamaican sugar:  local (which
includes relatively minor sales to other Caribbean countries); quota to the
European Economic Community (EEC); and other export sales. Based on expected
sugar production (net of conversion losses) of the three key factories and
on continued stabilized production of 140,000 tons/year from the other
factories in Jamaica, the total national production and sales are estimated as
below (in thousands of tons):

6.02      Jamaica's quota under the new International Sugar Agreement (see
para 6.07) is 130,000 tons p.a. Together with the 125,000-ton EEC quota
and internal needs of 115-120,000 tons, its total annual requirements are
in the 377-383,000 ton range. The above production estimates assume no
improvements in factory productivity resulting from recommended improvements
in harvesting and loading (para 2.34) or from reductions in factory stoppages,
principally because of the difficulty in forecasting the speed with which
such improvements will occur; those estimates show that production will be
20-25,000 tons p.a. under demand. To the extent factory improvements do
occur, the deficit will be alleviated, but further field improvements and/or
rehabilitation of other factories may be necessary to enable Jamaica to meet
internal quotas and export requirements.
B.   Local Market
6.03      As is the prevailing practice in many Caribbean countries, wholesale
and retail prices of certain grades of sugar are kept artificially low by
Government. Currently the wholesale price of brown sugar of J$167/ton is only
slightly over half the cost of production and the same is true of refined
sugar sold to the Government-owned condensary at J$203/ton. Until 1975 the
losses involved were carried by the sugar industry. Government has decided to
maintain its policy for certain grades of sugar on the grounds that brown
sugar and condensed milk are diet staples, particularly of the low-income
segment of the population. Beginning in 1976, Government has, however,
reimbursed SIA for its losses from sales of local sugar under informal arrange-
ments. Assurances have been secured from Government at negotiations that it
would continue to reimburse SIA for the losses it incurs from the sales of
sugar within the country (including as costs of sugar all guaranteed-price,
supplemental and other payments made to cane farmers and sugar factories, and
a pro-rata share of SIA/SIRI operating costs), such reimbursement taking place
during the year following that in which the loss occurs.
6.04      Physical distribution of sugar for the local market is carried out
by SMCJ, acting as SIA's agent, with reasonable effectiveness. However, a
further element of underpricing may inhibit the availability of brown sugar
at retail outlets. The controlled retail price for brown sugar of J$.08/lb
gives the merchant only a penny margin to cover the costs of repacking sugar
(which is received in 112-lb bags) into two-pound bags for retail sale. Since
the merchant's costs of repacking are more than double the allowable margin,
his incentive to have the product available is weak. Thus the very product
whose use Government is trying to encourage through underpricing is often
unavailable. To remedy this inconsistency, SIA has undertaken a study of
measures needed to improve the retail distribution of brown sugar.
C.   Export Sales
6.05      Under the Lome convention, EEC has undertaken to purchase about 1.3
million tons of raw sugar p.a. from Asian, Caribbean and Pacific producers at
prices geared to beet-sugar production in EEC member nations, notwithstanding
the fact that EEC is now self-sufficient (about 10 million tons p.a.) and,



- 58 -
because of its production-subsidy policies, is expected to have as much as
3 million tons available for export by the early 1980s. The convention's
earliest terminal date is March 1, 1980, but it would continue in effect until
two years' advance notice of termination is given. There is at present no
indication that such notice will be given. The raw-sugar price is generally
reviewed annually; the most recent price of 272.5 units of account (J$440) per
ton fob was agreed in May 1977 for deliveries through June 1978.
6.06      In practice, refiners in Great Britain, being accustomed to pro-
cessing Jamaican sugar, have generally bought the entire Jamaican quota and
have in recent years paid as much as 9.5 units of account (J$15)/ton over the
stipulated price. In recent years Jamaica has also delivered additional
quantities of sugar at quota prices to make up other producers' deficiencies,
but there is no certainty that it will receive such beneficial fortune in the
future.
6.07      The new International Sugar Agreement (ISA), which was negotiated
in October 1977, will go into effect for the five-year period 1978-82 if
60% of the about 70 negotiating countries ratify it by December 31, 1977.
The new ISA attempts to provide stability to what has been a chaotic export
market since expiration of the previous agreement in 1973 by the following
means:
(a) establishment of a target price range of US$.11-,21/lb
sugar;
(b) assignment of quotas - called Basic Export Tonnages -
to all sugar-exporting signatories;
(c) accumulation of stocks of up to 2.5 million tons sugar
by sugar exporters;
(d) stabilization of prices in the lower price range (up to
US$.15/lb) by manipulation of quotas and at upper price
levels (US$.19-.21/lb) by release of stocks.
The principal differences between the new ISA and previous versions are the
braoder price range and larger stock accumulation for which the new agreement
provides and the more comprehensive participation of sugar-importing countries
in the agreement. While the EEC nations did not join the agreement, EEC has
declared its willingness to limit its exports to the same extent as ISA
participants.
6.08      World sugar prices, particularly since expiration of the previous
ISA, have been notoriously volatile. After going as high as US$.65/lb in
November 1974, free-market prices have fallen to as low as 7 cents, prin-
cipally because of oversupply. It is expected that the current oversupply
will be corrected by 1980 and that sugar prices will approach the long-run
marginal production cost of about US$.14/lb. Because of increasing competition
from lower-cost substitutes, most notably liquid sweetners derived from corn



- 59 -
(see below), it is possible that sugar price increases will be limited, and
a price of US$.13/lb has been used in financial projections for SIA beginning
in 1980 (see Chapter 7). However, there is some question as to how quickly
the ISA minimum target price can be reached. Particularly in 1978, exporting
countries may, even with maximum quota reductions, produce as much as
2.5 million tons over import requirements, so that this report's projections
do not assume attainment of the minimum price until 1979. The principal
expected effect of the ISA on prices, then, is in reducing short-term price
instability, not in countering more basic supply-demand factors.
6.09      The rapid introduction of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) into the
US market, however, introduces an element of uncertainty into the world market
situation. At present corn prices in the US, HFCS is cheaper to produce than
traditional sugar: recently HFCS sales have taken place at prices over 20%
lower than equivalent refined-sugar prices (about US$.157/lb, Chicago market).
Installed capacity is currently about 1 million tons and is expected to reach
2 million tons/year in the US by the early 1980s, and the product is expected
to have captured 20 to 25% of the US sweetener market by then. Technical
innovation is rapid: a second generation (55% fructose) HFCS with sweetening
power equivalent to that of sugar is now being marketed and is expected to be
accepted by users who could not use the first generation (42% fructose) syrup.
One company has begun producing a 90% syrup, half again as sweet as sugar.
While HFCS cannot yet be produced economically in crystalline form, about 30%
of the US market does not require crystalline sugar and the bulk of that 30%
therefore represents market potential for HFCS. The situation would, however,
change if crystalline forms of HFCS, currently being produced in small quanti-
ties in laboratory trials, could be produced commercially. The liquid form
may also make inroads into the Japanese markets but is not expected to replace
sugar to any significant extent in countries already producing sugar from cane
or beets. At the very least, however, potential competition from HFCS is
expected to limit the upward movement of sugar prices, since the US market is
a major influence in setting world free sugar prices. The implications for
Jamaica are that it cannot rely in the foreseeable future on buoyant prices
for any sugar it has to sell on world markets.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   National Sugar Company
7.01      Projected Income.  As shown in the combined three-factory projected
income statements (Table 7.1, on page 61), the 1977 financial results are
expected to be extremely unfavorable: net losses exceeding J$8 million on
gross revenues of J$22.5 million. The principal causes for this poor perfor-
mance are:
a.   excessive factory breakdowns, which result in excessive fuel
and other operating costs and lengthening of the harvest
season into the rainy months, thereby reducing sugar extrac-
tion from lower quality cane;
b.   excessive costs due to redundant manpower;
c.   an insufficient price for sugar (one third of the J$270/ton
guaranteed price);
d.   abnormally low cane availability for Monymusk and, to a
lesser extent, Bernard Lodge, because of drought conditions
in the southern plains and production difficulties of the
cooperatives.
It should be noted that the financial projections do not include operations of
the Gray's Inn company, for which financial projections were not available at
the time of field appraisal due to its recent acquisition by National Sugar.
The effect of combining projections for Gray's Inn with those of the three
key factories would be to reduce National Sugar's consolidated operating and
net income slightly, since Gray's Inn, while much smaller than the other three
factories, has not operated profitably in recent years.
7.02      As summarized below, significant improvements in the three-factory
results are expected in 1978, and further improvements by the end of the
project-execution period:

Significant improvements in National Sugar's revenues and operating income
are expected in 1978 principally as a result of increased cane availability
due to improved rainfall patterns which have taken place in the 1977 out-of-
crop season. Further increases in cane availability are foreseen throughout
the project-execution period. In addition, the project would result in
improvements of the three factories' operating results by:
(a) more efficient factory operations attributable to the
rehabilitation program; and
(b) rationalization of manpower requirements.
7.03      Under normal circumstances, it would be expected that commercial
enterprises such as sugar factories should show operating profits. In Jamaica,
however, extremely strong trade-union pressure would in all probability erode
any profits which a public-sector sugar enterprise earned, so that provision
of additional cash to the sugar factories by means of revenue increases is
inadvisable. Instead, assurances have been provided that SIA will, beginning
in 1978, provide sugar factories with capital rehabilitation loans of J$2 per
ton cane milled provided that the factories invest such loans in equipment
designed to increase efficiency and productivity. The capital rehabilitation
loans will have a grace period of at least five years for principal and
interest, and SIA has indicated its intention to convert them to equity. Under
the prevailing circumstances, such loans are the best available surrogate for
direct revenue increases; amounting to J$4.3-4.5 million p.a., they would
enable the three factories to show operating profits beginning in 1978 if
they were considered as revenues.
7.04      Projected Cash Flows.  Because of their substandard financial
results for several years, particularly 1977, the Monymusk and Bernard Lodge
companies have been unable to meet the debt service on loans owed to SIA and
will require additional financing from SIA to cover their 1977 cash shortfalls,
with the result that their accumulated indebtedness to SIA and commercial banks
at the end of their fiscal 1977 years is expected to be (in millions of J$):

Assurances have been received from Government that it would:  by
April 30, 1978 submit to the Bank proposals for consolidation, assumption or
other restructuring of the indebtedness of National Sugar and all its sub-
sidiaries to SIA and commercial banks; and carry out or cause to be carried
out such of its proposals as it and the Bank agree. For purposes of financial
projections, it has been assumed that each subsidiary's indebtedness will be
consolidated into a single consolidation loan. Based on present practice, it
is expected that such consolidation loans would be made at 10% p.a. interest.
Based on current financial projections (detailed in the staff working papers),
neither company could repay its consolidation loan during the project
implementation period. The principal possibility available to the Jamaicans
to meet this problem is extension of the repayment terms until the companies
are able to meet their obligations.

The financing plan, under which net internal cash generation would provide 28
and 26% respectively of the three companies' construction programs and total
cash requirements for the period, would be satisfactory if prices and labor
costs in Jamaica were to stabilize at 1977 levels. However, inflationary
forces and labor demands in particular may result in increased factory
operating costs, the timing and extent of wlhich are difficult to predict.

Consequently, assurances have been obtained from SIA and Government at
negotiations that action would be taken so that the three key factories would
be able to finance 30% of their annual construction programs from net internal
cash generation (defined as total revenues plus capital rehabilitation loans
less: expenses other than non-cash expenses; interest and commissions on all
debt; and amortization of long-term debt). Based on current estimates,
further revenue adjustments would be necessary in 1982 for the companies to
comply with this undertaking. Prices set in this manner would provide manage-
ment of National Sugar and other sugar factories sufficient financial
independence to carry out their operating responsibilities without undue
interference from Government and to finance necessary factory rehabilitation
without undue reliance on outside borrowing.
7.06      To complete the financing plan, loans of J$10 million (in 1977
terms) from SIA's Development Fund would be required for part of the local-
cost component of the rehabilitation project. The loans would be required
by each of the three companies as follows:
a.   for the Frome company, J$2.2 million;
b.   for the Monymusk company, J$3.5 million;
c.   for the Bernard Lodge company, J$4.3 million.
It is expected that the Frome and Monymusk companies would be able to repay
each year's equipment loan by equal installments over the following five
years (which are the standard SIA terms for such loans), 'but that the Bernard
Lodge company would be unable to begin repayments during the project implemen-
tation period. The alternatives to this extended-repayment problem already
outlined in paragraph 7.04 are available for this situation. Assurances
were obtained from SIA at negotiations that such amounts as necessary to
complete the project's financing plan (currently estimated to be J$10 million)
would be provided to National Sugar or its subsidiaries.
B.   Sugar Industry Authority
7.07      The SIA accounts provide the key to the industry's financial
viability. The crop accounts are equivalent to industry income statements
from a national viewpoint, and the various loan funds provide the financing
required for industry modernization. SIA crop accounts for 1976-82 and the
principal underlying assumptions are detailed in Tables 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 on
pages 66-68, and a consolidated forecast of cash flows into and out of SIA's
loan funds is shown as Table 7.6 on page 69, using most 'Likely world prices
for the forecast period.
7.08      Under the assumption of most likely prices, the projected crop
accounts (adjusted to reflect Government reimbursement of losses on local
sales--para 6.03) would show surpluses during each year of project implemen-
tation. Similarly, net cash inflows into the loan funds would increase each
year except 1982, which would enable SIA to expand its lending program.

7.09      As noted in paragraph 6.07, however, world sugar prices are
notoriously volatile. To test the industry's viability under less favorable
assumptions, alternative computations have been performed under two assump-
tions: approximate 1977 free-market price of US$.08/lb continuing through
1978 and ISA minimum price of US$.11/lb for 1979 and future years (referred to
as "ISA minimum price" in subsequent calculations); and the 1977 free-market
price continuing throughout the project execution period (referred to as
"free-market price" subsequently). The results of these computations are
summarized below (in 1977 J$ millions);

7.10      These summaries indicate that Jamaica's sugar industry will be
financially marginal if the ISA minimum price prevails during the project
implementation period; it will require additional financial support if lower
prices prevail, if possible future exchange-rate adjustments do not compensate
for excess Jamaican price inflation over worldwide inflation, or if sugar-
industry cost increases exceed general price inflation in Jamaica. To
guard against these possibilities, assurances have been obtained from Govern-
ment during negotiations that it would provide financing to complete the
project if SIA and National Sugar are unable to do so.

VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Sugar Factories
8.01      The primary benefit of the rehabilitation project is cane-milling
capability which could not otherwise be expected with adequate reliability;
without rehabilitation, the three factories would not be able to grind cane
expected to be available to them in the immediate and long-term future, as
summarized below (in thousands of tons of cane p.a.)
Frome     Monymusk      Bernard Lodge
Probable available 1982 crop       870          820             583
Long-term availability:
weighted average                896          800             556
Factory capability without
rehabilitation                  612          710            544
Milling capability attribu-
table to rehabilitation         284          90              12
Other direct benefits include:
a.   increase in sugar extraction directly attributable to
equipment included in the project (improved cane-preparation
equipment, boiling-pan aids and centrifugals);
b.   reductions in operating costs resulting from reducing or
eliminating excess stoppages; and
c.   improvements in sugar-extraction resulting from more
efficient factory operations (reducing stoppages and com-
pressing the campaign season).
8.02      In comparing the project's costs and benefits, sugar production
resulting from project-related reliable milling capacity was valued at the
difference between the marginal revenues received for the sugar and the
variable costs of producing it. Marginal sugar production would be sold
under the ISA price mechanism. Although it is generally expected that sugar
prices will rise above the ISA minimum price (see table 7.4 on page 67), two
price assumptions have been made to demonstrate the economic value of the
project even under the two more adverse price circumstances described in
para 7.09. Sugar factory costs are almost entirely fixed, so that variable
costs of sugar are those of cane cultivation and of handling the sugar from
factory to ship. Cultivation costs have been adjusted to remove 50% of the
labor component (representing otherwise unemployable labor). Costs were
calculated as follows (J$/ton).



- 72 -
Cane              Sugar
Cultivation costs              J$ 17.00
Less adjustment for 50%
of labor component               3.70
13.30            J$ 133.00
24.00
Factory-to-ship                                         157.00
The value of marginal sugar sold is therefore estimated at J$67/ton at a price
of US$.08/lb (J$224/ton) and J$151/ton at a price of US$.11/lb (J$308/ton).
These values were applied to the difference between the long-term probable
cane availability and the factory capability without rehabilitation to deter-
mine the most likely benefits, and to the difference between the worst-case
cane availability and factory capability without rehabilitation to determine
the worst-case benefits.
8.03      Project benefits related to sugar extraction improvement were valued
on the following bases:
a.   cane-preparation improvements would result in 0.7% better
extraction;
b.   centrifugal rehabilitation:  1.5% better extraction; and
c.   vacuum-pan boiling aids:  1% better extraction (as opposed to
observed improvements of 3% where such aids have been installed
at Monymusk).
Project benefits related to cost reductions were estimated on the iasis of
field observation and investigation of factory records.
8.04      Only the benefits which are directly and measurably attributable to
the project investment have been included. Consequently, no weight was given
to the better extraction rate resulting from improvements in factory operations
(item c of para 8.01) mainly becuase determining the speed and extent of such
improvements would be extremely judgmental. Similarly, no weight was given to
other project-related benefits, e.g. increased sugar extraction expected to be
produced by improved cane-harvesting and loading practices (para 2.35).
8.05      Only the investment costs have been included in the comparison.  Be-
cause almost all rehabilitation works represent replacement or renovation of
existing plant, no incremental operating or maintenance cost is foreseen.
(In fact, such costs would normally be expected to decrease).
8.06      Based on the above, the estimated rates of return for project in-
vestment in factory rehabilitation are as follows:

These data confirm field observations:  that Frome and Monymusk are more
severely in need of rehabilitation than Bernard Lodge; and that the results
of continued declines in cane production would be worse in the Monymusk and
Bernard Lodge areas than at Frome. An overall high rate of return for re-
habilitation projects in general is not surprising, since investment costs
are relatively low and incremental operating costs are negligible.
B.   Refinery
8.07      The benefits and costs of the proposed refinery renovation and expan-
sion have been estimated as follows:
a.   incremental refined sugar production at J$57.50/ton repre-
senting the difference between quotations for imports of
refined and exports of raw at the time of appraisal;
b.   incremental molasses production at J$37/ton, the current
price in Jamaica;
c.   sugar losses at the expected fob raw-sugar value less local
storage and shipping;
d.   incremental operating expenses based on field observation and
examination of refinery records.



- 74 -
Based on the above, the return on investment in refinery improvements is
estimated as follows:
at most likely costs                               47%
with 25% increase in investment costs              33
with 25% increase in operating costs               22
with 25% increase in all costs                      17
C.   Overall rate of return
8.09      The estimated return on project investment is summarized as follows:
ISA            Free-
minimum         Market
price           price
Most likely costs and cane production              51             26
Most likely costs, worst-case production           26             16
25% increase in all costs, most likely cane
production                                         34             16
25% increase in all costs, worst-case cane
production                                         16              9
The rate of return would be higher if:
a.   the ex'ected but difficult-to-measure increases in sugar extraction
resulting from overall improvements in factory efficiency were in-
cluded as benefits;
b.   benefits resulting from improved cane-harvesting and loading (higher
sugar extraction, lower cane-washing costs and less wear-and-tear on
machinery) were included;
c.   the foreign-currency value of incremental sugar production were
shadow-priced to reflect possible overvaluation of Jamaican
currency; and/or
d.   higher price assumptions were used.
8.10      Given the dimensions and layout of the existing installations, clear
alternatives to their rehabilitation needs often do not exist: obsolete equip-
ment usually requires replacement with equivalent capacity. Where alternatives
do exist, the recommended solution generally is on the basis of lower invest-
ment costs and no significant difference in operating or maintenance costs.
Therefore, the recommended project represents the least-cost solution to the
rehabilitation needs of the installations.



- 75 -
8.11      To provide a very rough comparison, the cost of new milling capacity
to provide 45,000 tons of raw sugar p.a. - the approximate capacity attribut-
able to the project - would be about US$45 million at current prices. The
estimated cost of the factory component of the recommended project is about
half the cost of new capacity.
D.   Benefits to the Economy
8.12      The approximately 45,000 tons of annual sugar production which the
project would help to maintain represent gross foreign exchange earnings of
about US$11.1 million p.a. at ISA minimum prices; as much as 75%
of this (about US$8.3 million p.a.) could be expected to be retained because
of the high labor content in cane and sugar production. There are no agri-
cultural substitutes to produce foreign-exchange earnings of this magnitude
in the short run, and substitution of other agricultural products to produce
equivalent foreign-exchange earnings and/or savings over the longer term
would require institutional improvements and innovations which would be
extremely difficult to achieve.
8.13      Of equal importance are the employment benefits which the sugar
industry provides. Using the current national average yields of 27 tons of
cane/acre and TC/TS of 10, the 45,000 tons of sugar represents about 1,600
canefield man-years, which would be difficult to utilize in alternative pro-
ductive capacity.
8.14      In addition to these measurable effects, it is felt that if the sugar
industry's deterioration is not arrested now, it will accelerate, eventually
endangering the livelihoods of most of the 50,000 Jamaicans now employed by
the industry. To achieve this long-run effect, it is necessary to take
measures now to begin to eliminate unproductive employment and allow manage-
ment to reinstate desired efficiency levels at the key factories. In compar-
ison to the long-run preservation of employment which the project would seek
to achieve, the recommended reduction of superfluous employment (totalling
about 400 people at the three key factories) is small.
E.   Project Risks
8.15      Security of cane supply is a vital condition for efficient sugar-
factory operation. Consequently, the proposed project departs from the
optimum in that an element of uncertainty exists concerrting the level of
future cane production in the Monymusk and Bernard Lodge areas (para 2.42).
8.16      Government and/or SIA have already taken steps to ensure that some
of the conditions for avoiding reductions in cane supply are met:
-    a policy precluding further canefield cooperal:ivization has been
published;
-    adequate loan programs are established;
-    smut disease, if not eliminated, appears under control;



- 76 -
a program to measure soil and groundwater salinity is
underway;
measures to improve irrigation efficiency are expected; and
-    studies of cane transportation are expected to result in
improvements and savings.
As a result of the proposed project, factories would be rehabilitated,
giving farmers necessary assurance that their cane crop can be harvested in
the proper season.
8.17      However, the central problem of the cooperatives and their related
problems - weak agricultural management, sub-optimal fertilizer application
and replant programs, strained relations between management end
worker/members - would reduce cane availability, if not to worst-case levels,
at least to levels below those considered probable. Resolution of the cooper-
ative problem is not possible without vigorous Government support; the studies
already begun by the Cooperative Development Center are inteded to result in
such resolution.
8.18      Deferral of the rehabilitation project until the initiation of ade-
quate stWeps to improve the cooperatives' performance, while a conceivable
alternative to proceeding with the proposed project under present circumstances,
would defer the factory rehabilitation. This would have such serious conse-
quences that it would not be advisable because:
a.   the deterioration of the factories is so advanced that all
future campaigns would be highly subject to breakdown;
b.   further deterioration in factory performance would cause
farmers to deliver cane late or not at all, which would prompt
them to substitute other less economic agricultural endeavors
for cane-growing;
c.   deferral of rehabilitation would tend to make eventual renova-
tion proportionally more expensive.
National Sugar's reasonably strong management, which is now newly-installed,
highly motivated and anxious to improve the industry, would tend to deteriorate -
by declining morale and/or loss of key staff - if the means for improving
the company's key factories were not at hand. It is therefore recommended
that Bank consideration of the project proceed and that Bank involvement in
the rationalization of the cooperatives be deferred for a possible future
project.



- 77 -
F.   Ecological Impact
8.19      By reducing consumption of fuel oil at the three factories, air
pollution resulting from its combustion would be reduced. If successful,
efforts to minimize canefield burning would reduce air pollution in the
immediate vicinity and increase water conservation as a result of cane trash
serving as mulch. No adverse ecological effects are foreseen as a result of
the project.
IX. SUMMLARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The proposed Loan Agreement provides assurances that SIA would:
a.   engage consultants to study and discuss with the Bank the
consultants' findings concerning improvements in cane
harvesting/loading/quality assessment (para 2.37);
b.   employ a qualified full-time financial comptroller
(para 3.03);
C.   not provide financing to any cane farmer on terms and
conditions not available to other cane farmers with
similarly-sized operations (para 3.27);
d.   make adequate provisions for doubtful loan recoveries,
consolidate its accounts, make all its funds and accounts
available for audit and provide the Bank with audited
financial statements and audit reports (para 5.04);
e.   provide capital rehabilitation loans of J$2/ton cane milled
to the factories provided the loans are invested (para 7.02);
f.   provide sufficient revenues or capital rehabilitation loans
to the project factories in such manner that they be able to
finance satisfactory portions of their investment programs
(para 7.05); and
g.   provide sufficient equipment loans to National Sugar to
enable it to carry out the project (para 7.06).
9.02      The proposed Project Agreement provides assurances that National Sugar
would:
a.   carry out a satisfactory plan to rationalize manning levels
(para 2.49);
b.   prepare job descriptions, define responsibilities, identify
training needs and prepare a training program for its employees
and identify desirable changes in the industry's organization
(para 2.50);
c.   continue to employ an experienced and competent chief executive
officer, financial director and technical director (para 3.07);



- 78 -
d.   provide audited financial statements and audit reports annually
(para 5.05); and
e.   revalue its assets as of the end of fiscal 1978 and to compensate
for future inflation (para 5.06).
9.03      The proposed Guarantee Agreement provides assurances that Government
would:
a.   permit National Sugar to carry out its plan for rationalizing
the manning levels of its factories (para 2.49);
b.   provide promptly import licenses for plant and equipment
to be financed by the proposed loan (para 4.15);
c.   reimburse SIA for losses incurred in sales of sugar locally
(para 6.03);
d.   make proposals to restructure National Sugar's indebtedness to
SIA and commercial banks and carry out such proposals as the Bank
agrees to (para 7.04);
e.   take action so that the three project factories would be able to
finance satisfactory portions of their investment programs from
net internal cash generation (para 7.05); and
f.   provide financing to complete the project if SIA and National
Sugar are unable to do so (para 7.11).
9.04      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that:
a.   SIA had made satisfactory arrangements to engage consultants
to study measures to improve cane harvesting/loading/quality
assessment (para 2.37);
b.   SIA and National Sugar had executed a satisfactory subsidiary
loan agreement (para 4.10); and
c.   the Bank had received a satisfactory Plan of Action for project
execution (para 5.03).
9.05      As a condition of disbursement against training-program expenditures,
the Bank would approve a training program to be proposed by National Sugar
and/or Government (para 4.07).
9.06      With the assurances enumerated above, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable base for a loan to SIA for US$18 million, of which
approximately US$17.6 million would be re-lent to National Sugar. The loan
would include retroactive financing of up to US$1.2 million for urgently-
required boiler rehabilitation at the three key factories (para 4.13) and
would have a term of 17 years, including 4 of grace, with interest at the
rate prevailing at the date of loan approval. The loan would be guaranteed
by Jamaica.

Justification
3.        The works included in the project are needed to renovate various
operations at the three key factories and refinery as explained in the
following paras, which summarize the improvements to be made and the reasons
those improvements are necessary for the following operations or installa-
tions: cane reception, weighing and quality assessment; washing and prepara-
tion; milling; steam generation; electric power; evaporation, crystallization
and centrifugals; condensing water systems; and refinery.
4.        Cane reception, weighing and quality assessment.  Cane reception
at sugar factories, including most in Jamaica, generally is by means of
electric hoists and slings. However, at the three largest factories, cane
reception stations have been extended by the use of wheeled tractors with
front-mounted grapples, whose lower initial cost and greater flexibility to
extend cane-storage areas (necessitated by the need for temporary cane stor-
age during factory stoppages) have been advantageous during recent years of
capital shortages and increased factory breakdowns. This practice has
resulted in additional sugar losses. Wheeled tractors inevitably crush some
cane, whose juice is then lost in the washing process. Ihey also transfer
additional dirt and stale material into the mill feed equipment, thus intro-
ducing organisms which inhibit crystallization and reduce sugar extraction.
At all three factories, concreting and provision for adequate drainage of
storage yards would reduce the introduction of dirt and organisms. Extension
of Bernard Lodge's overhead electric traveling cranes from a 35- to 60-foot
span is necessary to accommodate increased cane storage requirements. At
Frome, similar extension of the overhead cranes has been proposed as the
least-cost means of providing coverage for the cane-storage areas.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
5.        Cane washing and preparation.  Once the proposals to discourage
push-pile loading (para 2.34 ff. of the text) are completely effective, the
need for cane-washing instllations will no longer exist. In the interim
installation of a new washing elevator at one of Frome's two milling trains
will correct an unsatisfactory situation there, and minor rehabilitation work
is required at the Monymusk washing plant.
6.        The steam-winch engines driving many of the cane carriers at
Frome and Monymusk require high maintenance and contaminate process steam
with oil. They are to be replaced with hydraulic drives. Modifications to
both of Frome's carriers are required to handle the cane from the washing
station.
7.        Cane preparation is commonly measured by a preparation index
(PI) or percentage of broken cane cells; more intensive fragmentation permits
greater juice extraction but increases mill-feeding and combustion problems,
particularly in National Sugar's hearth-type boilers. Whereas intensive prepa-
ration is now considered about 90 PI, National Sugar factories, which utilize
rotary knives, achieve about 50 PI. Replacement of existing knife sets with
Unigrator-type shredders would enable the factories to achieve a PI of 75 to
80.
8.        Cane milling.  Substandard milling operating standards can be
improved by installation of automatic controls or improvement of operators'
skills through training (para 2.51 of the text). The latter choice appears
the lower cost alternative for National Sugar factories. Rehabilitation needs
of the milling trains at Frome principally involve replacement of equipment
which dates from 1939, when the factory was constructed, and provision of
spare rollers, which are also needed at Bernard Lodge.
9.        Steam generation.  At Frome, five of the eleven boilers date from
1939; their pressure parts are so corroded as to require immeidate attention
to avoid failure. Immediate removal of an excess boiler now at Bernard Lodge
(boiler #6) to Frome and reconditioning thereof to replace one of the Frome
boilers would permit the timely rehabilitation of the others at Frome; this
is less expensive than replacing all the superannuated boilers at Frome.
It would also permit the rationalization of the boiler situation at Bernard
Lodge, where water-level controls and alarms are urgently needed, To improve
thermal efficiency and thereby reduce fuel oil consumption, installation of
air pre-heaters is desirable. Replacement of the critical pressure parts
at Monymusk is also urgently necessary and replacement and/or renovation of
bagasse storage and ash-handling facilities there are also required, princi-
pally because of the advanced age of existing facilities.
10.       Electrical power systems.  All three of Frome's turbo-alternators
(two of which date from 1939) suffer frequent outages, and spare parts are
often unobtainable. Frome and Monymusk require additional generating capacity
during the out-of-crop season; while electricity is normally bought from the
Government-owned power company, its unreliable service necessitates standby



ANNEX 1
Page 5
capacity at these two installations. Unlike the large turbo-alternators
which utilize steam from the main boiler installation, the standby capacity
would consist of one-1000 kW diesel set at each factory.
11.       Evaporation, crystallization and contrifugals.  National Sugar has
installed boiling pan aids, which automate key operations at vacuum pan
stations, at one of its low-grade pans at Monymusk with notable success;
sugar recovery is estimated to have increased by about 3% as a result of this
installation. The purchase of nine additional sets for the three stations
would benefit sugar recovery and, in some cases, reduce steam utilization
as well.
12.       Low-grade centrigufal stations at Monymusk and Bernard Lodge do
not conform with modern methods of maximizing sugar recovery, which involve
gravity feed of cooled massecuite from the crystallizers instead of pumping
re-heated massecuite; it is estimated that the more modern system would
increase sugar recovery by about 1.5%. Renovation of the raw-sugar centri-
gufal system at Monymusk would permit release of batch machines to the
refinery, where added capacity is needed.
13.       Condensing water systems.  Frome depends on a 17-year old timber
induced-draft cooling tower, which is no longer structurally reliable, for
half its cool water requirements; the tower would be rebuilt. Monymusk and
Bernard Lodge depend on cane growers for much of their water supplies; doubling
the size of the spray ponds at both installations would reduce their needs for
new water, which could then be applied directly to the canefields.
14.       Refinery.  Improvements to the Monymusk refinery are principally
for three purposes: replacement or rehabilitation of old equipment e.g.
raw sugar mingler, liquor-lime proportioner, centrifugals; increase in
capacity from 10 to 15 tons/hour refined sugar output e.g. liquid and refined
sugar storage, centrifugal; increasing efficiency and concurrently providing
greater capacity in sugar drying, classifying, bagging and handling stations.
Technical Assistance
15.       Technical assistance costs have been estimated as follows (in US$
thousands); based on charges of US$5,800/man-month for ccnsultants and
US$5,000/man-month for design/engineering and on-site assistance:
