                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The original and the first additional credits are almost fully disbursed, having financed urban infrastructure construction or rehabilitation in over 130 municipalities and capacity
                         building of 92 municipalities. Only a few subprojects left to be completed. Additional subprojects to be financed with the additional credit have been identified in 56 municipalities and
                         preliminary design has been completed. Detailed project design and bidding documents for initial subprojects have been prepared and appraised, and the procurement process has
                         started. Plans to recruit consultants for municipal capacity building and for the preparation of a next generation of urban improvement interventions are awaiting final approval by the
                         government.
