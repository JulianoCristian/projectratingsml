                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The original credit closed on June 30, 2011. This and the first additional credit have been fully disbursed, having financed urban infrastructure construction or rehabilitation in over
                         130 municipalities and capacity-building of 92 municipalities. New sub-projects to be financed (through the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund) in 72 towns with the additional
                         financing have been identified, with works having started in eight towns.
                         Works on almost all sub-projects which had been identified at the time of the appraisal of additional financing are expected to start by the end of October 2011 (after the rainy
                         season), and the procurement process has been completed for about a third of the sub-projects; for the rest the procurement is proceeding to allow the start of works by November
                         2011.
                         Detailed project design and bidding documents for sub-projects identified or modified later are being prepared, and their procurement process needs to be accelerated to enable the
                         start of the construction by December 2011. There is a modest risk some of these may not be fully completed by June 30 2012. As such, the task team is regularly monitoring
                         progress of the procurement of packages and their implementation status.
                         With the recruitment of consultants for municipal capacity building, the activities under LGED's Municipal Support Units have restarted. The recruitment of consultant firm for the first
                         phase work on preparation of the next generation of urban development interventions has been completed, and the TORs are being modified to enable the next phase work to be
                         completed by June 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following closing of the original credit for the Municipal Services Project, the additional financing (of $42 million) is ongoing. New sub-projects to be financed through the Bangladesh
                         Municipal Development Fund (BMDF) in 72 towns have been identified/selected and almost works expected to begin by November 2011. However, the procurement process has to
                         be sped up to ensure completion of all works by June 30, 2012 and the Bank and BMDF are regularly monitoring the progress of procurement and implementation.

                         Under the additional financing, capacity-building activities under the municipal support units (MSUs) of the LGED have restarted while the consultant team for the first phase work on
                         preparation of the next generation of urban development interventions has been mobilized.
