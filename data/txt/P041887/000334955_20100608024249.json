The additional credit will\n            help finance the scaling up of improvements in urban\n            infrastructure and the municipal financial and management\n            capacity. The project has so far financed the rehabilitation\n            or construction of urban infrastructure in about 130\n            municipalities (and the repair and rehabilitation of\n            flood-damaged infrastructure in 195 towns), as well as a\n            capacity strengthening program of 92 municipalities. These\n            activities have been carried out well and resulted in\n            significant benefits as well as strong demand for additional\n            support. The additional credit will help extend the partial\n            financing of urban infrastructure improvements to some 170\n            towns, ' and extend the municipal capacity\n            strengthening program to about 142 municipalities, out of\n            315 urban local bodies (ULBs) of Bangladesh. Further, the\n            additional financing will support the development of a next\n            generation of urban improvement programs. The additional\n            financing will be the second one to help scale up the core\n            components of the project. In recognition of the good early\n            implementation record under the project, an additional\n            financing of $25 million was approved in 2008 to help\n            rehabilitate the damages to urban infrastructure as a part\n            of the Emergency 2007 Flood Restoration and Recovery\n            Assistance Program."}, "docdt": "2010-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
