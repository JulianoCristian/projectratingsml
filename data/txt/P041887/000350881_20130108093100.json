"The Municipal Services Project in\n            Bangladesh had an outcomes rating of satisfactory.  The risk\n            to development outcome was moderate.  Bank performance was\n            rated as moderately satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was satisfactory.  The lessons learned are as follows: (1)\n            Allow sufficient time for a new institution to be\n            established, especially when it accompanies a major policy\n            reform. (2) The MDF model in supporting ULB infrastructure\n            investments was effective and should be continued with\n            stronger technical support. (3) Introducing a municipal fund\n            where there are small cities with weak financial systems\n            requires realistic eligibility criteria for participating\n            municipalities and ample institutional capacity building to\n            allow them to participate and sustain their investments. (4)\n            Closer coordination between BMDF and LGED in providing\n            institutional strengthening and technical support would\n            strengthen BMDF operations. (5) The MSU was an effective\n            vehicle for delivering and coordinating technical and\n            institutional support to municipalities assisted by the\n            World Bank and other donors. (6) Including a disaster risk\n            management (or contingent emergency response) component in\n            projects where there is a high risk of flooding and other\n            natural disasters facilitates an emergency response.
