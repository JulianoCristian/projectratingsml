                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The original MSP credit closed on June 30, 2011. This and the first additional credit have been fully disbursed, having financed urban infrastructure construction or rehabilitation in
                         over 130 municipalities and capacity-building of 92 municipalities. New sub-projects to be financed (through the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund, BMDF) in 65 towns with
                         the Additional Financing operation have been ongoing; of the $42 million, 92.2% has been disbursed so far.

                         Works on all sub-projects (including those which had been identified at the time of the appraisal of additional financing as well those more recently approved) are now ongoing, and
                         the implementation of all 141 sub-projects are being very closely monitored by the BMDF and Bank team. There is a modest risk some of these may not be fully completed by June
                         30 2012, with 14 civil works packages reporting less than 50% progress. As such, the task team and BMDF will discuss and advise the municipalities on thenext steps given that the
                         Credit closes on June 30, 2012.

                         For municipal capacity building activities under LGED's Municipal Support Units, the activities have been undertaken in 50 municipalities. The consultant team for the first phase work
                         (module A) on preparation of the next generation of urban development interventions has completed its work and the reports/deliverables will be finalized soon; the consultant team
                         for the second phase (module B) is now underway, covering 24 towns. Meanwhile and the Government is processing their formal request for a selective extension of the Credit for
                         this contract only for three months, in order to complete the Module B.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following closing of the original credit for the Municipal Services Project, the additional financing (of $42 million) is ongoing with 92.2% disbursed as yet. New 141 sub-projects to be
                         financed through the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund (BMDF) in 65 towns have been under implementation, with an average 77% physical progress reported (June 6,
                         2012). Works on almost all packages are ongoing with the completion of most (126 out of 141) expected by Juen 30, 2012. In order to ensure completion of all works by June 30,
                         2012, the Bank team and BMDF are regularly monitoring the scheme-wise progress in implementation and some non-performing schemes will be dropped following review mid-June.

                         Under the additional financing, capacity-building activities under the municipal support units (MSUs) of the LGED are also underway. The consultant team for the first phase work
                         (module A) on preparation of the next generation of urban development interventions has presented their draft reports while the second (module B) consultants are now working on
                         the basis of the guidance from module A outputs. As the module B assignment will be completed in August (i.e. after Credit closing June 30, 2012) a selective extension of this
                         contract will be sought.
