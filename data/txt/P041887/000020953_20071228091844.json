The restructuring of\n            above-referenced projects, including the additional\n            financing, will form part of the larger IDA support package\n            for 2007 FRRAP, which also includes funding embedded in the\n            ongoing projects mentioned above and two other credits\n            (Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Program, Cr.4052,\n            and Primary Education Program 11, Cr 3857. The credit\n            closing dates of three Credits (Cr. 3177, Cr. 3791 and Cr.\n            3740) will be extended to June 30, 2011. The Emergency 2007\n            FRRAP consists of two components: (A) infrastructure\n            rehabilitation covering (i) rehabilitation of secondary,\n            regional, and rural roads, (ii) reconstruction of bridges\n            and culverts (iii) rehabilitation of urban roads, bridges\n            and culverts, and drainage facilities in municipalities,\n            (iv) rehabilitation of health facilities, (v) rehabilitation\n            of flood embankments, flood control and drainage, and\n            irrigation schemes, (vi) rehabilitation of water supply and\n            sanitation facilities, and (B) livelihood restoration\n            through low interest loans and community projects. The flood\n            restoration works will support sectors where the Bank is\n            currently financing regular investments. Concerned\n            Government of Bangladesh (GOB) line ministries and\n            departments will be accountable for their respective\n            infrastructure rehabilitation within the framework of\n            ongoing projects. This ensures overall rapid and effective\n            implementation without major amendments to each project design."}, "docdt": "2007-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
