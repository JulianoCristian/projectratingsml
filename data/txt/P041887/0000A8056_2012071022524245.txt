                         The new sub-projects financed (through the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund, BMDF) in 65 urban local bodies (ULBs) with the Additional Financing operation are near
                         complete. Works on 141 sub-projects packages are in the final stages of implementation, with very close monitoring by the BMDF and Bank teams. There is a modest risk some of
                         these may not be fully completed by June 30 2012, with 80 schemes (out of 1192) in 21 ULBs partially completed. As such, BMDF will advise each ULB to provide an undertaking
                         that the ULB would ensure completion of these schemes .

                         For municipal capacity building activities under LGED's Municipal Support Units, the activities have been undertaken in 50 municipalities. The consultant team for the first phase work
                         (module A) on preparation of the next generation of urban development interventions has completed its work and the reports/guidelines have been finalized; the second phase
                         (module B) is underway, covering 24 towns.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following closing of the original credit for the Municipal Services Project, the additional financing (of $42 million) is about to close with 92.98% disbursed as yet. New 141 packages of
                         1192 schemes were financed through the Bangladesh Municipal Development Fund(BMDF) in 65 towns have been under implementation, with an average 92% physical progress
                         reported (June 25, 2012). Works on almost all packages are ongoing with the completion of most (1112 out of 1192) expected by June 30, 2012. In order to ensure completion of all
                         works by June 30, 2012, the Bank team and BMDF are regularly monitoring the scheme-wise progress in implementation; for contracts with slightly incomplete works, BMDF will
                         ensure that each ULB will undertake to complete the 80 incomplete schemes in 21 ULBs

                         Under the additional financing, capacity-building activities under the municipal support units (MSUs) of the LGED are also underway. The consultant team for the first phase work
                         (module A) on preparation of the next generation of urban development interventions has presented their draft reports while the second (module B) consultants are now working on
                         the basis of the guidance from module A outputs.
