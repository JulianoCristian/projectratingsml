development impacts, accompanied by satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower. Lessons on\n            sector development issues indicate that through the\n            development of Regional Conservation Strategies and Action\n            Plans, regional coordinating centers, small grants programs,\n            and others,  proved instrumental in addressing conservation\n            issues at the regional scope. Although there is high quality\n            technical expertise in Russia to support implementation\n            ofnational and regional conservation programs,  the local\n            institutional \"infrastructure\" for providing\n            respective consulting and advisory services however,  is\n            underdeveloped. This translates into the need to facilitate\n            institutional change, adapting processes (such as\n            procurement) to the prevailing market conditions,\n            particularly outside Moscow, which would eventually result\n            in more cost-effective project solutions in future\n            biodiversity operations.  Moreover,  interaction and\n            coordination between protected areas, and regional/local\n            public education authorities should  maximize the\n            effectiveness of the protected area-based education\n            programs. Lessons on the operational context suggest, and\n            reinforce the need for an early procurement and co-financing\n            planning; for monitoring project performance indicators\n            (particularly on technical issues); to foster staff\n            continuity; and, to benefit from a  sector-wide review of\n            project impacts, incorrelation with other Bank, and non-Bank\n            implemented projects, contributing effectively, within the\n            country assistance strategy (CAS) framework, in each\n            specific sector."}, "docdt": "2004-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
