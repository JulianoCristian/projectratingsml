                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This status update follows the Thirteenth Implementation Support Mission from August 12-20, 2013. The project is on track to achieve the development objectives. A total of 203 sub-
                         projects, including 91 public-private partnerships, have been established for carrying out agricultural innovations. Promising results emerging from the research and development
                         activities include filing of 72 patents and/or intellectual property protection applications, publishing 319 research papers in high impact peer reviewed journals, release of 192
                         technologies based on NAIP research, commercialization of 82 technologies/products, establishment of 22 business planning and development units, and piloting 51 new rural
                         industries. The project has greatly improved access to e-resources for agricultural research to scientists across the country and is also helping establish high performance computing
                         facilities as part of a national agricultural bio-informatics grid, and developing a financial management and management information system to connect ICAR institutions. About 81%
                         of the Credit and 76% of the GEF grant has been disbursed.
