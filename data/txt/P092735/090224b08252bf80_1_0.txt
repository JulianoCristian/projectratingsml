                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is scheduled to close on June 30, 2014 and is essentially complete. Procurement is nearing completion on the final contract for ICT equipment and financial reporting is
                         being brought up to date.

                         This status update follows the Fourteenth Implementation Support Mission from April 28-May 8, 2014. The project achieved its development objectives. A total of 200 sub-projects,
                         including 91 public-private partnerships, have been established for carrying out agricultural innovations. Promising results emerging from the research and development activities
                         include filing of 72 patents and/or intellectual property protection applications, publishing 319 research papers in high impact peer reviewed journals, release of 192 technologies
                         based on NAIP research, commercialization of 82 technologies/products, establishment of 22 business planning and development units, and piloting 51 new rural industries. The
                         project has greatly improved access to e-resources for agricultural research to scientists across the country and is also helping establish high performance computing facilities as part
                         of a national agricultural bio-informatics grid, and developing a financial management and management information system to connect ICAR institutions. About 86% of the Credit and
                         92% of the GEF grant has been disbursed, final credit utilization is expected to amount to 96% of the revised credit.
