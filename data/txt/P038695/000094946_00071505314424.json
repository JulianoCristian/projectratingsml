Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include: It is essential to obtain an\n            independent assessment of the extent of the damages and an\n            estimate of the costs involved without relying on figures\n            provided by inspectors from the housing ministry. Solidarity\n            among people affected by an earthquake--or a major\n            catastrophe--should not be minimized, but rather supported\n            in the project definition. It played a major role in\n            reducing by half the number of temporary shelters that had\n            to be erected and in helping people who used to live in\n            isolated farmhouses resettle in villages where the risk of\n            landslides following an earthquake is minimized. The\n            director of the project implementation unit and his staff\n            should be thoroughly familiar with Bank procurement and\n            disbursement procedures before project launching. In the\n            case of emergency operations, more flexible disbursement\n            procedures are needed. The Bank should make it a standard\n            practice to agree to the audit terms of reference at the\n            project's outset. Most project design and supervision\n            activities should have been awarded to private consulting\n            firms; this may have produced solutions more appropriate to\n            the special needs of the population. If for security\n            reasons, supervision teams cannot make site visits, the Bank\n            should consider suspending disbursements."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
