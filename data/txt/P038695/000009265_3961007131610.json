The project aims at rebuilding\n            the economic, social, and physical assets that were\n            destroyed by the earthquake, with a view to restoring\n            essential facilities and services in the shortest possible\n            time. The project will include the reconstruction and\n            repairs to facilities in the following sectors: a) in\n            education; b) in housing; c) in agriculture; d) in public\n            health; e) in roads; f) in water supply and sewerage; g) in\n            earthquake hazard reduction and prevention; and h) in social\n            rehabilitation. The project will address the\n            population's social and environmental concerns that\n            have surfaced in the aftermath of the earthquake. Particular\n            attention will be paid to the needs of women and children.\n            The project will also have a major impact on the\n            environment. Through rebuilding of the area, the quality of\n            the environment will greatly improve, as more structurally\n            sound and functional houses will be provided to the\n            population, accompanied by good access roads, and better\n            water supply and sewerage services."}, "docdt": "1994-11-10T00:00:00Z"}
