1.       Introductory Statement

1.     This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional loan
in the amount of US$10 million to the Government of the Philippines (GOP) for the Second Agrarian
Reform Communities Development Project (ARCDP2), IBRD Loan Number 7152-PH. The Bank is
the only international financing institution for this project.

2.     The proposed additional loan would help finance the shortfall in resources required to complete
the remaining critical infrastructure investments of the project. The shortfall is largely due to the
depreciation of the U.S. Dollar (US$) vis-à-vis the Philippine Peso (PhP) and local inflationary factors
since 2006. The additional financing request is accompanied by requests for: (a) an extension of the
current loan Closing Date from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010; (b) a change in the current fund
management arrangement (for infrastructure subprojects) from the Municipal Development Fund
Office (MDFO) to the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR); and (c) the application of retroactive
financing amounting to 20 percent of the proposed additional financing amount. The project
objectives and design remain the same, although its scope in terms of outreach is wider than indicated
at appraisal, given the community driven development (CDD) feature of the project.

2.       Background and Rationale for Additional Financing

3.     Original Loan. The US$50 million loan in support of the ARCDP2 was signed on January 22,
2003 and became effective on June 4, 2003. The overall goal of the project is to reduce rural poverty
and enhance the quality of life of the target beneficiaries, comprising primarily of Agrarian Reform
Beneficiaries (ARBs). Its development objective is to raise household incomes and the quality of life
of rural households in the targeted Agrarian Reform Communities (ARCs) by improving their
productive assets and rural infrastructure and providing access to key support services. The existing
loan Closing Date is December 31, 2009.

4.     Implementation Performance. The project is rated as satisfactory. Its physical
accomplishment based on the June 2008 mission was reported at 91 percent vis-à-vis the elapsed time
of 86 percent (March 31, 2008 data). Loan disbursement is 82.69 percent (as of October 23, 2008).
Most of the undisbursed amount had been fully committed to ongoing subprojects as required in the
subproject contracts. The project has also complied with environment and social safeguards
requirements, and procurement has been carried out in accordance with the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines. The majority of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been fully achieved with
some exceeding the targets such as: (a) 15 percent increase in the real net household income (the
target is 20 percent); (b) 20 percent increase in the annual average yield per hectare of major crops
after four years (the target is 15 percent); and (c) 220 percent increase in cropping intensity (the target
is 140 percent).

5.     No request for price escalation, even with the increase in prices of construction materials, has
been received. The review of individual subprojects indicates that contract price escalation has been
well controlled compared with overall inflation in the Philippines. Specifically, the post bidding
investment costs on 259 subprojects (99 percent of the total) show an average cost increase of only 4
percent, between the estimated investment at the time of subproject approval and award of contract
(a period averaging four months).

6.     Two areas were, however, rated as moderately satisfactory: Financial Management and the
Rural Infrastructure Component. While overall financial management performance and
implementation of infrastructure subprojects have been generally satisfactory, delays in the release of
funds by MDFO has severely constrained construction of subprojects. The slow processing of key
documents has also created delays in the completion of the required audit reports. An Action Plan has
been developed to address these concerns and implementation progress is noted to have improved to
date.


                                                      1

7.     Rationale for Additional Financing. The additional financing will be used to cover the
shortfall in resources required to complete and finance the remaining critical activities of the project.
At the time of appraisal (FY03), the exchange rate was US$1.00 to PhP50 and the average rate
projected through the implementation period was PhP52.60. Until the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in
September 2005, the US$ strengthened to about US$1.00 to PhP56. As such, no shortfall in loan
funds was then anticipated and funds were eventually fully committed for approved subprojects.

8.     At the time of the MTR, only 14 percent of the loan had been disbursed due to initial
implementation challenges. While project progress accelerated after the MTR, the US$ depreciated
substantially. By April 2008, the exchange rate had dropped to PhP41. Together with increasing
local inflation, this drop resulted in the Peso purchasing power of a US$ to about 63 percent of what it
had been at the time of MTR.

9.      The net effect is that the loan is now inadequate to support the level of investment which had
been planned from the time of the MTR. Compared with the MTR situation, about US$8 million of
the expected loan proceeds shortfall can be attributed to exchange rate alone. Compared to the
situation indicated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the loan proceeds are estimated to be
worth about 20 percent less in real terms than was envisaged. Exchange rate movements account for
50 percent of the loan proceeds shortfall; local price (inflation resulting from slower than planned
implementation) account for 44 percent; and 6 percent was due to the front end fee introduced since
the PAD.

10.    Proposed Use of Funds. The additional financing will be used to complete remaining
infrastructure facilities that are part of the original project targets and work program. The funds are
required to cover the construction and/or rehabilitation of communal irrigation projects/systems
(CIP/CIS)1 being implemented by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). The GOP request
recognizes that a buffer amount is required to accommodate any further exchange rate changes and
inflationary factors that may occur during the coming year. Construction of infrastructure is one of
the key performance indicators of the project, but without additional external funding it is highly
unlikely that this indicator would be fully met. Irrigation has also been at the center of the GOPs
efforts for sustainable economic growth, and is considered of high socio-economic and political
priority given the serious concerns on sufficiency of food supply and increasing food prices.

3.       Proposed Changes

11.    The additional financing request will not entail any change in the projects development
objectives or design. In fact, the additional financing being proposed will enable the project to fully
achieve its original objectives and maintain its current scope. The environmental category also
remains unchanged and no new safeguard policies are triggered. There will be no change in
institutional and procurement arrangements and requirements. However, new procurement will be
done in accordance with the "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
published by the Bank in May 2004 and revised in October 2006 (the 2006 Procurement Guidelines).
Fund management arrangement would also be changed specifically on the funds flow applicable to
the additional financing of the 22 irrigation subprojects. The additional financing will be carried out
in accordance with the provisions of the 2006 Anti-Corruption Guidelines.

12.    Fund Management by DAR. To ensure the timely processing of financial transactions, the
government has requested the channeling of funds for these NIA-managed irrigation facilities directly
through DAR, instead of MDFO. This is aimed at reducing steps in the funds flow process and


1        A CIP/CIS is a community-owned and managed run-of-river type of irrigation facility with a service
area of less than 1,000 hectares. An Irrigators Association (IA) is organized to undertake operation and
maintenance of a CIP/CIS. (The larger systems are classified as National Irrigation Systems or NIS, and are
primarily operated and maintained by the NIA, with some level of participation from IAs.)


                                                       2

       ensuring speedy processing of payment/billing requests. Based on the Banks review of the DARs
       financial management system, DAR as an agency does not fully meet the financial management
       requirement as stipulated in OP/BP 10.02. However, as a result of the mitigating measures
       implemented under the ARCDP2, the financial management risk has been mitigated to a manageable
       level (substantial). With this level of risk, the Bank Task Team endorses the proposed new funds
       management arrangement.

       13.    Retroactive Financing. All the subprojects proposed to be financed under the additional
       financing are under implementation. DAR has actually advanced funds to maintain the momentum
       of construction activities. As of August 2008, DAR had already advanced some US$1.84 million. In
       addition, there is about US$2.66 million in claims that have been submitted but have not been
       processed by MDFO. Another US$1.6 million worth of billing is expected by the end of December
       2008. These are equivalent to about US$6 million (60 percent of the US$10 million additional
       financing request). The GOP is requesting retroactive financing of 60 percent and a waiver of the
       maximum 20 percent. As per discussion with the EACPF and EAPCO, 20% retroactive financing
       would be endorsed. (Note: The Philippines Country Financing Parameters was approved on February
       21, 2005. As such, the country can avail of a retroactive financing up to a maximum of 20 percent.)

       14.    Extension of the Loan Closing Date. The GOP has also requested extension of the loan
       Closing Date from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010. While most of the subprojects would be
       completed within 2008, it would need additional time to fully complete the bigger and more complex
       subprojects, including preparation for operation and maintenance (O&M) and installation of required
       sustainability-related mechanisms.

       15.    Project Financing. Table 1 shows a summary of the estimated total project costs and
       financing: (a) at appraisal; (b) as approved by the ICC; and (c) with additional financing. Estimates of
       costs exclude rights-of-way and "future commitment to maintenance" which would increase both the
       total cost and the local contribution, thereby bringing it up to at least 50 percent for most types of
       physical infrastructure.

      4.       Consistency with Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Statement

      17.    Since there is no change in project objectives, design and scope, the project will remain
      consistent with the current CAS. The project continues to directly and strongly support the
      achievement of the CAS objectives of economic growth and social inclusion/empowerment.
      Furthermore, the project advocates improved governance at both national and (particularly) local
      government levels. Under the ARCDP2, the LGUs are the focal point of the project implementation
      and project support is provided to build local capacity in infrastructure development and maintenance,
      as well as in fiduciary matters. Similarly, the project upholds a private/public interface at the
      community level through supporting local agriculture and enterprise initiatives.

      5.       Economic Analysis of Cost Overrun

      18.    With the additional financing of US$10 million, the project loan cost will increase to US$60
      million. However, as a result of exchange rate movements, particularly since the MTR in 2005, the
      likely PhP equivalent of the loan is expected to be similar to the appraisal estimate of PhP2.6 billion.

      19.    The elements of the project remain consistent with appraisal. The viability of each component
      is now expected to be better than at appraisal, because the terms of trade have moved in favor of
      agricultural products, which are the main income sources of the project beneficiaries. At appraisal,
      the project was evaluated as economically sound, with an estimated economic rate of return (ERR) of
      22 percent.

      20.    The resources from an additional loan would be used primarily for the 22 irrigation schemes.
      These were all evaluated post bidding and were found to remain viable, with all ERRs exceeding the
      GOP/NEDA cut-off of 15 percent. Overall, their economic returns were estimated at 22 percent on
      average, based on 2007 data. Updating of this analysis to take account of the Banks more recent
      commodity price projections indicates a substantially higher ERR of 29 percent in the base case.
      Thus, the investments themselves are economically sound and sensitivity analysis shows the ERRs to
      be robust.



                                                          4

21.    The calculation of the economic impact of the proposed additional financing also needs to take
into account what would happen without any additional funding. Under that scenario, contractors
who have already undertaken initial work would still need to be paid, and in many cases costs would
be incurred but without benefits. Some schemes would perhaps proceed more slowly and eventually
be completed but with a different funding mix. Not providing additional funding would reduce the
current projects overall viability and have a negative impact on farmers, particularly those who have
prepared and spent for the new or rehabilitated irrigation schemes.

22.    Overall, the "without investment" scenario would almost certainly be more negative than had
no irrigation interventions been made at all on these schemes. The economic benefit of finishing off
these schemes with additional financing and considering money spent to date as "sunk cost" gives an
ERR of 40 percent.

6.       Project Appraisal

23.    No formal appraisal is required, given that the proposed loan is to fund an unanticipated
financing gap. However, the Task Team conducted a mini-appraisal as part of the June 2008 ARCDP2
Implementation Review Mission. Findings and data gathered have been incorporated in this Project
Paper.

24.    Safeguards Clearance. The EAP Safeguards Secretariat has reviewed the documents
submitted by the Task Team. The Acting EAP Regional Safeguards Advisor, Jose V. Zevallos, has
issued the safeguards clearance on October 7, 2008.

7.       Expected Outcomes

25.    As there is no change in the project development objectives or scope, the outcome indicators
and expected outcomes remain as currently defined in the PAD. Specifically, the additional financing
will ensure the completion of irrigation subprojects that would contribute 290 of the 1,500
infrastructure units (IUs) target of the project. The subprojects will cover 4,153 ha and are expected
to benefit about 3,880 rice farmers through an increase in yields and an increase in crop intensity by
about 70 percent on average.

8.       Benefits and Risks

26.    Benefits. The benefit of the additional financing will be that all ARCDP2 key implementation
activities would effectively be completed and that target outcomes would be fully achieved. The KPI
to which the additional financing will substantially contribute is the construction of 1,500 IUs. Such
would support and contribute to the achievement of other project targets such as: (a) 20 percent
change in real net household income; (b) achievement of at least 140 percent cropping intensity on
irrigated areas; and (c) 15 percent increase in average yield per hectare. The benefits and outcomes of
project investments are already being demonstrated for ARCs where the program of work has been
completed. In ARCs where the planned construction has not been completed, there is a risk that the
expected benefits will not be achieved.

27.    The completion of the 22 CIP/CIS is pre-programmed and is being eagerly awaited by the
intended farmers. The estimated annual incremental net benefit per farm household, after paying
amortization, is estimated at PhP40,000 at 2010 projected price levels. This is about 35 percent of a
typical household income.

28.    Furthermore, the government supports the additional financing as part of its concerted efforts to
avoid a rice crisis. Irrigation has always been an important part of the governments strategy to
achieve sustainable economic growth and food security. Recently, irrigation has acquired greater
socio-economic and political importance as a result of domestic and global concerns about increases
in the price of rice and other basic food commodities.

                                                    5

29.    Risks. The proposed additional financing has a minimal risk to the Bank and the government,
provided it is processed rapidly. The government has already given the required counterpart funds for
the existing loan and demonstrated positive commitment to continue compliance with all loan
covenants. The project design and activities are fully known and identified, and there is sufficient
implementation support.

30.    There are, however, risks if there is further delay in the process. Delay would heighten socio-
political pressure for the project, as farmers would perceive that the planned construction may not
proceed after all. Efforts will be made to maintain positive relationships with contractors to expedite
construction schedules. A second risk is that after approval of the additional financing, field
implementation could be affected by delays in funds flow. The funds flow risk could be mitigated by
adopting the recommended option for the funds flow. That is, for the funds to flow directly to DAR,
thus minimizing steps in the funds flow process.

9.      Financial Terms and Conditions for the Additional Financing

31.     The Government has selected a Fixed-Spread Loan in US Dollars, with 10-year grace period
and payable over 25 years (including grace period) with level repayments.

                     Attachment C. Definition of Financing Gap and Its Causes


Initial Provisions for Project Funding

1.       The fieldwork for ARCDP2 appraisal took place in mid-2002 and the estimated project
costs prepared at that time (May 29, 2002) were US$74.8 million (excluding up-front fee, which
was not then in place). Appraisal calculations assumed an exchange rate of PhP50 per US$ at the
time of appraisal, but differential inflation rates of 5 percent for domestic prices and about 3 percent
for dollar inflation. The PhP equivalent was estimated at PhP 3.9 billion. With the standard
assumption that purchasing power parity would be maintained, and assuming the project was
implemented between 2003 and 2006, the average exchange rate over the period projected in the
PAD was PhP52.6 per US$.

2.       Following the appraisal mission fieldwork, in July 2002 the ICC approved a project cost
slightly lower than that of the Banks appraisal fieldwork.

3.       The loan was subsequently negotiated and the appraisal document issued on October 30,
2002. The Loan Agreement was signed on January 22, 2003 and the Loan became effective
roughly half a year after what had initially been expected in June 2003. Project cost estimates in the
PAD were not updated following loan negotiations.

4.       The table below shows the Project Cost as assessed during the appraisal as reflected in the
PAD and the approved cost of ICC.

   Note: Approvals were given and PAD was undertaken prior to: (i) introduction of the Front End
   Fee; and (ii) change in cost sharing policy for LGUs.

5.       The main differences are (a) about US$5 million lower base costs approved by ICC;
because of different exchange rate assumptions, the PhP difference was only PhP111 million (or

equivalent to about US$2 million at that time); and (b) a much lower level of price contingencies
provided for by ICC equivalent to about US$4 million.

6.       Based on the ICC Approval, the government approved a Forward Obligation Authority
(FOA) of PhP 2,972 million on March 31, 2003 (PhP 2,608 million to cover the proceeds of the
loan and PhP 364 million of GOP resources).

Changes in Project Financing Shares

7.       Shortly after the project had been formulated, two major changes occurred. First, the Bank
introduced a 1 percent front end fee that it factored into the loan (replacing the old commitment fees
which were part of annual debt service). This reduced available resources by US$0.5 million.
Second, the GOP insisted that the national/local government cost-sharing arrangements under this
project be radically altered to a minimum 50 percent local contribution for rural infrastructure
compared with ARCDP I and what had been assumed in the appraisal of 10 - 30 percent.

8.       Although the increase in cost-sharing had been mooted at the time of appraisal, the Bank
decided to go ahead and process the loan on the assumption that this project, which was a follow-on
operation and had been appraised under the old system, would not be affected. This proved not to
be the case and many of the LGUs who had committed certain levels of support to the project found
that this would cover far less investment than originally planned.

9.       Early implementation was slow in part due to shortages of local resources. Accordingly,
the project, which had initially been designed to operate in 80 ARCs, had its scope extended to 125
ARCs in February 2006, following the MTR.

Exchange Rate and Inflation

10.      During the early years of the project, the PhP weakened against the US$ and in September
2005, at the time of the MTR, the rate was at around PhP55 ­ PhP 56 per US$. This led to the
expectation that, if anything, more PhP would be available from the Bank loan than had been
originally planned. (This had happened under ARCDP1). However, since that time the trend has
reversed. Disbursements prior to the MTR were small, about 14 percent of the loan amount, and
consequently this early advantage has been more than offset by the subsequent revaluation of the
PhP against the dollar.

11.      Table 2 shows exchange rate and inflation rates over time. It clearly demonstrates that
between 2002 and 2005 the US$ strengthened against the PhP and, despite cumulative Philippine
inflation of 18 percent, the purchasing power of the US$ fell by less than 10 percent since 2005. As
a result, by April 2008 the purchasing power of the US$ had fallen to 57 percent of its 2002 level
(and 63 percent of the level in 2005).

12.           The impact of changing exchange rates alone on the PhP value of the ARCDP2 loan is set
out in Table 3. This compares the PAD estimates with the actual disbursements to date, and
estimates for the future. Overall, the PhP proceeds of the Bank Loan available to fund the project
are likely to be the equivalent of about US$6.9 million less than had been projected in the PAD (and
about PhP 186 million less than provided for under the FOA2).

13.           The second reason for a funding shortfall from the loan proceeds is that there has been an
implementation delay and, since 2006, there has also been significant inflation in the Philippines.
This has meant that the physical structures approved for investment have generally cost more than
the amount approved at the respective Subproject Approval Committees (SAC). Results from 259
of 262 approved subprojects indicate that post bidding costs were about 4 percent higher than the
costs initially approved (amounting to about US$3 million), part of this is to be funded by the
additional financing.

14.       An analysis of the impact of average domestic inflation on the real value of loan proceeds can
be seen in Table 5. This shows that in terms of constant 2002 PhP, the loan has only been able to
provide proceeds of 80.6 percent of what was envisaged at appraisal. Some 5.9 percent of the
difference was due to the front end fee, 49.6 percent to movement in exchange rates and 44.5
percent to local inflation brought about largely by implementation delays.

15.           DAR has partially bridge-financed the funding shortfall by advancing funds allocated to it
from the 2008 budget for capital expenditure. This funding is considered incremental to the original
FOA. T his has meant that although there is a shortfall in total resources, there is adequate FOA
cover already approved for the funds use.




2   It can be seen from Table 3 that cumulative proceeds are likely to be PhP2,422 million compared with the
initial 2003 ICC commitment of PhP2,608 million (see paragraph 6). The difference is PhP186 million.

Availability of Loan Proceeds for Infrastructure Sub Projects

16.     Table 4 shows the funding shortfall from Loan Funds, specifically for the Infrastructure
Subprojects. The focus on these is because there has already been a commitment to fund most of
them, including the issuance of Certificates of Availability of Funds (CAFs), and in many cases,
contracts have been drawn up between the project implementing agencies and construction firms to
undertake the work. At the exchange rate of PhP 45 per US$ the shortfall amounts to about US$7.6
million, but it is sensitive to the exchange rate between June 2008 and when the money is finally
spent (say, December 2009). If the exchange rate were at 40, as it was in February 2008, the gap
would be US$9.9 million, whilst if the average exchange rate were 48, the gap would be reduced to
US$6.4 million

17.     The table also shows that if the exchange rate assumed at appraisal in the ICC project
approval had held good for the whole of the project, the shortfall would have been about US$2.7
million. Alternatively, if the exchange rate at the MTR (about 55.5) had held good, funding for the
finally agreed infrastructure subprojects would have been adequate (at 55.5 there would be a
shortfall of US$121,000 (shown above), but with an exchange rate of 56.0 there would have been a
surplus of US$216,000).

18.     This indicates that at the normal time for project re-planning, which is the MTR, the re-
planning of investments and corresponding proposed use of loan funds coincided closely with
resources reasonably expected to be available from the loan.

19.     It has been the PhP revaluation since the MTR, rather than the revaluation since the
appraisal, that is the main cause of the financing gap, which, based on these figures, is estimated at
about US$7.6 million.

20.     This "gap" may escalate if the current high levels of cost inflation in the construction
industry filter through into the subprojects which have been approved and are currently under
construction. Therefore, the proposal for US$10 million Additional Financing is prudent, given the
possibility of physical as well as financial contingencies.

                     Attachment F. Economic Analysis of Irrigation Investments
                                  to be covered by Additional Financing

1.       Irrigation improvement under the project on the 22 schemes to be covered by the Additional
Financing is geared towards (a) new gravity irrigation schemes, resulting from extending the amount
of irrigated land from existing water sources schemes; and (b) rehabilitating existing gravity schemes,
which are no longer functional. Overall, the 22 schemes cover 4,153 ha with 69 percent of the area
classified as ,,new and 31 percent as ,,rehabilitation.

2.       Virtually all of the irrigation water would be for rice (paddy) in the wet season and in the dry
season could be used for rice or other crops. While the financial returns from irrigation will vary
considerably depending upon which other crops are grown in the dry season, it is prudent to undertake
the economic analysis based on paddy. This is because paddy is the main tradable crop produced in
the country and if, as a result of irrigation, production of higher-value crops increases in the
subproject area the likelihood is that it will be correspondingly reduced in other areas because the
domestic market is probably the limiting factor; other land previously used for higher-value crops
would as a result revert to paddy.

Type of Analysis Undertaken

3.       As was done in the PAD, the economic impact of investment in irrigation is assessed through
a simple model set out as Appendix 1. This model looks at the incremental impact of increasing the
area of land under irrigation. It considers situations where land which is not irrigated without project
(either due to no system being present, or that part of the system under consideration being
inoperative) becomes irrigated as a result of the project.

4.       With Project (WIP) there would be 100 percent cropping in the wet season and significant
cropping in the dry season (average assumed to be 90 percent), whilst Without Project (WOP) there
would be un-irrigated or poorly irrigated wet season cropping only. Implicitly, this assumes that the
constraint to dry season production is water for rice and markets for upland crops. Thus, even if some
of the areas to be irrigated under the project were partially planted with upland crops, WOP, this
production would simply be shifted to other areas with no input or output reduction, and consequently
the dry season rice grown and associated costs would be incremental.

Converting from Financial to Economic Prices

5.       Within the model, current financial output values and costs are adjusted by economic
conversion factors (ECFs) to give the economic value of outputs and cost of inputs. The conversion
factor for paddy to the freight and milling costs is adjusted based on international prices. The
conversion factor for seed is taken to be the same as that for paddy. It is recognized that the current
situation is abnormal and for future years the economic rice price is calculated using the latest
available Bank projections, which were made in April 2008, and cover 2010, 2015 and 2020. These
are then adjusted for freight costs, milling costs and quality differential. Details of the calculation are
shown in Appendix 1, Table 1. A similar methodology is used to estimate the economic price of
fertilizer ­ assumed to be urea (Table 2).

6.       For chemicals, animal traction for cultivation and harvest time transport the standard
conversion factor of 0.83 is used, while for labor the ECF is estimated at 0.6. A conversion factor of
zero is applied to the irrigation fees payable to NIA as these are simply transfer payments and the cost
of irrigation investment is included within the overall project costs. Payments to the Irrigators
Association are roughly 50 percent for maintenance, which is costed separately in the economic
analysis (see below) and 50 percent for honoraria, with an ECF of 0.6. This gives an overall ECF of
0.3. The conversion factor used on loan interest and insurance payment of 0.5 is designed to



                                                     20

eliminate the interest charge but leave the insurance fee as a true cost of production. Threshing
charges are basically labor costs and so the same ECF (0.6) is used for these as for labor.

Investment Cost and Maintenance

7.        The overall average financial investment costs for irrigation, based on the post bidding
reviews, are PhP137,000/ha including project design. F or new irrigation the average is
PhP155,000/ha, while for rehabilitation the cost is estimated at PhP104,000/ha. Annual O&M costs
are estimated to average PhP1,425 per ha per year or PhP750 per crop on a 190 percent average
cropping basis. For irrigation construction, the standard conversion factor of 0.833 is used while the
figure for O&M (which has a higher labor content) is 0.75.

Results

8.        Based on the information in the previous paragraphs, an Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) for investment in irrigation has been calculated. This takes account of additional working
capital by considering incremental costs to be incurred on average three months ahead of receiving
incremental benefits. It has been estimated using Bank price projections for 2010 onwards for rice
and fertilizer, rather than current prices, which are felt to be abnormal. For other items, current prices
are used and the calculation is done in constant 2008 currency terms. The analysis is run over a 20
year period and no residual value has been assumed.

9.        If the schemes are well implemented, economic returns will be good. The base estimate of
the internal rate of return at economic prices (ERR) is 29 percent (39 percent for rehabilitation and 26
percent for new schemes, which are more costly to implement). This assumes WIP yields of 4 tons/ha
for wet season, compared with 3.5 tons WOP and 4.5 tons/ha for the dry season. The increased
cropping intensity, reflected by dry season cropping is assumed to be 90 percent. These underlying
yields and cropping intensity parameters are based on levels currently being achieved in ARCs under
ARCDP2 and which still leave plenty of scope for further improvement.

Sensitivity Analysis

10.       The base case estimate implicitly assumes that construction work is well scheduled and
during the construction year farmers continue to achieve WOP average performance. If there is a
hiatus in the construction schedule on rehabilitation schemes, there would also be a loss in farmers
income, which should be factored into the analysis. Such losses would not normally affect ,,new
schemes because in those cases there is no irrigation water supply to be interrupted. A sensitivity
analysis, assuming a one year loss of opportunity to produce over all schemes, would cause the ERR
to fall to 23 percent - still a very acceptable level .

11.       To test the robustness of the potential investment under other scenarios covering less benefits,
higher investment costs and delays as well as higher prices and improved yields, sensitivity analyses
have been modeled and give the following results.

12.      The investment is relatively robust in economic terms and still shows good rates of return in
the face of several negative assumptions. It can be seen that the project is most sensitive to the level
of dry season cropping achieved; if that is 60 percent rather than the planned 90 percent, and there is
also a one year construction delay, then the ERR falls to 16 percent.

13.      A fall in yields also negatively affects the ERR, but given that the incremental wet season
yield is conservatively budgeted at only half a ton per hectare, a 10 percent WIP change compared
with a static WOP would be quite a substantial variation. Conversely, if yields were higher than
expected and rose by 10 percent over a three-year period, after introduction of the new schemes, the
ERR would be significantly higher, at 37 percent. The ERR is not overly sensitive to construction
cost increases, indeed these are less important than delays. This suggests that getting the Additional
Financing in place quickly is very important and even if some cost increases are incurred, the whole
project should still be very sound.

14.      It is clear from this analysis that as a result of the ,,terms of trade moving in favor of
agriculture, the irrigation investment which has already been planned in detail would be likely to
show much better returns than envisaged at appraisal.

Economic Cost of Abandoning the 22 Schemes

15.      This analysis has been done on the basis that the construction of these schemes is the
,,project so that the WOP case assumes no irrigation, but does not take into account the cost of work
done to date. If the alternative to Additional Financing is for the works presently done on the schemes
to be abandoned, the WOP case could be considered as having a wasted investment element
(currently, the 22 schemes are 27 percent completed on average). A sensitivity analysis taking this as
the base scenario would imply that the incremental investment is 73 percent of the full cost of the
schemes. In such a case, the base ERR would be 40%. This reconfirms that it will be very important
to get the Additional Financing in place and finish off the schemes.

Executive Summary

1.     Scope of Review. A financial management assessment review was carried out by the Bank for the
Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to ensure that there an adequate financial management (FM)
system that satisfies the Banks OP/BP10.02 requirements for the proposed Additional Financing for the
Second Agrarian Reform Communities Development Project is in place. According to the requirements of
OP/BP 10.02, the borrower and the project implementing entities should maintain financial management
systems, including accounting, financial reporting and auditing, that are adequate to ensure that they can
provide accurate and timely information regarding project resources and expenditures. The review was
carried in accordance with the Banks guidelines under Financial Management Practices in World Bank-
Financed Investment Operations. The review included: (a) updating of the assessment carried out in 2002
for the project on DARs FM system, including for Foreign-Assisted Projects, and the inherent FM risks
in the country; (b) review of the results of the FM implementation reviews for project since it started in
2004; and (c) review of the report of the First Thematic Assessment of the Effectiveness of the Bank
Fiduciary Supervision4 conducted in May 2008 by Bank consultants, which included the project as one of
the three projects selected for review.

2.     Overall Conclusion. Overall, the FM system of DAR (as an agency) does not fully meet the
financial management requirement as stipulated in OP/BP 10.02 because of the following: (a) there were
non-compliance with internal controls policies and procedures such as no updated bank reconciliation
statements for some bank accounts as reported by the Commission on Audit (COA) in its audit of the
2007 financial statements of the agency, which resulted to unreliable account balances and made COA
issue an adverse opinion thereon. Notwithstanding, the issues reported in the audit of the agencys
financial statements did not include issues related to the project. The audit reports on the project
Statement of Special Account and project Financial Statements were unqualified for 2005 to 2007; (b)
books of accounts are still manually maintained, which caused delays in the generation of financial
reports; (c) delays in the preparation and submission of the audited consolidated Statement of Sources and
Application of Funds; and (d) delays in funds released to subprojects.

3.      The financial management risk of the project before the mitigating measures is considered high.
The FM risk of the project has been mitigated to a manageable level (substantial) due to the mitigating
measures implemented under the project, which have already shown positive impact. The factors
considered in assessing the FM risk of the project and the existing mitigating measures are discussed
below.

4.        FM rating of ARCDP 2 and report of the First Thematic Assessment of the Effectiveness of
the Bank Fiduciary Supervision. The FM system of the ARCDP2 has been rated moderately
satisfactory due to the following factors: (a) delays in the release of funds to the LGUs and NIA for the
subprojects under implementation; (b) long delay in the preparation and submission of withdrawal


4         The Thematic Fiduciary Assessment (TFA) was conducted in May 2008 in the road sector of the
Philippines. The TFA covered three main components: (i) procurement review, (ii) financial management review,
and (iii) contract performance review and physical inspection. The objectives of the review were to (i) assess the
effectiveness of the Bank supervision model of fiduciary and contract management aspects in the road sector in the
Philippines; (ii) review compliance of the Task Teams with Bank supervision policies and procedures; and (iii)
make recommendations to enhance supervision effectiveness, reduce fiduciary risk and ultimately improve the
quality and impact of investment lending.

applications to the Bank by the Municipal Development Office (MDFO) of the Department of Finance;
and (c) delay in the submission of the 2007 audited consolidated Statement of Sources and Application of
Funds SSAF (LGUs, NIA, MDFO and DAR) for the project. The 2007 audited Statement of Special
Accounts and ARCDP2 Financial Statements for DAR and MDFO though were already received by the
Bank and the COA rendered unqualified opinions thereon. There were no significant accountable and
internal control issues disclosed in the report of the consultants. The issue reported by the consultant
relates to the delays in payment of the creditors, as well as, delays in the preparation of work and financial
plans.

5.       NGAS and eNGAS. The budgetary controls, accounting procedures and internal controls
prescribed by COA under the New Government Accounting System (NGAS) are not considered adequate
because there are certain internal controls that are found only in various COA memoranda and circulars,
and laws and regulations. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), with its grant
to the Philippine Government, is working with the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to
improve the governments internal controls through the development of a National Guidelines on Internal
Controls manual. COA, in its audit of the agencys financial statements, reported certain instances of non-
compliance with the internal controls as described below. The bookkeeping segment of NGAS is
computerized and is referred to as electronic NGAS (eNGAS). The DAR has yet to implement eNGAS
and maintains its books of accounts manually. Due to the absence of a functioning computerized
accounting system, there are a lot of subsidiary records that not properly maintained and reconciled with
the general ledger for cash, receivable accounts, and property, plant and equipment accounts. These issues
have been reported by COA in its audit of the 2007 consolidated financial statements of the agency.
Consequently, COA issued an adverse opinion for this audit. The details of the issues discussed in the
audit report on the agencys financial statements and in the management letter did not disclose any
accountable and internal control issues relating to the Project. COA issued an unqualified opinion on the
2005 to 2007 audited Project Financial Statements and Statements of Special Accounts of DAR and
MDFO.

6.       Internal Controls and Internal Audit. DARs internal audit service (IAS) unit is assessed to be
weak, in view of the limited scope of coverage and the lack of training of the staff to carry out the internal
audit function in accordance with international standards. Internal audit function is a key activity to help
improve the control environment and facilitate greater reliance on financial management systems. There
were issues of non-compliance with established internal controls described above which were reported by
COA in its audit of the 2007 consolidated financial statements of the agency.

7.       Wide geographic spread of the subprojects. The infrastructure component of the project
represents 68% of the original loan amount. The infrastructure subprojects are implemented by the local
government units (LGUs) and NIA regional offices (for the small communal irrigation subprojects) which
are highly decentralized in nature with wide geographic spread. The FM capacity of the LGUs and NIA
regional offices is generally weak.

8.       Delays in the funds flow. Funds flow for the project within DAR is fast because there is an
adequate number of staff who can handle payment processing. The signatories are almost always
available to sign disbursement documents. The delays in funds flow come from outside the DAR system.
Funds for the infrastructure component in the original loan are released by the MDFO which maintains
the Special Account for this purpose. Releases are made based on the requests from the LGUs and NIA,
and endorsed by the DAR CPO.

9.       Delay in the submission of the annual audited consolidated statement of sources and
application of funds (SSAF). LGUs and NIA implementing rural infrastructure subprojects are required


                                                       29

to submit annual audited SSAF to DAR CPO. These are then submitted to MDFO for the first level of
consolidation as the funds were released from the Special Account maintained at MDFO. Overall
consolidation of the project SSAF is done by DAR, who is responsible in disbursing the other
components and is the overall agency responsible for implementing the project. Due to the wide
geographical spread of the subprojects, delays in the collection of these individual audited SSAFs are
experienced. Thus, annually there have been delays in the submission of the audited SSAFs. The audited
Statements of Special Account maintained at MDFO and DAR were always submitted on time.

10.   Mitigating Measures. The FM arrangements and mitigating measures that DAR has effectively
implemented for the project to reduce the financial management risks described above are as follows:

    (a) DAR has an effective organization for project implementation. The Project Management Board
        (PMB) which is an inter-agency board of senior officials is involved in the overall direction and
        management of the project. The Foreign Assisted Projects Office (FAPSO), the one-stop shop for
        foreign assisted project (FAPs) ensures that there is proper technical, financial and other
        administrative support for the FAPs, including this project. A Central Project Office (CPO)
        dedicated to the project ensures the hands-on implementation of the project in all its aspects
        including FM.

    (b) The project involves a consultative planning process with the communities in selecting
        subprojects and other activities. The involvement of the communities ensures that funds are used
        for the intended purpose and a good control against misuse of funds.

    (c) FAPSO FM unit is tasked to provide administrative and FM support to the CPO. On FM, it
        maintains separate books of accounts of the project, and prepares the basic financial reports
        required by the Bank. The CPO for the project has a Finance and Administrative Unit, in charge
        of the FM for the project, which includes the following: (i) coordinates with FAPSO FM on the
        FM aspects of the project and prepares the management and operating reports and monitors the
        utilization of the project funds (loan proceeds and counterpart fund); (ii) conducts FM orientation
        to NIA and LGUs participating in the project immediately after the subproject approval by the
        DAR Special Awards Committee (SAC), reviews the accounting records and supervises the FM
        aspects of the subprojects under implementation and inspects the physical progress of the
        subprojects together with the CPO rural infrastructure engineers and procurement specialist; (iii)
        reviews regularly the project accounting records maintained by the DAR Provincial Project
        Offices (PPOs) and the related financial reports submitted to the CPO; and (iv) conducts end of
        year meeting with the accountants of all LGUs and NIA to review the closing of the subprojects
        books of accounts.

    (d) Release of funds to the LGUs and NIA implementing infrastructure subprojects are based on the
        statement of work accomplished (SWA)/terms of contracts with contractors approved by the
        subproject engineers and mayors or regional directors of the LGUs and NIA, respectively. The
        SWA is reviewed by the DAR PPO rural infrastructure engineer after conducting its own physical
        inspection. The SWA together with all the supporting documents, including a statement of
        receipts and disbursement of the subproject, are submitted to the DAR CPO engineer and FM for
        review of accuracy and completeness of documentation and then submitted to MDFO for fund
        release. LGUs and NIA are required to maintain separate subproject bank accounts to facilitate
        monitoring of subproject funds.

    (e) DAR CPO maintains a system for all subprojects to monitor the physical progress and also the
        release of funds. At the start of each subproject implementation, a certificate of availability of


                                                     30

        funds (CAF) is issued to the LGUs and NIA. The CAF is equal to the amount of the cost of the
        subproject that will be funded by the loan proceeds. Thus, the release of loan proceeds for the
        subprojects is guided by the amount stated in the CAF and this information is included in the
        monitoring system.

    (f) Final inspection and acceptance of subprojects are conducted jointly by the DAR CPO and PPO
        rural infrastructure engineer with the LGU/NIA subproject engineers before final payments are
        released to the contractor.

    (g) Annual project SSAFs are required to be audited by COA and submitted by the LGUs and NIA to
        the DAR CPO, which are then used in preparing the annual consolidated project SSAF. Annual
        audited financial reports required under the project are as follows: (i) Statement of Special
        Accounts maintained at MDFO and DAR; (ii) Financial Statements consisting of balance sheet,
        cash flow statement and statement of changes in equity for the expenditures disbursed by DAR;
        and (iii) Consolidated SSAF covering all project components.

    (h) Quarterly financial monitoring report is required under the project and due to the Bank 45 days
        after the end of each quarter.

Country Financial Management Issues

11.   Perceived high corruption in the country. The international institutions monitoring corruption
has rated the countrys corruption as high. This perception of the existence of high corruption in the
country puts any investment in certain degree of risks.

12.   Weak internal controls/ weak or lack of an internal audit function in government units. One
of the outstanding recommendations in the 2003 Public Expenditure, Procurement and Financial
Management Review relevant to the project is the organization of the internal auditing function. The
establishment of the internal audit function is authorized under the Internal Audit Code, and in 2003
President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo directed all government to organize internal audit service under
Administrative Order No. 70. Only a few government agencies have complied mainly due to budgetary
constraints. DBM has issued a circular on April 14, 2008 authorizing all agencies to establish its own
Internal Audit Services ahead of the approval of the overall rationalization plan of the agencies.

13.   At present, the effective coverage of IA throughout the national government is minimal. Only a few
agencies have Internal Audit units and they are understaffed with inadequate skills and resources to
perform its mandate. Besides, internal audit methods and focus require major upgrading in line with
international standards. Internal control systems remain weak and relatively ineffective, which leaves the
system open to leakages/fraud. Technical Assistance funded by the Bank is being provided to the
presidential Anti-Graft Commission (PAGC) through IDF Grant to help expedite this process by
developing appropriate audit methodologies and preparing a Generic Internal Audit Manual align with
international standards.

14.   The AusAID, with its grant to the Philippine Government is working with the DBM to improve the
governments internal controls through the development of a National Guidelines on Internal Controls
manual. This is still a work in progress and would later on be disseminated to all government agencies.

15.   Absence of an integrated financial management system/computerized accounting system not
implemented by all offices. The bookkeeping segment of the NGAS is computerized (eNGAS) but still
under roll out to all government agencies. DAR has still not started the implementation of eNGAS, which


                                                     31

poses a great challenge in the generation of timely and accurate consolidated financial reports. It has just
started converting its chart of accounts and the prior years balances using the NGAS chart of accounts.
An integrated financial management system is still not in place in the country. Progress of the
implementation of eNGAS in all government units is highly dependent also on the availability of funds in
the units budget. DAR has already purchased the hardware requirement for the Central Office and will
provide for the budget of the rest of the hardware requirement in its next years budget.

2. Weak internal                       2. The Bank has initiated to address the issue of                N
controls/weak or lack of               internal audit through its grant Strengthening of
internal audit function in             Internal Audit in Government. A Generic
government units                       Internal Audit Manual was prepared under this
                                       grant and which is for customization by all
                                       agencies in government. Please see discussion
                                       below on the internal audit arrangement for the

17.    Strengths and Weaknesses. The significant strengths of the Financial Management system for the
project are as follows:

    (a) The culture and environment in DAR as well as in the CPO is one that fully supports rural
         development and thus going to the field and hard to reach areas has been part of their operation
         and is well provided for in the agencys budget. This provides them hands on approach to project
         implementation including financial management.

    (b) DAR has an effective organization for project implementation. The PMB provides overall
         direction and policies of the project. DARs FAPSO ensures that there is proper technical,
         financial and other administrative support for foreign assisted projects. DAR has also created a
         Central Project Office for the project staffed with experienced procurement specialist, financial
         management and administrative officer and staffs, engineers and other technical staffs that plans
         and supervises the implementation of the project by the participating agencies or units such as the
         DAR PPOs, LGUs, and NIA. Most of the DAR officers and staff are already familiar with the
         Bank policies and procedures as they have been involved in the First Agrarian Reform
         Communities Development Project.

    (c) The consultative planning process at the community level ensures that the subprojects and
         activities implemented are the priority needs of the communities. The communities provide
         assurance that funds are properly used for the intended purpose and good control against
         corruption.

    (d) The system of review conducted by the DAR CPO FM on the accounting records of the DAR
         PPOs. LGUs and NIA, physical inspection of subprojects and the financial reporting requirements
         established by DAR CPO for these offices provide added strength to the system of controls of the
         Project.

    (e) Good monitoring system of the releases of funds to the subprojects and filing system of
         documents for subprojects.

                 Significant Weaknesses                                            Corrective Action
 1. Significant delays in the submission of withdrawal   1.a DAR CPO assists MDFO in the preparation of the SOEs to
 applications to the Bank by MDFO for fund released      support the withdrawal applications. MDFO reviews the SOEs prior
 from the Special Account to the LGUs and NIA.           to submission to the Bank.


                                                         1.b Funds under this additional financing will be handled by DAR
                                                         because DAR has direct contact with NIA, who will implement the
                                                         subprojects for this loan.


 2. Delays in the submission of LGUs and NIA of the      2.a DAR CPO collects the annual audited SSAFs from the LGUs
 individual annual audited SSAF of the subprojects,      and NIA on or before end of April to allow sufficient time for the
 which caused the delay in the submission to the Bank of audit of the consolidated SSAF.
 the Projects audited consolidated SSAF.


 3. No IA coverage for the project.                      3.a The CPO FM conducts regular review of the project/subprojects
                                                         books of accounts and accounting records of the DAR PPOs, LGUs
                                                         and NIA each year, in addition to the year-end review on the closing
                                                         of the books of accounts. In addition, during these review visits,
                                                         physical inspection of subprojects implemented by NIA and LGUs
                                                         is conducted by CPO FM and/or CPO rural infra engineers.


                                                         3.b LGUs and NIA are required to submit annual audited SSAF for
                                                         each subproject.



Financial Management Arrangements for the Project

19.    FM organization and staffing. The FM staff in DAR FASPO and PPOs maintains the books of
accounts for the project and prepares the basic project financial statements. DAR CPO is the focal unit
that prepares the project work and financial plan, monitors and supervises the implementation of all
activities under the Project. The DAR CPO FM reviews and processes all requests for payments before
these are endorsed for approval to the DAR FASPO and DAR FM director and/or undersecretary. DAR
CPO FM also provides the review and monitoring of the FM aspect at the DAR PPO, LGUs and NIA for
the subprojects and project activities.

20.    Budgeting. The project is using the governments budgeting system. DAR prepares its annual
budget (including the project budget), which is required by the DBM. Preparation instructions (budget
calls) is received from the DBM. Budget preparation and discussions start with the lowest level of the
organization in DAR and consolidating by the DAR Central Office. There are reviews and approvals
within DAR and with DBM before these are submitted to the legislative and executive branches of
government for review and signing into law. The General Appropriation Act (GAA), need approval of the
Congress and the President. The GAA then becomes the basis of the quarterly release of funds (through
the use of the Notice of Cash Allotment or NCA) to the Agency or projects. Adequate budget registers are
used to control the budget implementation and reporting as required under NGAS. Government agency
heads are required to submit accountability and financial reports to the DBM, COA and the Congress in
accordance with existing rules and regulations. These reports are designed to monitor the efficiency and
effectiveness in the utilization of budgeted government funds by each agency, and generally to verify the
attainment of goals established in the budget process and the national development plan.



                                                            37

21.   Accounting. The books of accounts of the project are maintained manually using NGAS by all
offices participating in the project.

22.   Internal Controls. The project follows the internal controls policies and procedures found in the
NGAS, Government Audit and Accounting Manual (GAAM), COA and DBM memoranda and circulars,
other laws and regulations. In addition, the following requirements are implemented for the project:

    (a) Maintenance of separate books of accounts and submission of quarterly unaudited interim
        financial reports (IFR).

    (b) LGUs and NIA implementing subprojects are also required to maintain separate books of
        accounts for the subprojects to enable them to generate subproject financial reports.

    (c) LGUs and NIA are required to submit statement of receipts and disbursements (SORDs)
        (showing loan proceeds and counterpart fund) for each request of funds after the release of the
        contractors mobilization fee. The SORDs serve as a monitoring report for the DAR CPO on the
        management of the subproject funds by the LGUs and NIA.

    (d) LGU and NIA engineers review and sign on the statement of work accomplished (SWA) which is
        then approved by the LGU mayor or NIA director. DAR PPO rural infra engineers inspects the
        subprojects and certifies on the statement of works accomplished submitted by the LGU before
        submitting the SWA and the request for fund release by the LGU/NIA to DAR CPO.

    (e) Designated Accounts are maintained by MDFO and DAR for the project where all loan proceeds
        released from the Bank are credited. Peso Project Accounts are also maintained to pay for Peso
        expenditures. DAR PPOs, LGUs and NIA are also required to maintain Peso project bank
        accounts to ensure proper monitoring of the funds (loan proceeds and counterpart fund) received
        for the subprojects. Subsidiary ledgers are also maintained to account for the receipts and
        disbursement of funds from the loan proceeds and the counterpart fund.

23.   Internal Audit. The Internal Audit of DAR has weak capacity and it does not cover the project. As
the subprojects are implemented by agencies other than DAR, the DAR CPO procurement, FM and rural
infra engineers provide the review of the subprojects, such as the following:

    (a) DAR procurement specialist together with the DAR infra engineers reviews the procurement
        documents of the subprojects to be implemented by the LGUs and NIA. DAR CPO issues NOL
        for subprojects below the Banks prior review threshold.

    (b) Regular review of the accounting records at the LGUs and NIA is conducted by the DAR CPO
        FM and physical inspection of subprojects during implementation and at final completion is
        conducted by DAR CPO and PPO infrastructure engineers and at times with DAR CPO FM.

24.   External Audit. The external audit of the project and subprojects is done by COA.

25.   Financial Reporting. The DAR FASPO and CPO prepare financial and physical reports for the
project regularly for DAR management and PMB. In addition, DAR requires the LGUs and NIA to
submit individual annual audited SSAF for the subprojects. DAR is required to submit the following
reports to the Bank throughout the life of the project:




                                                     38

    (a) Unaudited Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter,
        which shall consist of the: (a) financial reports which should include the current and cumulative
        data compared with plan (covering both loan proceeds and government counterpart funds); (b)
        physical progress report; and (c) procurement status report. The physical accomplishment report
        must be linked to the financial report.

    (b) Annual audited project financial statements, statements of special accounts and consolidated
        SSAF and a copy of the management letter reflecting the auditors findings and
        recommendations, which are due to the Bank no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal
        year.

26.   Funds Flow/Disbursement Arrangements for the additional financing. This additional loan of
US$10.0 million will finance solely the cost of the communal irrigation subprojects implemented by NIA
at 100% of the amounts disbursed for the subprojects. Retroactive financing for expenditures already
incurred and paid for the subprojects covered under this additional loan, the maximum percentage of
which shall be approved by the Bank.

27.   The project funds are composed of the loan proceeds and DARs counterpart fund. The funds from
the loan proceeds will flow from the World Bank to the Bureau of Treasury account at the Central Bank
of the Philippines. After the issuance of NCA issued by DBM, the funds will be credited to the
Designated Account of the Project maintained at DAR central office. Withdrawal of funds shall be
through the submission of Withdrawal Application and Statement of Expenditures (SOEs).
Disbursements under the Project shall comply with the Bank policies and procedures on disbursements
and financial management as reflected in the Banks Disbursements Handbook and Financial Monitoring
Report Guidelines. NIA central office and regional offices shall maintain Peso subproject bank accounts.
Release of funds to NIA by DAR from the Designated Account shall be based on three tranches in
accordance with the agreed minimum percentage of work accomplished. NIA shall submit to DAR
statement of receipts and disbursements together with the statement of work accomplished as support of
the second and third release of funds.

28.     Financial Covenants. The financial reports submitted to the Bank under this project, which shall
include the additional financing, are as follows:

    (a) Unaudited Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter,
        which shall consist of the: (i) financial reports consisting which include the current and
        cumulative data compared with plan (covering loan proceeds and government counterpart fund);
        (ii) physical progress report; and (iii) procurement status report.

    (b) Annual audited project financial statements, statements of special accounts and consolidated
        SSAF and a copy of the management letter reflecting the auditors findings and
        recommendations, which are due to the Bank no later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal
        year.

29.   Condition for Loan Effectiveness. The submission of the 2007 audited consolidated statement of
sources and application of funds was originally required as a condition for effectiveness. However, this
was earlier complied with and submitted to the Bank prior to the Technical Discussions.

30.   Supervision Plan. FM implementation review mission visit is undertaken twice a year during
project implementation to ensure that the loan proceeds are used for the purpose it was granted, which
may take at the most four to six weeks. FM supervision can also be performed by telephone and emails in


                                                      39

cases of follow up of certain issues. The scope of the supervision is left to the professional judgment of
the FM specialist. It includes: (a) review of the continuous maintenance of adequate FM system by DAR;
(b) review of selected transactions, where deemed necessary; (c) follow up of timeliness of FM reporting
and actions taken on issues raised in previous review missions; (d) review of financials reports of the
project; and (e) review of compliance with the financial covenants. In addition, the FM implementation
review includes desk review of the quarterly IFRs, and audited financial statements and management
letter submitted to the Bank.
