Project (ARCDP2). The Bank is the only international\n            financing institution for this project. The additional loan\n            will help finance the shortfall in resources required to\n            complete the remaining critical infrastructure investments\n            of the project. The shortfall is largely due to the\n            depreciation of the U.S. Dollar (US$) Vis&Vis the\n            Philippine Peso (PhP) and local inflationary factors since\n            2006. The additional financing request is accompanied by\n            requests for: (a) an extension of the current loan closing\n            date from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010; (b) a change\n            in the current fund management arrangement (for\n            infrastructure subprojects) from the Municipal Development\n            Fund Office (MDFO) to the Department of Agrarian Reform\n            (DAR); and (c) the application of retroactive financing\n            amounting to 20 percent of the additional financing amount.\n            The project objectives and design remain the same, although\n            its scope in terms of outreach is wider than indicated at\n            appraisal, given the community driven development (CDD)\n            feature of the project."}, "docdt": "2009-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
