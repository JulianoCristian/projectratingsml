Project Development Objectives (PDO)

The overall goal of the project was to reduce rural poverty and enhance the quality of life of the
target beneficiaries, comprising primarily of agrarian reform beneficiaries. The objective of the
project was to significantly raise household incomes and the quality of life of the people in the
targeted Agrarian Reform Communities (ARCs) by improving their productive assets, rural
infrastructure and access to key support services.

No revision was made on the PDO.

    Comments          Three years after joining the project:
                      • 105% achieved as per the PAD target.
                      • Average increase per household reached 21% for the four batches.
                      • Increases per batch were: (a) 23% for CY 2003 ARCs; (b) 14% for CY 2004
                        ARCs; (c) 19% for CY 2005 ARCs; and (d) 33% for CY 2006 ARCs. The
                        relatively lower rate of increase for CY 2004 ARCs was attributed to
                        damages and losses in crops, business assets and other properties due to a
                        series of strong typhoons that hit the ARCs in 2006 and 2007.
                      • Increments in income were generated from the following activities: (a) on-
                        farm (58%); (b) off-farm (16%); and (c) non-farm (26%).

                      End of the project (December 31, 2010)
                      • 205% achieved.

  124 ARCs joined the project in different batches (i.e., 45 ARCs in CY 2003, 32 in CY 2004, 21 in CY 2005, and 26 in CY
2006). Monitoring of indicators, which needed to be tracked over a period of three years, was therefore based on the individual
ARC’s year of entry or batch.

                      • Average increase per household reached 41% for the four batches.
                      • End of project value was much better due to the completion of and benefits
                        generated from infrastructure subprojects (especially irrigation)3.
                      • Increases per batch were: (a) 51% for CY 2003 ARCs; (b) 33% for CY 2004
                        ARCs; (c) 44% for CY 2005 ARCs; and (d) 32% for CY 2006 ARCs.
                      • Increases came from the following activities: (a) on-farm (64%); (b) off-
                        farm (8%); and (c) non-farm (28%).

                      Based on a difference of differences analysis, incremental average income for
                      project ARCs, three years after joining the project, had increased by 13.9%,
                      compared to control group (“without “ project ARCs). The difference further
                      widened to 16.8% in 2010. (See Annex 3.)


Indicator 2:        Increase in cropping intensity on irrigated area within the ARCs.

Comments            141% achieved as per the PAD target. This was due to increase in the number
                    of cropping per year because of the completion of project-funded irrigation
                    facilities. (Excluded cultivation of new areas after completion of roads and
                    bridges which improved access to farms.)

Comments            113% and 140% achieved as per the PAD target, three years after joining the
                    project and by the end of the project, respectively. This was calculated using
                    three major crops (rice, corn and coconut). Increases per ARC batch, three
                    years after joining the project, were: (a) 13% (2003); (b) 27% (2004); (c) 7%
                    (2005); and (d) 22% (2006). Average yields further increased by 21% for all
                    batches at the end of the project.

                    Increase was attributed to the farm technologies introduced by the project
                    through the Farmers’ Field School, training on Integrated Pest Management
                    and use of certified seeds. Provision of irrigation systems and facilitation of
                    credit access for agricultural inputs under the project also contributed in
                    increasing yields.

                    (Note: Excluded increases in yield attributed to the cultivation of previously
                    idle lands of about 5,266 hectares and to crop diversification such as planting

   Twenty-two (22) irrigation subprojects were completed in 2009/2010. The contribution of these subprojects was significant
given that the average household incomes for ARCs, with and without irrigation, in 2010 were 47% and 38%, respectively.

                       building activities empowered the community groups to network and link with
                       service providers. Completion of roads and bridges also facilitated easier
                       access to these services.

                     19% and 1% were graded “Good”, “Fair” and “Bad”, respectively. The
                     subprojects with “Fair” or “Bad” rating were primarily those damaged by the
                     series of typhoons, but have since been repaired by the LGUs/ARCs using their

                     IAs involved in various project activities. However, since only 9 subprojects
                     were completed at that time, only 9 IAs therefore were required to manage and
                     maintain their irrigation subprojects. At the end of the project, however, all the

fully functional and is well-maintained); “Fair” (subproject is generally in good condition but requires minor corrective
maintenance); “Bad” (subproject is damaged, partially functional and requires immediate repair); and “Severe” (subproject is
dysfunctional). If a subproject is rated as “Bad” or “Severe” on three successive annual assessments, the grant part of the project

                and by December 2010, respectively. The higher than expected adoption rate
                was due to field-based training, capacity building for extension staff and
                provision of starter kits to the trainees which they had to repay in-kind, for

                with the expansion of project coverage from 80 to 124 ARCs in CY 2006, the
                project likewise increased its coverage to 237 POs which became the “self-
                revised target”. Given that majority of the newly-covered POs had lower
                organizational maturity (OM) levels, more time and assistance were needed to
                improve their OM levels. Nevertheless, the self-revised target was achieved at

                 POs which increased from 7,475 to 15,876; and (b) Bank’s rating on gender
                 responsiveness which was satisfactory throughout the project implementation

                 Nevertheless, the target was exceeded (133%) by the end of the project in
                 2010. Credit sources were national and local banks, microfinance institutions
                 and NGO microfinance program. Access to these institutions was facilitated
                 by the project.

                                     period.
 Comments         Target was partially achieved (86%) during the three-year operating period,
                  but eventually achieved 346% of the PAD target by end of the project. This
                  was due to limited credit support for livelihood activities available initially.
                  The launching of the micro-enterprises and agricultural credit activities by
                  the project in 2005 enabled households and POs to start or expand their
                  business enterprises and subsequently intensified CBU generation.

The project was restructured in view of the USD10 million Additional Financing loan which was
approved on March 19, 2009. Moreover, during the Bank-wide review and reconciliation of
Loan Agreements and Project Appraisal Documents (PADs), the list of performance indicators in
the project Loan Agreement was updated with the addition of two PAD indicators on: (a)
reduction in travel time; and (b) access to key support services.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The project was designed to support the overarching objective of the updated Medium-Term
Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP, 1999-2004) and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS, 2003-2005) which was to restore sustainable economic growth through greater poverty
reduction and equity. It aimed to address two of the four major themes of the MTPDP that were
likewise supported by the CAS, namely: (a) promoting macroeconomic stability and equitable
growth; and (b) accelerating environmentally sustainable rural development with social equity.
The succeeding CAS (2006-2008 and 2010-2012/13) and MTPDP (2005-2010) continued to
emphasize the importance of economic growth and social inclusion as integral national strategies
for poverty reduction and prosperity.

Land reform through the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP7) has been an
important Government Strategy in alleviating rural poverty since 1987. The twin objectives of
the CARP are to: (a) increase agricultural productivity; and (b) improve farmers’ income
primarily through land transfer and increasing land productivity. It also provides support services
to Agrarian Reform Communities (ARCs) to complement land transfer and improve land use. At
the time of project preparation, less than half of the 1,410 ARCs were only partially provided
with basic support services to improve the transferred lands due to limited resources. The
Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) approached the Bank for technical and financial
assistance to expand the provision of support services and cover some of the remaining ARCs.
During the predecessor project (Agrarian Reform Communities Development Project or
ARCDP1), the demand for these support services was found to be high, particularly for rural
access (farm-to-market roads and bridges), irrigation systems and agricultural and enterprise
development. Results from ARCDP1 also showed that investments in integrated support
services, in partnership with the Local Government Units (LGUs) under whose political
jurisdiction the ARCs8 were located, were successful in reducing poverty and increasing
sustainability of project investments.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the project was to significantly increase household income and the quality of
life in 80 ARCs by improving their productive assets, rural infrastructure and access to key
support services. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were: (a) 20% change in real net household
income, three years after joining the project; (b) 140% increase in cropping intensity on irrigated
areas, three years after joining the project; (c) 15% increase in average yields per hectare of main
agricultural crops, three years after joining the project; (d) average of 10% real increase in
household business assets, three years after joining the project; (e) 50% reduction in travel
time, after roads have been constructed/improved by the project; and (f) increase in ARCs’
access to support services and assistance.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

The PDO and KPIs remain unchanged throughout the project life.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project originally targeted 80 ARCs involving about 70,000 households, most of whom were
agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) with average incomes below the poverty line. After the
Mid-Term Review (MTR), the project accepted additional ARCs/LGUs which expanded the
coverage to 124 ARCs, with about 154,500 ARC households (including some 10,500 Indigenous
Peoples households). These ARCs cover 484 villages in 119 municipalities across 18 provinces.
The number of beneficiaries did not take into account additional population in adjacent
communities who were also served through road access and reduced transport costs. Other
households outside of the ARCs benefited through income and employment generated from
upstream enterprises as a result of increased agricultural production and enterprise activities in
the project areas.

1.5 Original Components

The project had the following six components. The implementation of these components was
done in an integrated manner to enhance their synergistic effects aimed at achieving the PDO.

Component 1: Community Development and Capacity Building (USD4.90 million, 5.26%
of total cost). This component focused on: (a) increasing active community participation and
self-reliance in ARC planning processes and implementation of integrated community-identified
priorities; (b) building the capabilities of ARC Peoples Organizations (POs) through community
mobilization and planning activities; and (c) strengthening the capacity of DAR and LGUs to
support appropriate development activities in the target ARCs. These investments in the social
capital facilitated beneficiaries’ and other key stakeholders’ participation in project activities,
access to key support services and sustainability of investments.

Component 2: Rural Infrastructure (USD69.50 million, 74.65% of total cost). This
component financed community-based and small-scale physical infrastructures that supported
agricultural and enterprise activities in the ARCs, based on the assessment of their needs and
priorities identified during the ARC development planning process. It involved the construction
and rehabilitation of rural access roads and bridges, communal irrigation, potable water supply,
multi-purpose buildings and solar dryers. The selection of subprojects took into account
technical feasibility and economic viability as well as willingness of the LGUs to provide
support, including counterpart financing or equity.

Component 3: Agriculture and Enterprise Development (USD10.70 million, 11.49% of
total cost). This component focused on increasing agricultural and enterprise productivity in the
ARCs and supporting the development of new and improved market opportunities. Activities
were directed towards improving farm and non-farm production using the ARCs’ productive
assets and linking them to other resources and markets.

                                                                                                 2
Component 4: Access to Financial Services/Support to Rural Finance (USD2.10 million,
2.26% of total cost). This component focused on the provision of agricultural finance services
through ARC cooperatives and micro-finance services to POs and individual entrepreneurs.
These were done in partnership with the Land Bank of the Philippines, People’s Credit and
Finance Corporation, and various microfinance organizations. These financial services helped
improve the utilization of the beneficiaries’ productive assets and in the marketing of their
produce.

Components 5 and 6: Implementation Support; and Project Management, Monitoring and
Evaluation (USD5.90 million, 6.34% of total cost). Implementation support covered the
provision of technical assistance and services to partner LGUs, DAR Provincial Project Offices
(PPOs) and ARCs in the: (a) preparation of ARC development plans; (b) preparation of
feasibility studies and detailed engineering for proposed infrastructure subprojects; (c)
procurement and financial management; and (d) subproject monitoring. It also financed support
for overall coordination, management, monitoring and evaluation of project activities at the
national and field levels.

1.6 Revised Components

The project components remained unchanged throughout the project life.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Changes in the Cost Sharing Arrangement for Infrastructure Subprojects, Project Scope
and Project Period. The project was designed based on the national government’s mandated
cost-sharing scheme which was applied during ARCDP1. Under this scheme and depending on
the income class of the LGUs, 70%-90% of the total cost of rural infrastructure subprojects was
treated as a grant from national government, while the remaining 10%-30% represented the
counterpart of the LGUs and/or beneficiaries. After the loan was approved by the World Bank
Board, the government issued a national policy regarding a new LGU cost sharing scheme for all
foreign-assisted projects that would be processed by the Government’s Investment Coordination
Committee (ICC), starting January 2003. Although the project was approved by the ICC in July
2002, the new scheme was retroactively applied to the project. This scheme varied significantly
from the project design as this required the LGUs to provide 50%-100% of the infrastructure
subproject costs9 as counterpart, compared to the previous 10%-30%.

The change in the cost sharing arrangement significantly delayed project implementation as it
took some time for most LGUs/ARCs to mobilize counterpart funding. Some LGUs also
withdrew from the project, while others were only able to finance an average of one to two (1-2)
subprojects, compared to the average of three to five (3-5) that had been projected during project
preparation. Consequently, it was decided during the MTR Mission to accept new LGUs/ARCs
that would be able to provide the required counterpart funding, thus increasing the project

 The new LGU cost-sharing arrangement had also adversely affected other World Bank-supported projects such as the Second
Mindanao Rural Development Project.

                                                                                                                      3
coverage from 80 to 124 ARCs. The entry of additional LGUs/ARCs, though, required longer
implementation period which resulted in three extensions of the Loan Agreement closing date.

Change in Fund Management Arrangements. Based on the original design, project fund
management was entirely vested on the DAR. This was however modified after Loan Agreement
effectiveness when the Department of Finance (DOF) requested that fund management for rural
infrastructure subprojects be coursed through the DOF’s Municipal Development Fund Office
(MDFO). (The MDFO is the primary conduit for releasing national government funds to LGUs,
as regards foreign-assisted projects). This change was documented through an amendment of the
Loan Agreement and involved the opening of a Special Account for MDFO.

Additional Financing (AF) Loan. The USD10 million AF covered the shortfall in the project’s
budget for the completion of 22 communal irrigation subprojects. The shortfall was due to the
appreciation of the Philippine Peso (PhP) against the US Dollar (USD) and local inflationary
factors since 2006. The foreign exchange rate at appraisal was PhP50.00 to USD1.00, but the
average rate during implementation was PhP45.00 to USD1.00.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis. The project built on the lessons and experiences from
ARCDP1 and other community driven development (CDD) projects in the country and in the
region. A series of stakeholders’ consultation workshops (including dedicated workshops for
marginalized groups, particularly Indigenous Peoples and women) was conducted to assess and
confirm the priority needs in the target areas, potential and opportunities for development,
capacity of the LGUs and beneficiary-communities, as well as presence and capacity of other
implementing partners and service providers. The various preparatory and consultation activities
upheld the following as key to addressing the PDO: (a) improvement and integration of basic
support services for ARCs that include provision of rural infrastructures, community
empowerment and capacity building, and diversification of farm and non-farm income
opportunities; (b) partnership with LGUs, national agencies, micro-finance institutions, civil
society and other service providers; (c) participatory and community-based planning,
implementation and operation, maintenance and sustainability of investments; and (d)
continuation of ARCDP1 policy of converting the infrastructure subproject grant into an LGU
loan if the completed subproject is not properly maintained. A Quality at Entry (QAE) review
undertaken in 2003 rated the project satisfactory.

Assessment of the Project Design. The project design proved to be relevant in terms of helping
address the national poverty reduction agenda and the priority needs and demands of the target
beneficiary-communities. It built on the ARCDP1 design, with an additional component to
improve access to rural financial services given the credit constraints in the ARCs. The
component interventions and safeguards measures were appropriate to the ARC context and were
well within the capacity of the various implementing partners. Implementation arrangements
were also largely appropriate and resulted in the desired outcomes, even with challenges
encountered in the funds flow mechanisms. Nevertheless, the design could have anticipated the

                                                                                              4
change in the cost sharing scheme for infrastructure subprojects by identifying mitigating
measures and/or determining restructuring options to address the possible risks.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment. The project was a priority of the government and
thus high importance was placed in ensuring thorough preparation. A team was designated by
DAR to spearhead project design and ensure compliance with necessary documentary
requirements. Sufficient staff complement and counterpart funding were also made available by
DAR all throughout the project preparation period, even when there were budget delays at the
national level.

Assessment of Risks. Critical risks correctly identified at appraisal were: (a) a deteriorating
macroeconomic situation that might have led to inadequate counterpart funds from the
government and LGUs; (b) weak capacity of many LGUs to implement the project; and (c) the
possibility that funds would not be efficiently and effectively used for the intended purpose. To
address these, the following mitigation measures were incorporated in the project design: (a) a
requirement for the LGUs to allocate upfront a budget for the first year of subproject
implementation; (b) more training of LGUs on overall project management (including
procurement and financial management) and engagement of NGOs and other service providers to
help in project implementation; and (c) the installation of a closer monitoring system, including
regular follow-up of LGUs’ submission of their financial management and liquidation reports.

2.2 Implementation

Facilitating Factors. The project was implemented based primarily on the original design. The
key approaches mentioned in Section 2.1 above led to the accomplishment of output and
outcome targets. Other key factors that contributed to the project’s successful implementation
were: (a) the established and functional structure of the DAR and the National Irrigation
Administration (NIA) from the national to the LGU level; (b) effective working relationships
that were established during the project between and among the project operational partners; and
(c) the strong commitment of the ARCs and LGUs to implementation outcomes. (There was no
Quality at Supervision review undertaken by QAG for the project.)

Implementation Challenges. As noted above, the revision in the LGU cost sharing
requirements for infrastructure subprojects significantly affected and delayed implementation. A
majority of the participating LGUs had limited capacity to provide sufficient counterpart funds
within the required timeframe. As this was a national policy and was beyond the project’s
control, various options and strategies were discussed during the project’s MTR Mission which
led to the decision to invite new LGUs with sufficient financial capacity to participate in the
project. However, the expansion led to an increase in the number of ARCs from 80 to 124, thus
stretching project management and resources beyond the original project design. This
necessitated three extensions of the loan closing date to allow for an additional implementation
period. Nevertheless, the project team was able to cope with the expanded scope and increase in
beneficiaries.

Two other major financial impediments, outside of the project’s control, had affected its timely
execution. The first was the re-enactment of the national budget in 2006 and 2007, which

                                                                                               5
delayed the flow of counterpart funds. This was addressed by the DAR providing “bridging
funds” to the project, thus enabling the project to pay its obligations to contractors and suppliers.
The second occurred during the period September 2005 to April 2008 when the USD:PhP
exchange rate dropped to about 63% of its 2005 level, leading to a budget shortfall. The shortfall
was addressed with the approval of the USD10 million Additional Financing loan in March
2009.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The project’s M&E system was anchored in the Logical Framework which
specified the PDO and key performance indicators at the impact, outcome and output levels. The
system was composed of: (a) a management information system which included a database
system called the “Field Implementation Support and Coordination (FISC) System” for tracking
physical accomplishments; (b) results M&E; and (c) impact evaluation. The system was
designed to gather data and generate reports for use in management decision-making. It also
facilitated the flow of data and information at different levels of the project, i.e., Central Project
Office (CPO), PPOs and DAR Foreign Assisted Projects Office (FAPsO). This database system
was initiated during ARCDP1 and was enhanced and fully operationalized under the project.
Nevertheless, while specific targets were identified for each indicator, the project failed to
specify the target increase for the indicator on “women’s participation in the project’s decision
making activities”. This, however, did not deter the project from proactively engaging women in
all project activities.

M&E Implementation and Utilization. An extensive baseline study was conducted at the start
of the project, the results of which were used in improving the design of the M&E system. The
baseline was further complemented by the project component data that were collected at the
ARC level using the Data Capture Forms. The forms were submitted to the PPO for data
encoding and consolidation with the Rural Infrastructure monitoring reports generated by the
LGUs’ Local Project Offices (LPOs).

The project also tracked the results of the major KPIs on an annual basis as follows: (a) KPIs on
household income, crop yields and organizational maturity were drawn from the DAR’s annual
survey on ARC Level of Development Assessment (ALDA); (b) KPIs on household business
assets and cropping intensity were generated from focused group discussions with ARC
beneficiaries conducted by the PPOs and Municipal Agrarian Reform Officers; (c) KPIs on
infrastructure units handed over to the ARCs, reduction in travel time, and increased access of
ARCs to key support services and assistance were gathered from the in-house monitoring
systems generated by the CPO and PPOs; and (d) the KPI on quality of infrastructure
maintenance was generated from the FAPsO M&E Unit data. The project also developed a
monitoring tool to generate data on benefits of completed and operational infrastructures. The
PPOs collected the data through focused group discussions with the Barangay Implementing
Teams and other ARC representatives. These were submitted to the CPO on a semestral basis.

Overall, the M&E system was well-designed and well-implemented. The quality and reliability
of the data and information were satisfactory. The data gathered were used by the project staff
and the DAR Management in reviewing the project’s progress, as well as in improving the

                                                                                                    6
strategy and focus of project interventions. The M&E database has also been transferred to the
FAPsO M&E Unit so that ARC monitoring can continue beyond the project period.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard. Three safeguard policies were triggered under the project, i.e., indigenous peoples
(IPs), involuntary resettlement and environmental assessment. The project established the
required frameworks which guided and ensured compliance with these policies. Specifically, all
infrastructure subprojects were required to have the right-of-way negotiations
addressed/negotiated and documented before any activity commenced. Subproject environmental
management plans also formed part of the subprojects’ plans and their implementation was
regularly monitored by the project staff and the Bank. In addition, a Bank-administered trust
fund (Japan Social Development Fund) helped the project further improve the mainstreaming of
IPs in ARC development. (Key outputs of this trust fund have also been adopted by the National
Commission on Indigenous Peoples and other agencies to operationalize the IP Rights Act.) The
safeguards ratings were consistently at satisfactory level throughout the project life.

Fiduciary. Compliance with procurement guidelines and procedures was generally satisfactory
and no misprocurement case was encountered. The financial management (FM) compliance
performance, however, varied, given that many stakeholders/offices were involved and that
transactions, although small, were likewise numerous. At the level of some LGUs/ARCs,
adherence to the FM guidelines required significant technical assistance and monitoring,
although rated overall as moderately satisfactory. Particularly in CDD type of activities, which
involved many stakeholders with varying capacities, it was necessary to have more frequent and
closer follow-up by the CPO, as well as by the Bank Task Team, to ensure complete
documentation and timely submission of FM and audit related reports. Annual audit findings
were generally unqualified, with a few qualified findings that had all been addressed and/or
complied with by the relevant offices.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

The project has robust phase-out and sustainability mechanisms. The partnerships between and
among DAR field offices, ARCs, LGUs, government agencies and financing institutions that
were established through the project are being continued. The capacity building of beneficiary-
organizations, such as cooperatives, Irrigators’ Associations, water users’ associations,
barangay/village road groups, etc., on the operation and maintenance (O&M) of project
investments ensured satisfactory subproject O&M. At the end of the project, the 142 subprojects
inspected by an inter-agency Inspectorate Team (out of the total 259 completed subprojects)
were all given a rating of “Good”.

Furthermore, the capacity building of the implementing agencies’ staff and the allocation of
budget support for continuing follow-on and monitoring of project activities contributed to the
sustainability of investments. However, it is important that the budget is released on time so that
follow-on activities can be implemented as scheduled.




                                                                                                 7
Discussions are ongoing among DAR, the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Bank
regarding a new project that would build on the project experiences and lessons learned. The
emerging thrusts of the new project are on rural agribusiness and market-oriented value chain
development. The DA, DAR and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(DENR) have also signed a joint Memorandum seeking to converge their respective initiatives in
rural development. The new project would provide an opportunity to harmonize the rural
development efforts of these three agencies for greater effectiveness and efficiency.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Overall satisfactory implementation was achieved, with all the project key performance
indicators being met, and in some cases, significantly exceeding the targets, by the end of the
project. Beneficiaries’ income, household assets and access to support services all increased.
(Please refer to Section F. Results Framework Analysis for details.)

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives. The project development objective of significantly raising the target
beneficiaries’ household income and their quality of life was and remained highly relevant and
consistent with the current key development priorities of the Bank and the country. Both the
Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (2010-2012/13) and the recently-approved Philippine
Development Plan (2011-2016) are anchored to the framework of inclusive growth and poverty
reduction.

Relevance of Design and Implementation. The project design and the corresponding
implementation strategies were appropriate in achieving the objectives set. The use of: (a)
participatory and CDD approaches; (b) mutually reinforcing packages of investments; (c)
stakeholders’ ownership and accountability for the investments’ operations and maintenance; (d)
focus on sustainability mechanisms at various levels (DAR, NIA, LGUs and ARCs); and (e)
effective implementation arrangements and M&E, enabled the project to accomplish its expected
outputs and outcomes.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Increase in Income. The project had fully achieved its first objective of raising household
incomes. The increase in the average real net household income of 21%10 (against the target of
20%) three years after joining the project, and 41% at the end of the project, can be attributed at
least in part to project investments. About 74% of the incremental income came from
farm/agriculture-related activities which was generated from: (a) agriculture and enterprise
technology assistance which directly contributed to increase in yields, crop diversification and
additional sources of household income; (b) access to agricultural and micro-finance services
amounting to PhP104.07 million which the project had facilitated for ARC cooperatives, farmers
and micro-entrepreneurs to establish and/or expand their productive activities; (c) rehabilitation

10
   Based on a difference of differences analysis, the incremental average income for project ARCs, three years after joining the
project, has increased by 13.9%, compared to the control ARCs (“without” project ARCs). This further increased in 2010 to
16.8%.

                                                                                                                              8
and/construction of 35 irrigation facilities which improved water availability for production and
resulted in increased utilization of agricultural land and cropping intensity in 5,358 hectares; (d)
investment in 15 post harvest facilities that addressed the need for crop drying and storage areas,
thus helping decrease spoilage and maintain quality of produce; and (e) opening and/or
rehabilitation of 198 roads and bridges (covering a total of about 1,084 kilometers) which
improved access between production areas and local markets, and reduced travel time and
transportation cost.

Improved Quality of Life. The second objective of enhancing the quality of life of the people in
the target ARCs by improving their productive assets, rural infrastructure and access to key
support services had also been achieved. As this is directly related to the first objective, the
various project investments mentioned above also triggered improvements in the overall quality
of life as follows: (a) ARCs’ access to health, educational and technical support and services had
improved as a result of improvement in the road network supported under the project. Over
2,400 services ( 284% of the original target) have been accessed by the ARCs from development
partners and services providers, mostly on medical, health and agricultural technical services;
(b) organizational development and capacity building activities empowered community
organizations to implement and/or expand their livelihood and social welfare activities (2,030
subprojects or 164% of the target) for their members and the communities in general; and (c)
technical and financial assistance interventions made possible the establishment of 8,905
(194%) and 723 (188%) household and cooperative level enterprises, respectively, which either
became the main sources of livelihood and/or supplemented the beneficiaries’ income source.
These helped in building the beneficiaries’ resilience to shocks and enabled further investments.
The community facilities such as multi-purpose centers and water systems also addressed the
need for potable water and post-harvest services. Furthermore, activities that proactively
involved women and IPs have ensured that the project interventions were highly relevant to the
key priorities of these marginalized groups, and helped improve their quality of life.

3.3 Efficiency

The economic efficiency of the project was satisfactory. The higher level of investment costs
due primarily to exchange rate changes (please refer below) was more than counterbalanced by
higher coverage in terms of both ARCs and number of beneficiaries, hence, creating a larger
base for project benefits.

Cost of Investments. The overall costs were 12% higher than initially projected in peso (PhP)
terms due to implementation delays; and 24% higher in dollar (USD) terms as a result of the
dollar weakening against the PhP during the project period. Nevertheless, when adjustments
were made for the timing of investments, the real unit investment (per hectare) in irrigation was
in line with PAD estimates. For roads, the real unit (per kilometer) investment costs were higher
because the roads funded under the project were part of the rural road network, rather than
simply village access roads.

Cost per Beneficiary-Household. The project’s total cost was estimated to be about USD1,070
per household for the target 70,000 households, at appraisal. Given expansion in project
coverage, the actual cost per household significantly decreased at USD610 for the 154,500

                                                                                                  9
households covered. As such, average project cost per household was significantly lower than
initially planned. At the household level, benefits from the project were substantial as elaborated
below.

Benefits. The estimated benefits for the infrastructure components were higher than had been
assumed in the PAD due to increased benefits per unit of infrastructure. Traffic volumes and
corresponding benefits were higher for roads, while the expected real long-run rice (and other
commodity) prices, in the case of irrigation, were projected at higher real levels in 2011 than
they had been in 2002. In these regard, the resultant recalculated EIRR for the project, based on
the weighted average of different investments was 29%, compared with 22% at appraisal.

Real incomes of project participants were found by DAR’s monitoring data to have increased by
an average of 41% in real terms by 2010. This increase was compared with the results from a
control group of 31 ARCs which were not covered by foreign-assisted projects (i.e., “without”
project ARCs). Using data collected in the same way for the same period and using the same
parameters, the increase in the control group’s real income was only 21%. The difference
between the average household incomes of the two groups can be considered as the average
benefit “attributable” to the project. Furthermore, multiplying the increase in income by the
number of households, and converting to economic terms as well as comparing the resultant
project incremental benefits to actual project costs led to an EIRR of 67% and an economic
benefit cost ratio of 3.2 (using a 12% real discount rate). This suggests that the estimate of the
weighted average EIRR at 29% is quite conservative.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome rating is satisfactory given that the: (a) objectives, design and
implementation of the project were and remained relevant; (b) project development objective
was achieved; and (c) economic efficiency was satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty in the country is predominant in rural areas (70%) where most of the ARCs in the
country are located. The increase in real net household income in the participating ARCs had
been substantial (21% and 41%) which contributed to alleviating poverty. The project also
generated positive residual effects on poverty reduction within the vicinity of the ARCs through:
(a) improved access for interior villages which also use the ARCs’ roads and bridges; (b)
increased employment opportunities from the creation of new and expansion of existing farm
and non-farm enterprises; and (c) irrigation of farms outside of the ARCs but serviced by
project-funded irrigation subprojects.

The project’s activities on gender mainstreaming facilitated involvement of women in decision
making and implementation of both project and non-project funded activities. Women-
membership in community organizations and cooperatives more than doubled (112% increase)
and woman-officers increased from 54% to 60% during the project period. (The government’s
                                                                                                10
planning agency had consistently rated the project as satisfactory in its annual gender
mainstreaming/responsiveness review.)

The integrated and synergistic approach of the project through its various components also
resulted in strengthening of POs, particularly in improving their skills and capacity in
implementing subproject activities and/or accessing resources for their priority needs. The 237
POs strengthened through training and other capacity building activities also demonstrated that
investment in social capital was critical for ensuring the sustainability of project investments.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project contributed to improved capacity within national and provincial DAR offices and
119 LGUs. These institutions received training and professional development assistance. Many
of the LGUs had no previous experience in managing externally-funded projects and thus,
required training in the preparation of feasibility studies, contract management, procurement and
financial management, among others. The DAR field personnel, on the other hand, were
strengthened towards more efficient delivery of support services and facilitating linkages with
other development partners. This also improved the capacity of DAR to provide support to local
planning, project implementation and management as envisioned in Republic Act 9700. The
improved capacity of both the DAR and the LGUs was reflected in the overall satisfactory
implementation and performance of the project.

The project likewise supported some key provisions of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act
(IPRA), especially in ensuring the involvement and participation of Indigenous Peoples (IPs) in
ARC development, simplification of the Free and Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) process, and
the improvement and production of an Ancestral Domain Sustainable Development and
Protection Plan (ADSDPP) manual/brochure, including the preparation of 25 ADSDPPs in IP
communities within the project sites. NIA’s fiduciary capacity and compliance with the Bank’s
procurement and financial management guidelines were also strengthened through the project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

There were additional benefits that were generated by the project. These benefits were also
realized in ARCDP1, although in ARCDP2, more data were collected to substantiate the
occurrence of such benefits. Road construction did not only contribute to improved access but
also led to the cultivation of previously idle lands. Another benefit was the increase in land
values, particularly those adjacent to new or improved infrastructure facilities such as roads. On
average, land values rose from PhP268,000 per hectare before the project to PhP652,000 (or
PhP479,000 per hectare in real terms) after the project11. The increase in land values raised in
turn the value of the capital asset of the beneficiaries, which tend to spur local economic growth,
as well. As earlier mentioned, a number of roads funded by the project were part of the rural road
network connecting several ARC and non-ARC villages. Benefits from reduced travel time and
wear and tear on vehicles are also being enjoyed by households in adjacent non-ARC villages.

3.6 Summary of Stakeholder Workshops

Field consultations were conducted as part of the ICR Mission to determine the perspective of
each stakeholder group with respect to project implementation and performance. There were 344
participants representing diverse stakeholder groups drawn from a sample of large, medium and
small provinces. The participants included representatives from farmers’ cooperatives,
Irrigators’ Associations (IAs), POs, IP organizations, LGUs, national agencies, private sector and
academe. Discussions focused on: (a) what each stakeholder group regarded as the project’s
major achievements, challenges and gaps; (b) the relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of
project strategies and interventions; and (c) innovation, sustainability and partnership.

The broad consensus reached by the stakeholders included: (a) project design was very relevant
and contributed towards income targets being reached or exceeded; (b) real net income increase
was far higher than the computed 21% increase three years after joining the project (this was
validated through comprehensive examples of increases in yields, cropping intensity and other
indicators); (c) decentralized management by the province and communities was important for
achieving targets, local ownership and accountability; (d) Bank procurement and financial
management requirements were initially difficult to implement but that the eventual benefits in
terms of efficient contracting, management and completion of subprojects made these efforts
worthwhile; (e) despite changes in local political leadership, the LGUs continued their support
for project investments; and (f) DAR and the LGUs have become active partners, with each
acknowledging the importance of each other’s role. (Please see details in Annex 5.)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The risk to development outcome is assessed as moderate. Clear O&M arrangements were
established for infrastructure subprojects which made up around 70% of the loan and considered
a major investment contributing to the attainment of the PDO. At the level of the ARCs and
LGUs, community-based O&M groups responsible for the proper use of the facilities were
organized and trained, while yearly budgets have been allocated to ensure ready funds for O&M
activities. To date, all infrastructure subprojects have met quality O&M as defined in the Project
Operational Manual, including those damaged by successive typhoons, which have all been
subsequently repaired.

The ARC organizations continue to grow and there is greater effort within these communities
toward exploring better markets on an on-going basis. Project interventions had also increased
the resilience of the targeted communities to respond to and recover from natural calamities as
noted during field visits. These were due to greater access to credit, improved organizational
capacity and stronger partnerships at the local level.

However, risks associated with natural calamities cannot be predicted, but will most likely
increase particularly in typhoon-prone areas, as the effects of climate change intensify.



                                                                                               12
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance was rated satisfactory in the Quality at Entry Assessment by the Quality
Assurance Group (QAG). The Bank Team was composed of both international/national staff and
consultants who had been involved in ARCDP1 and other community driven development type
of projects. As such, relevant experiences and lessons learned in these projects were considered
in project design and preparation. The team also conducted a series of formal and informal
consultation meetings with different stakeholders to gather and validate key design data and
information. These contributed to the thorough appraisal of the different aspects of the project
and helped the Borrower further improve the project’s overall design, implementation
arrangements and strategic relevance.

The Bank Team likewise ensured that fiduciary arrangements were adequate and that provision
was made to address and comply with safeguard requirements. In special consideration of the IP
Safeguards and gender concerns, the Bank Team required that separate consultations be done
with IPs and women.

However, the change in the cost sharing scheme for infrastructure subprojects was not
anticipated as the oversight agencies had barely started discussing the subject at the time that
project appraisal was almost completed. Nevertheless, options for restructuring were identified
and implemented during supervision. In addition, there was no specific target agreed on one
particular indicator, i.e., increase in women’s participation in the project’s decision making
activities. This, however, did not deter the project from proactively engaging women in all
project activities.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank’s performance during the implementation phase was satisfactory. Supervision was
intensive, with review missions conducted at least twice a year and focused on assessing the
project’s progress towards achieving the PDO. All missions were composed of project
component specialists, as well as safeguards and fiduciary specialists. As the majority of the
Bank Team members were based in the country, follow-on meetings/short missions were
conducted, especially at the time when the project was facing challenges. These helped address
issues in a timely manner, including the cost sharing scheme, opening the project to new
ARCs/LGUs, and the corresponding catch-up plan. Mission “writeshops” were also held wherein
the Bank and the project team jointly analyzed and agreed on the strategic actions and steps to
improve implementation.

Building on the lessons learned in ARCDP1, the Bank Team also paid closer attention to
ensuring the establishment of M&E system at all levels early on in the project, including the

                                                                                             13
conduct of baseline survey. Review missions specifically focused on the progress in each
component and assessed how they interacted to support the achievement of relevant output and
outcome key performance indicators and PDO.

No Quality at Supervision Assessment was made by QAG during implementation.

(c) Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory as it played a proactive role in ensuring
quality preparation, design and implementation of the project. This was performed by building
on the Bank’s global experiences and practices, as well as being sensitive to and taking into
account national and local situations, opportunities and challenges.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall performance of the central and local government agencies was satisfactory, although
MDFO was delayed in implementing several critical actions. The LGUs played a major role in
implementation in line with the government’s decentralization policy. They provided substantial
funds and resources to the project which was more than three times the appraisal estimates (from
USD6.56 million to USD20.5 million) to cover the needs of the ARCs, as well as the increase in
the required equity sharing for infrastructure subprojects. The Land Bank of the Philippines
(LBP) and the People’s Credit and Finance Corporation (PCFC) also actively participated in the
project and extended their services and financial assistance to the beneficiaries even if some of
them were located outside their original priority areas. On the other hand, the NIA had been
delayed in commencing detailed engineering and design activities during the initial phase.
Nevertheless, its performance improved in the course of implementation, especially during the
AF implementation phase where it exerted extra efforts to accelerate the completion of irrigation
subprojects.

The MDFO’s performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Project operations were adversely
affected by delays in funds releases for infrastructure subprojects, the cost of which totaled to
almost 70% of the loan. The Special Account was activated by MDFO only in February 2005
(or 20 months after loan effectiveness), thus delaying subproject activities. This was exacerbated
by further delays in the processing of financial documents and claims. While there had been
some improvements in fund releases, these were not consistently observed in the processing of
payments.

The ICC’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The ICC prioritized the review and
approval of the project, thus paving the way for the quick and smooth transition between
ARCDP1 and this project, and spared the project from losing momentum and the services of its
competent staff. Priority attention was also accorded to the project in the processing of the
Additional Financing (AF) loan. However, delays were encountered given that this was the first

AF loan for the country and that the government had to study first the new Bank facility. It
should be noted though that in the processing of the AF, the government allowed a modified
funds flow arrangement wherein DAR was given full responsibility for managing the AF loan
and which ensured the timely release of funds to NIA. Nevertheless, the affordability and related
issues on the cost sharing arrangement for infrastructure subprojects should have been addressed
by the ICC as these have been a major challenge for the project, as well as for other foreign-
assisted projects in the country.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of DAR, the main implementing agency, is rated satisfactory throughout the
project period. A full complement of skilled and competent staff was made available to the
project. The DAR Management also had taken a direct and proactive role in supporting project
implementation. In many cases, DAR had independently taken action in the interest of effective
project implementation, particularly in providing bridge financing whenever the project
experienced cash flow problems. Specifically in 2006 and 2007, when the government operated
on a re-enacted budget (i.e., no national budget was passed by the Congress, thus prompting the
government to operate based on the preceding year’s budget), DAR provided bridge financing to
ensure that project operations were not disrupted. DAR again provided bridge financing when
the project experienced significant delays in the processing of funds/claims by MFDO, as well as
when the project encountered delays in securing a budget cover for the AF operations.

DAR’s regular and project staff at both the central and field level had also been proactive in
addressing the various needs of project partners and clients. Feedback gathered from the LGUs
and communities indicated that the project did not only help them improve their communities; it
also helped improve their skills in project development and implementation. In a number of
cases, the skills and experiences gained by the LGUs in this project enabled them to qualify for
assistance from other projects and/or facilitated access to other development opportunities.

(c) Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The overall performance of the government is rated moderately satisfactory. Although
implementation delays were experienced due to the increase in the LGU cost sharing for
infrastructure subprojects and the delays in funds releases, all the major target outputs and key
performance indicators were achieved or significantly exceeded within the extended loan period.
It is recognized that to a large extent, the satisfactory performance of the project can be attributed
to the: (a) strong support provided by DAR particularly in proactively finding solutions to
implementation problems; and (b) partner-LGUs’ commitment to and ownership of project
activities and investments.

6. Lessons Learned

The lessons related to the achievement of the project’s development objectives, particularly on
the sustainability of project interventions and contribution to the wider agricultural and rural
development goals, are as follows:

(a) Convergence of Stakeholders Support. Project interventions were anchored on the
    Comprehensive ARC Development Plans which were prepared by the ARCs. As these plans
    contain all the priority needs of the ARCs, including those beyond the scope and limited
    resources of the project, the LGUs/ARCs encouraged and proactively sought participation of
    other development players. These coordinated support and complementation of resources
    proved effective in facilitating the critical and connected interventions that generated greater
    benefits and outcomes. ARCs with integrated and substantial support from a range of
    stakeholders also demonstrated that they were more organizationally able to generate
    economic and social benefits from a range of investments.

(b) Cost Sharing Arrangements. The cost sharing arrangements among project beneficiaries,
    LGUs and the project had maximized available resources, thus benefiting the greatest
    number of people. However, the new cost sharing scheme applied in this project was too high
    for most lower-income LGUs. Participation in the project became difficult for LGUs/ARCs
    that could not generate the required equity. The project countered this effect, to some extent,
    through higher investment in agriculture and livelihood enterprises, improved access to rural
    finance, and stronger focus on leveraging resources from other stakeholders to assist the
    ARCs. Nevertheless, the cost sharing arrangement should be regularly reviewed to assess its
    implications on the overall countryside development and poverty reduction initiatives.

(c) Mechanisms for Sustainability. Building on the experiences of ARCDP1 and other
    demand driven initiatives, the project introduced and consistently implemented the following
    measures to help increase the likelihood of sustainability and reduce the risk of project gains
    being lost, viz., (i) investing in capacity building and empowerment of community
    organizations, barangay (village) implementing teams (BITs) and LGU local project offices
    for them to take the lead in the execution and O&M of project activities and investments; (ii)
    provision of conditional grants which could be converted into an LGU loan if the O&M of
    completed subprojects if found unsatisfactory; (iii) establishment of linkage and partnership
    between the ARCs/LGUs and service providers (government agencies, non-government
    organizations, financing institutions, seed companies, academe, etc.); (iv) mainstreaming of
    post-project/follow-on activities into the DAR regular activities which are monitored through
    staff/personnel performance evaluation system; and (v) incorporation of the Comprehensive
    ARC Development Plans (CARCDPs) into the LGU Development Plans, with corresponding
    allocation of financial and technical support for the continuation of project activities,
    including O&M of infrastructure investments.

(d) Integrated and Synergistic Interventions. Development interventions, for these to be
    effective in improving the income and welfare of the intended client, should involve a
    holistic and integrated package of assistance. These include investments in capacity building

                                                                                                 16
   and skills development of target beneficiaries (social capital), technical and financial
   assistance for livelihood and income enhancement, and infrastructure development. The mix
   and level of these interventions should depend on the priority needs and capacity of the
   beneficiaries, including the availability of service institutions.

   At the time of the PAD (2002), no provision was made for a front end fee for the orginial loan. However, a front end fee of 1%
of the loan (USD100,000) was provided in the Additional Financing loan as per the Project Paper (2009). Eventually, a front end
fee of 1% of the original loan (USD500,000) was included in the Loan Agreement (2003), but the front end fee for the Additional
Financing loan was reduced to 0.25% (USD25,000).

                                    Annex 2. Outputs by Component



The major components of the project were designed to interlink and contribute towards
achieving the KPIs as shown in the project’s conceptual framework (Figure 1). Project
interventions and targets for each barangay (village) and ARC were defined on a demand-driven
basis.




Figure 2 presents the project’s accomplishments vis-à-vis targets at the component level as of
December 31, 2010. It shows that all of the components attained over 100% of their targets.
Several components substantially exceeded their targets with a mean accomplishment of output
per target of 140%16. This was due to continuing activities supported by DAR, LGUs and the
communities’ own resources beyond the completion of component inputs but still achieving
outputs within the project period.

   The accomplishment weighted by value of investment showed a performance of 115%. The government weighed the
performance in a different way such that performance cannot exceed 100%. Using the government’s approach, the project
weighted accomplishment was 100%.

Component 1: Community Development and Capacity-Building. Overall accomplishment
was 207%. This component had four major sub-components: (a) community development; (b)
organizational development; (c) capacity-building; and (d) advocacy and networking. Outputs
included increases in community-based projects, capital build-up (CBU), membership in
People’s Organizations (POs), savings, training, and services accessed. By the end of the
project, this component had achieved 207% of its measurable targets. In fact, quantitative targets
for each of the aforementioned outputs had been reached or exceeded since the end of 2009,
when funding for the component was fully absorbed.

Organizational strengthening laid down the institutional foundation for sustainable infrastructure
use (Component 2) and enterprise development (Component 3). A major accomplishment of this
component was to organize Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance Groups (IOMGs) in order
to support the sustainable use of completed infrastructure subprojects. Out of 409 such groups,
all are operational as of December 2010 except three IOMGs for irrigation subprojects that have
been completed by the loan closing date. These remaining IOMGs are expected to be operational
once the irrigation system starts its operations. The project also organized Barangay
Implementing Teams (BITs) that enabled the beneficiaries to take responsibility for project
implementation activities, and to anticipate measures supportive of post-project sustainability.

(a)    Community-Based Projects. A total of 2,030 “self-help projects” had been completed,
       representing 134% of target. These included establishment and maintenance of
       community vegetable and tree nurseries; construction of toilet facilities, bus shelters, and
       other small facilities; and clearing of drainage canals.

(b)    Capital Build-Up (CBU). Total cumulative CBU reached PhP51.82 million or 342% of
       target. This signifies the increasing institutional and financial capital base of the POs.

(c)    Membership in POs. As of the end of 2010, PO membership had grown to 27,251
       (211% of target). The membership increase demonstrated the greater involvement of
       community members in development activities.

(d)    Savings. Total savings amounted to PhP40.701 million or 455% of target. The increase
       in savings was mainly achieved through establishing savings programs within co-
       operatives with well functioning financial intermediation services. The savings and CBU
       generated were used by the POs for their livelihood capitalization and social programs.

(e)    Training. The project carried out 4,467 training activities (109% of target), such as PO
       strengthening and IOMG seminar-workshops. These were attended by 132,436
       participants, representing 142% of target.

(f)    Services Accessed. Advocacy and networking activities by the ARCs resulted in the
       ARCs being able to access a total of 2,405 new services (284% of target). Services
       included: (i) medical and health (32%); (ii) agriculture technical support (30%); (iii)
       enterprise development and livelihood assistance support (7%); (iv) financial assistance

                                                                                                21
       (6%); (v) educational assistance (6%); and (vi) other services (19%). This demonstrated
       increasing ability of the ARCs to independently access support for ongoing development.
       It also showed how convergence of support at the local level contributes to overall
       accomplishments.

Component 2: Rural Infrastructure. The project completed 260 subprojects which
corresponded to 101% of the component’s global target. This component was the largest project
investment and involved three major types of subprojects: (a) rural access; (b) irrigation; and (c)
community infrastructure.

(a)    Rural Access Subprojects. Around 75% of the infrastructure subprojects were on rural
       access. The project rehabilitated 124 farm-to-market roads and constructed 74 other
       roads. Rural access subprojects were consistently identified as top priority by the ARCs,
       and almost always immediately led to visible socio-economic improvements in local
       communities. The total of 198 road subprojects serving 99 ARCs spanned an aggregate
       of 1,083.95 kilometers, with a total cost of PhP2,226.58 million. In addition, 12 bridges,
       with a total length of 396.28 linear meters and costing PhP89.92 million, were
       constructed as part of 10 of the road subprojects.

(b)    Irrigation Subprojects. A total of 35 subprojects located in 28 ARCs were covered by
       the project, with an aggregate service area of 5,358 hectares, and a budget of PhP735.61
       million. Of these, 28 were communal irrigation projects/systems (CIP/CIS) implemented
       by the NIA, and the rest were small water impounding projects (SWIPs) and run-of-river
       systems implemented by the LGUs. The NIA-implemented subprojects were equally
       divided between new construction (CIP) and rehabilitation/expansion of existing facilities
       (CIS). Irrigation water delivery led to substantial improvements in cropping intensity.

(c)    Community Infrastructure Subprojects. These included construction of 15 multi-
       purpose centers (MPCs) and 11 potable water supply systems serving at least 3,357
       households. All but one of the 15 MPCs included a multi-purpose building with concrete
       solar dryer. The project achieved 100% of its community infrastructure target at a cost of
       PhP74.16 million.

Component 3: Agriculture and Enterprise Development. The four sub-components under
this component were: (a) enterprise development and management; (b) technology promotion,
transfer and commercialization; (c) market development and promotion; and (d) subdivision of
collective Certificates of Land Ownership Awards (CLOAs). Together with improved
infrastructure support (Component 2), organizational strengthening (Component 1) and access to
credit (Component 4), this component enabled farmers to engage in productive market-based
agri-based enterprises and thus improve their incomes. This component achieved 173% of its
overall target.

(a)    Enterprise Development and Management. The number of household level enterprises
       established under the project reached 8,905 or 194% of target. These included hog and
       goat raising, vegetable production, food pressing, sari-sari stores and welding shops. In
       addition, the project also supported 723 PO-based enterprises such as vermiculture,

                                                                                                22
       agricultural input trading, meat shop, post-harvest processing and farm implement rental.
       These accounted for 188% of the target.

(b)    Technology Promotion, Transfer and Commercialization. The project financed 4,617
       training activities and cross visits with a total of 156,120 participants. These activities,
       combined with microfinance services (see Component 4 below), contributed to the wider
       and increased adoption of viable technologies among the project beneficiaries. The
       number of adoptors reached 70,849, which was 150% of the target. The main barrier to
       adoption was access to financing.

(c)    Market Development and Promotion. The project facilitated a total of 801 contract
       growing and joint venture agreements between farmers and buyers, representing 240% of
       the target. These activities supported the PO based enterprises, out grower services and
       off-season vegetable production, among others.

(d)    Subdivision of Collective CLOAs. A total of 4,744 hectares (106% of target) covered
       by 2,384 CLOAs was surveyed and subdivided into individual lots for 1,864
       beneficiaries. The subdivision of land promoted on-farm investment and also provided a
       clearer process for access to formal finance.

Component 4: ARCs Access to Financial Services. Under this component, the project
facilitated links between ARC cooperatives/organizations and microfinance institutions. The
overall accomplishment was 118%. Under the innovative Micro Finance Solutions
(MICROSOL) Project and Agri-Finance Solutions (AGRISOL) Project, ARCDP2 enabled 100
ARC cooperatives (133% of target) to access credit, thus benefiting 39,079 clients (102% of
target). The Microfinance Innovations in Cooperatives (MICOOP) Program introduced in the
latter stage of the project, based on the learning from AGRISOL and MICROSOL, demonstrated
remarkable growth in terms of loans accessed for productive enterprises by the participating
farmers’ cooperatives. As a result, the cooperatives experienced substantial increases in their
assets, savings and share capital.

Components 5 and 6: Field Implementation Support; and Project Management,
Monitoring and Evaluation. These components achieved 100% of targets defined among
others in terms of: (a) establishment and maintenance of project offices at the national and
provincial levels; (b) hiring of suitable project management and technical personnel; and (c)
procurement of vehicles and equipment. The Central Project Office achieved full completion of
activities under the supervision of the DAR-FAPSO and in coordination with DAR Provincial
Offices and NIA.

                                 Annex 3. Economic Analysis


1.      Cost per ARC and Beneficiary Household. At appraisal, the project had an estimated
total cost of USD75 million and projected to cover 70,000 households within 80 ARCs.
However, there was an adjustment in project coverage between appraisal (2002) and actual
implementation. During implementation, the project cost increased to USD93.63 million and
covered 154,500 households within 124 ARCs. Nevertheless, the cost per ARC and beneficiary
household was reduced from USD938,000 to USD755,000 and from USD1,070 to USD610,
respectively.

2.      LGU Contributions. The original cost tables were based on LGUs’ providing a total of
USD6.56 million of funding, which was about 11% of the total cost of infrastructure. During
implementation, there were changes in cost sharing arrangements - with LGUs being required to
fund a greater portion of the cost of infrastructure from their own resources. Using the same
definitions as applied at appraisal and based on project costs on capital investment (excluding
cost of right-of-way and O&M commitment costs), the final estimated project costs and
financing amounted to USD20.5 million, which is more than threefold increase in LGU
contribution.

3.     Poverty Profile. The increase in project geographical scope meant that the project was
more thinly spread than initially envisaged and typically implemented in “wealthier LGUs” or
LGUs that can afford the increased cost sharing requirement. As a result, the project had
impacted on households with higher income than was envisaged at appraisal. Average household
income of families entering the project was about PhP64,400 (in real 2002 peso terms),
compared to an appraisal estimate of PhP45,000.

4.      Overall Project Costs. The overall project costs at PhP4.4 billion (USD93.63 million)
were higher than envisaged at appraisal, i.e., 12% and 24% in peso and dollar terms,
respectively. The PhP increase largely resulted from a longer implementation period than
planned, while the higher USD figure also reflected dollar devaluation against the PhP. In
addition, the overall structure of actual project costs compared to those estimated at appraisal
changed as actual investments for rural infrastructure were demand driven. The design
assumption was that 45% would be for village access/rural roads, 36% for irrigation, 3% for
farm roads, 6% for potable water and 10% for other social infrastructure. Ex-post, actual
investment was dominated by rural roads (74%) and irrigation (24%) leaving investment of only
2% in other infrastructure, mainly potable water. No investments were made in farm roads/tracts.
A significant tree crop planting activity had also been envisaged, but this was never implemented
as a specific subproject.

Ex-Post Review of Completed Subprojects

5.     The method of analysis used for EIRR analysis was reviewed during various
implementation support missions and found to be thorough and acceptable. After making some

initial assumptions made in the PAD models; and (b) estimates made at the time of subproject

estimated at appraisal (19.7%), but were still above the 12%-15% cut off point used by the
Government for different types of infrastructure projects. Below is the summary table of
subproject analysis, including broad findings:

6.      Rural Roads. Traffic volumes for both “with and without project” were substantially
higher than in the PAD model. This was to be expected, because many of the roads chosen for
upgrading were part of the rural road network (roads which connect a community to the existing
system) rather than purely village access roads. The average road length of 5.5 km was similar
to the 6 km PAD base model assumption, but the directly served population at 1,800 was well
below the PAD model figure of 3,500. Ex post data on traffic volumes indicated a “without
project” road usage of 51 car equivalents per day, compared with 33 that were assumed in the
PAD. Similarly “with project” road usage was also higher than the PAD estimate at 191 car
equivalents per day, compared to the PAD model estimate of 76. Unit vehicle operating cost
(VOC) savings were also estimated by DPWH to be slightly higher in real terms than in CY
2002. On the negative side, real unit costs of roads, expressed in constant currency terms were
about 13% higher than in the PAD model and there were substantial construction delays.

7.      Overall, the estimated EIRR of the average road was 19%. This was based on savings in
vehicle running costs and driver and passenger time savings. (The same approach as in the
PAD.) If passenger time savings were excluded, the figure would fall to 15%. These ex post
figures pretty well confirm the ex ante calculations, suggesting that the direct returns from rural
road infrastructure have been adequate but not spectacular.

8.       In addition to these benefits, other economic benefits resulting from improved roads
included reduction in transport time from manual or bicycle haulage and savings in travel time
for foot traffic. Data collected separately by the CPO as regards road subprojects also
reconfirmed: (a) substantial land price increases in areas along the roads; and (b) large savings in
travel time. The economic benefits associated with these two items were largely captured within
the VOC savings.



                                                                                                                                                               25
9.     Irrigation. Compared with the situation envisaged in the PAD, construction investments
per hectare was higher, both for new construction (PhP159.400/ha) and rehabilitation
(PhP101,700/ha) – the PAD estimated PhP100,000 and PhP70,000 respectively. However,
considering that irrigation investments were made on average in 2008/2009 but the PAD figures
were in 2002 prices, the real17 increase was 11% for new irrigation and 1% for rehabilitation.

10.     On the 12 irrigation schemes first completed, the base (without project) cropping
intensity was higher than envisaged at appraisal (about 150%), but with some of it low yielding.
Post project cropping on those schemes was over 200%. Overall, the increase in cropping
intensity from irrigation was expected to be at least 50%. Taking account of the likely increased
cropping intensity and updated rice prices (estimated based on WB projections), the base EIRR
from irrigation using the same type of model as in the PAD was 28%, compared to 19% at
appraisal.

11.     Other Activities. As a result of the wider project coverage, the likely benefits from the
components on community development/capacity building and agriculture/enterprise
development, as well as other project activities which were designed to enhance project
participants’ access to external services, were expected to be higher than the PAD estimates. On
the cost side, total project costs, excluding direct infrastructure investment, but including project
management and LGU implementation support amounted to USD22.5 million. Applying the
same assumptions used at appraisal (i.e., 2.5% per annum income increase over and above what
might otherwise had been achieved for households within project supported ARCs) would give
an estimated NPV from “other activities” of about PhP2.9 billion in 2002 currency terms (about
USD65 million), compared with the USD20 million PAD estimate. The EIRR would be 79%
compared with 29% in the PAD. However, considering the wider project coverage and therefore
a thinner spread of benefits and subprojects, a lower base case estimate was used. With a 1.25%
increase in household income resulting from the “soft investments” under the project, over a six
year period (Years 4-9) and the gain “held” until CY 2017 (fifteen-year evaluation period), the
EIRR for these “soft investments” would be 50%. If the gain were only held until CY 2013, the
EIRR would still be 47%.

12.      The cut off point for a 15% EIRR for the “soft” components would be an annual average
household income increase of 0.35% per annum for six years (Years 4-9), whereas in the PAD,
the cut off figure was 1.1%. Clearly it was difficult to know what level of household income gain
to attribute to this element of the project. However, the fact that according to the ALDA surveys,
the average household income gain three years after an ARC joined the project was a real 21% in
total18 (30% by CY 2009 and 41% by CY 2010), suggests that the 1.25% per annum assumption
is very conservative.

Weighted Average EIRR for the Project

13.    The table below compares estimates of the project EIRR at the time of the PAD and at
ICR, taking into account the different investment levels. The estimated overall EIRR calculated
by weighting individual EIRRs by investment, gives an overall figure of 29% compared to the

above that originally estimated in the PAD.

Whole Project Approach

14.     In the PAD, a further analysis was done to estimate what level of household benefits
would be needed to achieve an acceptable EIRR, assuming no without-project growth. It was
found that an average annual growth in real project household income of 4.6% per annum for 6
years from project Year 4, equated to an overall 15% rate of return. This implied that by Year 10,
real household income would be 31% higher than at the start of the project. The PAD assumed
household income in 2002 averaged PhP45,000 across the project area, thus for the project to
show a 15% EIRR, and assuming zero real growth without project, household income in 2012 of
PhP59,000 (in constant Peso terms), would be required.

15.     Using the same methodology, but taking into account the actual average base incomes of
PhP64,400 in real 2002 Peso terms (or PhP66,540 in net real 2003 Peso terms), the 154,500
direct beneficiary households and the actual project costs of PhP4.4 billion, household incomes
would need to increase by only a real 1.07% per annum for six years on average for the project
to show a 15% EIRR.



                                                                                                                                                        27
16.     However, the assumption of no “without project” growth implied that all income
increases were attributable to the project which is not realistic. One way of estimating
attributable income growth is to compare income growth of project-supported ARCs with
performance over the same time period of other ARCs which were not covered by foreign
assisted projects (FAPs). Comparing in this way should help eliminate exogenous factors, such
as weather or commodity prices which would affect both sets of data more or less equally.

17.    Data collected from ALDA19 reports and set out in the project’s KPIs showed real
average per capita income growth of 21% (three years after joining the project), which increased
to 30% in CY 2009 and 41% in CY 2010. This was compared to the results for the same years
from a control group of 31 non-FAPs ARCs as presented in the table below.

18.     An economic analysis was run, based on these differences. Within this, it was assumed
that after three years, incremental average income from project ARCs would increase by 13.9%
compared to the control (without project). Subsequently, the difference was assumed to have
increased to 14.6% by CY 2009 and to 16.8% by CY 2010 over and above the “without project”
scenario. From 2011 onwards, it is conservatively assumed that no further relative improvement
would occur. In relation to real 2003 base income, these “attributable” improvements were
14.7%, 16.5% and 20.2% for three years after joining the project, CY 2009 and CY 2010,
respectively.

19.     On the cost side, all project costs were included and provision was made for continued
maintenance of infrastructure beyond the project period. A simple assumption was made that all
costs and benefits were subject to a standard economic conversion factor of 0.833 as in the PAD.
Based on this, the EIRR of the project (evaluated over 15 years) is 67% and the benefit cost
ratio (using a 12% opportunity cost of capital) is 3.32. The NPV in CY 2002, expressed in terms

20.      The project is not very sensitive to assumed changes in benefits beyond CY 2010.
Making the assumption that attributable benefits would continue to increase at 2% per annum
after that date rather than remaining constant would only have a marginal impact on EIRR or
benefit cost ratio. Much more important would be any changes in the proportion of total income
increase that is considered attributable to the project. Based on the difference of differences
analysis between project ARCs and the control group, it had been estimated that of the 40.9%
average real income uplift between joining the project and CY 2010, 20.25% or roughly half was
attributable. But if the attributable benefits were only 10% or only a quarter of the total income
uplift, then the EIRR would fall to 29% and the benefit cost ratio to 1.6. Consequently, the
benefits attained through the project were found to be robust and likely to be sustained, assuming
no major exogenous factors.

                   Annex 5. Stakeholders’ Workshop Report and Results

Field consultations were conducted as part of the ICR Mission to determine the perspective of
each stakeholders’ group with respect to project implementation and performance. There were
344 participants from diverse groups including cooperatives, IAs, POs, IP organizations, LGUs,
national government, private sector and academe.

Discussions focused on: (a) what each stakeholders’ group regarded as the project’s major
achievements and challenges/gaps; (b) relevance, effectiveness and efficiency of strategies and
interventions; and (c) innovation, sustainability and partnership. The main results are presented
below:

1. Relevance to Beneficiary Needs and Local Conditions. The project design contributed
towards income targets being reached or exceeded.

2. Effectiveness in Achieving Outcomes. The management of the project, being decentralized
in the hands of the province down to the communities, was important for achieving targets, local
ownership and accountability.

   a. Planning. The strategic and business plans enabled the ARC households to
      systematically and effectively prioritize and implement interventions based on available
      resources.

   b. Rural Infrastructure. The construction/improvement of roads and irrigation was
      identified as among the project’s “greatest successes” because of the immediate income
      and benefits derived from these.

   c. AED “Roll-Over” Scheme. The starter kits which were provided to an initial group of
      training participants were recognized as an effective strategy to ensuring the adoption of
      training inputs. The recipients were required to pay these in-kind or in-cash and the
      repayments/proceeds were distributed to the next-in-line training participants (graduates)
      in a form of a loan, and the roll-over/cycle goes on. However, there was concern on the
      limited number of starter kits that were made available for each training, especially in
      courses where there were big numbers of participants.

   d. Rural Finance. The MICOOP model had been very successful and had already expanded
      operations, even if started late in the project.

3. Efficiency in Maximizing Benefits from Project Resources. The implementing partners
found that the Bank requirements for procurement and financial management were initially
difficult to implement, but the eventual benefits to them in terms of efficient contracting,
management and completion of subprojects made compliance worthwhile.

   a.       Financial Management. This can be further simplified based on lessons learned
        from the project and other similar projects.



                                                                                              32
   b.        Scale of Investments. Allocation of more resources for agriculture and enterprise
        development activities had been proven to have generated greater incomes and benefits.
        These have also partly compensated for the expected impact of infrastructure subprojects
        on incomes and livelihood opportunities (in view of the limited infrastructure investments
        as a result of LGU counterpart limitation).

   c. Land Development. It is important for the farmers to be assisted in developing their lands
      to be irrigated to ensure maximization of investments, generation of income and
      contribution to food sufficiency.

4. Impact. Participants indicated that actual household income growth was far higher than the
estimated 21% increase in income (three years after joining the project). For instance, ARBs
engaged in corn farming reported that their incomes have approximately doubled.

5. Innovation. Beneficiaries recognized the project’s innovative strategies and activities which
have ensured project adaptability to changing and unique local needs and conditions.

   a. Local Convergence. Important sustainability safeguards measures are being achieved
      through local convergence and partnership approach.

   b. Climate Change Adaptation. Climate-resistant measures had already been adopted in the
      design of irrigation systems across provinces.

6. Sustainability. In majority of the LGUs, despite political changes, new officials had
continued their support for project investments. This reflected the strong community ownership
and relevance of the investments prompting the new officials to maintain the LGUs’ priority
attention to these investments.

   a.       Enforcement of Local Ordinances. There is a need for LGUs to continue the strict
        enforcement of ordinances necessary to maintain project-financed infrastructure.

   b.        Inspectorate Team. This mechanism for inspection of infrastructure was recognized
        to be an important strategy for following up on needed repair and maintenance activities
        by the concerned parties.

   c.      Continuing Training on the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of Infrastructure
        Subprojects. Continuing education and training on the O&M roles and responsibilities
        was necessary in view of changes in the composition/membership of O&M groups
        (IOMGs and BITs).

7. Partnerships. As a result of the project, the DAR and the LGUs had become active partners
with each acknowledging the important role that each other play.

   a. Trigger for Inclusive Partnerships. The project was seen to have not only strengthened
      inter-agency and public-private partnerships but have also expanded the scope of



                                                                                               33
   partnerships, as well as paved the way for other institutions to better serve the
   community.

b. Confidence-Building. The project served as platform to continually build mutual trust
   among stakeholders who may have been adversaries before.




                                                                                     34
                           Annex 6. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

1.      Introduction. The Second Agrarian Communities Development Project was launched in
2003 and was designed to build on the successes of and lessons learned from the first project
(ARCDP1, 1997-2003). The project reflected the objectives of the Philippine Government’s
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program which aims to reduce inequity in land ownership and
increase productivity and incomes in the rural areas by improving land tenure and providing
integrated support services to farmers. Specifically, the project supported the DAR’s key
operating strategy for development of ARCs and sought to broaden the gains from ARCDP1 by
covering more ARCs nationwide. ARCDP2 was consistent with the overarching objectives of
the MTPDP 1999-2004 as well as the updated MTPDP 2005-2010.

2.       Project Objectives. The project’s development objective was to significantly raise
household income and quality of life of people in selected ARCs by improving their productive
assets, rural infrastructure and access to key support services.

3.     Project Scope and Beneficiaries. The project originally targeted 80 ARCs involving
about 70,000 farm households in 13 provinces. Subsequently, coverage was expanded to 124
ARCs located in 119 municipalities across 18 provinces. These ARCs had a total population of
751,984 with 154,507 households including 10,487 IP households. Most of the households were
agrarian reform beneficiaries with average incomes below the poverty line.

4.     Project Components. The project as designed had six components which were
implemented in an integrated and synergistic manner that worked positively towards
achievement of the desired project outcomes.

5.      Community Development and Capacity Building (US$4.90 million, 5.26% of total cost).
The component aimed to: (a) increase active community participation and self-reliance in ARC
planning processes and implementation of integrated community-identified priorities; (b) build
the capabilities of ARC POs through community mobilization and planning activities; and (c)
strengthen the capacity of DAR and LGUs to support appropriate development activities in the
target ARCs.

6.      Rural Infrastructure (US$69.05 million total, 74.65% of total cost). The component
financed small-scale physical infrastructures that supported agri-enterprise activities in the
ARCs, based on the community’s assessment of its needs and priorities. It involved the
construction and rehabilitation of rural access roads and bridges, communal irrigation, potable
water supply, multi-purpose buildings and solar dryers. Subprojects supported took into account
the willingness of LGUs to provide support including counterpart financing.

7.      Agriculture and Enterprise Development (US$10.70 million total, 11.49% of total cost).
The component aimed to increase agricultural and enterprise productivity in the ARCs and
supported development of viable new and improved market opportunities. Activities were
directed towards strengthening farm and non-farm production using existing resources, market
opportunities and interests of the ARCs.

                                                                                            35
8.      Access to Financial Services/Support to Rural Finance (US$2.10 million total, 2.26%
of total cost). The component focused on the provision of agri-finance services though ARC
cooperatives and other conduits; and provision of microfinance services through partnership with
the Land Bank of the Philippines, People’s Credit and Finance Corporation, and various
microfinance organizations.

9.     The Implementation Support and Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
components (US$5.90 million total, 6.34% of total project costs) covered the provision of
technical assistance and services to partner LGUs, DAR-PPOs and ARCs; coordination of
various project activities at the national and field levels; and financing of the overall
management, monitoring and evaluation activities of the project.

10.     The project components remained relevant and unchanged throughout the project life.
The design of the project was flexible enough to adopt certain enhancements in the components’
strategies and activities based on actual field conditions.

11.     Institutional and Implementation Arrangements.           The project was implemented
under the full supervision and responsibility of the DAR as the project executing agency. The
DAR’s FAPsO, through the CPO, was responsible in overseeing the overall implementation of
the project. The CPO exercised functional supervision of the 18 PPOs which were in turn
responsible for the execution of the project at the field level. DAR entered into collaborative
partnerships with other national government agencies, LGUs, non-government organizations
(NGOs) and private sector organizations to implement the various components and activities of
the project.

12.     Significant Changes. These included the following: (a) adoption of a new NG-LGU
cost-sharing scheme for the project which increased the LGUs’ counterpart in the cost of rural
infrastructure subprojects from 10%-30% under ARCDP1 to 50%-100% under ARCDP2; (b)
the change in NG-LGU cost sharing scheme necessitated the expansion of project coverage from
the original 80 ARCs to 124 ARCs and three extensions of the loan closing date; (c) project fund
management was designed to be handled solely by the DAR but after loan effectiveness, fund
administration for rural infrastructure subprojects was reverted to the MDFO; and (d) an
Additional Financing loan of USD10.0 million was secured as a result of the shortfall in loan
proceeds brought about by the appreciation of the Philippine Peso against the US Dollar starting
from 2005.

13.   Project Achievements and Outcomes. The project was successful in fully achieving its
KPIs indicating that the project has contributed significantly in uplifting the lives of ARC
households. Project investments have been sustained and supported further economic growth in
the ARCs.

14.     Increase in average real net household income, three years after ARCs joined the
project. Based on the results of the ARC Level of Development Assessment (ALDA) survey
conducted annually by DAR and tracked by the project, the average weighted real net household



                                                                                             36
income in the 124 ARCs (four batches)20, has increased by 21% from an average baseline value
of PhP66,540 (in real 2003 peso terms) to PhP80,328 three years after the ARCs joined the
project. This is slightly higher than the KPI target of 20%. Average net household income
increased by 41% by end of the project.

15.     Increase in cropping intensity (in irrigated areas). Achievement was 198% as of
December 2010, surpassing the KPI target of 140%. The 35 irrigation subprojects financed
under the project have contributed to the increased cropping intensity in the ARCs.

16.    Increase in average yields per hectare three years after joining. Per ALDA data,
average yields of major crops (irrigated rice, corn and coconut) in the ARCs three years after
joining increased by 17%, exceeding the KPI target of 15%. This has further increased to 21%
by the end of the project.

17.     Increase in business assets per household three years after joining. Achievement was
31% (PhP11,135) from the baseline average of PhP36,211, substantially surpassing the KPI
target of 10%. The increase was 47% (PhP17,020) by December 2010. ARC households
invested most of their business assets in permanent crops and trees, livestock and poultry, and
pre- and post-harvest facilities.

18.     Reduction in travel time. With the completed construction or improvement of 198 road
subprojects, average travel time was reported to have reduced by 69% or from about 11 minutes
to 3.36 minutes per kilometer.

19.    Increased access of ARCs to key support services and assistance. ARCs accessed 2,405
(284% of the KPI target of 848) various types of services which were not directly supported or
financed by the project.

20.     Other major component outputs and outcomes. Component KPIs were also fully
achieved by end of the project. Under the Capacity Building and Community Development
Component, 75% of 237 POs assisted (100% of target) increased in their level of organizational
maturity; women’s participation in decision-making in project activities had increased; and 2,030
community-based subprojects were undertaken (164% of target). In ARCDP1, the Barangay
(village) Implementing Team (BIT) played a pivotal role in mobilizing wider and more effective
community participation in the project. Under ARCDP2, 498 BITs were organized and trained
to operationalize the project’s different components. The Infrastructure Committee of the BIT
transformed into the Infrastructure Operation and Maintenance Group (IOMG) and was trained
to operate and maintain subprojects turned over to the ARCs. A total of 409 IOMGs were
organized and fully functional by end of the project.

21.      Under the Rural Infrastructure Component, 260 subprojects with a total cost of PhP3.126
billion were completed and turned over to the ARCs by December 30, 2010. These included 198
roads covering an aggregate length of 1,084 kilometers and serving 99 ARCs; 12 concrete

20
   The ARCs’ entry to the project was done in batches. ARCDP2 covered 45 ARCs during the first year (2003), 32 ARCs in
2004, 21 ARCs in 2005 and 26 ARCs in 2006. Most of the ARCs covered in 2005 and 2006 were either expansion ARCs or
replacement to ARCs whose LGU withdrew participation from the project.

                                                                                                                  37
bridges with total length of 396 linear meters as component of 10 roads; 35 irrigation subprojects
with a total service area of 5,358 hectares; 15 multi-purpose centers; and 11 potable water
systems serving about 3,357 households. These subprojects comprised a total of 1,590
Infrastructure Units (IUs) or 106% of the KPI target of 1,500 IUs. All subprojects implemented
by LGUs were provided with an annual budget for O&M. Completed subprojects were
monitored on an annual basis by the DAR-FAPsO to ensure compliance by the LGUs and ARCs
with O&M standards. Similar to ARCDP1, the project imposed the policy of conversion of the
LGU grant into loan in case the LGU defaulted on its O&M obligation.

22.     Under the Agriculture and Enterprise Development Component, the target KPI of 30%
adoption rate was also achieved. About 54,624 or 45% of 120,598 training participants adopted
project-introduced technologies three years after joining the project, which further increased to
50% (70,849 out of 142,426 training participants by end of the project). The provision of
training with materials, (i.e., starter kits in the form of seeds/planting materials, animals) and
promotion of roll-over procedures for project investments in crops, livestock, poultry and non-
farm enterprises were extensively pursued.

23.      Access of ARCs to financial services was facilitated through the Micro-Finance Solutions
Program and the Agri-Finance Solutions Program through which 100 ARC cooperatives (133%
of target) were able to access financing, and benefited 39,079 clients. In tandem with the PO-
strengthening activities, 188 POs (104% of target) were capacitated to undertake savings
activities. Capital build up funds of POs estimated at PhP30 million at baseline increased by
43% three years after joining the project and 173% by end of the project.

24.     Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance. The World Bank supervision missions have
consistently rated the project’s compliance to environment and social safeguards (on IPs, land
acquisition and rehabilitation of project affected persons, and gender) as satisfactory. At the
onset of implementation, the project adopted and operationalized development frameworks and
procedural guidelines that helped project implementers comply with safeguards. The project’s
financial management activities have complied with the World Bank’s fiduciary requirements
although the project has met various challenges beyond its control since the start of
implementation, including delays in funding releases.

25.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

26.     Change in NG-LGU Cost Sharing. The project was prepared under a cost-sharing
arrangement similar to ARCDP1. However, the GOP’s adoption of the new NG-LGU cost-
sharing policy for ARCDP2, after the project was negotiated and approved by the World Bank
Board and despite the DAR’s repeated requests for reconsideration, increased the equity share of
participating LGUs to 50%-100% of the total cost of infrastructure subprojects (from 10%-30%
under ARCDP1). With the higher equity requirement, LGUs limited the number of subprojects
they could support from an average of 3-5 to only 1-2 subprojects per ARC. The reduced interest
and absorptive capacity of LGUs adversely affected the physical and disbursement performance
of the project’s Rural Infrastructure Component. At mid-term, take-up of subproject grants was
so small that the bulk of the loan allocated for subprojects was still unused. This led to
expansion of project coverage and three extensions of the loan closing date.

                                                                                               38
27.     Change in Fund Management Arrangement. Originally, the ICC and the Bank
approved full project fund management to DAR. However, after loan effectiveness, fund
management for infrastructure subprojects was reverted to MDFO, upon the request of DOF.
Thus, project funds were channeled through two accounts: DOF-MDFO for the loan proceeds
specifically for rural infrastructure and DAR for all other eligible expenses. Financial
management performance of DAR had been consistently satisfactory but delays in release of
funds by MDFO had significantly constrained timely completion of infrastructure subprojects.

28.     The project likewise experienced substantial constraints in funds flow caused by: (a) the
national government operating under a re-enacted budget in 2006 and 2007 which delayed the
flow of government counterpart funds; and (b) exchange rate fluctuations which created a budget
shortfall that particularly affected irrigation subprojects. Funding constraints were mitigated by
DAR providing bridge-financing to the project and the approval of the Additional Financing.
Another challenge faced by the project was adverse weather condition (e.g., typhoons and
drought) which caused suspension of infrastructure works and damages to agricultural
production in many ARCs.

29.      Facilitating factors included: (a) use of community-driven and participatory approaches
in all stages of project implementation, including project sustainability; (b) strong commitment
and participation of ARCs, LGUs and other project stakeholders that helped increase ownership
of project investments and gains; and (c) the project’s strong tie-up and collaboration with
service providers (such as other government agencies, NGOs, and the private business sector)
facilitated the convergence and complementation of various support services accessed by the
ARCs. The DAR has consistently provided strong commitment and support through: (a) close
management and supervision of the project; (b) timely engagement of qualified and competent
staff at the CPO and PPOs; (c) provision of adequate budget support including bridge-financing;
and (d) sustained coordination with the project’s oversight agencies and implementing partners.

30.    Lessons Learned. These included: (a) the revised NG-LGU cost-sharing policy should
have been pilot-tested prior to its formal adoption and institutionalization by concerned
implementing agencies; (b) the establishment of a revolving bridge-fund as a stop-gap measure
for cash-flow related issues is worthy of consideration in other projects where problems with
MDFO processing continue to be a challenge; (c) regular and frequent consultations with project
stakeholders resulted in timely resolution of project-related issues; and (d) adoption of strategies
such as roll-over investment schemes, expanded role of the BIT and the innovative financial
services programs maximized the spread of benefits to more ARC households.

31.      Sustainability. The project had a robust phase-out and sustainability mechanism that
drew on learnings from ARCDP1.             Sustainability mechanisms included turn-over of
infrastructure and O&M to the communities through the IOMGs and LGUs with regular
inspections conducted by DAR and potential conversion of grant to loan if infrastructure is not
maintained. Barangay (village) development plans were integrated in Municipal Development
and Investment Plans to ensure continued budget support for ARCs’ post-project sustainability
activities after project phase out. The capacity-building activities for existing DAR and LGU
staff have increased the likelihood that mainstreamed and follow-on activities would be
supported.
