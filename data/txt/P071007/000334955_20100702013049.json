The\n            recently-concluded implementation review mission (April\n            2010) has confirmed the continued satisfactory\n            implementation progress of the project. Overall physical\n            accomplishment of the original and additional financing loan\n            is reported at 98 percent, with an elapsed time of 96\n            percent, based on the revised closing date of June 30, 2010.\n            The remaining critical activities consist of eleven\n            infrastructure subprojects funded mostly under the US$10\n            million additional financing. Four of these subprojects\n            would not be completed by the closing date of June 30, 2010.\n            This has occurred due to delays in the release of funds from\n            the Central Government which affected implementation of\n            physical works. The extension is necessary to complete the\n            remaining eleven irrigation subprojects. The\n            Government's various implementing organizations have\n            agreed on specific catch-up plans to ensure completion of\n            the subprojects during the extension period. This will be\n            the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
