                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall goal of the project is to reduce rural poverty and enhance the quality of life of the target beneficiaries, comprising primarily of agrarian reform
                         beneficiaries. The objective of the project is to significantly raise household incomes and the quality of life of the people in the targeted Agrarian Reform
                         Communities (ARCs) by improving their productive assets, rural infrastructure and access to key support services.
                         This would cover about 80 new ARCs wherein support would be provided through the following components: (i) community development and capacity
                         building; (ii) rural infrastructure; (iii) agriculture and enterprise development, (iv) ARCs access to financial services; (v) field implementation support; and, (vi)
                         project management, monitoring and evaluation.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There is high likelihood that the project development objective (PDO) would be achieved. As per the data gathered during the November 2010 mission, all the key performance
                         indicators (KPIs) have been accomplished, with the two remaining KPIs expected to be fully achieved by the loan closing date (December 31, 2010). Those that have been achieved
                         include: (i) 21% increase in the average real net household income (target is 20%); (ii) 199% increase in cropping intensity (target is 140%); (iii) 17% increase in main crop yield
                         (target is 15%); (iv) 29% increase in real business assets per household (target is 10%); (v) 69% reduction in travel time (target is 50%); (vi) good quality of infrastructure
                         maintenance (target is "Good" as per the Govt. standards); and (vii) accessed 2,385 services and subprojects outside of the project (target is 848). The two KPIs yet to be fully
                         achieved as of the last mission are: (i) completion of community-based infrastructure (1,491 out of 1,500 infrastructure units); and (ii) percentage improvement in the Peoples'
                         Organizations' organizational maturity level (71% out of 75% target). As of this ISR submission, these have also been achieved.
