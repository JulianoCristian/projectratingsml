outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the cost sharing arrangements\n            among project beneficiaries, Local Government Unit (LGU) and\n            the project had maximized available resources, thus\n            benefiting the greatest number of people. However, the new\n            cost sharing scheme applied in this project was too high for\n            most lower-income LGUs. Development interventions, for these\n            to be effective in improving the income and welfare of the\n            intended client, should involve a holistic and integrated\n            package of assistance. These include investments in capacity\n            building and skills development of target beneficiaries\n            (social capital), technical and financial assistance for\n            livelihood and income enhancement, and infrastructure\n            development. The mix and level of these interventions should\n            depend on the priority needs and capacity of the\n            beneficiaries, including the availability of service institutions."}, "docdt": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
