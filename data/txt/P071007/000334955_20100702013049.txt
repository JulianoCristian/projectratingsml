7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall goal of the project is to reduce rural poverty and enhance the quality of life of the target
beneficiaries, comprising primarily of agrarian reform beneficiaries. The objective of the project is to
significantly raise household incomes and the quality of life of the people in the targeted Agrarian Reform
Communities (ARCs) by improving their productive assets, rural infrastructure and access to key support
services.

This would cover about 80 new ARCs wherein support would be provided through the following
components: (i) community development and capacity building; (ii) rural infrastructure; (iii) agriculture
and enterprise development, (iv) ARCs access to financial services; (v) field implementation support; and,
(vi) project management, monitoring and evaluation.

               ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR THE
 SECOND AGRARIAN REFORM COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                          P071007
                      LOAN NO. 7689-PH

                                   Restructuring Paper


1.     The closing date for Philippines' ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR THE
SECOND AGRARIAN REFORM COMMUNITIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan
No. 7689-PH; P071007) is requested to be extended from June 30, 2010 until December
31, 2010

2.      The recently-concluded Implementation Review Mission (April 2010) has
confirmed the continued satisfactory implementation progress of the project. Overall
physical accomplishment of the original and additional financing loan is reported at 98%,
with an elapsed time of 96%, based on the revised closing date of June 30, 2010. The
targeted outputs under component activities have mostly been achieved, and in some
cases exceeded. The project development objective continued to be relevant and its full
achievement is highly likely given the level of achievement of the key performance
indicators (KPIs), including the benefits and outcomes generated. The mission also notes
the project's continued satisfactory compliance with safeguards and fiduciary policies
and guidelines.

3.      The remaining critical activities consist of 11 infrastructure subprojects funded
mostly under the US$10 million Additional Financing. Four of these subprojects would
not be completed by the closing date of June 30, 2010. This has occurred due to delays in
the release of funds from the Central Government which affected implementation of
physical works. It should be noted that since the loan effectiveness on July 31, 2009, the
project only received its first Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) and Notice of
Cash Allocation (NCA) on December 23, 2009; and corresponding cash on January 11,
2010. In this regard, DAR has submitted to the oversight agencies (DOF and NEDA) a
request for a six-month extension of the loan closing date.

4.      The proposed extension is necessary to complete the remaining 11 irrigation
subprojects. The Government's various implementing organizations have agreed on
specific catch-up plans to ensure completion of the subprojects during the proposed
extension period.

5.     This will be the first extension of the project.
