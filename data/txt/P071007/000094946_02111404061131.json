There are six project components.\n            Component 1 increases active community participation and\n            self-reliance in the planning processes of Agrarian Reform\n            Communities (ARC) and in implementing integrated\n            community-identified priorities. It also builds the capacity\n            of ARC peoples organizations, such as the\n            \"barangay\" implementing team, cooperatives,\n            associations, farmers' groups, women's groups,\n            producer groups, as well as strengthening the capacity of\n            DAR and LGUs to support appropriate development activities.\n            Component 2 provides essential rural infrastructure which\n            contributes directly to sustaining increases in rural\n            incomes of the target beneficiaries based on community\n            demand-driven approach. The infrastructure includes rural\n            roads, bridges, small-scale irrigation, potable water supply\n            systems, post-harvesting facilities, and social buildings.\n            Component 3 provides strategic support services to help\n            generate viable increases in agricultural productivity and\n            diversification. Component 4 comprises capacity building\n            support to cooperatives and micrfinance institutions.\n            Components 5 and 6 provide implementation and project\n            management support, respectively."}, "docdt": "2002-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
