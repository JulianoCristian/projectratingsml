In 2002, about\n            37 percent of the rural population in the Philippines lived\n            below the poverty line. An integral part of the\n            government's strategy for reducing poverty and inequity\n            in land ownership, particularly in rural areas, had been the\n            land reform program implemented through the Comprehensive\n            Agrarian Reform Program. The project funded by World Bank\n            implemented community development and capacity-building\n            activities to ensure active community participation and\n            self-reliance among agrarian reform beneficiaries and\n            organizations. Using a community-driven approach, rural\n            infrastructure was provided based on the prioritized needs\n            of the communities. It included rural roads, bridges,\n            small-scale irrigation, potable water supply systems and\n            post-harvest facilities. Through the assistance of the World\n            Bank, the Philippines boosted agricultural and enterprise\n            productivity by at least 17 percent over the life of the\n            project and had increased the household incomes of\n            smallholder farmers and their families by about 21 percent\n            in 124 communities by improving their access to agriculture\n            and related support services."}, "docdt": "2011-03-30T08:10:05Z"}
