                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER

     A. SUMMARY

1.      The main change proposed under this restructuring is the extension of the credit closing
date by twenty four months, from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2014. There are pending activities
that will take longer than the remaining time to complete. The two major pending activities with
a combined cost estimate of about US$25 million are: (i) construction of Chiawa Bridge, and (ii)
rehabilitation of Link 3 of Lusaka-Chirundu Road. Bids have been received and evaluated for
both contracts. Construction of the bridge is estimated to require 16 months. There is therefore a
need to extend the closing date to enable the completion of these activities. It is also proposed to
take this opportunity to refine the program and project results frameworks (Annex 1), clarifying
indicator definitions, updating values and reconciling any inconsistencies.

B.     PROJECT STATUS

2.     The Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (RRMP) is the first phase in a three-
phase Adaptable Program Loan in support of the Government of the Republic of Zambia’s
ROADSIP II Program. ROADSIP II is financed by government and cooperating partners in the
road sector, including the Bank.

3.     During the period from 2004 to 2010, government funding for the road program grew
from US$29 to US$215 million, averaging US$108 million per year, whilst external funding
from cooperating partners has averaged US$57 million per year. Total disbursement to the sector
by the Bank over the same period under RRMP 1 has been US$61 million against an allocation
of US$90 million.

4.      With about US$48.2 million (96 percent) of the original US$50 million credit already
disbursed, most of the activities under the original project have been completed and significant
impact achieved especially in road sector reforms and rehabilitation of important road
infrastructure. The key pending activities are those introduced through the first and second
additional financing credits, i.e. construction of Chiawa Bridge and rehabilitation of Link 3
section of Lusaka-Chirundu road.

5.      The project objectives continue to be achievable. Project development objective is
currently rated ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ because two sector level outcomes have yet to be fully
achieved, although the Borrower has made significant progress in this regard. Major fluctuations
in annual internal and external funding levels have meant that the domestic funding indicator has
not yet been achieved. The Bank and other donors have expressed their concerns and it is
expected that the indicator will be achieved by the end of FY14. The proportion of the core road
network under routine maintenance stands at 44 percent against a projected amount of 50 percent
in 2012. The Borrower has indicated that the slight shortfall is due to continuing efforts to bring
the roads to routinely maintainable condition by investing in the more costly periodic
maintenance. The explanation by the Borrower is considered acceptable and the proposed time
extension would lead to the achievement of the outcome. The Borrower has increased the budget

                                                 1
allocation to the road sector and is giving greater priority to road maintenance. The proposed two
years extension will also give time for this increased expenditure to be reflected in the project
outcomes, and thereby improve the likelihood that the project will fully achieve its development
objectives.

6.      Progress of the two activities was hindered first by a cost overrun due to market
circumstances and later by reduction of implementation capacity following government’s audit
of the roads sector, both factors being external to the project. Other drainage structures funded
under the first additional financing were completed successfully but Chiawa Bridge was delayed
because of the uncompetitive bids received in May 2009. The second additional financing credit
was therefore prepared to fund the cost overrun for Chiawa Bridge and to rehabilitate link 3
section of Lusaka-Chirundu Road, located in the same general area as Chiawa Bridge. The
preparatory activities (surveys, designs, bid documentation and bidding) for these activities took
place between 2009 and 2011 when the Zambian roads sector was the subject of a major audit.
The audit process took precedence above all other activities within the project implementation
agencies and led to the dismissal of key staff which in turn led to loss of capacity and slowed
down the implementation of the Bank-funded as well as all other activities. By December 30,
2011, bids for the road rehabilitation and bridge construction were ready but could not be cleared
by the Bank for award because the contracts would require 24 months to complete, beyond the
project closing date.

7.     Audit reports of the implementing agencies have been submitted on time and no reports
are overdue. The most recent financial statement identified accountability issues which have
been addressed by the project team and resolved.


C.     PROPOSED CHANGES

8.     The pending road and bridge activities have reached a high state of readiness since
procurement has advanced to bid award stage. Beyond this stage, progress is not likely to be
hindered except by occurrences beyond the control of the contractors. The respective contracts
make provisions for such occurrences. The Borrower has prepared an implementation schedule
(Tables 1 and 2) and it is considered realistic and acceptable. Construction contracts for the two
major works will start immediately once the No Objection is issued by the Bank. Capacity
building activities for road sector institutions and the creation of a road accident data recording
and analysis system will be completed during the extended period.

9.      Based on the above, and as requested by government in its letter Ref. MFAL/102/12/828
of March 29, 2012, it is necessary to extend the project closing date by two years beyond the
current closing date, to June 30, 2014, for successful implementation and full realization of the
objectives of the project. This approach presents the minimum risk.

10.     The proposed extension will also provide an opportunity to refine and update the program
and project result frameworks. The changes to the results framework include clarification of the
indicator definitions, updating of indicator values and resolution of inconsistencies in certain



                                                2
indicators. The contribution that the first phase of the RRMP project will make to the RRMP
project has also been clarified. Full details are given in Annex 1.

11.      The capacity of the key implementation agency, the Road Development Agency (RDA)
is still not sufficiently robust but the Bank and other donors have agreed, and some have indeed
started, to provide capacity building support. The RDA will benefit from coordinated technical
assistance services to be funded by the Bank under the second phase of the project. Other donors
prepared to assist are the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank.
Furthermore, it is proposed that an RDA Technical Assistance Coordination Committee will be
established to plan and coordinate the various technical assistance contracts.

12.      The proposed request for an exceptional extension for the second Additional Financing is
consistent with OP13.20 which stipulates that when implementation of the additional loan
activities is delayed because of a factor that is clearly external to the operation and outside the
control of the borrower or implementing agencies, an extension of the closing date for a period
that is equal to the delay due to the responsible factor may be requested. This proposed extension
of project closing date is also consistent with OP 13.30 and meets the requirements of OP 13.30
(3). Specifically, (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of the
borrower and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and (c) the borrower has
prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the Bank to complete the project.

13.    The extension will be subject to a six-monthly review of compliance with the action plan
in accordance with OP13.30.

D.     EXTENSION OF CLOSING DATE

14.    The closing date for Zambia Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project [Cr. Nos.
3866-ZA, Cr. 38661-ZA, and Cr. 4821-ZM (P071985)] will be extended from June 30, 2012 to
June 30, 2014.

15.      The proposed extension is necessary to enable the Borrower complete the pending
activities which include the construction of a bridge across the river Kafue at Chiawa and the
rehabilitation of the Link 3 section of the Lusaka-Chirundu Road. Bids have been obtained and
are ready to be awarded. An acceptable implementation program has been prepared and the
Borrower is making arrangements to improve the implementation capacity. Measures to ensure
the attainment of these and other indicators in the Results Framework, primarily enhanced
monitoring by the Bank and capacity building under the second phase, will be undertaken.

16.     This will be the fourth extension of the project. In addition to the original project duration
of three years from July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2007, the project closing date has been extended by
five years to June 30, 2012. A one-year extension to June 30, 2008 took place on December 13,
2006, to complete the ongoing activities due to delays in the procurement of civil works. A
further two-year extension to June 30, 2010 was necessary to allow the completion of activities
funded under the first additional financing. The last two year extension to June 30, 2012 was
necessitated by the second additional financing.
