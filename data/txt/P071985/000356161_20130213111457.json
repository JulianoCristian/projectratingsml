This restructuring is the extension of the\n            credit closing date by twenty four months, from June 30,\n            2012 to June 30, 2014. The extension will also provide an\n            opportunity to refine and update the program and project\n            result frameworks. The changes to the results framework\n            include clarification of the indicator definitions, updating\n            of indicator values and resolution of inconsistencies in\n            certain indicators. The extension is necessary to enable the\n            Borrower complete the pending activities which include the\n            construction of a bridge across the river Kafue at Chiawa\n            and the rehabilitation of the link three section of the\n            Lusaka-Chirundu road.

The last two year extension to June 30, 2012\n            was necessitated by the second additional financing."}, "docdt": "2012-04-18T00:00:00Z"}
