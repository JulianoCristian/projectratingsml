                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The credit closing date of the project was extended to June 30, 2014 to enable the completion of outstanding work mainly funded out of the first and the second additional
                         financing. Almost all of the activities planned under the original $50 million credit have been completed and nearly 95% of the credit disbursed. Some of the notable achievements
                         include the rehabilitation of the worst 35 km escarpment section of the trunk road between Lusaka and Chirundu and the creation of a road funding agency, a road management
                         agency and a road safety agency. As a result of the reforms, Zambia is now capable of funding 100% of its routine road maintenance requirements from road user charges.

                         2. With the extension of the credit closing date, award of the pending contracts for Chiawa Bridge and Link 3 of Lusaka Chirundu road will now take place. The agencies have been
                         urged to fast track the process to avoid further delays.
