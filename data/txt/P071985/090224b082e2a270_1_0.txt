1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background

1.      At the time of appraisal, Zambia was just recovering from a period of very poor economic
performance in the years 1991-1998, due to a combination of inadequate national policies, low
international commodity prices, decades of economic turmoil and continuing regional instability.
With an economy heavily dependent on revenues from copper exports, the significant drop of
copper price on world market in the 1980’s had a serious impact on the country. During that period,
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell by an average of 0.2 percent per year, and by 1989, the
debt to GDP ratio was 200 percent, opening a period of hyperinflation and the collapse of the
Zambia currency.

2.      In the 1990’s, with a change of government and the introduction of a multi-party political
system, Zambia implemented a set of structural reforms and improved its economic management
despite serious fiscal and capacity constraints. The country benefited from the Highly Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief program in 2001, resulting in the fall of inflation (from 93
percent in 1991 to 16 percent in 2002), and with the help of increasing copper prices, the country
posted positive real GDP growth again, which averaged five percent per year in 2003 and 2004.

3.      In this context, the objective of the World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) dated
November 1999 was to sustain positive growth rates and show that economic reforms were
beginning to bring tangible, measurable benefits to the population and allowed a reduction of
poverty in the near future. In 2004, around two-thirds of Zambians were still living in poverty, and
50 percent of rural households were living more than twenty five kilometers from a market.

4.      Road transport was identified as a major factor within the Government's overall policy
framework to enhance economic development and growth. Similarly, the World Bank CAS states
that transport would contribute to two of its strategic objectives: (a) removing constraints to
sustainable, diversified growth, improving governance, and (b) increasing access to basic services
and direct poverty interventions.

Sector background

5.      Most of the road network was built in the decade following Independence in 1964, at a
time when Zambia had one of the most prosperous economies in Africa and was classified as a
middle income country. Roads were primarily built to promote national unity and to ensure that
all parts of the country were connected without taking into consideration the economic costs of
such massive investments.




                                                 1
6.      Zambia has one of the highest lengths of road network in Africa per person and per dollar
of GDP 1 and the highest proportion of over-engineered roads 2. At the time of appraisal, the
national network consisted of approximately 37,000 km of gazetted road, with over 20,000 km
classified as trunk, main and district roads, and the balance consisting of feeder (rural district),
urban and parks (tourist) roads. Maintaining such a length of road network proved challenging and
costly - especially following the sharp economic decline that hit the economy prior to and in the
1980’s. Maintenance funding was therefore negligible between the 1970’s and mid 1990’s, which
resulted in a network with 51 percent of main and district roads and 90 percent of feeder roads in
poor condition in 1995 3.

7.      In the early 1990’s the Government eventually took action to address the main backlog of
maintenance, which were due to both institutional and financial inefficiencies. The country signed
up to the World Bank led Road Maintenance Initiative (RMI) in 1994, and introduced a fuel levy
the proceeds of which were earmarked for road maintenance and channeled through a newly
established Road Fund.

8.      The Government drew up the first Road Sector Investment Program (ROADSIP-I)
outlining the rehabilitation and upgrading needs over the period from 1997 to 2007. This planning
tool also helped mobilize much needed support from international donors. Among others, the
World Bank provided support through a US$70.0 million Road Sector Investment Program
Support Project (ROADSIP – 1998 to 2005) that aimed at: (a) reforming the road sector policy
and institutional framework; (b) strengthening the road sector financing; (c) strengthening the local
construction and consulting industry; and (d) addressing the road maintenance and rehabilitation
backlog.

9.      With the support of the World Bank and other Cooperating Partners, the Government
adopted in May 2002 a Transport Policy which committed to pursue, in the road sector, the
following three main strategic objectives: (a) ensuring an effective coordination of the road sector
investment program and the correct prioritization of resources, (b) implementation of policy on
road transport and traffic management and road safety and (c) improving rural access and mobility.
These policy objectives were to be translated in a follow up investment program, ROADSIP II
covering the period 2004 to 2013. The World Bank designed the Road Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project (RRMP) to support the achievement of ROADSIP II objectives.

Rationale for Bank Assistance

10.     Since 1991, the Bank has been successfully engaged in the transport sector in Zambia. It
has supported the Government both through direct sector work and capacity building as well as
provided technical assistance in formulating and implementing institutional and policy reforms
Road Management Initiative (RMI) and Rural Travel and Transport Program (RTTP) and
ROADSIP I.

support for the implementation of the ROADSIP II program. This ICR relates to the work carried
out under APL1 and its two Additional Financings (AF).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

12.      The original PDO as stated in the Development Credit Agreement is to support the
Borrower in implementing the first three years (2004-2007) of the Road Sector Investment
Program (ROADSIP II), including: (a) preserving its public core road network in support of
sustainable economic growth and diversification strategy; (b) development and then maintaining
of institutional capacity for the efficient, equitable and financially sustainable management of the
public road infrastructure and road safety; (c) extension of urban and rural transport infrastructure
and services for increased accessibility; and (d) extension of local community involvement in the
management of selective road infrastructure as well as in prioritization of investments.

13.      The Government and International Development Agency (IDA) agreed to measure the
project performance at the outcome level against the following key performance indicators, which
focus on road improvements and completion of some institutional changes:
 (i) Increase the coverage of core road network under sustainable routine maintenance program.
 (ii) Improve the quality of core road network for paved and unpaved roads.
 (iii) Increase domestic funding for the total road budget.
 (iv) Put in place and operate a system for recording of road accidents.

14.    The key performance indicators at the intermediate outcome level for each component of
the project are detailed in Section F of the data sheet along with a discussion of their
appropriateness in Section 2.3.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

15.     The PDO was amended to reflect the emerging needs at activity level, improve
measurability, and adjust the overall scope of the project. The Second Additional Financing
(AF2) approved on October 14, 2010 amended the PDO on the basis of the need to shorten it “for
improved clarity and measurability”. The number of objectives were indeed reduced from four to
three, as follows: “The objectives of the Project are to support the Recipient in implementing the
Program, including: (a) development of the institutional capacity for sustainable management of
public road infrastructure and road safety; (b) preservation of road assets in targeted transport

                                                  3
corridors; and (c) rehabilitation and construction of targeted transport infrastructure”. It should be
noted that the second objective (b) refers to “targeted corridors” in place of “core public network”,
which reflects the actual scope of activity while the latter included parts of the core road network
over which the Project had no influence. The third revised objective (c) drops reference to
“accessibility and rural transport services, and community transport infrastructures” which could
be seen as a reduction of the scope of the project. However, the addition of PDO level Key Project
Indicators (KPI) on accessibility monitors this impact. The fourth original objective was dropped.
The motivation for the decision has not been fully discussed in the Restructuring Project Paper.

                                      Table 2: Changes to PDOs
                    Original PDO                                      Revised PDO (after AF2)

of sustainable economic growth and diversification        sustainable management of public road
strategy;                                                 infrastructure and road safety
(b) Development and then maintaining                 of   (b) Preservation of road assets in targeted
institutional capacity for the efficient, equitable and   transport corridors
financially sustainable management of the public
road infrastructure and road safety;
(c) Extension of urban and rural transport                Dropped
infrastructure     and     services    for    increased
accessibility;
(d) Extension of local community involvement in the       Dropped
management of selective road infrastructure as well
as in prioritization of investments.
                                                          (c) Rehabilitation and construction of targeted
                                                          transport infrastructure

16.     Outcome level indicators were modified twice. Two outcome level indicators were added
at the time of the First Additional Financing (AF1) on March 29, 2007 to reflect and monitor
progress on the added interventions in the four national parks and on selected river crossings: (a)
Number of visitors accessing the four rehabilitated national parks before and after project
intervention and (b) Proportion of rural population with access to re-instated all-weather river
crossings. At the time of AF2, some targets were adjusted to reflect the new activities added.
Lastly, core indicators were introduced both at the project outcome and intermediate outcome
levels as required by corporate guidelines. See Annex 2 table 2.4 for details of the revisions to
PDO-level indicators and targets.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

17.     The project’s direct beneficiaries were commercial and social road users of the core
road network in the whole country, the local communities, and the supported Agencies. The
benefits of improved road condition through improved rehabilitation and maintenance over the
whole core road network provided better economic and social opportunities (such as access to
markets, health services, education and information). By lowering transport costs, the project was
expected to contribute to a reduction of consumer prices and to an increase in farm gate price for
farmers. The local contracting and consulting industry was able to access contract opportunities,
and provided job opportunities for local residents for road rehabilitation works. Overall, the

                                                     4
improved road safety programs was expected to benefit in particular the poor in both rural and
urban areas, as they constitute the bulk of pedestrians and suffer disproportionately more from
road accidents. Lastly, the project benefited the three recently created public agencies: Road
Development Agency (RDA), National Road Fund Agency (NRFA) and Road Transport and
Safety Agency (RTSA) as well as Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communications
(MTWSC), Ministry of Local Government and Housing (MLGH) and the National Construction
Council (NCC) through technical and management capacity building.

1.5 Original Components

18.   The project was approved by the Board on March 9, 2004 and consisted of four main
components:

Component 1: Civil Works for Road Maintenance, Upgrading and Rehabilitation (US$
283.78 million, IDA Financing US$43.50 million – actual US$75.80 million). This component
was designed to focus on the priority civil works needs for road maintenance and rehabilitation for
the period of 2004-07 within the core road network. The program supported ongoing road
maintenance and rehabilitation works, and included inter-territorial trunk, territorial main, district
roads, primary feeder roads, urban roads, and tourist roads in the country.

Component 2: Engineering and other Technical Services (US$34.98 million, IDA Financing
US$2.00 million – actual US$7.20 million). Technical assistance for carrying out feasibility
studies, engineering design and supervision of maintenance and rehabilitation works for
Component 1 and to provide support to complete the preparatory activities for the next phase.

Component 3: Institutional Development and Capacity Building (US$48.49 million, IDA
Financing US$3.40 million – actual US$5.90 million). Technical assistance and training in the
areas of policy support, implementation support, and institutional development. The strategic focus
of the project was to provide support to the Government in implementation of the Transport Policy
and the new institutional framework including the creation of three new agencies in the road sector.
The main elements of the component included: Policy Support, Implementation Support,
Institutional Development, and Monitoring and Evaluation.

Component 4: Accessibility and Mobility Improvement: (US$13.61 million, IDA Financing
US$1.l0 million – actual US$1.10). This component was aimed at providing continued support
for improving physical access for the poor in order to promote their economic and social
development. The main sub-components included Community Transport Infrastructure (CTI),
Intermediate Means of Transport (IMTs) and Canals and Waterways.

1.6 Revised Components

19.     The project components were not revised but changes were made at the sub-component
level, with some cancellation or addition of activities from the original design as discussed in
section 1.7 below.




                                                  5
1.7 Other significant changes

20.    Restructurings. AF1 (Cr. 38661-ZA) was approved on March 29, 2007 to finance flood
damaged transport infrastructure (selected priority river crossings in the Northern and Luapula
Provinces and in Four National Parks) for an amount of US$25 million and became effective on
August 21, 2007. The Bank’s initial response was to prepare a stand-alone project but this option
was revisited following the Quality Enhancement Review meeting of August 24, 2006 which
advised for the Additional Financing approach given its simplicity, speed of processing and
because the general design and implementation modalities of RRMP would be utilized. AF2 (Cr.
4821-ZM) to finance unanticipated cost overruns associated with the construction of Chiawa
Bridge and to scale up the project by rehabilitation of another road section (Lusaka– Chirundu)
was approved on October 14, 2010, in the amount of US$15 million (of which US$10.0 million
was from the Crisis Response Window and US$5.0 from IDA) and became effective on September
22, 2011. Both of these AFs were approved by the Board of Directors.

21.     Scope and scale. The two AFs mentioned above led to the modification of the scope and
scale of the project. The scope of Component 1 was extended under AF1 to include the
reinstatement, rehabilitation and improvement of about 180 small river crossings in three
Provinces (Northern, Luapula and Copperbelt) and in four National Parks, and the construction of
the Chiawa Bridge on the Kafue River. Following a recommendation at mid-term review (MTR),
two activities were cancelled under AF1: (i) the upgrading of non-core roads because the road re-
classification study had not been launched at the time of MTR, the team deemed impossible to
complete the ensuing work during the project timeframe; (ii) the proposed road safety and
environmental management program under Component 1 was covered under Component 2. Under
the AF2 the scope of the project was extended, to include the rehabilitation of a further 12 km of
Lusaka -Chirundu paved road.

22.     Implementation Schedule. The original project duration of three years from July 1, 2004 to
June 30, 2007, was extended four times, by seven years, total, to June 30, 2014. The credit was
first amended on December 13, 2006, following the MTR to extend the closing date by one year
until June 30, 2008 to complete activities delayed by the procurement of civil works. On April 12,
2007, a second amendment extended the project by two years until June 30, 2010 to allow the
completion of activities funded under AF1. The Credit was amended a third time on May 14, 2010
for a two years extension of activities funded under AF2. This was due to delays in the construction
of the Chiawa Bridge caused by insufficient funding and the uncompetitive bids received in May
2009 for the construction of the bridge. The fourth extension was approved on April 2, 2012, for
two years to allow the completion of Chiawa Bridge and of the 12 km of works on the Lusaka-
Chirundu road.

23.    Implementation arrangements. The project started with the arrangements in place for the
implementation of ROADSIP project, with overall responsibility for coordination and
management of the Project bestowed to the National Roads Board (NRB). When the three new
Agencies were deemed operational in 2006, these responsibilities were transferred to NRFA under
the AF1.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

      (a) Soundness of the background analysis

24.      RRMP built on the achievements of The Road Management Initiative (RMI) in the 1980’s,
the Rural Travel and Transport Program (RTTP) and the Road Sector Investment Program Support
Project (ROADSIP – 1998 to 2005). The ROADSIP project was financed by the Bank and aimed
at: (i) reforming the road sector policy and institutional framework; (ii) strengthening the road
sector financing; (iii) strengthening the local construction and consulting industry; and (iv)
addressing the road maintenance and rehabilitation backlog. RRMP was conceived to support and

                                                      7
improve the outcomes of ROADSIP (the overall outcome was assessed as Satisfactory), by
supporting the establishment of the three newly created Road Agencies, while also continuing the
institutional reform agenda, in particular with regard to the financing of the sector.

25.      Project design was informed by lessons learned from past operations such as the need to
strengthen the local capacity in the construction industry. Under ROADSIP, the poor performance
of the local construction industry had created major delays and resulted in higher than expected
construction costs. As a consequence, RRMP was designed to include support to the National
Construction Council (NCC) to strengthen construction industry capacity. Also, previous
operation reported on the very poor performance of M&E in the road sector, and therefore RRMP
rightly introduced the development of a centralized M&E system for the road sector as a critical
output.

26.    The Quality at Entry Assessment rated the project as Satisfactory. Strategic Relevance and
Approach and Policy and Institutional Aspects were rated Highly Satisfactory, while
Implementation Arrangements were rated Moderately Satisfactory. The excellent collaboration
with other donors was noted as well as the strong commitment from the Borrower (through the
Zambia National Task Force). The review panel highlighted the absence of clear responsibility for
carrying out Monitoring and Evaluation, the fact that the baseline data was not available and that
the implementation and procurement plans were not ready at Board presentation. The QEA rating
seems over estimated and did not take into account the fact that not all PDOs were connected to
outputs directly expected from the project but were rather reflective of national ROADSIP II
program.

     (b) Assessment of the project design

27.     Ambitious and complex project design. The project objectives were ambitious and
targeted too many areas of interventions. As a result the PDO lacked clarity and reflected more a
collection of objectives than a single simple objective to which all project outcomes would
contribute. There was also some disconnect between objectives and activities at the design stage.
For instance, one of the PDO indicator’s aspects “increase coverage of Core Road Network (CRN)
under sustainable routine maintenance” does not relate directly to an activity financed by the
project. Similarly, the project’s theory of change was not robust as it was expected that capacity
building within the road sector agencies would improve rationalization of road investments, and
hence result in redirection of sufficient resources towards the maintenance of the road network in
general.

28.    The choice to finance the operation through an Adaptable Program Lending (APL)
was highly relevant. The project aimed at supporting a 10-years road program (ROADSIP II) and
the APL tool provided the adequate progressive and phased support to the Government program.
One may discuss the design of the Program triggers 4 because only some of them are linked to


4
  The APL triggers for Phase 2 are : (i) the three agencies NRFA, RDA, and RTSA having their own Board of
Directors, comprising private and public sector representatives, are established and fully functional one year before
APL 1 closing; (ii) NRFA is able to meet 40% of total road expenditures incurred on routine and periodic maintenance
and rehabilitation from domestic resources by 2006; (iii) Satisfactory implementation of the road safety plan; (iv) The

                                                          8
outputs resulting from the project activities. As such, most relate to institutional achievements and
less on physical progress on road improvements works, which does not reflect the bias of the
Results Framework toward physical achievement.

29.     The implementation arrangements were not adequate for supporting new
institutions. The project aimed at supporting the setting up of the three agencies (NRFA, RDA
and RTSA) while giving them the responsibility of implementing the project. It would have been
more appropriate to create a separate Project Implementation Unit (PIU) outside of these Agencies,
primarily responsible and accountable for the projects activities, including capacity building in the
three Agencies. At the close of the project, these agencies have not reached the expected
professional standards, and still require ad hoc technical assistance. It has to be admitted also that
saddling the agencies with the implementation responsibility in itself would have instilled a sense
of project ownership and some residual specialized skills.

        (c) Adequacy of Government’s commitment

30.     The Government’s commitment was satisfactory. The Government recognized RRMP
as a critical vehicle for implementing its Transport Strategy, as further defined in the Transport
Policy of May 2002 and the Letter of Sector Policy of December 2003. The design of the project
was discussed and agreed with the Cooperating Partners, through the Donors Forum for the
Transport Sector established in 2000 to facilitate such coordination. The relatively short duration
of the preparation phase - 15 months – between the Concept Review Meeting on December 12,
2002 and the Board Approval on March 9, 2004, illustrates that no major issues arose, thanks to
the commitment from Government.

        (d) Assessment of risks

 31.     The assessment of risk at appraisal was adequate and mitigation measures were
identified. Most risks related to the Government’s commitment to enact and effectively implement
the legislation setting up the three new Road Agencies, the timely release of counterpart funding
for the agreed activities and its overall lack of efficiency and transparency. The mitigation measures
proposed did not prove sufficiently effective to address the risks that indeed became reality during
implementation.

2.2 Implementation

32.    The project was approved on March 9, 2004 and was declared effective on June 15, 2004
after meeting effectiveness conditions.

33.   Major delays were experienced for all activities, both for setting up the institutional
reform and for the procurement and realization of civil works. From the outset, the project
was delayed because some issues from ROADSIP project remained unresolved, in particular

annual administrative costs for all these agencies shall be less than the 5% maximum funding limit of the NRF; and
(v) Satisfactory completion of all preparatory activities for the planned Phase 2 investments.



                                                        9
concerning the management structure for the road sector and the financing of maintenance (Road
Fund issues). As a result, the appointment of Board Directors in the three Implementing Agencies
took much longer than expected and delayed ownership of the project and consequently, the actual
implementation of activities. Engineering designs and bidding documents were not ready at project
effectiveness, due to the lack of in-house capacity at RDA. Additional delays were experienced at
procurement stage, because higher bids than expected were received for Chiawa Bridge for
instance. Lastly, adverse climatic conditions, such as the massive floods in 2006 also contributed
to more delays. These delays, which justified several project closing dates, also provided further
time for the project to achieve or exceed its targets related to civil works.

34.      Audit of the road sector by the Office of the Auditor-General (2009-2010). The
Government of Zambian conducted a major audit of the road sector between February 2009 and
September 2010, following allegations of over commitment of funds. The audit, managed by the
Office of the Auditor-General, revealed serious governance weaknesses that resulted in
misappropriation of resources for Government-funded projects and sub-optimal quality of work.
RRMP funds were not concerned by such mismanagement. Following the Audit, Cooperating
Partners froze assistance to the sector until the findings were made available. A large number of
key staff at RDA, NRFA and RTSA including those assigned to implementation of Bank-funded
activities was dismissed in 2009 and the Agencies were not able to recruit most of the replacement
staff before October 2011. Over this period (2009-2011), the project was impacted by this decrease
in capacity at the level of implementing agencies which resulted in a slowdown of implementation.

35.      To address the issues identified by the Audit, the project supported the adoption,
implementation and monitoring of the Road Sector Governance Plan and of a Financial
Management Improvement Plan. To improve the institutional capacity, and to support project
implementation, the Bank and Government agreed to the recruitment of Technical Assistance in
institutional policy development work, engineering, and procurement under APL Phase 2. In
addition, the incoming Government, in December 2011, implemented further staff dismissals - not
linked to the Audit - from among the remaining staff, directly impacting the implementation
capacity of RDA.

36.     The Mid-Term Review. A mid-term review took place from June 26 to July 14, 2006 and
noted an overall delay of two years within most activities due to challenges on procurement. At
that stage, the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) consultant had just submitted its inception report
on the development of a national M&E framework, two years late. The MTR report also noted
major delays in the release of funds by the Government to support ROADSIP II (amounting to
only six percent of the required commitments per year). The MTR mission recommended the
cancellation of two activities under Component 1. Overall, the MTR was not used as an
opportunity to take major corrective actions to improve project implementation performance with
the hiring of additional technical assistants to implementing agencies and tailored training in
procurement, financial management and monitoring and evaluation.

37.     Restructurings. In total, the project has been through four restructurings, with two AFs
that has also led to changes in the results framework on at the sub-component level. Restructurings
have been used to adjust the scope of activities: (a) to add new activities, such as additional civil
works (river crossings, Chiawa Bridge, and a section of the road link from Lusaka to Chirundu) or

                                                 10
complementary technical assistance (Bridge management Unit); (b) to adjust the result framework
and at the same time reduce the scope of activities (original Objective 3); (c) to extend closing
dates by seven years. Overall restructurings have not been used to increase project efficiency and
improve quality of implementation with sufficient technical and fiduciary support to implementing
agencies.

38.    The activities added under AF1, at the request of GRZ are accountable for major
implementation delays and eventually led to AF2. The Bank initial response to GRZ was to prepare
a stand-alone project but a Quality Enhancement Review held on August 24, 2006 found that an
AF to the ongoing RRMP would be a more efficient, simple and rapid process for the Bank and
GRZ.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

39.     M&E Design: The original design had four PDO level indicators, and nine intermediate
outcome level indicators. Most of them were straightforward and connected to the activities but
two PDOs, “(c) extension of urban and rural transport infrastructure and services for increased
accessibility”; and “(d) extension of local community involvement in the management of selective
road infrastructure as well as in prioritization of investments” were not monitored at the outcome
level. Indeed, the result framework focused on the achievement of civil works and disregarded the
levels of services and accessibility, or community involvement. The latter was also absent at the
output level (this was solved by deleting the PDO through a Restructuring). Overall, the Results
Framework, was well designed to reflect achievements on physical outputs, such as the
improvement of road quality and the construction of IMTs, and the achievement of maintenance
program targets, but could have been refined to better monitor results on the institutional
objectives.

40.     M&E Implementation and Utilization: The original M&E implementation arrangements
were never set up and the interim arrangement became permanent and suboptimal. Under the
original framework, the plan was to have the Ministry of Communications and Transport (MCT)
as the entity responsible for managing the M&E for the whole road sector, while NRFA was
required to provide financial resources for data collection. Since MCT needed time to develop its
M&E system, an interim arrangement was agreed by which each agency would collect data with
their own resources and report to NRFA that would ultimately compile and analyze data. At project
closing, MCT (by then renamed MTWSC) had not developed its M&E system and none of the
Agencies had the appropriate capacity to report qualitative and timely information to NRFA,
despite specific capacity support received from the European Union (EU) in 2007 and from the
Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) from January 2010. It should be noted that
the weakness of M&E in Zambia road sector was flagged as major area of concern in previous
Bank operations, at RRMP Quality Entry Assessment. As such, the absence of an operational M&E
system by the end of project is a significant shortfall for RRMP.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41.    Procurement. At project appraisal, a procurement assessment of the implementing agencies
was carried out showing that procurement capacity had been built in the sector during ROADSIP

                                               11
project and that appropriate arrangements and monitoring existed in all implementing agencies. A
plan to mitigate risks was attached to the PAD. The project included procurement of a mix of large
civil works and numerous smaller contracts and consultancies. Despite a positive assessment at
appraisal, the implementing Agencies were not able to carry out procurement tasks and proved to
be understaffed and without proper capacity/expertise. Delays in procurement were also caused by
the lack of capacity at the level of bidders whom even required assistance from RDA to modify
their bidding documents when requested. The Bank carried out annual post procurement reviews
in order to ensure that acceptable standards were being observed. Despite close monitoring the
Bank team has not been able to improve performance in Implementing Agencies, as additional
training and closer supervision may have been necessary. The procurement ratings in the
Implementation Status reports (ISRs) have varied from Moderately Satisfactory (MS) to
Satisfactory (S) at 2014.

42.     Financial Management. Financial Management policies were complied with. NRB and
later NRFA was the entity responsible of all aspects of financial management including submitting
all financial reporting. Its performance was satisfactory throughout implementation, despite the
absence of an internal audit function. All interim and audit reports were submitted without major
delay, but shortage of lower level accounting staff in 2010 resulted in some delays in the release
of payments to contractors. Consequently, improved staffing was part of the Financial
Management Improvement Action Plan agreed to between the Bank and Government at the time
of preparing AF2.

43.    Environment. The project was rated Environmental Category “B”. The project worked with
the environmental management unit established under ROADSIP project, located in the Roads
Department. The project prepared Environment Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Environment
Management Plans (EMPs) to address the requirement of (OP/BP 4.01) and laid out mitigation
measures for the identified minor environmental issues. The project also prepared and cleared an
Environmental and Social Management Plan.

44.    Social Assessment. All social safeguards documents and instruments were prepared,
reviewed, disclosed and cleared as per Bank’s policies and guidelines. A Resettlement Policy
Framework was also prepared and disclosed before effectiveness in October 2003 as required by
Involuntary Resettlement (OP) (BP 4.12). The project also triggered Natural habitats (OP/BP 4.04)
and Cultural Property (OPN 11.03). A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) of USD 3.5 million was
prepared and implemented for 333 people, out of 57 households affected by the construction of
Mufuchani Bridge. The RAP for Chiawa Bridge included four project affected people whose small
business was relocated.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.     RRMP was designed as a ten-year APL program to be implemented in three consecutive
phases with no overlap. RRMP Phase 2 was approved by the Board on September 2009, 62 months
after the effectiveness of RRMP Phase 1, but 15 months before its AF2, 57 months before APL 1
closing date. RRMP Phase 2 is also facing major delays that required extension of the closing dates
by two years, but latest assessment of the project performance shows that the project will accelerate
implementation as most stumbling blocks have been addressed.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.      The relevance of objectives is substantial. The overall program objective to stimulate
economic growth and contribute to poverty reduction through investment in road infrastructure
and adequate institutional and policy reforms remains highly relevant to the development priorities
of Zambia in 2015. The RRMP project development objectives remain relevant to the second and
third objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy for the Period FY13-16: (ii) Improving
competitiveness and infrastructure for growth and employment; (iii) Improving governance and
strengthening economic management. The backlog of maintenance has not been solved and the
institutional capacity of the Government to manage its core road network needs continuous
technical support.

47.     The relevance of design and implementation is moderate. The complex project design
is reflective of the negotiations between the Government and other Cooperative Partners which
respective policy agenda were not initially aligned. By closing date, the design had been simplified.
Implementation arrangements were not adequate for supporting new institutions. There were too
many Implementing Agencies involved and the project should have devolved responsibilities to
them progressively, rather than from the outset.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Achievement of the original PDOs by the second restructuring in 2007, when PDO
indicators were modified
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Objective 1: Development of adequate institutional capacity for effective, efficient, equitable and
sustainable management of the public road infrastructure and road safety. Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory

48.     The three new Road agencies RDA, NRFA, and RTSA were established in 2005 and
deemed staffed and operational by the end of 2006. However, no activity concerning Road safety
objectives were carried out.




                                                 13
Objective 2: The preservation of the public core network. Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

49.     Two of the three major rehabilitations civil works were ongoing. Positive evolution of the
quality of CRN was reported, with 64 percent of paved and 44 percent unpaved network in good
condition but these results cannot be attributed to the project.

Objective 3: Extension of local community involvement in the management of selected road
infrastructure as well as in prioritization of investments. Rating: Unsatisfactory.

50.     No activities were completed under the project at the time of the second restructuring to
involve local community in the management of local infrastructures.

Objective 4: Extension of urban and rural transport infrastructure and services for increased
accessibility. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

51.     No works were completed at the time of the second restructuring. MLGH appointed a
project coordinator and a proposed program for CTI was under discussion.

3.2.2 Achievement of the PDOs achievement by AF2 / third restructuring in 2010, when the
PDOs were revised
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Objective 1: Development of adequate institutional capacity for effective, efficient, equitable and
sustainable management of the public road infrastructure and road safety.
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

52.    Establishment of three Road Agencies. Completed. The agencies staff low technical
capacity created challenges for implementation, and the dismissal of their Board in 2009 as a
consequence of the Audit of the Road Sector, stalled progress and strengthening of capacity.

53.    Road Safety: RTSA had contracted a consultant for the establishment of an accident
database and was in the process of analyzing Requests of Interest for the construction of Road
Safety School Park and Motor Vehicle Inspection Center.

Objective 2: The preservation of the public core network.
Rating: Satisfactory

54.     Rehabilitation of road section to a maintainable condition. The project’s targets were
exceeded with the proportion of paved roads in good and fair condition increased from 58 percent
to 90 percent and the condition of good and fair unpaved road network increased from 7 percent
to 20 percent. By approval of AF2, Road Fund coverage of the core road network under the routine
maintenance program increased from 19.5 percent to 34 percent and combined internal road budget
increased from 27 percent to 84 percent.

Objective 3: Extension of local community involvement in the management of selected road
infrastructure as well as in prioritization of investments.

                                                14
Rating: Unsatisfactory

55.     Involvement of local authority in the implementation and promotion of basic
infrastructures. This objective derived from recommendation from ROADSIP experience for the
promotion and implementation of IMTs. But the experience was not followed under RRMP as
experience showed that such involvement created major interference in the selection process of
roads, culverts and IMTs, resulting in the disregard of economic and social assessment criteria in
favor of others, like political criteria. Therefore, the Team considered that it was not adequate to
pursue this activity or to try to address the issue and dropped the objective under AF2, many years
after completion of civil works.

Objective 4: Extension of urban and rural transport infrastructure and services for increased
accessibility
Rating: Satisfactory

56.     This objective of the Community Transport Infrastructure program (CTI) was to improve
accessibility to markets and essential services through small scale access improvements. This
objective was fully achieved, although the component remained a pilot in the five districts
(Chibombo, Kalabo, Mpongwe, Sinazongwe and Zambezi) and has not been scaled up as initially
intended per the project design. Despite substantial delays (due to the preparation of contract
packages, challenging mobilization to sites for contractors and heavy rains) and a global variation
order of 120 percent, the project has carried out 15 km of spot improvements, constructed 131
culverts (over 524 m) and rehabilitated one canal (over 1.4 km) by 2010. Traffic counts on three
roads in Chibombo, Mpongwe and Sinazongwe districts show major increase of traffic of 200
percent or more.

3.2.3 Achievement of the revised PDOs achievement by the project closing date in 2014
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Objective 1: Development of the institutional capacity for sustainable management of public road
infrastructure and road safety
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.     Institutional Capacity Building: The Boards of RDA, NRFA, and RTSA were only
reconstituted in 2011. During this period the Agencies were managed by a Chairman without the
check and balance offered by a fully established Board. Overall, capacity of the three road agencies
supported by the project has not been strengthened in a sustainable manner as intended by the
project, although RDA showed notable diligence in its role to supervise the construction of Chiawa
Bridge and rehabilitation works carried out in 2014.

58.     Road Safety Improvement: RTSA has developed the Road Accident Information System
in 2014 but its rolling out was deferred to the second phase of the project. Similarly the project
intended the construction of a mechanized motor vehicle inspection center but this activity did not
take place.




                                                15
59.     High Level Policy Review of the Road Sector Institutional Framework: This activity was
added in 2012 and replaced the intended institutional study and performance review of MTWSC.
The activity was not carried out before project closing and was deferred to the second phase of the
project.

60.    Increase in domestic funding for total road budget: The target of increasing to 66 percent
of domestic funding the road budget was not met but reached 55 percent in 2014 from a level of
27 percent in 2004. It should also be noted that road user revenues have increased from zero in
2004 to about US$100 million in 2014.

Objective 2. Revised as: Preservation of road assets in targeted transport corridors
Rating: Satisfactory

61.    Condition of Chirundu – Lusaka Road. Rehabilitation works, including minor upgrading
works, over the total 134.5 km road were divided in four sections and an escarpment section and
were completed in 2013. The target was exceeded (109 percent) with 89 percent of the road in fair
condition.

Objective 3. Revised as: Rehabilitation and construction of targeted transport infrastructure
Rating: Satisfactory

62.    Construction of selected Priority River Crossings: 103 river crossings were built in
Luapula, Northern, Eastern, North Western and Copperbelt Provinces and four national parks
before AF2.

63.     Construction of Chiawa Bridge (renamed Michael Sata) on the Kafue River. Works started
in June 2012 and were completed in June 2014. The works started with long delays because the
bid prices originally received were too high (US$17.2 million against an expected US$8.7 million).
This required a cancellation of the procurement process, a review of the designs and rebidding at
a revised cost estimate of US$14.7 million. The financing gap of US$6.0 million was financed by
the AF2 in 2010.

Objective 4. Dropped.

Attribution: co-Financiers and external factors.
64.     At the time of project preparation, several other donors in addition to the Bank were keen
to support the ROADSIP II with likely commitments amounting to US$ 141 million, but the
funding architecture had not been finalized. The donors listed in the PAD were: DANIDA, the
European Development Fund, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, Germany (through the
Kreditanstalt Fur Wiederaufbau), the Nordic Development Fund, and the Norwegian Agency for
Development Cooperation. During the implementation, these donors, which later included
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), provided their support to ROADSIP
II and not to RRMP and as such, the financing did not strictly constitute parallel financing. The
CPs met regularly among themselves to discuss transport sector developments and consulted with
government on sector policy issues. In general, the CPs operated with a high degree of
independence from each other.
                                                16
3.3 Efficiency

65.      Efficiency is rated substantial. The PAD included a cost benefit analysis for three main
road sections showing an Economic Rate of Return ranging from 20 percent to 25 percent. All
initial activities were completed by 2009, with reasonable delays. Five additional years were
needed for the completion of new activities added under AF1 in 2007. This ICR calculated
efficiency at completion only and did not run calculation as of AF1 and AF2 due to limited
availability of data.

66.     At completion, the Internal Rate of Return was calculated for 95 percent of project
investment. Overall, the Project achieved higher IRR than expected because the project costs were
lower than estimated for road works and there was no major cost overrun despite major delays.
Second, traffic increased substantially during project implementation and the actual traffic
volumes were much higher than the projections, especially, heavy vehicle traffic. However,
completion of Chiawa Bridge was poorly efficient, with construction costs much higher than
expected. The bridge was completed on June 2014 and traffic was low at the time of the ICR
mission. Because access roads are poor and under rehabilitation, it is expected that traffic volume
will increase in the coming months, once access will be easier. The economic rates of return are
high at 30 percent to 60 percent for road works and at 12 percent for Chiawa Bridge. Regarding
CTI, the main lessons is that following the completion of pilot phase, there was no funding
available for the maintenance of the newly built infrastructure. Therefore, most of the facilities
have deteriorated since 2009.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

-      Poverty Impact. The project did not measure its impact on poverty reduction, but
economic and social baseline survey was conducted in the area supported by CTI component. A
post survey remains to be done. However, most investments are in inter-urban and rural areas,
where literature shows that such investments have general poverty reduction impact on
communities by reducing traveling time, providing opportunities for income generating activities,
and increasing access to agricultural markets for farmers.

-       Gender Impact. In the absence of robust data, it is difficult to confirm if the policy and
strategy of the roads sector provided overall equal opportunities of employment for male and
female workers on road rehabilitation works.

-       Social Development Impact: The project did not measure Social Development Impact.
The roads were improved on existing alignments and did not have any negative impact on human
settlements. However, similar projects in other countries have showed that access to schools,
health centers, village markets, social services is generally increased by improved infrastructures
and supports the development of commercial activities.

HIV/AIDS: The project financed an HIV/AIDS Task Team coordinator within MCT from 2004 to
2006 that conducted sensitizing campaigns for MCT staff based in the provinces. A five-year
program to promote sexual behavior change in the transport sector, promote positive living among
people with HIV/AIDS, and promote appropriate care, support and treatment was developed but
not implemented due to the lack of funding.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

68.     One of the notable, albeit indirect, indicators of the project outcomes is the improved
domestic funding for road maintenance. In 2012, six months before the penultimate project closing
date, NRFA prepared a plan for future operations beyond the project, as required under Section
3.3 of the Development Credit Agreement for the project. According to the plan, Zambia
recognizes the special challenge associated with road maintenance, noting that the annual
requirement for routine and periodic maintenance of the core road network of about 40,000 km
amounted to US$422 million. The fuel levy, one of the road user revenues, was capable of fully
funding the cost of routine maintenance (estimated at US$35 million annually) as well as 31
percent of the periodic maintenance needs. This is a significant step especially in view of the
predictability of routine maintenance funding and the potential to bridge the periodic maintenance
funding gap from increased road user revenues.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
 N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant
69.     The project has revealed several problematic areas with potential risk impact: governance,
low technical capacity, reluctance to prioritize maintenance over construction. The sustainability
of project achievements in the rehabilitation or construction of infrastructures is likely to be
impacted by the relative underperformance of the project in developing institutional capacity for
an efficient and financially sustainable management of the public road infrastructure. Although the
sector has achieved positive results in addressing governance issues, these achievement require
qualified technical staff at the level of road agencies. On a political economy perspective, the
mobilization of funding through the Road Fund is not a guarantee that the Government will
prioritize maintenance over the extension of its road network. In the absence of a revised National
Transport Policy that would clarify that the Government is prioritizing maintenance, the
sustainability risk of Development Outcome remains significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

70.     The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
The Task Team ensured that the development objectives and project scope were consistent with
the Government's PRSP and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and appraised the
project in close coordination with the Borrower and Cooperating Partners. As mentioned before,
the project scope was too broad and the Team may have been over optimistic on the capacity of
the newly created agencies to take on their responsibilities. Lessons from past operations, such as
the poor capacity of local construction industry in applying quality design standards and in
carrying out proper supervision of contractors, the absence of an M&E system, and outstanding
issues on the management structure of the road sector, could have led the Team to focus support
on activities to address these weak areas, and more stringent supervision arrangement from the
outset. In addition, one project objective (increase of funding for the road sector) and one
intermediate indicator (routine maintenance) were not directly linked to project activities. The
results reported are not attributable to the project. At effectiveness, baseline data was not
established and no proper Monitoring and Evaluation system was put in place.

(b) Quality of Supervision

71.     The Bank performance in ensuring quality of supervision is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The Bank supervision was regular through 23 supervision missions and with the
presence in country of the last Task Team Leader from May 2013 until June 2014. Supervision
aide-memoires were relatively extensive but sometimes inconsistent or incomplete in the reporting
of results. It provided highlights on key issues to the client and to Bank management, yet most
often reflecting slippages of activities and unmet deadlines. Regarding works and bidding
processes of works, the Team was available to assist the borrowers but evidence suggests that it
could have been more proactive in detecting the causes for procurement delays, pay more attention
to the review of bidding documents and of engineering designs. The Bank team could have been
strengthened with a governance specialist to help address the numerous and pronged lack of
achievement regarding the institutional targets. Management has commended the team for
persistently and effectively coordinating with other donors and building synergy in transport
investment among stakeholders. It is not obvious if the Bank decision to include further activities
through AF1 instead of a stand-alone project was adequate since major delays are attributable to
these activities. The Bank team should be commended for commissioning Technical audits on civil
works (Priority River crossings, Kafulafuta-Luanshya) to investigate possible shortfalls in
supervision or on design.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

72.    Bank overall performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory consistent with the evaluation
of each section above.



                                                20
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

73.     The Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Government
demonstrated a strong commitment to the project during preparation. This support changed with
the new Government in office in 2011 that led to a shift in the political agenda and to prioritizing
construction over maintenance. CPs have been decreasing their support or opting out of the sector
because of the lack of responsiveness and commitment of the Government to the Maintenance
agenda. In addition, the Government commitment of project counterpart funding was not fully
realized, and not paid on schedule, causing major delays in implementing the Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP), and thus negatively impacting the overall project implementation timetable and costs.
The Government is to be commended for addressing the governance issues identified by the Audit
in 2009. Lastly, the Government managed the coordination of five Implementing Agencies in a
challenging environment.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

74.     Overall performance of the five Implementing Agencies (IAs) is rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory. NRFA, RDA, RTSA have performed poorly in implementing and monitoring
project’s activities and in undertaking procurement of services and works. NRFA, in charge of
coordinating financial management for the project, did not have the capacity to process payments
to contractors in a timely manner, which created delays and serious problems with the projects
suppliers. The Government commissioned an audit of the road sector in 2009 based on assumptions
of mismanagement of resources (but not of Bank’s funds) that led to the suspension of activities
and the need to reappoint IAs Boards. In summary, all IAs were not sufficiently prepared for the
project with weak implementation and coordination capacity and showed a lack of ownership of
the project activities. It is a telling example that as of October 2014, NRFA, MTWSC, RTSA,
RDA and NCC had not formally appointed a Desk officer, yet being recommended by the Bank
since 2009.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

75.     Borrower’s overall performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory consistent with the
evaluation of each section above. Because the rating of the Borrower Performance is in the
satisfactory range, while the rating of Implementing Agencies Performance is in the negative
range, the overall Borrower Performance rating is influenced by the Outcome rating, which is in
the positive range.

6. Lessons Learned

76.    Institutional Reforms: A lesson learned is that establishment of new institutions requires
more time than usually anticipated for transition, which may impact on project progress especially
when the new institutions are set to become implementing agencies. Such implementation
arrangements are probably overly ambitious in countries with overall weak institutions and
implementation capacity. It is preferable to use or create a PIU whose role is to implement all

                                                21
activities, or to coordinate IAs. PIU staff are generally accessible to IAs staff and this collaboration
would be key in transferring knowledge.

77.     Human Resource Capacity. Projects should rely on IAs’ internal expertise or when not
available, offer training to develop it, instead of recruiting external consultant to do their job. It
could have been more appropriate to monitor the capacity of the supported agencies to carry out
the tasks that were expected from them under the project, such as preparing detailed engineering
designs for roads, and undertaking bidding processes without contracting external consultants.

78.     Use the Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument as a tool for deepening
reforms: This instrument offered the appropriate flexibility and long-term engagement to support
the implementation of a sectoral policy over a decade. It has since been replaced by the Series of
Project instrument which offers similar advantages. In this project, the Phases should not have
been designed to run in parallel, and should have been consecutive, to avoid both IAs and Bank
team, focusing too much time on preparing the follow on operation rather than addressing current
challenges, and to allow the learning of lessons from one phase to the next. It would have been
appropriate with this project, to focus this first phase (2-3 years) of the project, to focus on creating
capacity in the new Agencies and ensuring coordination amongst them, and having strong
processes for works prioritization and capacity to manage complex bidding process, while
launching small civil works. The second and third phases would later launch more complex and
large rehabilitation and maintenance works.

79.     Use of Additional Financing in place of stand-alone project. In this case, the project
duration and overall efficiency has been affected by the activities added through AF1. While the
additional activities and the AF1 were warranted, the capacity of IAs to undertake additional
activities was not fully assessed. . It may have been more appropriate to initiate a stand-alone
emergency project so as to forestall delays under the original project. This option provides
flexibility to respond to the Government’s request without delays, and does not create additional
burden on ongoing operations.

80.    Monitoring and Evaluation: M&E should be given the appropriate attention by IAs and
the Bank team to inform decisions and corrective actions. Under an APL, a clear distinction should
be made between the triggers and intermediary Key Project Indicators.

81.     Role for the Bank in the road sector. This project shows that the Government has been
able to mobilize significant funding for maintenance of CRN but, because of a lack of appropriate
controls and oversight, the Government is not allocating sufficient funds to road maintenance.
Having a well-funded Road Fund does not of necessity guarantee proper use of the resources. More
robust economic analysis and rationalization needs to be applied in decision making. Therefore,
as the Government has increased its funding to new road construction during project life, the Bank
could focus on supporting institutional reforms to ensure that investment decisions are
underpinned by robust economic analysis.

82.   Lack of foreign competition to the local road Engineering, Procurement and
Construction companies (EPCs) in Zambia. An overly protective legislation in the country,


                                                   22
limiting access to foreign road EPCs, does not incentivize local EPCs to increase their standard
and capacity. This results in poor designs and weak implementation capacity of roads project.

83.    Social and poverty reduction impacts should be measured more systematically. Future
operations should be more focused on poverty reduction.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

84.    Bank’s draft ICR was shared with the Borrower on March 31, 2015. No comments were
received by the time the ICR was finalized.

85.      The following recommendations were made in the Borrower’s ICR: The Borrower
recommended that the implementation of Mobility Improvement projects be decentralised to
district councils as opposed to the centralised approach of CTI, assuming that local community are
best placed to take local decisions.

86.    The Borrower noted that the lack of clear lines of responsibilities between Agencies created
confusion and delays. The ROADSIP Steering Committee was ineffective in driving project
implementation. The protracted absence of Desk Officer also negatively affected implementation
as did the lack of project management and contract management capacity building. It was
recommended to establish Project Technical Working Groups comprising all the implementing
agencies to deal with matters pertaining to technical issues of project implementation.

                            Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The project was composed of various investment components. At appraisal, economic
analysis was conducted focusing on major road rehabilitation components: (i) Chingola-
Kasumbalesa, (ii) Kafulafuta-Luanshya, (iii) Lusaka-Chirundu Escarpment, and (iv) Lusaka-
Chirundu Link 3. Under the Additional Financing, economic assessment was also conducted to
evaluate (v) the Chiawa Bridge, a large bridge construction work across the Kafue River. These
five investments amounted to US$66 million or three-quarters of the actual total project cost.

2.       The Project also supported other small interventions, such as spot road improvements in
rural areas and construction and reconstruction of small bridges and culverts under the Community
Transport Infrastructure (CTI) component. Conventional cost benefit analysis is generally not
appropriate to evaluate low-volume rural roads. 5 According to the appraisal document, instead, a
multi-criteria assessment was used to select priority interventions in each district and province.
Though, there is little documentation on how to actually do this in the relevant documents.
According to a baseline survey of the impact evaluation conducted in the CTI areas, the traffic
levels are indeed much low at about 200 per day. In addition, half of which were non-motorized
traffic, such as pedestrians, bicycles, and ox carts. Thus, the current analysis excludes these rural,
small interventions and focuses on the above-mentioned major road rehabilitation and bridge
investments.

3.      In ex post project economic analysis, ideally, the same methodologies and assumptions
should be used to re-evaluate efficiency after the intervention. Unfortunately, however, the
evaluation methods used at the appraisal stage were neither maintained nor well documented. In
addition, the monitoring framework of the Project was not linked well to the project evaluation.
For some project locations, no systematic traffic counts were made after the Project, although the
country owns a nationwide network of traffic count stations. Therefore, the current analysis
replicates the similar evaluation models, updating underlying parameters and traffic data to an
extent possible.

4.      For the first four road rehabilitation components, Highway Design Model 4 (HDM4) was
used at appraisal. The model was rerun with updated traffic data and vehicle operating costs. For
the Chiawa Bridge construction, more static cost-benefit analysis was conducted to compare time
savings of passengers, eliminated costs of an operating pontoon, and investment cost of the bridge.
See the following section for more details.

5.     The summary of the results is shown in Table 3.1. The first three road rehabilitation
components achieved higher efficiency than expected. This is partly because the project costs were
lower than estimated. There was no major cost overrun despite some project delays in some
components. It is also because traffic was increased substantially. The actual traffic volumes were
much greater than the projections. Especially, heavy vehicle traffic has been increasing rapidly
along the project corridors. As a result, the economic rates of return are high at 30 percent to 60
percent. For the Chiawa Bridge component, the traffic was increased dramatically, because people
now have 24-hour access to cross the river. However, the project costs nearly doubled compared

threshold.

Chingola-Kasumbalesa
6.     Background. The T3 road from Chingola to Kasumbalesa, a border crossing to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is a vital route for the Copperbelt Province to be connected
to the mining towns of Chingola and Chiliabombwe to Kasumbalesa. There was a significant
amount of traffic on this road with a large number of heavy goods vehicles, making a riding surface
extremely rough and causing severe traffic congestion at the Kasumbalesa border post. The project
aimed at rehabilitating this road segment with 40.48 km length and strengthening shoulders.

7.     The civil work was awarded in February 2005 and started in the following month. The
work was completed in November 2007, four months before the original schedule. The project
cost was reduced from an original contract amount of US$10.7 million to a final payment of
US$9.8 million, because of various price adjustments.

8.      After the work was completed, the traffic volume increased substantially along the road.
Before the project, the average traffic was 1,694 vehicles in 2002. Unfortunately, no traffic count
was made immediately after the project completion. A more recent traffic count in 2013 indicates
daily traffic increased to 4,468, suggesting an average annual growth rate of 9.2 percent for the
past ten year.

9.       Evaluation. The HDM4 model is applied for the period of 2005 to 2025, using this actual
traffic growth up to 2013 and a constant growth rate of 5 percent for the rest of the period, a more
conservative assumption. Vehicle operating costs are adjusted to the year of 2005, using historical
national data on fuel prices, per capita income, and consumer price index (Table 3.2). The project
work was implemented in the first two years.

10.    The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 33.1 percent, which is higher than
estimated at appraisal (see Table 3.1 above). The main reason is that the traffic increased more
than expected. The growth rates vary from 3 percent to 40 percent per annum, depending on type

of vehicle. Heavy trailers and trucks grew particularly, because the project road serves mining
activities in the region. This contributes to boosting economic benefits from improved road
conditions by the Project.

Kafulafuta-Luanshya
11.     Background. The M6 is a bituminized trunk road, commencing north of Kafulafuta on the
T3 and heading in a northwesterly direction for 32 km before turning south-west to Luanshya. The
total length is 43.4 km. Together with the T3, it is among the most important strategic road
networks in the Copperbelt Province. It connects not only domestic but also international
commercial centers, especially to DRC and to Lusaka, South Africa and Zimbabwe.

12.    At the appraisal stage, the road condition was not so bad with International Roughness
Index (IRI) measured at 2.1 to 2.7. But with anticipation that the traffic would increase and the
road condition would deteriorate rapidly, the Project aimed at rehabilitating the road with
pavement repairs and asphalt overlay. The traffic volume was actually increased significantly from
3,031 to 4,085 after the project.

13.     The work was awarded in October 2005 and completed on time by April 2007. The contract
amount was US$7.3 million, including supervision costs. There was a small amount of cost
overrun, about two percent of the contract amount. The total cost was still far below the original
cost estimate, which was US$9 million.

14.     Evaluation. The HDM4 model is applied for a 20 years project life from 2006 to 2026.
The actual traffic growth is used for 2006, and a constant growth rate of five percent is assumed
for the rest of the period. The project work was implemented in the first two years. Similarly to
Table 3.2, vehicle-operating costs are adjusted to the year of the project based on historical fuel
price, income and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.


                                                                 35
15.     The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 63 percent, which is significantly higher
than the original estimate. This is partly because of the nature of the work, which is a rehabilitation
of the road segment that had been relatively well maintained even before the Project. Thus, the
project cost was relatively low on a unit basis. Another reason is that the traffic on the road
increased significantly once the work was completed. The annual average growth rate was 12.8
percent in 2006. The proportion of heavy vehicles increased tremendously, because of the
expansion of the Copper Mines as well as the decommissioning of rail operations between Ndola
and Luanshya in 2006. At a 32 km point of this road segment, the share of heavy trailers and trucks
increased from 9.2 percent in 2003 to 28.4 percent in 2006. This contributed to boosting economic
benefits from the Project.

Lusaka-Chirundu Escarpment

16.    Background. The Lusaka-Chirundu road (135 km in total) forms part of the southern
portion of the T2 that originates at the southern end of the Lusaka and ends at the border post of
Chirundu. This is an important road link connecting Zambia to the south, including Zimbabwe,
Mozambique and South Africa. In recent years, traffic has grown very rapidly. The traffic
increased for 50 percent for the period of 2003-2008 at a growth rate of about 10 percent per
annum.

17.      Before the Project, the riding quality of Escarpment section (75 km to 109 km) was
particularly poor. IRI deteriorated by more than 20 percent from 2003 to 2008. The original design
retained the existing vertical and horizontal alignment. Following a design review, however, the
mountainous sections of the road were decided to be realigned to improve the horizontal and
vertical alignment. This escarpment section has a length of 34.7 km, spanning across mountainous
terrain.

18.     The appraisal document indicates that the IRR is 21.7 percent. But there is no detailed
information on how to calculate it. In 2007, the work design was reviewed to ensure physical
appropriateness of the road alignment and cost effectiveness of the proposed work. According to
the final design report, the traffic level was 907 vehicles in 2008. The cost of the work was
estimated at US$17.5 million. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) was reevaluated at 5.5-5.8
percent, depending on section.

19.    The civil work was awarded in March 2006, but the implementation was significantly
delayed due to the review of the design, as mentioned above. The design was approved in
September 2007. The revised completion date was set at the end of February, 2008. However, the
progress was generally slow due to unfavorable weather condition, particularly, extremely wet
weather in November and December, 2007. The work was completed in June, 2008, with a 4
months delay. However, the project cost was not changed. The final project cost was US$8.03
million with a supervision cost of about US$1 million included.

20.      Evaluation. The HDM4 model is applied for the period of 2008 to 2028, using the actual
traffic growth up to 2013 and a constant growth rate of five percent for the rest of the period. It is
assumed that the project work was implemented in the first year, given the significant delay



                                                  36
experienced. Based on historical national data on fuel prices, per capita income and CPI, vehicle
operating costs were adjusted to the year of the project.

21.     The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 29.8 percent, which is higher than the
revised estimate. The actual traffic level turned out larger than the estimate. More importantly, the
actual project cost was much lower than estimated. This contributes significantly raising the
economic rate of return.

Lusaka-Chirundu Link 3

22.    Background. The Link 3 is on the same Lusaka-Chirundu corridor as the above
Escarpment Section. According to the work design was reviewed to ensure physical
appropriateness of the road alignment and cost effectiveness of the proposed work. According to
the 2007 detailed design final report, the traffic level was 1,343 vehicles on Link 3. The cost of
the work was estimated at US$17.8 million. The IRR was reevaluated at 6.3-10.8 percent,
depending on section.

23.     Evaluation. As in the case of Escarpment Section, HDM4 was rerun for the period of 2014
to 2034, using the latest available traffic data in 2014. The data provided by RDA indicates that
the current traffic volume is much lower than the level before the project in 2007. This may be
affected by possible methodological differences in traffic counting, such as location and
seasonality. However, given this low level of traffic, HDM4 generates a negative rate of return.
This is considered to be caused by multiple factors: lower-than-expected traffic, relatively good
road condition even before the project, and relatively high project costs per kilometer, though the
project cost was still much lower than estimated.

Chiawa Bridge

24.     Background. The Chiawa Bridge was recognized as a priority link to improve transport
connectivity across the Kafue River not only for tourism and agricultural development but also to
improve people’s amenities. Before the Project, a pontoon existed, which was in fair condition and
was operated fairly efficiently. However, its limited working hours and frequent breakdowns
crucially constrained local mobility of people and freights.

25.     The appraisal document indicates that the economic rate of return is 15.4 percent. However,
there is little discussion on the applied methodology and assumptions. A detailed cost benefit
analysis report was prepared in 2010, which updated the original analysis. This shows that the cost
of operating a pontoon could be saved, which amounted to US$578,000 per annum. The traffic
level observed before the Project was relatively low at 36 motorcycles and vehicles. A time cost
of about US$40,000 could be saved per year. More economic benefits were expected from induced
growth in the agriculture and tourism sectors. It was assumed that the Project could increase
agricultural production by 10,000 to 30,000 tons along the project areas. As a result, the IRR was
estimated at 10.9 percent.

26.    The work was awarded in July 2012, with work duration of 15 months. However, the work
was delayed for about five months, due to the late start of the work. In May 2014, a 140 m long

                                                 37
bridge was completed with two approach roads each 800 m long, totaling 1,600 m. The actual
project cost was about US$11.1 million.

27.     Evaluation. Using the latest traffic count at the bridge in 2015, the same cost benefit
analysis framework was applied. Other parameters, such as vehicle operating costs and time values
of passengers and freights, are assumed unchanged. The IRR is estimated at 12.1 percent, which
is lower than expected. This was largely attributed to a significant increase in project costs from
US$6 million to US$11.1 million, more than offsetting more-than-expected traffic growth over the
bridge.

Component 1: Civil Works

Periodic Maintenance: periodic maintenance under the project was carried on the Lusaka to
Kabwe Road and some minor works under Community Transport Infrastructure (CTI) (RAMP) in
the five districts, Chibombo, Kalabo, Mpongwe, Sinazongwe and Zambezi.

The amount of roads under periodic maintenance was as shown in Table 5.1 below.

                               Table 5.1: Periodic Maintenance

Note: * Planned (Source: RRMP I Mid-term Review)

The amount of road under periodic maintenance was higher than the target at the beginning but
had started reducing as more roads were placed under routine maintenance.

Rehabilitation: rehabilitation works were carried out on the following roads:
         (i) Chingola – Kasumbalesa; the rehabilitation works covered a total length of
   40.5km. The works contract was awarded to China Henan International Corporation Company
   Limited (CHICO) of China with a commencement of March 18, 2005.
        (ii) Lusaka – Chirundu; the rehabilitation works covered a total length of 53 km
   comprising the escarpment section and Link 3 (55 km to 100 km).
       (iii) Kafulafuta – Luanshya; the rehabilitation works covered a total length of 45.36
   km and was jointly financed by the WB and OPEC, through parallel financing. The OPEC
   financed the section of road from Kafulafuta to km7 while IDA financed the section from km7
   to Luanshya.

The works were handed over on April 20, 2007 two weeks ahead of schedule. An evaluation by
the engineer of the road condition after completion found the riding quality to be good.

Upgrading: No major upgrading works were undertaken under RRMP I except for some partial
upgrades that were undertaken on the Lusaka – Chirundu Road escarpment section to provide
passing lanes in some sections.

Construction of Chiawa Bridge: the construction of Chiawa Bridge, (renamed Michael Sata
Bridge), on the Kafue River, see Figure 1, was one of the last major works to be undertaken. The
start of the works was delayed due to the high bid prices originally received. Consequently
government had to request for additional funding for the works. The works were completed in June
2014.




                                              41
Construction of Selected Priority River Crossings: a total of 103 selected priority river
crossings in Luapula, Northern, Eastern, North Western and Copperbelt provinces and four game
parks which were washed away by rains were constructed.

Road Safety Improvement: the activities under this component were to strengthen Road
Transport and Safety Agency (RTSA) through the procurement of various requirements for traffic
law enforcement and capacity building in road safety management through the development,
installation and roll out of an Accident Database Management System and a mechanized motor
vehicle inspection center.

Component 2: Engineering and Technical Services:

The focus of this component was to provide technical assistance for carrying out feasibility studies,
engineering design and supervision of maintenance and rehabilitation works for Component 1 and
to provide support to complete the preparatory activities for the next phase.
Achievement: A total of 13 consultancy contracts were entered into for undertaking feasibility
studies, engineering design and the supervision of maintenance and rehabilitation works.
The consultancies were all effectively executed. However, the provision for Feasibility study for
establishment of a construction Materials Centre was reallocated to the supply and delivery of
laboratory equipment for the civil engineering department at the University of Zambia.

Component 3: Institutional Development and Capacity Building:

Policy support: the implementation of the government Transport Policy resulted in the
establishment of the three implementing agencies, NRFA, RDA and RTSA. While the three newly
created agencies have been performing satisfactorily technically, it was noted that the Boards of
Directors have not been in place consistently to provide policy guidelines and operational
oversight. Another challenge faced is the scope of work and overlaps between Road Development
Agency (RDA) and Ministry of Local Government and Housing (MLGH). The problem emanates
from the appointment of councils as Road Authorities and their reporting channels. In order to try
and overcome the conflict, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between MLGH
and Ministry of Transport, Works, Supply and Communications (MTWSC) for RDA to try and
manage the problem. Adherence to the terms of the MoU was not satisfactory.

Implementation Support: two consultancies were undertaken under this component, namely:
        (i) Design and supervision of the Resettlement Action Plan for Mufuchani; and
       (ii) Baseline Study for Poverty Impact Assessment.

Institutional and Capacity Development: A total of 50 staff underwent training in various fields
relevant to the operations of the implementing agencies. However, there seems to have been
difficulties in the coordination of this activity as not all the agencies had their staff trained. The
training undertaken included:
              • Management of Public Transportation;
              • Monitoring and Evaluation, design and Implementation;
              • Project Procurement of Works, Goods and Consultancy; and
              • Goods and Equipment procurement.

NCC: Consultancy Services for the Redesigning of the NCC Website: the redesigned website
was accepted in September 2013 and launched in December 2013. The redesigned website has
enabled NCC to improve service delivery through online registration of contractors. Further,
stakeholders are able to obtain necessary information from the website.

NCC: Consultancy Services to develop a Business Plan: after a protracted process NRFA
developed a strategic plan using its own resources. The strategic plan was used a basis for the
development of a Business Plan. However, due to the lapse of time the operationalization of the
Business Plan was carried forward to APL II. The development of the Business Case will give the
NCC and the construction sector in general a clear direction on how the sector can grow and be
more efficient and effective.

NCC: Consultancy Services to Develop Unit Rates: the consultancy to develop Unit Rates was
successfully completed, albeit late. The training of the users in the use of the software is to take
place under APL II. The unit rates will be particularly important in adjudicating bids

Monitoring and Evaluation: The M & E Unit under the MTWSC was established in 2010 as a
sector wide M & E Unit and has since undertaken a needs assessment.
There was no Monitoring and Evaluation Reports based on the Project M & E Framework. It was
reported that the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit under MTWSC had challenges collecting data
from the implementing agencies as the Unit had no system of collecting the data.
Both NRFA and RDA have M & E Units which have been undertaking monitoring and evaluation
of the various projects being executed but have not used the Project M & E Framework.

Component 4: Accessibility and Mobility Improvement

Community Transport Infrastructure (CTI): The contracts for consulting services to undertake
condition survey, the design of the interventions and the supervision of the civil works were signed
in May 2008. The works contracts were signed and the actual works commenced in October 2009.
The civil works involved accessibility improvement (spot improvement) of community roads and
construction of footbridges and culverts. The other component of CTI was clearing of canals and
waterways in Kalabo District.

This component commenced almost four years after Project effectiveness. The delay in the
commencement of activities has been attributed to a number of factors. These included; (a) delay
due to time taken to decide who would implement the project activities. The MLGH had initially
wanted to implement the activities, including design, but the WB insisted on the use of consultant,
and (b) inadequate institutional arrangements within MLGH in that the project activities were not
regarded as part and parcel of the main activities of the Ministry.

As a result of the delay, the original scope of the component was drastically reduced to a pilot
project in five districts. The component has remained a pilot in the same districts.
While the PAD stated that one of the objectives of the project was enhancing the local capacity,
the district councils were not involved in the procurement of the consultants and contractors. As a



                                                43
result, it is reported that the district councils felt left out and did not regard the projects as their
own and consequently not providing for the maintenance of the infrastructure.
The project did not provide funding to councils for the maintenance of the newly constructed
infrastructure. As a result, most of the facilities have deteriorated since their construction. Tables
5.2 and 5.3 below show the state of some of the roads at the time of this report.


Traffic Count and Transport Study
A Traffic Count and Transport Study undertaken by the Consultant on three roads in three districts
as part of this report showed that the generally the average traffic had significantly increased as
shown in Table 5.2 below.

Assessment of Bank Performance


Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Bank performance is rated as satisfactory in ensuring quality at entry. The Bank spent sufficient
resources on project preparation, with most of the preparation done in 2002 and 2003.The first
identification mission took place much earlier, but it took much time to reach agreement and move
from a first identification mission to full preparation. During preparation, the Bank team clearly
identified the sectoral issues and ensured that the works proposed in the approach adopted were
closely aligned with GRZ objectives and the CAS. Further, the design took into consideration the
positive achievements of ROADSIP I.

Quality of Supervision

Quality of Bank supervision is rated as satisfactory. The Bank provided a total of 23 full
supervision missions during project implementation. These missions were timely and did not shy
away from addressing issues that arose during the realization of a project of the type that was
relatively new to the country at that time. The missions reacted proactively to identify issues and
problems that could have jeopardized the achievement of the PDOs or could have resulted in both
cost overruns and substandard end products. The aide memoires prepared at the end of each
mission were informative and clear, as well as identified the issues that needed to be addressed
before the next mission.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. Bank performance was satisfactory at all stages
from project preparation through supervision.


Assessment of Borrower Performance


Government Performance
Government performance is rated as satisfactory. Government implemented the necessary policy
and the necessary legislation for the establishment of the three agencies, namely NRFA, RDA and
RTSA, which were critical to the implementation of the project. Further government throughout
the implementation showed commitment to the project objectives by allocating increased funding
for routine maintenance and periodic maintenance of CRN. The Steering Committee and the
Committee of Permanent secretaries were always available to discuss important issues during
supervision missions and had provided sufficient resources for these missions.

Implementing Agencies Performance
The performance of the implementing agencies is rated as moderately satisfactory. Most
implementing agencies did not have staff dedicated to the implementation of project activities and

                                                45
therefore project activities were additional to their responsibilities. This caused challenges in
decision making and timely implementation of activities. The staff assigned showed dedication to
the implementation of the project but the requirements of their jobs, performance of which is
evaluated made it difficult for them to be available at all times.


Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
The overall performance of the Borrower is rated as moderately satisfactory.

Lessons learned
Mobility Improvement: this component commenced about two years behind schedule. The
Consultant noted that a similar project under MLGH, Community Access Improvement Project
(CAIP) was able to undertake 461 projects in 14 districts during a similar period, i.e., from January
2010 to November 2013. The major difference was that the CAIP works were decentralised to
district councils as opposed to the centralised approach of CTI. It is evident that such small work
which has a great impact on communities, are best implemented through a decentralised approach.

Project Coordination: The use of the ROADSIP Steering Committee for the project was well
intentioned but had challenges in driving project implementation.

Project Management: there were lapses in project and contract management as could be evidenced
on the Chingola – Kasumbalesa Road where variation orders were executed without obtaining due
authority.

Desk Officers: There were no dedicated offices in some of the implementing agencies for the
implementation of the project.

Recommendations
Mobility Improvement: it is recommended that the implementation of these projects be
decentralised to district councils as opposed to the centralised approach of CTI. It is evident that
such small work which has a great impact on communities, are best implemented through a
decentralised approach.

Project Coordination: there is need to improve coordination and draw clear lines as to who is
responsible for what action. This will allow for better follow up on issues and avoid lapses. The
use of the ROADSIP Steering Committee for the project was well intentioned but seems to have
been ineffective in driving project implementation.

Project Management: there is a need to provide capacity building in project and contract
management.

Desk Officers: There is need to have dedicated offices in each of the implementing agencies for
the implementation of the project.



                                                 46
Project Technical Working Groups: There is need to establish Project Technical Working Groups
comprising all the implementing agencies to deal with matters pertaining to technical issues of
project implementation.
