In this project FYR Macedonia seeks two development\n            objectives: to reduce non-tariff costs to trade and\n            transport; and to prevent smuggling and corruption at border\n            crossings. There are five project components. The first\n            improves customs procedures, assists streamline operations\n            at three border posts and one inland terminal on a pilot\n            basis; provides customs training in new procedures, and\n            trains for agency awareness and cooperation; and\n            restructures the customs administration. The second\n            component provides technical assistance and advisory\n            services to trade and international transport participants\n            through the European chamber; improves communication between\n            border control agencies and trading community by using a\n            virtual forum; and supplies equipment. The third component\n            improves information system, provides personnel training,\n            and stimulates regional and inter-agency cooperation. The\n            fourth component improves border crossing facilities. The\n            fifth component includes the services to support program implementation."}, "docdt": "2000-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
