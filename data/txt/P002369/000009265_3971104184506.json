 vast majority of the undeserved and vulnerable groups in\n            urban and rural settings; and c) contribute to fertility\n            decline and reduce the high population growth rate by\n            improving the management and delivery of reproductive health\n            services. The credit will support a broad sector expenditure\n            program to cover an initial five year period of\n            Senegal's ten year National Health Development Plan.\n            This plan will consist of: a) the reform program; b)\n            improved access to and quality of public health services; c)\n            improvements in the management and delivery of reproductive\n            and child health (RCH) programs; d) strengthening the MPHSA\n            (Ministere de la Sante Publique et de l'Action Sociale)\n            institutional capacity; e) reorganization and reinforcement\n            of epidemiological surveillance; and f) improvement of the\n            quality of life of deprived families and vulnerable social groups."}, "docdt": "1997-08-08T00:00:00Z"}
