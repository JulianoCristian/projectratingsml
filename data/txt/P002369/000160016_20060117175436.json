The current\n            auditing process - in which the government prepares the\n            terms of reference and chooses the auditor - is not fully\n            satisfactory. The audit is not as in-depth as with a more\n            independently chosen auditor. In the terms of reference, the\n            audit should not only certify the accounts but also conduct\n            an economic analysis of prices paid and the relevance of\n            using goods and services procured under the project. The\n            periodic Statement of Expenditures reviews are not\n            sufficient to track all misuses of funds. This approach may\n            add costs to implementing a project, but is important in\n            order to ensure better governance, reduce corruption, and\n            get the best value for money spent."}, "docdt": "2005-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
