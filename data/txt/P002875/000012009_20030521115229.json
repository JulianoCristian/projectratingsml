      developments substantial. Lessons convey the following. By\n            and large, within Africa, a Road Fund, financed from user\n            fees is an important way to ensure the availability of funds\n            for maintenance. In this case, even when the government\n            lacked budgetary resources, the Road Fund continued to be\n            funded. However, mobilizing local counterpart funding in\n            rural areas for road maintenance is difficult, where the\n            overhead costs for community mobilization (fees to NGOs) are\n            high and are likely to make replicability difficult.\n            Therefore, additional means of financing rural road\n            maintenance should be considered. Moreover, when a Road Fund\n            is introduced, the responsibility of each agency should be\n            clearly outlined in order to avoid potential disagreements.\n            Whereas the Road Fund did provide funds for civil works,\n            conflicts arose concerning how the funds should be managed,\n            and which agency should contract the work.  In addition,\n            small and medium contractors (PMEs) encountered difficulties\n            in the development of the new maintenance system; instead,\n            it would have been useful to develop a system of assistance\n            for PMEs during preparation. It is recommended to accompany\n            the privatization of road maintenance activities, with\n            widespread training programs, to quickly build up the\n            necessary capacity in the construction industry."}, "docdt": "2003-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
