Mild environmental impacts are expected because\n            no new roads will be opened up. Also, the project encourages\n            labor intensive road maintenance activities that are more\n            environmentally friendly. Field observations revealed that\n            the project will have minor negative environmental impacts\n            that can be mitigated. Dirt roads only require mild\n            rehabilitation by resurfacing and eliminating critical\n            points. Certain tracks of the tarred roads will require\n            heavy rehabilitation in the short term. The needs of the\n            rural population will be considered when selecting rural\n            roads to be rehabilitated. Other minimizing measures in\n            rural areas include: (1) technically restoring laterite\n            quarries by leveling the grounds and spreading back organic\n            soil on the area, and restoring vegetative cover through\n            tree planting or grass propagation, or transforming these\n            quarries into water reservoirs; (2) improving drainage\n            infrastructure to restore original water transfers naturally\n            regulating the wetlands; (3) improving the downstream\n            portion of road drainage systems to prevent accelerated\n            formation of gullies and erosion alongside and the roads;\n            (4) Controlling dust, which can cause health hazards and\n            mild damage to crops and vegetation, by frequent watering of\n            construction sites, already widely practiced. In urban\n            areas, mitigations include: (1) reconstructing and\n            maintaining the drainage system, and paving instead of\n            tarring roads to prevent urban flooding; and (2) installing\n            vehicle pollution standards and an inspection system to\n            reduce emissions. Habitat destruction and relocation of\n            either rural residents or urban dwellers will generally be\n            avoided, while recommendations for instituting a better\n            compensation system are incorporated in this study."}, "docdt": "1997-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
