and sustained\n            growth. Specifically, the project will support operations to\n            a) rehabilitate and maintain both national and rural roads;\n            b) provide regular and stable road maintenance financing\n            from local resources; c) encourage private sector\n            involvement in subsector development; d) improve road\n            safety; and e) revitalize and strengthen the management\n            capacity of transport sector institutions. The IDA Credit\n            will finance works, goods, and services for four components:\n            1) remedial maintenance or rehabilitation and regraveling of\n            the paved road network, critical sections of the rural road\n            network, and the most important sections of the national\n            unpaved network to improve their condition to a level\n            facilitating sustainable maintenance; 2) institutional\n            strengthening of public sector management capacity to\n            improve sector coordination, investment planning and\n            monitoring, road maintenance programming and implementation,\n            and to facilitate private sector involvement in transport\n            and public works; 3) road safety improvement, including\n            building and equipping a vehicle inspection center,\n            technical assistance and studies, collection and analysis of\n            traffic accident data, school and public road safety\n            campaigns, and training instructors and examiners; and 4)\n            building mechanisms for beneficiary and community\n            participation in rural road management capacity."}, "docdt": "1997-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
