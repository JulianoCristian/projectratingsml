The project achieved\n            its main objectives, its impact on institutional development\n            was moderate, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank\n            and Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, there is a need to\n            evaluate more carefully project objectives and targets at\n            the time of appraisal, to ensure that these are consistent\n            with what can realistically be achieved within the envisaged\n            timeframe. Second, WAPDA's administrative procedures\n            should also be streamlined in order to minimize the time\n            that technical staff assigned to the project have to devote\n            to routine tasks. Finally, despite periodic attempts to\n            address the issue, the utility of progress reports as a\n            management tool remains limited."}, "docdt": "1995-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
