Fourth Wapda Power Project will\n            assist WAPDA in the further reinforcement and expansion of\n            the secondary power transmission network and thereby reduce\n            transmission losses.  It consists of:  (a) the erection of\n            about 3,815 km of transmission lines, (b) the construction\n            of 139 new substations, (c) the extension and reinforcement\n            of another 86 existing substations, and (d) studies,\n            technical assistance and training.  This last component\n            involves: (i) preparing an investment program for reducing\n            losses in the transmission network, (ii) preparing a program\n            of action to improve power plant efficiency, (iii)\n            developing a least cost national power plan, and (iv)\n            modernizing WAPDA's internal audit system and\n            strengthening its accounting capabilities. The proposed\n            project consists of normal electric utility work entailing\n            no unusual risks and there should be no difficulty in its execution."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
