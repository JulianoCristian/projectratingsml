Accessibility to\n            telecommunications services by the poor, particularly in\n            rural areas, will be supported. To facilitate Morocco's\n            transition to a global, information-based economy, a\n            national information technology strategy will be developed.\n            The project seeks to increase the postal services\n            competitiveness, ensuring public service obligations are not\n            only met, but adequately defined and financed. The private\n            sector will be a major beneficiary of competitive\n            telecommunications, post, and information technology\n            services, since the service industry accounts for\n            increasingly higher shares of GDP in developing economies.\n            However, the reversal of key policy measures, such as the\n            introduction of competition in the telecommunications\n            sector, or the strengthening of the regulator's\n            autonomy, may pose serious risks to an already complex operation."}, "docdt": "1999-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
