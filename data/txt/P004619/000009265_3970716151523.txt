CUADALCANAL ROAD          PiPROVE  ENr PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:       Soloon Islands.
Beneficiary:    Ministry of Energy, Works and Utilities (MEMU).
Amount:         SDR2.0 million (US$2.0 million equivalent).
Terms:          Standard IDA terms.
Project
Description:  The project seeks to (a) improve the existing main road in the
CuadaLcanal Plains and (b) enhance MEWU's capabilities in
design, construction and maintenance of roads. To accomplish
these aims, the project provides for road improvement and
rehabilitation, construction of bridges at major river cross-
ings, road construction equipuent, and consulting services f,or
project implementation and on-the-job training.
Benefits:       Quantifiable project benefits are mainly savings in vehicle
operating costs. The project will suppo,rt the Government's
efforts to increase and diversify agricultural production by
providing reliable low-cost transportation facilities in one
of the most agriculturally fertile and economically important
parts of the country.
Risks:          The main project risk is possible delay in construction, to
guard against which adequate technical support to MENU is
included in the project. Another risk is that the rc^ds may
not be properly maintained. However, the Government bas
assured that it would (i) prepare an adequate maintenance
program before project completion and submit it to the
Association for coment before implementing it and (ii)
provide adequate funds in its budget for the purpose.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO SOLOMON ISLANDS
FOR THE GUADALCANAL ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommi-ndation on a proposed
credit on standard IDA terms to Solomon Islands for the equivalent of SDR2.0
million (US$2.0 million equivalent) to help finance the Guadalcanal Road
Improvement Project.  The project would be cofinanced with the Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB) as the lead institution and with the OPEC Fund for Inter-
national Development; ADB would provide SDR1.999 million (about US$2.0
million) from its Special Fund resources.  The OPEC Fund wouLd provide US$1.5
million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank Group's second report since the country's independence
(Country Economic Memorandum: Solomon Islands, No. 4989-SOL) is dated
August 1. 1984. Basic country data are given in Annex I. In June 1983, the
World Bank and the UNDP issued an energy assessment report (Solomon Islands:
Issues and Options in the Energy Sector, No. 4404-SOL).
Structure of the Economy
3.        Solomon Islands, is an archipelago stretching over 1,650 km in a
southeasterly direction from Papua New Guinea. It was a British protectorate
since 1893 and gained its independence in July 1978. The country had a popu-
lation of 241,000 and a per capita GNP of US$628 in 1983. Six main islands -
Choiseul, New Georgia, Santa Ysabel, Malaita, Guadalcanal and Makira - account
for most of the population and the land area of some 29,000 sq km constitutes
mountain ranges of mainly volcanic, deep narrow valleys and limited coastal
strips. Although the population is racially homogeneous (about 93% Melane-
sian), at least 87 vernacular languages are spoken.  About 80: of the popula-
tion reside in small, widely dispersed settlements along the coasts; 60% of
the people live in localities with fever than 100 inhabitants and more than
80% in localities with fewer than 200. The capital city of Honiara, the only
major urban area situated on Guadalcanal, the largest island, has 16,000 inha-
bitants. Other urban centers have less than 2,000 inhabitants each. Inter-
island shipping is the main mode of transportation.
4.        Solomon Islands is a predominantly agricultural economy with land
communalLy owned.  Subsistence (nonmonetary) production is an important compo-
nent of the total output. It contributes 40% of GDP, and nine out of ten
households are engaged in subsistence food production to some extent. As is
typical of the islands in the Pacific, the basic needs of the population are
reasonably well met from subsistence activities. Re£lecting;the size of the
subsistence sector, the proportion of the labor force engaged in paid employ-
ment is limited. Between 1978 and 1982, only about 20Z of the labor force was



employed as full-time salary and wage earners, and an addit-onal 27-28%
derived some cash income from copra and market gardening. Thus only about 48Z
of the labor force was engaged in cash earning occupations.
Recent Developments
5.        After an impressive growth performance in the 1970s (8X p.a. growth
of real CDP), Solomon Islands" economy recorded a sharp downturn in the 1980s,
with real CDP estimated to have declined by 2.5Z p.a. between 1980 and 1982.
The continued world economic recession and the deteriorating terms of trade
more than offset favorable supply conditions, i.e. new investments in the
timber industry and new planting of palm oil and coconut trees in the mid to
late 70s, causing a decline in reaL domestic income. The weak external demand
in turn led to a weak domestic aggregate demand; domestic inflation slowed
down considerably to 7Z in 1983 from 16Z in 1980, in large part because of
lower import prices while investment also declined because of the lower level
of overall economic-activity, especially'the lower profitability in the export
sector. The noncash sector of the economy, which contributes over one-third
of GDP, seems to have withstood the economic'downturn well as basic needs tend
to be met from subsistence.
6.        Between 1980 and 1983, the growth in total revenue and grants did
not keep pace with that in total expenditures. Current expenditures on the
newly decentralized administrations and an 8Z increase in salaries and wages
in the public sector accounted for the growth in expenditures. As a result of
the depressed level of economic activity, revenue was less buoyant than in
previous years. Thus the current deficit is estimated to have exceeded SI$3.0
million in 1983, while those for previous years averaged SISO.S million. How-
ever, with a drop in development expenditures due to difficulties in project
preparation and implementation, the overall budgetary deficit decreased to
6.8% in 1983 from 14.4Z of GDP in 1980. Financing of the budgetary deficit
was almost equally divided between borrowings from the National Provident Fund
and the domestic banking system. The latter, for the first time, became an
important source of financing as there was some slack in the demand for credit
by the domestic private sector.
7.        In spite of the weakened external demand for most of the country's
export commodities, the external current account deficit in the balance of
payments improved in 1983 to 12% of GDP from 27% ln 1981. Uhile some of this
improvement reflects the lower level of economic activity and the associated
-lower level of imports of consumer and capital goods, exports performed well,
rising by over one-quarter in the two year period. To shore up its short-term
balance of payments position, the country resorted to judicious external
borrowing from commercial sources and multilateral institutions including a
S-I$2.4 million standby credit from the IMF in 1983. Moreover, in August 1982,
the Government depreciated the I5$ by 1OX to ensure the country's competitive-
ness in export markets, which was eroding because of a somewhat overvalued
exchange rate. Solomon Island's debt service rose to 3.6% of exports of goods
and services in 1982 from much lower levels in previous years, following the
assumption of a syndicated Eurodollar loan of US$20 million by the Govern-
ment. Nevertheless, the debt service ratio remains low and the level of
international reserves at the end of 1983 was strong, equivalent to about nine



-3-
months of import requirements. largely built up by the proceeds of the Euro-
dollar borrowing.
Development Issues
8.        With a young and rapidly growing labor force. the Government faces
the challenge of creating employment opportunities in a largely subsistence
economy.  While considerable export diversification took place between 1970
and 1980, it was limited to large-scale commercial agriculture with relatively
limited impact on the smallholder subsistence sector. Unfortunately, the
s      growth in the labor force over the period outpaced the growth in formal wage
and salary empLoyment, even during periods of high economic growth, wtiich
suggests that future employment growth will have to come from the non-
commercial subsector within agriculture, i.e., smallholders and subsistence
farmers.
9.        Human resource development is far from adequate in SoLomon Islands
as roughly measured by the few available social indicators. The only avail-
able data indicate that, in the early 70s, the adjusted enrollment ratios for
primary and secondary education were, respectively, 61Z and 7X, while the
adult literacy rate is (at best) about 152. The low level of educational
achievement explains the severe shortages of local skiLled and semi-skilled
labor and of high level manpower for the public and private sectors. Decen-
tralization and localization have undoubtedly accentuated these shortages.
The shortage of manpower is a major development constraint.
10.       Aware of the fact that the agricultural sector is the backbone of
the economy, the Government, in its first National Development Plan, 1980-
1984, emphasized export diversification, balanced development of smallholder
agriculture and estates, strengthened agricultural marketing, distribution
systems and agricultural support services, as well as the need for-improve-
ments in the educational sector. In October 1984, a new Government under the
leadership of Sir Peter Kenilorea was voted into office. A renewed emphasis
on development planning is expected with the creation of a new portfolio
devoted to planning, the Ministry of Economic Planning.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
.11.      Consistent with Government priorities, the Bank's strategy for the
Solomon Islands focuses on the education sector and activities which support
agricultural development. This strategy is designed to address key con-
-  straints to development - the shortage of skilled manpower and limited absorp-
tive capacity, as well as to support the major potential growth area in the
economy - agriculture. The three credits totalling SDR 8.9 million (US$10
million) approved thus far are assisting the expansion of primary education,
agricultural extension and training, and access to term-credit through the
Solomon Islands Development Bank.
12.       In delivering the lending program to the Solomon Islands, considera-
tion has been given to the need for aid coordination, impact and cost



-4-
effectiveness of IDA involvement in the region and the exp,rtise and geogra-
phical proximity of the ADB. The Bank has looked to cofinancing of selected
activities with the ADB in sectors of common interest and concern. This has
been possible in the projects supporting agricultural development. The ADS
does not have an active lending program in the formal eduction sector, and IDA
has participated in direct lending in this sector. A project to expand junior
secondary education has been appraised.
13.       The proposed project which will provide the country with 90 km of
improved roads, and strengthened capability in design, construction and road
maintenance, will directLy support the Government's efforts to increase and
diversify agricultural production. Improvements in the Cuadalcanal road will
provide all-ieather access to agricultural areas, markets and administrative
centers. The ADB, as the lead agency for the project, conducted the appraisal
in May 1984. The IDA staff has maintained consultation with the Government
and the ADB on this project and the final design and project details reflect
the agreement of all parties concerned. In particular IDA staff has placed
emphasis in the project design on the project scope taking into account budge-
tary limitations and the country's implementation capabilities, the develop-
ment of a sector-wide road maintenance program and promoting the institutional
development of the Ministry of Energy, Works and Utilities.
14.       As of September 30, 1984, the amount of effective credits to the
Solomon Islands held by the Bank Group amounted to US$10.0 million equiva-
lent. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits. There are no IFC
investments in Solomon Islands.
Disbursement Performance
15.       Only three projects are currently being implemented in Solomon
Islands. The first credit of US$1.5 million (SDR 1.3 million) for Solomon
Islands Development Bank became effective in July 1981. The second credit of
US$5.0 million (SDR 4.3 million) which financed a primary education project,
became effective on July 19, 1982. The third credit of US$3.5 million
(SDR 3.3 million) for rural services became effective on June 12, 1984. Dis-
bursements were initially slow under the first credit, but have increased as a
result of IDA agreement on financing a portion of local currency, as well as
foreign currency expenditures. Under the second credit, the project is
nearing completion and disbursements are well ahead of schedule. The third
project is in start-up phase of implementation.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Overview
16.       Although population growth in Solomon Islands - 3.4% p.a. - is high,
the density is low with an overall average of 9 pe'sons per sq km. Population
and production centers are scattered over numerous islands, mainly along the
coast, creating a formal domestic sea transport sector. The sea transport
(excluding small motorized boats and canoes) carries 55Z of total freight ton-
km and 47Z of total passenger-km, while road transport accounts for 45% of



freight and 48% of passenger traffic (see para. 3). Although domestic avia-
tion serves only 5X of passenger traffic and negligible freight transport, it
provides extensive links between the islands through 23 airfields, two of
which are designated as international airports. There are no railways in the
country.
Transport Planning and Coordination
17.       Transport planning and coordination has traditionally been the
responsibility of the National Planning Office (NPO). Formerly located in the
c      Prime Minister's Office, the NPO has been subsumed under the Ministry of
Economic Planning, a new portfolio created after the recent general election.
Proposals for improvement of transport infrastructure are generally initiated
in the provinces and submitted to NPO. After discusions with the Ministry of
Energy Works and Utilities (MEWU) - the Ministry responsible for public works,
including transport infrastructure at the national level - and the concerned
provincial authority, NPO reviews the proposal for economic and technical
feasibility. In the past, based on such review, NPO submitted the proposal
for consideration by the National Planning Council (NPC) - the economic plan-
ning authority for the country headed by the Prime Minister. Since the new
Covernment came to office, the status of the NPC will need to be clarified,
however, indications are that considerable emphasis will be placed on
development p.anning with the creation of a new ministry specifically for that
purpose.
The Road Subsector: Development Strategy
18.       The Government's overall long-term objective within the road
subsector is to provide on each major island a system of roads linking ports,
airports, development areas and centers of population as well as to develop
central and provincial government capability to build and maintain roads to a
satisfactory level. The Government, however, recognizes that its financial
position restricts road construction activities mainly to rehabilitation of
existing roads, except for penetration roads to open up agricultural areas.
It is also aware of the urgent need for regular road maintenance, but mainte-
nance is undertaken only when road or bridge conditions reach a critical
state. The Government's immediate pLans are to improve the main road on the
northern coast of Guadalcanal which carries relatively more traffic than any
other road in the country. Priority is also given to upgrading feeder roads
nationwide and to improving the main road pn the west coast of Malaita Island.
19.       Annual development expenditures on road construction have fluctuated
(SI$40,000-1,000,000) over the past five years due mainly to the varying
external aid flows.  In 1984 the planned expenditure for road construction is
estimated at SI$1.6 million. Since the country is heavily dependent on
foreign aid to finance development programs, the realization of the Covern-
ment's road network plans will largely depend on the availability of aid
funds.



-6-
The Road Network
20.       Solomon Islands has 1,294 km of public roads, 168 km of which are
classified as urban roads, apart from private roads (520 km) for plantation
and logging operations. The majority of public roads are located on the two
main islands, Cuadalcanal (548 km) and Malaita (350 km), while Western
Province has a high share of private roads (400 km) for logging operations. A
total of 100 km of all public roads are bitumen-sealed, 93 km of which are in
Guadalcanal and the rest in Auki (Malaita Province) and Gizo (Western Prov-
ince).  The total length of roads on Guadalcanal island is 598 km, of which
158 km are classified as main roads and 138 km as urban roads under the
Central Government; 252 kri are under provincial authorities; 50 km are private
roads serving plantation and logging activities. While the extent of the main
road network is considered fairly complete in the sense that it connects major
population centers, ports and airfields, the majority of the roads are in a
deteriorated condition with poor surface and inadequate drainage. The pene-
tration and other rural roads are in eveui worse condition and are mostly
accessible only to tractors and four-wheel-drive vehicles. The use of many
roads is further constrained by numerous unbridged river crossings, with heavy
rain preventing movements for several days in the year.
Vehicle Fleet
21.       There were 3,080 vehicles registered in Solomon Islands in 1982, of
which 2,350 were privately owned. The majority of vehicles are registered in
Honiara. Since some illegal operation (vehicles without registration) takes
place, particularly outside Guadalcanal, the above fleet size is an under-
estimate. Of the total, 46% were private cars and taxis, while 8% were motor-
cycles; the remainder were trucks, tractors, trailers, and buses. After 1980
when customs duties on cars and motorcycles were substantially increased,
fleet growth has slowed down. Overall annual growth during 1981-1982 was less
than 1Z as against 6.8% during 1978-1982.
22.       Vehicles more than two years old are required to pass an annual
roadworthiness test (except taxis which are tested every three months). The
inspection procedures are satisfactory.
Road Transport Industry
23.       Public passenger transportation. services are provided by a formal
sector consisting of privately operated buses and taxis. Bus services are,
however, restricted mostly to Honiara township limits in Guadalcanal where
three litensed companies operate 8 large buses and 5 minibuses. No subsidy is
provided by the Government which regulates fares and routes.  Despite some
resistance from informal passenger transport operators, the Provincial
Government in April 1984 granted permission to two of the bus companies to
extend services to Tambea in the west and to Vouza bridge in the east.  These
extensions of bus services have substantiaLly imprdved the safety of passenger
transport since the informal carriers available hitherto in these areas were
open trucks without seats.



24.       The trucking industry is dominated by company-owne4 vehicles,
particularly in the logging, rice and oil palm plantation sectors as well as
for transport of fuel. 'For hire' services are provided by two medium size
firms in Guadalcanal and by a number of small operators owning not more than
three trucks each. The majority of trucks carry a mixture of passengers and
freight with farmers accompanying their copra, cocoa or other produce for sale
at the Honiara market; Most of the trucks in operation conform to the maximum
*      permissibLe loads of 7.7 mt per single axle and 14.6 mt per tandem axle.
During axle-load surveys conducted as part of the feasibility study, only 6Z
of the truck axles in Guadalcanal exceeded the legal load limits and then by a
maximum of 20%. However, with gradual improvement of the road network,
heavier trucks may be brought into use; the Government has indicated that it
will utilize the portable loadometer provided under ADB technical assistance
to enforce load regulations.
25.       Regular traffic counts have been carried out by MEWU since 1970 for
the existing Guadalcanal road. A review of the results of these counts
reveals an annual traffic growth over the past five years of 7% - higher close
to Honiara and lower Eor the rural sections of the road - almost coinciding
with the growth rate for the vehicLe fleet over the same period. Such a high
growth rate is not considered to be sustainable in the future, particularly as
rice, oil palm and cocoa plantations are already established and their further
development plans are modest in scope.
26.       Accidents on the roads of the country have increased over the years,
particularly in GuadaLcanal where 302 accidents took pLace in 1983, of which
61 involved people, with 3 fatalities and 93 injured persons. While the
number of accidents has been on the increase, the severity has fortunately
been decreasing. However, the annual accident density on Guadalcanal roads -
0.8 per km - is considered high for such a limited vehicle fleet. The Govern-
ment is seriously concerned about this development and is taking steps to
coordinate efforts of law enforcement agencies towards accident prevention
such as installing better sign posts, speed limits and spot checks to appre-
hend violators.
Road User Revenues and Expenditures
27.       Revenues raised by the Government include customs duties on vehi-
cles, spare parts and accessories, fuel and lubricants as well as the annual
vehicle license fee and the driving license fee. The annual vehicle license
fee varies from SI$80 for a medium car to SI$320 for a medium truck. Road
expenditures are financed through annual budgetary allocations. Revenue from
road users, even disregarding vehicle import duty, is considered sufficient to
cover current road expenditures, including construction and maintenance.
However, since the fuel tax structure was changed from an ad valorem to a
specific basis in 1983 resulted in a 50 fall in revenue, the Government may
have to consider an upward adjustment of the specific tax or revert to the ad
valorem basis to generate enough revenue to cover hi'her expenditures in
future years. Arrangements for adequate road maintenance in the country would
be given special emphasis during implementaton of the project (see para. 53).

Road Administration
28.       Responsibility for construction, maintenance and administration of
the Guadalcanal road from Lambi to Aola is vested in MEWU.  All other public
roads come under the respective provincial governments. The civil engineering
activities of MEWU are organized in a traditional 'line' system under the
Chief Civil Engineer (CCE) who reports to the Under Secretary (Works). There
are two main activity groups - design and works - each under a Principal Civil
Enginoer (PCE). Road construction and maintenance are carried out by the
Roads and Bridges Section (RBS) under the PCE (Works). Capital works under-
taken in recent years have been few and RBS has mainly undertaken maintenance
works. However, it has no established program for maintenance of roads, but
reacts to emergency situations on an ad-hoc basis. There is room for signifi-
cant improvement of maintenance techniques being followed by RBS.
29.       There are no major road contractors in the country.  The practice
has generally been to carry out road works through small local contractors or
to implement them departmentally. In the past, some bridges have also been
constructed departmentally; however, present staff has little experience in
such works and, consequently, foreign contractors have been engaged for some
major bridge construction currently underway with Australian assistance.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The proposed project was identified by a feasibility study, financed
by ADB and undertaken in the second part of 1983. An ADB fact-finding mission
visited the project area in January/February 1984 and, after an in-depth
review of the study, agreed on the proposed project with the Covernment. ADS
appraised the project in the field in April 1984 and prepared an Appraisal
Report in June 1984. A Bank highway mission inspected the project roads and
bridges in August 1984. The IDA Credit was negotiated by telex on December
12, 1984. An appraisal report, dated October 1984, prepared by ADB is being
diitributed to the Executive Directors separately. Supplementary project data
are provided in Annex III.
Project Objectives and Description
31.       The main objective of the proposed project is to provide reliable
low-cost transportation facilities in the Guadalcanal Plains - the most
fertile and economically important part of the country with great potential
for agricultural development - and thereby support the Government's efforts to
increase and diversify agricultural production. The project would also
-enhance the capability of MEWU in design, construction and maintenance of
roads, primarily through on-the-job training of its personnel in maintenance
techniques, and through provision of equipment.
32.       The project would consist of:  (a) improvement and rehabilitation of
90 km of a coastal road passing mostly through the Guadalcanal Plains; (b) con-
struction of three major bridges; (c) procurement of construction equipment;
and (d) consulting services to assist KEMU in implementation of the project



-9-
and to provide on-the-job training to its staff in road construction and
maintenance. The project roads and river crossings are shown in Map 18626.
Improvement and Rehabilitation of Roads
33.       The project includes: *(a) improvement of the existing gravel roads
froD Tambea to Ndoma and Poha (36 km) and from Vouza Bridge to Hberande River
and Kombito (45 km); and (b) rehabilitation of the existing bituminous road
from Ngali.biu to Vouza Bridge (9 km). All these roads are generally in poor
condition.
346.      West of Honiara, the section from Tambea to Ndoma (21 km) would be
improved to 6.0 m wide gravel road standard, and the section from Udoma to
Poha (15 km) would be upgraded to a 6.0 m wide bituminous seated road. The
works east of Honiara would improve the seccion from Vouza Bridge to nberande
River (6 km) to a 6.0 m wide bituminous sealed road and che section from
Nberande River to Kombito (39 km) to a 3.0-m wide gravel road with passing
bays. All improved sections would have the road formation raised where
necessary, adequate side drainage, culverts and strengthened pavement.
35.       The existirng bituminous road from Ngalimbiu to Vouza Bridge (9 km)
east of Honiara would be rehabilitated to 7.0 a wide bituminous sealed road
standard.
36.       The proposed improvement and rehabilitation works would be adequate
to accommodate the prv,jected traffic for the next 20 years. The improved road
wold generally follow the existing alignment and no land acquisition would be
required.
Construction of Bridges
37.       The project includes construction of three major bridges on the
project roads for a total span length of 281 meters. Two bridges, namely
Sagaa (length 50 m) and Nberande (length 110 a), would be low-level submers-
ible structures in reinforced concrete and would be passable for most of the
year except during peak flood periods. The third bridge at Mbokokimbo (length
121 m) would be a high-level bridge with Bailey spans, for which only the sub-
structure would be provided under the project. The Government would complete
the construction of the bridge using Bailey panels and timber decking released
from an existing bridge. All three bridges would be single lane structures
with a carriageway of 3.5 a. The two subodrsible structures would be designed
to T 44 Standard Vebicle Loading of the National Association of Australian
State Road Authorities (NASRA), and the Bailey bridge at Mbokokimbo would be
designed to T 33 loading of NASRA.

Construction Equipment
38.       The project would provide construction equipment and spare parts
required by MEWU to carry out the project road works. After completion of the
project works, AEWU would use this equipment for road maintenance.
Consulting Services
39.-      The project would provide consulting services required for the
implementation of the project (construction management of force account units
for roadworks and construction supervision for bridgeworks). These services
(about 72 man-months) wou'd be provided by foreign consultants.  The consul-
tants would also provide on-the-job training to MEW staff and to selected
personnel of the provinces in road construction and maintenance. Support
facilities, light vehicles, and survey, laboratory and drawing equipment
needed by the consultants wouLd also be provided under the project.  The con-
sultants would be selected and employed on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Association and in accordance with ADB principles and procedures
(Section 3.02 of draft Development Credit Agreement). summary terms of
reference for the consultant services were agreed during ADB appraisal, and
are satisfactory.
Project Cost and Financing
40.       The total financial requirements for the project including contin-
gency allowances, about US$0.08 million of taxes and US$0.04 million of ADB
service and other charges, is estimated at US$6.50 million.  The foreign
excbange component is estimated at US$5.0 million. The total cost includes:
(a) physical contingencies of 10% of base costs on all items; and (b) price
con-ingencies amounting to about 14Z of base costs on all items, including
physical contingencies, estimated for foreign costs at 3.5Z for 1984, 8.0Z for
1985, and 9.0% each for 1986 and 1987, and for local costs at 8.0% for 1984
and 6.0% each for 1985, 1986 and 1987. Cost estimates are based on April 1984
prices.
41.       For the improvement of the existing roads, the base cost varies from
about C : ,G00 per kilooeter for a single-Lane gravel road to about US$73,000
per kilometer for a two-lane bituminous road. For the rehabilitation of the
existing bituminous road, the base cost averages about US$34,000 per kilo-
meter. For the construction of bridges, -the base cost for a submersible
bridge in reinforced concrete averages about US$4,300 per linear meter.  These
cost estimates are reasonable.
42.       The proposed IDA credit of US$2.0 million would finance US$1.75 mil-
lion wf the foreign excbange cost and US$ 0.25 million of the local cost of
the project. The ADB is extending a loan of US$2.0 to the project to finance
US$1.75 million of foreign costs (including US$0.05 million towards technical
assistance for project preparation and US$0.03 miliion for service charges
during construction) and US$0.25 million of local costs. The balance of the
foreign exchange cost, namely, US$1i.. million, would be financed by the OPEC
r41d.  The Covernment would finance the remaini;.g US$1.0 million equivalent
through annual budgetary allocations. The project would be cofinanced by IDA,
. ~  ~    



- 11 -
ADB and the OPEC Fund on a joint financing basis. In accordance with the
agreements to be contained in the Letter of Credit Administrz ion between IDA
and ADB, IDA funds would be administered by ADB. The totaL external Einancing
amounts to US$5.5 million, or aLmost 85Z of totaL project cost. Special con-
ditions of effectiveness are that all conditions precedent to effectiveness of
the ADB and OPEC Fund loans have been fulfilled or, in the case of the OPEC
Fund loan, that adequate foreign exchange funds for the project are available
to the Borrower from other sources under arrangements satisfactory to IDA
(Section 6.0L (a) and (b) (i) and (ii) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
r     Status of Preparation
43.       Detailed engineering for all road sections proposed for improvement
has been compLeted. Preliminary engineering for the existing bitumLious -road
from Ngalimbiu to Vouza Bridge proposed for rehabilitation has been completed
and the pavement will be further investigated by consultants. These investi-
gations will be completed by mid-1985. Detailed engineering for bridges has
been completed.
Implementation
44.       MEWU, assisted by qualified consultants, would be responsible for
the implementation of the project. Following a detailed assessment of the
implementation arrangements and considering the small size and simple techni-
cal nature of road improvement and rehabilitation works, it has been agreed
with the Covernmen; that the project road works wouid be carried out depart-
mentally using government forces through the Roads and Bridges Section (RBS)
of MEWU with construction management assistance from the consultants. The
necessary construction equipment and spares would also be provided under the
project.  The bridge works under the project would be impiemented by con-
tract. The contract(s) would be awarded on a unit price basis. The project
would be implemented over a three-year period and should be completed by
December 31, 1987.
45.       Since the proposed road improvement and rehabilitation works would
be confined to the limits of the existing right-of-way, no land acquisition is
envisaged. For construction of bridges, however, minor land acquisition would
be required for the approaches to Sasaa bridge. The Government has assured
ADB that it would take necessary action to acquire the required land on-a
timely basis.
Procurement
46-.      Civil works (totalling USS2.63 million) for the improvement and
rehabilitation of the project roads wouLd be implemented by force account.
Civil works contracts (totalling US$1.17 million) for the construction of
bridges would be awarded under international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Procurement of the equip-
ment and spare parts (worth US$1.82-million) would be carried out following
ICB in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. All bidding packages
for civil works would be subject to ADB's prior review of procurement documen-



- 12 -
tation.  ADB is the lead organization in -the joint cofinanciq; arrangement of
IDA and OPEC Fund for this project. ADB Guidelines for Procurement were
modeled on those of the Bank and IDA; these guidelines do not, therefore,
differ substantively from each other. In a letter of cooperation betveen ADB
and OPEC Fund, it has been agreed that ADS uili act as administrator of the
OPEC loan for this project and that OPEC Fund accepts ADB procurement guide-
lines. Bidding wilL thus be open to all eligible source countries of ADB and
IBRDIIDA. Key procurement information is sumrarized in the table below:

Note: Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the IDA Credit,
including a prorated share of unallocated funds.
Disbursements
47.       Disbursements from the IDA credit would be made on a Joint basis
with ADB and OPEC Fund for:  (a) 25Z of total expenditures for roadworks; (b)
452 of total expenditures for bridge works; (c) 35% af total expenditures for
equipment and spare parts; and (d) 35Z of total expenditures for consulting
services. Disbursements for roadvorks to be carried out by force account
would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures certified by
consultants. All other expenditures would be fully documented. The total
_d_



- 13 -
cost of the force account works would not exceed the cost estimate for these
works agreed for each package between MEM and ADB before th;e works begin.
Accounting and Audit
48.       The Government will establish and maintain a separate set of
accounts for all expenditures relating to the project. These accounts vill be
audited in accordance with sound auditing principles by an auditor acceptable
to the Association (and ADB) and an audit report on the project accounts,
together with such other details as say be requested, will be submitted to the
Association (and ADB) within six months of the close of each fiscal year
(Section 4.01(c) of draft Development Credit Agreement).
Reporting and Monitoring
49.       The following reports will be prepared and submitted to the
Association (and ADB):
(a)  a Project Implementation Program updated annually (Section 3.01(b)
of the draft Development Credit Agreement);
(b) quarterly progress reports not later than 15 days after the end of
each quarter (Section 3.04(b) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement); and
(c) a Project Completion Report soon after physical completion of the
project (Section 3.04(d) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
50.       To facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the
project, the Government has agreed with ADS and IDA to compile and analyze
traffic and socio-economic data in-the influence area of the project 'road.
For this purpose, necessary surveys will be carried out by MEM prior to start
of construction and after completion of the project (Section 3.01 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement).
Environment
51.       The project is not expected to have any adverse environmental
effects as the road will follow the existing alignment and improved drainage
will reduce flooding.
Benefits, Justification and Risks
52.       The main quantifiable benefits of the proposed road improvements are
savings in vehicle operating costs which would average about 25Z from current
levels for roadworks and 35X for the bridges as a whole. The project road was
divided into five sections for economic evaluation and each section was
evaluated for alternative leiels of improvement, with the optimal level of
improvement selected for implementation. The ERR is estimated at 15.6S for
the entire project, with returns for individual sections and bridges ranging
from 10 to 35Z. This is satisfactory. The project will also assist the



- 14 -
Government's efforts to reduce transport costs and thereby-romote both an
increase and a diversification in agricultural production.
53.       The sensitivity of the ERR was tested for changes in costs and
benefits. For a 10Z increase in costs combined with 15Z lower benefits, the
ERR would drop to IZX. Delay in project completion by one year would reduce
it to 14Z; this risk is minimized by the provision of technical assistance to
*        ensure timely nroject implementation.  The other main risk is that the project
road may not be properly maintained after completion.  The Government has,
however, given assurances that (i) part of the construction equipment to be
procured under the project will be assigned to maintaining the project road
and (ii) adequate budgetary provision will be made for the purpose (Section
3.01(b) of draft Development Credit Agreement). A maintenance program will be
prepared by the Government six months before project completion and sent to
the Association (and ADB) for comment before it is implemented (Section
3.01(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
54.       The beneficiaries of the proposed project will mostly be small
farmers growing copra, cocoa and vegetables as well as the oil palm and rice
plantations which transport raw materials and finished products over the pro-
ject road. As all freight and passenger transport, except for company-owned
trucks for own use, operates in a fully competitive market and as rates and
fares are set according to road condition, benefits from improved road condi-
tions will mostly be passed on to transport users. Government technical
personnel will benefit from upgrading of their skills and capabilities to
undertake similar works in road construction and maintenance in the future
through on-the-job training with consultants.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
55.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Solomon Islands
and IDA and the Recommendation provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the
Articles of Agreement of the: Association are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors. Speciai conditions of effectiveness are that all
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the ADB and OPEC Fund loans have
been fulfilled or, in the case of the OPEC Fund loan, that adequate foreign
exchange funds for the project are available to the Borrower from other
sources under arrangements satisfactory to IDA (Section 6.01(a) and (b) (i)
and (ii) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Article* of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
57.       I recomeod that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
