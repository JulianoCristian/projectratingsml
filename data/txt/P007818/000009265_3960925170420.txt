THIRD LIVESTOCI PROJECT
(LOAN 235i-PAN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT'
PREFACE
This is the Draft Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Livestock Development
Project in Panama for which Loan 2356-PAN in the amount of US$9 million was approvod in November
1984. The closing date of the loan was originally establishod as June 30, 1989. However, because
of a deepening economic crisis linked to deepening political problems, tho Bank quapMded
disbursements to Panama in November 1987 and canceled the undisbursed amount of the loan as of
October 30, 1989.
This Draft Project Completion Report was prepared by a mission of the FAOQWorld Bank
Cooperative Program (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and ll). This report is based, inIpfl on
the Staff Appraisal Report, Loan and Guarantee Agreements, Supervision Reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, interviews with the Bank and the Technical Unit staff, and various
data supplied by the Technical Unit of the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP).
The Draft Project Completion Report was sent to the BNP (the Borrower) in October 1990
for comments and contribution to Part II of the Report. In December 1990 BNP informed the Bank that
it had no objections to PART I of the report. Additional information was provided in March 1991,
particularly on the achievements  of the Technical Unit (TU) in 1990. Those comments were
incorporated in the report. Subsequently, the Borrower agreed that its March 1 5 communication be
considered as Part ll of the PCR.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORIT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Third Livestock Project was the sixth agricultural operation to be financed by the
Bank in Panama having been preceded by two fisheries, two livestock and one tropical treecrop
projects. The Loan and Guarantee Agreements became effective on April 26, 1984. Scheduled to last
five years, the Loan Account was closed and undisbursed portion of the Loan canceled as of
October 31, 1989, long after the credit component had come to a virtual standstill due to economical
and political problems ensued by lack of payments on debt service under Bank loans which caused
disbursement to be suspended by the Bank. Only about 319% of the loan was disbursed.
Objectives
The purpose of the Third Livestock Project aimed at further assisting the Government
in making use of the country's comparative advantage in the livestock sector. The objectives included
increasing beef production mainly through improved livestock management methods, liberalizing
government marketing policies and expanding milk production through improved technical assistance
and supervised credit.
Implementation Experience
From the beginning the processing of subloans began to lag behind the appraisal
estimates. The main reasons were (a) a severe drought in 1983-84 which had reduced the demand
for credit and (b) the availability of funds from the previous Livestock II Project (loan 1397-PAN) whose
Loan Account had been expected to close in 1982, but required two extensions of the closing date
to complete disbursements which eventually lasted into spring of 1986. Later in 1987 counterpart
funds started to dry up and the demand for all type of subloans diminished due to the deteriorating
economic and political problems. At the end of 1987 when disbursements had reached a total of
US$2.8 million (31 % of loan amount) the Bank suspended disbursements to Panama because of the
aforetold payments problems. Because of said suspension, the Bank was unable to extend the closing
date beyond the originally established date of June 30, 1989, and eventually canceled the amount of
US$6.2 million, the undisbursed balance under the loan as of October 1989.
Results
The main objectives of the project were only partly achieved since only one third of the
total was disbursed. Prior to 1987 the Technical Unit (TU) approved about 230 subloans (the SAR had
estimated 420) of which 63% were for dual-purpose operations, 35% for beef production and the
remaining 2% for only dairy production (the latter category was not contemplated in the SAR). The
size of average subloans were quite similar to those contemplated in the SAR. The TU was
strengthened, a monitoring and evaluation service was established and staff training took place. With



- iv 
17 technicians in the fiold TU romained fairly active mostly providing technical assistance and
processing short-term credit. One impact of the project was that export quotas for beef were removed,
bL the benefits obtained were shortlived, wlien export of deboned beef meat to the US came to a halt
in 1987.
Su stainability
Despite the difficuit economic situation in Panarna and the uncertainties of a deepening
and continued depressior., BNP continued, as indicated in Part 11, to maintain the highly trained and
qualified TU. In 1990 (the year after the closing of the project) BNP has been able to process about
480 operations and several conferences and field-days were held to promote changes in production
technologies. Since demand for milk and meat is reduced, input prices have increased and farm
incomes are deteriorating there is a latent danger that many subloans provided under the loan may fall
into arrears, but the institutional capacity of BNP in expanding milkproduction through improved
techrnical assistance and supervised credit continues to be sustained.
Findings and Lessons
Given the circumstances it is rot possible to evaluate the impact of the project. A
deteriorating political climate and the accompanying economic depression brought about a standstill
of the project credit component three years after it became effective.
A major fault was the submission to the Board and approval of this loan in November
1983, when disbursement under the previous Livestock 11 Project (Loan 1397-PAN) was well behind
schedule. Thus the Third Livestock Project became effective when substantial funds from the
precedent loan were still available.

Country           :  Panama
Sector                Agriculture
Sub-sector            Livestock
2. Project Background
2.1        Agriculture is iess important in the economy of Panama than in most other Latin America
co 1-{es. Banana and sugar are the main cash and export crops. Since 1960 the agricultural
cont;. ution to GDP has declined from 23% to 19% in 1988. In its place, the services sector grew to
contribute about 60% of GDP from financial, commercial and transport activities. Despite the relative
decline in agriculture's contribution to total GDP, the performance of the sector has been crucial to
Panama. In the early 1 980s it still employed 27% of the work-force and generated 55% of commodity
exports.
2.2        Panama's nopulation in 1988 was 2.3 million inhabitants, of which about 1.0 million lived
in rural areas. Because of the scarcity of new jobs in agriculture, migration to the cities has been rapid
resulting in a 4.4% population annual increase in the urban areas and only 2.2% in the countryside.
2.3        The livestock sub-sector showed throughout the 1960s and the 1970s slow growth
similar to the rest of the agricultural sector at some 3% annually. Within the stub-sector, milk, poultry
and pork production kept up with population growth averaging about 3% duringthe 1970 decade. Beef
production estimates are biased as they record only output from registered slaughterhouses.
Clandestine slaughter which probably was sizeable, introduced a significant error factor in livestock
inventory and growth estimates. Nevertheless, due to the policy environment existing until the late
1 970s, the livestock sub-sector was a rather stagnant industry with sporadic short-term movements
in response to good seasons and market improvements. It was estiriated that in 1981, the cattle
population was about 1.3 million heads.
2.4        By September 1983, when the Third Livestock Project was presented to the Board, the
Bank had fully disbursed two projects for agriculture and one for livestock totalling US$5.7 million and
ongoing operations in the agricultural sector included one project for livestock credit and one for
development of tree crops.
2.5        The Governrment requested the Bank to help finance the continuation of its livestock
program which had been supported through two Livestock Development Projects (Loan 901 - PAN and
Loan 1397 - PANL Both of these projects were to help the Government to meet its objectives of
diversifying production and exports of beef and generating foreign exchange through import



-2 -
substitution by increasing milk production. The requested project was to be implemented by the
Technical Unit (TU) of the Barico Nacional de Panama (BNP) established under Loan 901 - PAN.
3. Pro,ect Objectives and Descriptlon
3.1        The proposed project aimed at assisting the Government in making fuller use of the
countrv's comparative advantaje in the livestock sub-sector. The objective of the project included
increast,ag beef production mainly through improved livestock management methods and liberalizing
official marketing policies; expanding milk production and improving its quality through on-farrr
investments and enforcement of a new price structure based on milk grading; and generating
employment opportunities in the rural sector.
3.2        The project consisted of:
Sub-loans for lual-gWrgose and Beef Production operations
(i)        long-term investments to include milking facilities, fencing, livestock, water
systems, pasture improvements, annual crop production and reforestation
on dual-purpose (milk and beef) and beef production farms; and
0i0        short-term financing for purchasing cattle for fattening in conjunction with
long-term investments.
Technical Unit (TU)
(i}        training in improved livestock management techniques consisting of: local
,raining for TU staff and project beneficiaries; and foreign training for TU
staff;
{ii)       intr,rnationally recruited consulting services to assist TU in 'ivestock
management systems, cattle reproduction efficiency, project monitoring and
evaluation and soil and water conservation; and
(iii)      acquisition of field vehicles and office and technical equipment.
3.3        Project conditionalities included the enforcement by Government of legislation introducng
milk grading standards.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.1        The project was originally prepared by the TU of the Banco Nacional de Panama with
assistance from the FAOiWorld Bank CP, which produced a preparation report in March 1982. Two
subsequent Bank missions (April 1982 and August 1982) completed the preparation work. The
proposal was appraised late 1982.
4.2        The overall project concept was approp'iate and it was based on the experience - since
end-i 973 - of the Bank with the two previous mentioned livestock development projects.
4.3        The procedural and organizational arrangements envisaged at design were well established
in the Panamanian context. The Banco Nacional de Panama, as with the two previous livestock



-3-
projects, was the borrower and executing agency for the project. The projects' TU admir' .0red the
sub-loans following the well-tested procedures by providing technical personnel to draw up the farm
investment plans that were part of the sub-loans applications. After sub-loan approval, the project field
technicians rendered technical assistance and supervised and moniKored the implementation of
investment plans. The project also further strengthened the TU, particularly in the areas of staff
training and in the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation section.
5. Project Implementation
5.1        The project was appraised during December 1 982, approved by the Board in November
1983. The Loan and Guarantee a,. aements were signed on November 23, 1983 and became effective
on April 26, 1984. It was scheduled to last five years, closing on 30 June 1989.
5.2        Planned and actual disbursements by year are shown in Part Ill, 3. It can be seen that the
rate of actual disbursements was considerably below that envisaged at appraisal. In fact, when the
Bank canceled the project in October 1989, the undisbursed balance of the loan was US$6.2 million.
In other words, only 31 % of the loan was disbursed over the five year period.
5.3        The basic reasons for the lag in disbursements during the first three years were:
-  a severe drought during 1983-84 which reduced demand for sub-loans;
the availability of funds from the previous project (Loan 1397 - PAN) which
was initially to close in 1982 but was extended twice. Final disbursements
took place during March 1986. Between 1982 and 1986 about US$3.2
million were disbursed out of a US$ 8 million loan.
5.4        At the end of 1987 counterpart funds started drying up. At the same time the demand
for all types of subloans diminished sensibly as a reflection of the economic crisis that started affecting
Panama and which largely had its roots in deep seated political problems. The Government began to
default on its payments and on November 30, 1987, the Bank suspended the right of the Panamanian
Government to make any further withdrawals on all Bank loans. The situation wGrsened in 1988 and
1989. The Bank informed the Government that it would not be possible to extend the closing date
beyond the original date of June 30, 1989, and closed the loan account on October 31, 1989. An
undisbursed portion of the loan in the amount of US$6.2 million was canceled.
Project Costs
5.5        Estimated project costs at appraisal and actual costs as of December 30, 1989 are shown
in Part It!, 4 A and B. Total project costs were estimated at appraisal at US$25.5 million, including
physical and price contingencies. Actual costs including World Bank and Government courtafrpart
funding had been estimated at US$6.6 million and these represent actual disbursements (i.e., in other
words, these costs came to only 26% of the appraisal costs). AvailaHe information does not
include individual borrowers' contribution to the sub-loans, which is estimated at 10-15% of farm
investmonts. Although the TU maintainedJ a%dequate records of expenditure and withdrawals of loan
proceeds, there appears to have been rio systematic attempt to record total project costs as distinct
from disbursements under the loan.
Project Financing
5.6        As can be seen in Part '!, Table 5, while it was envisaged at appraisal that the
contribution to total cost of Government/BiP, henaficiaries and IBRD would be 51%, 14% and 35%



respectively, it is estimated that in actual terms these contributions weru L1 %-1 'I , and 3 i o. 'I he
figures on the contribution of beneficiaries are estimated on a 1°2% basis of sub-loant lifiburfiunuornss
but data were not available to provide an accurate fiAgure.
5.7          The actual percentage contribution of the three sources are closeo to diai. imdicatol al
appraisal, and thus reflect that BNP/TU followad appraisal and loan agreemnient stipularinon,;.
Disbursements by Categories
5.8         Part 1II, 6 (Allocation of Loan Proceeds' shows the ornoinal allucaniol an1d the, actual
disbursements as of December 1 989. by categories. Because of the delays exp: iric;ud bv the project
during the first years and the suspension of payments by the Bank, thero is a considerable discrepancy
between actual loan disbursement and those contemplated at appraisal. Only B31 %X. of tlev loin wavv
disbursed.
Training
5.9        Between 1986 and 1 987 the project financed the training for variable periods of time of
13 technicians of the BNP in Israel, United States, Colombia and Costa R3ica, in fields related to
livestock management, animal nutrition, pasture improvement, anirnal health, etc. In 1 987 a seminar
with three Israeli consultants was organized in which BNP staff and cattle farmers palrticipated.
Consultants
5.10       One consultant was contracted to establish within the TU the monitoring and evaluation
sector. Other consultants contemplated, such as in soil conservation, were not employee: because of
project disruption.
6. Project Results
6.1        Because of the aforementioned start-up problems with the project and the payment
suspensions by the Bank, an analysis of project perforinance vis-a-  the envisaged targets in the
appraisal report is practical impossible. The impact of the project on nationa, beef and milk output
could not be determined. Neither was it possible to ascertain the full impact of investments financed
through the sub-loans on farm production and productivity. It is recognized by TUs' management and
technicians that the deteriorating economic situation after 'I 986 has brought about considerable
changes in input-output relationships throughout the livestock sector and thus farm development
targets and technical coefficients contemplated in the SAR became distorted. Under these
circumstances, and in the absence of any field data it was not possible to calculate financial razes of
return for benefitting farms.
6.2        Up to the end of 1989 the TU approved 230 sub-loans versus 420 conitemplated by the
appraisal mission. The largest demand was for dual-purpose operations (I144 sub-loans), while for beef
production 82 sub-loans were approved and only 4 for dairy productiori (Part III, 9). This last category
was not contemplated in the SAR. 80% of the beef production and 68% of the double purpose loans
were approved before 1987.
6.3        As to the average size of the sub-loans approved for beef production, they vvere quite
similar to those contemplated at appraisal (US$34,668 and US$34,600), while tho vevwragfL sizc of the
dual-purpose sub-loans approved (US$32, 1 00) was smaller than the SAR estimates (US$41 ,500). This



C 5 -
is probably related to a srnaller dernand for investment funds in roforestation and less costly farm
structures.
6.4        Tho project Sent preferably to larger farms. Of the 230 sub-loans approved, 57% were
channelled to farmns above 150 ha and which received 72%./o of tho total approved up to December
1 989 (Part ill, 10). This is quite understandable since, in general terms, srnaller livestock farms do not
nave clear property titles. During the first years of the project: tie implementation of t..at part of Law
130 which establishes Grade B rnilk was carried out". 'rhe Bank made a condition of effectiveness the
onactment of a revised legislation relating to milk quality, on-farm construction standards and pricing
policies. Although b aw 6 ' was apprcved under the previous livestock loani (1 397-PAN), it was not until
1985 that Grade B miPc was fully estahlished. This meant that tho average unit milk price rose from
below US$0.20 to abiut US$0.28 per liter. As a iresult, the demand for dual-purpose farrm sub-loans
increased and, at the same time, consurners benefitted by receiving moro wholesome milk.
6.5        Another impact of the project was that export quotas for beef were removed, but the
benefits obtained from this were short-lived. Bv 1 987 deboned beef meat exports to the United States
came to a halt, when the lIS Government banned all Panamanian imports. As a consequence, Panama
exported fattened steers to Mexico. The full extent of this operation is not known.
6.6        Under the project the strengthening of the TU continued. Thirteen technical staff were
trained, mostly through . bort coujrses in neighboring countries, Colombia, the USA and Israel (see para
5.9). A limited number of vehicles and office equipment in the amount of about US$ 149.000 were
purchased for the purposes foreseen under the project from the loan amount. At the end of 1989 there
were ten persons working at headq- -i, 'ers in Panama and 17 technicians in the field. By 1986 a
monitoring and evaluation unit was e. L,ished which keeps computerized records of some 30 farm
beneficiaries of sub-loans. The number of farms under this system has expanded only with difficulties
since farmers are reluctant to provide up-to-date information. Apparently, there is a continued feed-
back between this unit and field staff. The TU has remained fairly active, mostly providing technical
assistance to cattle farms and processing short-term credit, financed out of BNP's own resources. The
TU performed well under most difficult circumstances.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1        Despite the post-198d economic crisis, the accompanying political turmoil and the
uncertainties surrounding the deepening recession, BNP has been able to maintain its hignly trained and
qualified Technical Unit. In 1990, the year after the loan closing, BNP was able to process about 480
operations and several conferences and field-days were held to promote changes in production
technologies. While there is a latent danger that many sub-loans may fall into arrears, the institutional
capacity of BNP in expanding milk production through improved technical assistance and supervised
credit continues to exist and can be assumed sustainable.
8. Bank Performance
8.1        Project design was sound and formulation was based on the experience of the two
previous livestock loans. Up to 1 986 Bank's supervision missions were frequent and their technical
composition was in accordance with the needs of the TU. After the Bank suspendea disbursements
on all loans in Panama, supervision continued, but on an irregular basis which is understandable since
on-farm lending came to a standstill. A good rapport was established between Bank staff and executive
|  Law 60 provides the basis for a multiple milk grading system.



6-
and technical personnel of the TU. This was largely the outcoma of the Bank's long involvement - over
12 years - with BNP's livestock projects.
8.2        However, a major fault in project implementation is relazsd to the approval of Loan
2356-PAN in November 1983 when disbursement of the previous project (1 397-PAN) was well behind
schedule (para. 5.3). As a result, disbursements were extremely slow up to end-1985. A more realistic
assessment should have been made by the Bank as to the timing of the appraisal process in view of
the considerable disbursement lags of Loan 1397-PAN. Unpredictable, of course, were the disruptive
effects on the project of the deepening economic and political crisis.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1        Borrower performance was good because of the competent professional staff of the TU,
which largely was the result of the Bank's long involvement in livestock development in Panama; ENP's
management was flexible to deal with everyday's problems of the project. The TUs' technical expertise
improved constantly. In fact, the TUs technical assistance program can be considered as a model in
Panama for providing effective extension to the country's livestock sector. However, small ranchers
did not, by and large, benefit from the project.
9.2        The monitoring and evaluation service introduced through the project was a step in the
right direction, but its effect was relatively limited because of sub-loan beneficiaries' reluctance to
provide adequate information. Because of this technical follow-up, conclusions of the M&E Unit were
rather limited. The borrower fulfilled all the covenants stipulated in the loan agreement (Part III, 7). The
TU provided the Bank each six months with a progress report with detailed implementation data and
BNP's financial statements.
10. Project Relationship
10.1       Bank-borrower relationships were satisfactory and the dialogue, at least up to end-1 986,
between TU's technical staff and the Bank's supervision teams was constructive. Apparently, both
parties benefitted by fine-tuning the implementation of the sub-loans. The project maintained
continuous communications with the Ministry of Agriculture (MIDA) and the National Dairy Commission
(Comision de la Leche) which was decisive in settling the basic issue of lifting the regulations on beef
e ports and introducing Grade B milk. Because of the current and previous projects, the Government's
policy objectives towards livestock development became clearly defined and targeted towards specific
objectives.
11. Consulting Services
11.1       The consultant appointed for the establishment of the monitoring and evaluation service
performed satisfactorily. Other consultances contemplated in the SAR (dual-purpose cattle systems
and pasture management, cattle reproduction efficiency and soil and water consurvation) were not
carried out because of the Bank's suspension of payments.
12. Project D' .. mentation and Data
12.1       There were no major problems in complying with the legal agreements for project
implementation. The Staff Appraisal Report and the Loan and Guaru'!ee Agreements provided an
adequate framework for project implementation.

12.2       The supervision reports and other relevant project documents available at the Bank
generally contained sufficient information for preparation of the PCR. Hcwever, some data required to
complete Part Ill tables were neither readily avai!able nor properly recorded throughout the project
cycle. These included: (i) a planned and revised project timetable, and (ii) the cost of staff inputs.
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Translation of text of letter from Banco Naglonal de Panama. dated March 15. 1991
Ref.: Project Completion Regort. Third Livestock Project (Loan 2356-PAN)
We have received several commun:cations concerning the above-mentioned Project
Completion Report (a letter dated October 12, 1990, a telex dated December 10, 1990 and a fax dated
February 5, 1991), in response to which we wish to make the following comments:
1.         We repeat that we have no objections concerning Part I of this report. We informed you
of this in our fax of December 1 1, 1 990. For your further information, however, we must tell you that,
contrary to what is stated in items 6.1 and 7.1 of Part I of the report in question, the Banco Nacional
de Panama did, in fact, retain the Technical Unit, since it considered it well-equipped and necessary
in terms of the Institution's plans. In addition, the Bank continued and even stepped up the financing
of the livestock sector, using its own funds, and provided loans totalling about US$13.0 million to 477
operations in 1990; these levels exceeded those achieved in several years during the life of the
Livestock Project.
2.         Extension and public information activities were also stepped up with the establishment,
in June 1990, o' the Jornadas Agropecuarias Program by the Banco Nacional de Panama, consisting
in a series of talks to promote technological change in production, with a view to maintaining a
sustainable yield of renewable natural resources, and encouraging the entrepreneurial management of
farms.
3.         Government officials in the agricultural sector, traders, industrialists, manufacturers and
bankers also participate, with an eye to initiating dialogues on the problems of each individual area and
of the sector in general and putting forward strategies, recommendations and solutions. Fourteen
agricultural jornadas were held during an eight-month period, serving 4,000 farmers.
4.        In addition the Technical Cooperation Agreement with the Instituto de Recursos Naturales
Renovables (INRERARE) was renewed and strengthened to include the forestry and soil and water
conservation component on the cattle ranches financed by the Banco Nacional de Panama. Emphasis
is placed on agro-silvo-pastoral practices. A credit policy has been tailored to this activity.
