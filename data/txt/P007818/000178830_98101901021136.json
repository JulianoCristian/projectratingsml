generation of rural employment. These objectives\n            would be achieved through the provision of credit and\n            training to farmers, training and support to BNP's\n            Technical Unit (TU), and promoting the market conditions\n            which would encourage investments in the sector. Sub-loans\n            would be made for some 260 dual purpose (milk and beef)\n            operations and 160 beef production operations. Loan proceeds\n            would finance: (a) livestock; (b) farm structures (mainly\n            fencing and milking facilities); (c) farm equipment; (d)\n            water systems, pasture improvements; and reforestation; (e)\n            vehicles and equipment to TU; and (f) technical assistance\n            and training."}, "docdt": "1983-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
