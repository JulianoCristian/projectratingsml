MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Thailand
Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH) and
Second Highway Sector Project (Loan 3008-TH)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Thailand - Highway Sector Project (Loan
2894-TH) and Second Highway Sector Project (Loan 3008-TH), prepared by the East Asia and
Pacific Regional Office. The Borrower did not prepare Part II.
The two projects, belonging to a series of fifteen road projects to date, aimed primarily at
financing roads maintenance and rehabilitation by the Department of Highways (DOH), the principal
roads agency in the country. The projects had limited institution-building objectives as DOH had
reached institutional maturity years earlier. In fact, the entire roads sector had been performing well
for a considerable time.
Implementation of major civil works suffered initial delays. The primary reason was steep unit
cost increases, caused by the economic boom, and heavy demands on the construction industry, which
required rebidding for contracts. Project implementation took about two years and one year,
respectively, longer than planned. Covenant compliance was good.
The projects contributed to the preservation of roads infrastructure. Ex-post economic rates
of return were high. Completion of a bus transport study, investments in DOH training and removal
of unsafe "black spots" on roads also contributed to sector development.
The Project outcome is rated as satisfactory, the institutional development impact, in view of
the limited institutional objectives, as modest, and the sustainability as likely in a sector which is
advanced and well managed. The PCR quality is adequate.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Highway Sector Project and Second Highway
Sector Project, for which loan 2894-TH and loan 3008-TH were approved on December 15 1987 and
December 3, 1988 in the amount of US$50 million and US$87 million, respectively. Loan 2894-TH was
fully disbursed by February 8, 1993, and the last disbursement under Loan 3008-TH was made on
February 14, 1994, leaving a balance of US$200,124 which was canceled on June 14, 1994.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Country Department I, East Asia
Region, with the assistance of a consultant. The Borrower's executing agencies had not completed Part
II of the PCR at the time this report was prepared. The Report's findings are based on a review of the
documents in the project files at the World Bank and data provided by the Borrower.






PROJECr COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
Highway Sector Project
(Low 2894-TH)
Second Highway Sector Project
(Loan 3008-TH)
Evaluation Summary
Background and Obiectives
1. Since 1963, the Bank has supported the Royal Thai Government's initiatives in the transport sector
with financial and technical assistance through 24 transportation projects totalling US$972.15 million, of
which highways received US$777.1 million (for 13 projects). The Highway Sector Project (loan 2894-
TH, February 17, 1988) of US$50 million and the Second Highway Sector Project (loan 3008-TH, March
1, 1989) of US$87 million, were the first in a series of three highway loans the Bank made to support
the Government's Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (originally for US$998.6 million and revised to
US$1,316.8 million). The total foreign financing also increased from US$200 million to US$471.6
million, which the Bank, along with ADB and OECF, were requested to finance. The executing agencies
for these projects were the Department of Highways (DOH) and the Department of Land Transport
(LTD). The lead agency was DOH.
2. The objectives of the first two highway sector projects were identical: both loans were made to
support DOH's ongoing efforts to: (a) protect past investments in the highway subsector by rehabilitating
and strengthening paved highways and improving road maintenance efficiency; (b) reduce road transport
costs and improve the transport service in order to disperse industrial and other economic activities away
from Bangkok to smaller cities and rural areas; (c) improve road safety; (d) undertake selected road
improvements, and; (e) to begin an effort with LTD to improve environmental control of vehicle air and
noise pollution.
3. Over 90% of the proceeds of both loans were allocated for financing civil works for roads. In
particular, most of the proceeds were to rehabilitate, strengthen, improve and pave national and provincial
roads; widen existing congested roads (to be operated as toll roads) through addition of two lanes;
improve safety conditions throughout the highway network through civil works; and, improve periodic
maintenance and paving programs. The balance of the loans was to be used for training, equipment,
consultant services and air and noise pollution control.
Implementation Experience
4. The conceptual basis of the highway loan was appropriate, timely and innovative. The projects
introduced new approaches for project design, appraisal, financing and implementation with maximum
flexibility and minimum risk potential to both the Bank and Borrower. With the start of the Highway
Sector Project preparation in June 1985 until loan negotiations in October 1987, the Bank took
considerable time to formulate an optimal approach based on Thailand's conditions. During the long
gestation period, extensive interdepartmental briefings, review meetings, and Bank-Borrower consultations
were held so as to identify the relevant issues, refine the conceptual framework and work out the
operational modalities, thereby defining the roles of the implementing agencies and the organization of



iii
the work. The design proved efficient in terms of supervision costs, averaging 6.2 and 5.2 staffweeks
per year for the Highway Sector and Second Highway Sector Projects, respectively.
5. In spite of initial delays and cost overruns, overall implementation of the civil works components was
satisfactory. Once a subproject started, implementation was usually within budget and ahead of schedule,
particularly for projects with contract periods of up to one year. Almost all divergences from thiis pattern
were due to unanticipated and continued high economic growth: Average GDP growth during the Sixth
Development Plan was 10.8%, compared to the 5% anticipated. This forced the Governmllent to revise
macroeconomic planning targets, increase the size of the DOHl Sixth Five-Year Expenditure Program,
revise traffic estimates and modify the designs.
6. The success of the implementation can be attributed to the flexibility of the project design and
organization as well as DOH's capacity to implement complex projects under changing economic
conditions. Also, the good relations between the Bank and Borrower played an important role. This
cordial relationship made it possible to refine the prototype of the sectoral design for highway loans on
a cumulative basis and with no loss of time; at the same time, authorities could address the problems as
they arose. The main areas where cooperation proved productive were in making timely changes to the
size of the Highway Sector Project and in the Sixth Five-Year Highway Development Plan itself, in the
design of road sections and in the transfer of funds and subprojects from one Highway Sector Project to
another.
Results
7.  Although it is too early to assess whether the two projects met all the objectives, qualitative and
quantitative indicators show they helped the Borrower sustain a more efficient road transport system by
focusing on maintenance, strengthening institutional capacity to accommodate traffic increases much
greater than originally expected, and applying resources to enhance DOH's fiscal capabilities. Based on
the indicators, the overall results were good: Most of the specific objectives were met despite initial
delays, design changes and corresponding cost increases. Once begun, the civil works components of
the two highway projects were completed within schedule and, in spite of a general hike in construction
prices, achieved economic rates of return much higher than 12% (the opportunity cost of capital in
Thailand). All covenants were complied with except for delays experienced in receiving audit reports.
DOH's planned total expenditure program was 98 % of its actual budget disbursement for the revised plan.
Maintenance expenditure targets were also met on an annual basis. Feasibility studies and engineering
surveys and designs were satisfactorily executed. DOH's traffic engineering and safety program devised
to eliminate "black spots" covered 491 locations, or 90 % of the 547 originally planned. The construction
of a training institute was completed and training equipment procured. The curricula reviews made many
useful recommendations which were implemented. DOH continued to conduct its training program.
However, LTD's air and noise pollution reduction program was delayed and procurement was deferred
until further review was completed. Loan 2894-TH was fully disbursed at closing, in December 1992,
after an initial one-year postponement. Loan 3008-TH was also fully disbursed except for US$208,124,
which was canceled at the time of loan account closing on June 14, 1994.
Sustainability
8. The Bank-financed subprojects are likely to maintain acceptable levels of net benefits throughout their
economic life. The economic rates of return for the road sections were evaluated at appraisal and on
completion. The latter were much higher than the former, mainly due to the higher traffic growth



iv
experienced. Moreover, sustainability is expected because of the dynamism of the national economy, the
institutional maturity of DOH, a Government commitment to a maintenance-first policy, conservatively
designed pavements, the introduction of improved pavement management systems and concern for air and
noise pollution and other environmental issues. Under Thai conditions, the above factors would have
benefits that would enable it to be sustained.
Lessons Learned
9. Experiences from the two Highway Sector Projects in Thailand suggest the following:
a.     During the economic boom of 1987-91, the maintenance policy and conservatively designed
pavements continued to facilitate economic growth in spite of the high traffic volume. Had
the roads not been well maintained and built in anticipation of such a volume, economic
growth would have been constrained. Moreover, the resources allocated for the Sixth Five-
Year Development Plan would have been diverted to road maintenance according to the Loan
Agreement.  The Thai experience suggests that overall sustainability of highway sector
projects depends as much on past decisions/actions taken or not taken (on maintenance
policy, building institutional capabilities, design standards, trained human resources) as on
the efficiency of current projects.
b.     For successful project implementation under an uncertain macroeconomic framework, strong
institutional capabilities and flexibilities and close Bank and Borrower relations are essential.
c.    The sector design approach, which introduced flexibility into the subprojects management,
can create positive externalities that build on existing infrastructure, and past programs and
strategies.

Back2round
1.    Since 1963, the Bank has supported the Government's initiatives in the transport sector with
financial and technical assistance through 24 transportation projects totalling US$972.15 million, of which
highways received US$777.1 million for 13 projects. The Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH) and
Second Highway Project (Loan 3008-TH) were the first of three highway sector loans the Bank made to
support the Government's original and revised Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (1987-1991). Loan
2894-TH was signed on February 17, 1988, became effective on June 16, 1988, and closed on December
31, 1992. Loan 3008-TH was signed on March 1, 1989, was effective on June 20, 1989, and closed on
December 31, 1993. The executing agencies were the Department of Highways (DOH) and the
Department of Land Transport (LTD). The lead agency was DOH. Part I of the Project Completion
Report covers both projects while separate statistical information (Part III) has been prepared for each.
2.    Thailand has successfully developed a country-wide network of national and provincial paved
roads through its first five development plans (1965-1986); their length increased from 5,451 km in 1965
to 33,000 km by 1986, and reached 40,995.6 km by 1991. The fifth development plan (1982-86) shifted
its emphasis from building new roads to maintaining and upgrading, which included better pavement
management. Total expenditures for these purposes were US$215 million or 30% of the total highway
subsector development expenditures. Maintaining and upgrading roads continued to be the central
concern of the Sixth Development Plan and the share of planned maintenance expenditure was raised to
35% of the total planned development expenditure. The two highway sector projects were made to
support the Government's Development Plan, originally estimated at US$999.6 million--for which the
Government expected to borrow about US$200 million from external public sources. However, with the
addition of new road improvement works, including urgent upgrading of congested roads (some of which
had earlier been planned as concession roads) to meet high traffic growth, the Government increased its
Sixth Five-Year Development Plan from US$998.6 million to US$1,316.8 million and the external
borrowing was raised from about US$200 million to US$471.6 million. The Bank co-financed part of
this increase together with the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB). Specific civil work subprojects to be financed under the loan were to be



selected on the basis of agreed upon technical and economic criteria and procedures. The three toll road
sections with four interchanges included in DOH's program were designed for cofinancing with ADB and
OECF under Loan 3008-TH. The financing arrangement, however, was not interdependent as the
Government identified specific independent projects for each financing institution. The government's own
portion was to be financed, in part, by toll collection. However, the Cabinet established very low tolls,
generating insignificant revenue. The government has dropped tolls on inter-urban roads pending the
results of an ongoing Long-Term Strategic Investment Study which is reviewing tolls as part of the
overall revenue mobilization for the highway sector.
3.     Having recovered from the recession of 1985, the economy of Thailand emerged once again as
one of the fastest growing in the world, while the country underwent rapid urbanization and industry
changed its structure of production. The pace of expansion accelerated in 1986 and 1987 and from 1988-
1991, real growth in domestic production grew at 13.4%, 12.2%, 10.3% and 8.4% respectively.
Correspondingly, since 1986, road traffic continued to grow at an average of 14% on the nation's major
highways and at 15 % on provincial roads while the vehicle fleet grew at an annual rate approaching 20%
in some parts of the country between 1987-90. By 1991, the vehicle fleet numbered 8.5 million, with
road transport representing 88% of freight and 92% of passenger transport services. As a result, road
capacity came under increasing pressure as it was transformed from a growth facilitator to a potential
obstacle, with serious consequences to the export-driven economy.
Pro*ect Obiectives and DescriDtion
4.     Obiectives. Both highway sector projects were designed to support the Government's policy as
described in the Sixth Development Plan, which involved improved maintenance and rehabilitation of the
road network. Specifically, the first two highway projects were to support DOH efforts to: (a) protect
past investments by rehabilitating and strengthening paved highways and improving road maintenance
efficiency; (b) reduce road transport costs and improve transport services over the highway system which
would help disperse industrial and other economic activity away from Bangkok to smaller cities and rural
areas: (c) undertake selected road improvements; and (d) reduce traffic hazards and improve road safety.
The project also included an initial effort for LTD to improve environmental control over vehicle air and
noise pollution.
5.     Project description. The major components of the DOH program, to which the bulk of the loan
proceeds were allocated, were road civil works (91.6% of the US$ 50 million and 96% of the US$87
million). These components included rehabilitating, strengthening, improving and paving of national and
provincial roads; constructing additional lanes for three congested roads (to be operated as toll roads);
improving safety conditions throughout the highway network through civil works; and, improving
periodic maintenance and paving programs. Other components included: the construction of training
centers, the provision of equipment, furniture, materials, and technical assistance; strengthening of DOH's
Material Research Division by providing equipment to assist in field inspections and testing of pavements;
helping the Transport Planning Unit of the Ministry of Communications to improve its transport data
system; and provide technical assistance and equipment to DOH's Maintenance Division. Also, funding
was allocated for LTD's intercity and rural bus study and for its efforts to strengthen its environmental
and noise pollution control program. In addition, the loan would include provision for the Auditor-
General's Office to enhance its auditing capabilities.



Project Desi2n and Ormanization
6.     The conceptual basis of the highway sector loan was appropriate. timely and innovative. It
introduced a new approach for future project design, appraisal, financing and implementation with
maximum flexibility and minimum risk potential to both the Borrower and the Bank. The Bank took
considerable time to formulate the prototype framework in the Highway Sector Project (Loan-2894-TH).
During the long gestation period, extensive interdepartmental and Bank-Borrower consultations occurred
to refine the concept and make it operational by defining the roles of the implementing agencies and the
organization of the works. From the project's inception in June 1985 until loan negotiations in October
1987, Bank staff carried out five missions to develop the operational modality; within the Bank, several
interdepartmental briefs and review meetings were held to identify the relevant issues and refine the
conceptual framework.
7.      Under the new approach, each sector loan financed a specific three-year time slice of DOH's
expenditure program. Any eligible subproject (meeting the minimum 12% ERR, and agreed technical
criteria) could be financed for any length of time up to three years, thereby allowing for full
disbursement. Conversely, in the event the funding was exhausted before the subproject was completed,
it would automatically be transferred to another ongoing sector loan, with the same disbursement
conditions.
8.      The viability of this minimum-risk highway project design rested on three assumptions. First,
the Bank recognized that DOH was a mature institution that could plan and execute the road programs
and carry out the projects. Second, it concluded that DOH's five-year program budget estimates provided
a more adequate framework with which to assess the sector's physical targets and estimate their financing
requirements. Third, since budget estimates were in current prices, annual targets would be adjusted
downwards to reflect changes in fiscal and economic conditions, and DOH would downsize its program
to the revised annual budget by favoring maintenance over construction. Accordingly, the approach made
estimates of DOH's fiscal capabilities the focal point of the Bank's appraisal program.
9.     The chief merits of the time-slice financing were its flexibility and minimum risk both to the
Borrower and the Bank. The Borrower remained responsible for setting priorities and used the loan
proceeds to finance specific projects that met both economic and technical criteria and could, at the same
time, respond to domestic political demands. The approach also meant authorities could limit the project
size and content (rehabilitation, strengthening or maintenance) to reflect macroeconomic conditions. For
its part, the Bank was relieved from rescheduling and had a greater opportunity to fully utilize the loan
for the intended purposes.
10.    The design, appraisal, supervision and reporting requirements were more stringent than those
attached to more traditional approaches, for both the Bank and Borrower. Under the new scheme, the
Borrower was required to carefully review its sectoral priorities against budgetary constraints and its
prospects for external borrowing for the period in question. Also, it required DOH to draw up a works
program that could be started within the Development Plan Period (again, aware of the budget's
limitations). Further, the approach required the Bank to start dealing with the transport sector as a
whole, which involved various agencies and made activities more complex.
11.    The flexible design and organization meant the subprojects and loan funds could be easily
transferred from one sector project to another. It gave DOH broader scope to manage the subprojects.
However, for the approach to succeed, it would need a capable institution to implement the program,



- 4 -
dynamic macroeconomic conditions and a mature transport sector network where the main tasks would
be maintenance, strengthening, and rehabilitation.
Project Implementation
12.    Overall implementation of the Bank-financed civil works components of the Sixth Highway
Expenditure Program was satisfactory. Almost all the variances observed during implementation, except
for initial delays and the cost overrun due to poor soil conditions during construction of the toll roads,
resulted from the unanticipated and exceptionally high growth in GDP (since 1987) not only in Bangkok
and the central Region, but throughout the country. The variances included revised macroeconomic
targets, increases to DOH's total expenditure program and development plan, revised (higher) estimates
of traffic growth, altered designs that, in turn, increased construction costs, a shortage of construction
materials due to the building boom, rebidding of projects due to differences between the engineering
estimates and bid price as well as due to small number of bids.
13.    With a GDP growth rate of 9.6% and 13.4% in the first two years of the Sixth Development Plan
(1987-91) compared to the anticipated annual average rate of 5% for the total period, the Government
revised its planned targets upward for the three remaining years and set a GDP target for the five years
at 8.4%. The actual growth rate turned out to be 10.8%, again surpassing Government expectations, as
the budget registered a surplus; thus, DOH could raise its fiscal capacity and accelerate its investments
in road transport so as to accommodate the high growth in traffic without reducing the maintenance
expenditure.
14.    Projected traffic growth rates for the road sections in the project were also underestimated.
Moreover, with the high actual real GDP growth rate, per capital income surpassed what is considered
the threshold for private car ownership (around US$1,200 per capita); thus, vehicle sales continued to
grow at 40% per annum between 1987-90, which also had a very positive effect on the traffic growth
rate. Freight traffic increased further in response to industrial and commercial expansion and the rapidly
expanding construction industry. As a result, congestion posed potential obstacles to further economic
growth. To sustain the dynamism of the economy while accommnodating the increased traffic, the highway
design standards in many instances had to be changed from the two lanes planned to four or more.
15.    On the supply side, the booming Thai economy, which was driven by increased private
investment, heightened the demand for construction activities. The demand for manpower, especially for
engineers, was high and there were few contractors to bid on civil works. As a result, the costs of the
subprojects were substantially different than the engineers' estimates as were the bid prices, which led
to rebidding in order to meet the Ministry of Finance (MOF) requirements.
16.   In addition to general economic conditions, two other factors affected DOH implementation. The
first concerned delays in starting the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH) and in the Swedish Road
and Traffic Research Institute providing technical assistance for road safety to the National Safety Council
(NSC). For example, although Loan 2894-TH was approved on February 17, 1988 and effective on June
15, 1988, the first disbursement did not occur until February 1989. Initial delays, attributed to the
rebidding and shortage of construction materials, meant the loan closing date had to be postponed from
December 1991 to December 1992. Due to these delays, the funds of Loan 2894-TH were exhausted and
partial financing for nine contracts for about US$3.22 million was transferred to Loan 3220-TH.
However, performance under the first loan was exceptionally good, most projects were executed within
budget and completed on or before the contract date.

17.    The second variation concerned increased construction costs of the interchanges on the three toll
roads financed under Loan 3008-TH. These increases were partly due to poor soil conditions and partly
to changes in design to accommodate the much higher traffic volumes. For example, the number of
grade-separated interchanges was increased from the two to 17. In the final design of the three toll roads,
contracts for 16 road sections and 17 interchanges were identified; of these, Loan 3008-TH financed only
five road sections of 108.6 km and four interchanges. However, due to cost escalations, the four
interchanges were carried over into the Seventh Development Plan, to be financed under Loan 3446-TH.
18.    At appraisal, the Bank expected that DOH's inadequate fiscal capacity might hinder timely
implementation of the Sixth Expenditure Program and divert resources from maintenance to new projects.
This risk was anticipated and agreements were reached with the Government during negotiations that gave
priority to maintenance and rehabilitation over new road construction in the event of resource constraints.
However, actual expenditures were 427% of initial estimates, and the share of maintenance as a percent
of the Development Plan averaged 25 %, which was adequate.
19.   In retrospect, it could be that the maintenance policy (which fostered good road maintenance
practices) and conservatively designed road pavements (for the level of traffic) were two important factors
that helped keep the road network and transport systems from rapidly deteriorating due to the surging
traffic volume.
Project Results
20.   It is too early to assess in detail if the Bank-financed projects in support of the Sixth Development
Plan met all their objectives. However, qualitative and quantitative indicators show the projects helped
the Borrower sustain a more efficient road transport system by enhancing DOH's fiscal capacity and by
insisting on DOH following good maintenance policies. Based on these indicators, the overall results of
the two highway sector loans can be summarized as very good: Most of the specific objectives were met.
despite initial delays, costs overruns and an unexpected macroeconomic environment.
21.    Specifically, the projects were instrumental in accomplishing the following:
a.     Protectin2 past investments and improving road maintenance efficiency. The US$2
million allocated under Loan 2894-TH for periodic maintenance was used satisfactorily
on the 1988 overlay program for 23 road sections. They satisfied the principal condition
of the sector loans which stipulated that in the event of resource constraints, maintenance
would have priority over the development budget in the Sixth Development Plan.
Laboratory and field-testing equipment were procured to strengthen DOH's Material and
Research Division. However, with respect to the road maintenance efficiency sub-
objective, the Bank-financed TA was not used; instead, an ADB grant was applied to
review and improve the pavement management system and pavement design on the basis
of life-cycle cost studies; ADB would also finance hardware and software for the central
road database.
b.     Reducing road transport costs and improving transport services. This sub-objective was
also met satisfactorily. The rehabilitation of 12 road sections of 355.7 km and paving of
15 road sections of 408.3 km under Loan 2894-TH and the upgrading of five road
sections of the three toll roads (for a total of 108.6 km) to much higher capacities than
originally planned under Loan 3008-TH, were completed. Also, economic rates of return



- 6 -
for the road sections financed under both sector projects were found to be higher than
appraisal estimates and above the minimum acceptable (of 12%, equal to the opportunity
cost of capital in Thailand). Finally, LTD's study for intercity and rural bus transport
was completed and some of the recommendations have been implemented under Loan
3446-TH. However, the four interchanges were delayed due to design changes and cost
increases and were transferred for financing to Loan 3446-TH. Contracts for all of road
sections and interchanges financed by ADB and OECF have been completed.
c.     Reducing road hazards and improving safety. In support of DOH's road safety program,
Loan 2894-TH provided US$5.8 million to eliminate "black spots. " Work was completed
on 170 locations in 1988 and on 321 locations in 1989 against the 187 and 360 locations,
respectively, that had been planned, at a total cost of US$11.3 million (Baht 293
million). The remaining "black spots" were funded under Loan 3220-TH. However,
the TA for road safety provided by the Swedish Road Traffic Research Institute to the
National Safety Council was delayed for two years due to administrative difficulties; the
program scope was reduced and the financing for recording accidents, collecting and
analyzing data was transferred to Loan 3446-TH.
d.    Improving environmental control of vehicular air and noise pollution. Funds were
provided for technical assistance to help LTD improve compliance. Due to procurement
delays and a rebidding (because specifications were not complied with completely), this
component under Loan 3008-TH was not funded in a timely manner. Procurement was
therefore deferred and is being carried out as part of a larger package under Loan 3220-
TH.
e.     Providing training and consultant services. A study designed to modernize the training
curriculum was completed and some of the recommendations have been implemented.
The new training center at Chon Buri, financed under Loan 2984-TH, was completed--
but at about three times the initial cost estimates. Staff are being trained, as planned.
Two consulting contracts, for a total of 84 staff-months of expatriate project managers
and supervisors (for road works), and of 204 staff-months of local engineers, were signed
with TECH (Thailand) in association with SMEC (Australia).
Project Sustainability
22.    The Bank-financed subprojects are likely to maintain acceptable levels of net benefits throughout
their economic life. The reasons include the following:
a.     The Government is committed to a maintenance-first policy whereby priority is given to
allocating for maintenance rather than for new construction;
b.     DOH is a mature institution capable of planning, organizing and executing complex
projects and its practice and procedures meet acceptable standards;
c.     The engineering standards were high and the pavements were conservatively designed,
relative to traffic loads;
d.     Measures were taken to reduce traffic hazards and improve road safety;



- 7 -
e.     Efficient maintenance methods were developed, including  improved pavement
management systems;
f.    The high economic growth that increased traffic also generated greater revenues from
road user charges;
g.     The training programs incorporated modern approaches and encouraged efficiency;
h.     The Government began to address air and noise pollution, and subsequent Bank-financed
highway sector projects will open up opportunities to address the negative externalities
that road transport produces.
Bank Performance
23.   Through its support of the Sixth Development Plan, the Bank helped the Government create an
infrastructure policy that promotes sustainable economic growth. All the Borrower's objectives (protect
past investment, etc.) were aimed at achieving sustainable growth in the road transport sector. Through
these projects, the Bank met its objective of using resources efficiently by helping the Borrower focus
on institutional building and implementation of sound maintenance policies. Bank loans also helped ease
the potential resource constraints to continued dynamic growth.
24.    At the operational level, Bank staff also contributed to the success of the sector projects by
recognizing DOH as a mature and capable institution and enabling it to play a new role. The introduction
of the sector project design approach, with its flexibility, helped authorities respond to changing economic
conditions (from the rapid growth experienced) as well as transfer funds and subprojects to exhaust
unutilized funds before the project closing date.
Borrower Performance
25.   The Borrower performed well during the challenging period of unanticipated rapid economic
growth. DOH managed its program well, using public and private agencies, anticipating each phase ahead
of project implementation, preparing for it and making necessary changes when the situation demanded.
26.   The Borrower also complied with agreements reached at negotiations and performed well in
achieving project objectives. DOH showed no significant variation between the revised expenditure
program and the actual appropriation. In fact, disbursement was approximately 98% of the revised
planned expenditure. However, compliance with the audit requirement was not timely, even though funds
were provided for equipment under Loan 2894-TH that would enhance the auditing capacity of the
Auditor General's Office (which audited the project).
Project Relationships
27.   The Bank and the Borrower maintained a good relationship throughout the project's life cycle,
where the changing conditions (between anticipated and actual economic performance) required their joint
effort, creativity and flexibility. The introduction of the sectoral project approach brought new challenges
and Bank and DOH staff cooperated to make it a success. The Bank's recognition of DOH's institutional
capabilities might have created a favorable framework and contributed to the quality of the communication



-8 -
between the parties.
Consultin2 Services
28.    All the local and foreign consultants engaged under both sector projects appear to have performed
well. In general, supervision was considered efficient and the quality of work was also good.
Proiect Documentation and Data
29.    All the basic documents needed to prepare the PCR were available with the Division and some
statistical tables were identified at appraisal for the performance evaluation of the projects. In general,
they were clear and adequate. However, disbursement data compiled by project component were not
readily available from either the Borrower or the Bank. Disbursement data by category, which is
available, is sufficient to confirm that spending levels were consistent with appraisal estimates.
Findin2s and Lessons Learned
30.    The Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (1987-91) was prepared when the economy was in
recession. As stated earlier, the most optimistic original estimate for GDP was an annual average growth
rate of 5 %, while a mid-term review put it at 8.4 %. This was in sharp contrast to the actual average GDP
rate of 10.8% per annum during the project period. One impact of this unanticipated and exceptional rate
was the rapid growth of traffic that threatened to impede the economic boom. Thus, authorities had to
make two upward revisions in the DOH Highway Expenditure Program to cope with the additional urgent
work needed. This included changes to the original design for road sections. The problem was that road
capacity was constrained and construction materials and contractors were in relatively short supply
compared to the excess capacities of 1985. However, with the flexibility provided in the approach, DOH
implemented both projects without major difficulties.
31.    The experience suggests the following hypotheses/lessons:
a.     During the economic boom of 1987-91, good maintenance procedures, a "maintenance-
first" policy and conservatively designed pavements continued to facilitate economic
growth in spite of the problems related to heavy traffic. Had the roads not been well
maintained and built to withstand such heavy traffic, resources would have been diverted
to road maintenance in accordance with the Loan Agreement, which gives it priority.
This suggests that overall sustainability of projects depends as much on past decisions and
actions (good maintenance policy, building institutional capabilities, design standards, and
trained staff) as on efficient implementation of current projects.
b.     For successful project implementation under uncertain macroeconomic conditions, strong
institutional capacities and flexibility along with a close Bank and Borrower relations, are
essential.
C.     The sector design approach, which introduced flexibility into the management of the
subprojects can create positive externalities that build on existing infrastructure, as well
as on past programs and strategies.
