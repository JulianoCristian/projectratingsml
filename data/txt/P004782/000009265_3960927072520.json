Together with the first road sector loan, the\n            project will assist in : (i) protecting past investments in\n            the highway sector by concentrating on rehabilitation and\n            strengthening of paved highways and by improving the\n            maintenance system; and (ii) reducing road transport costs\n            and improving the reliability of services in the national\n            and provincial roads system to facilitate dispersal of\n            industrial and other economic activity away from Bangkok to\n            smaller cities and rural areas. Further to this, the project\n            will provide for the improvement of road safety and the\n            relief of congestion. Also funded will be assistance in\n            improving environmental control of vehicular air and noise pollution."}, "docdt": "1988-11-14T00:00:00Z"}
