The sustainability of\n            the project is highly likely. For both the World Bank and\n            the Borrower, overall performance was satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included the following: The key to a successful\n            project in a post-conflict context, with a newly formed and\n            inexperienced government body, is to establish a\n            well-designed and simple framework for project management.\n            Here, simple but comprehensive responsibility matrices\n            facilitated successful implementation. The Staff Appraisal\n            Report clearly spelled out staffing and functions of the\n            PCUs in great detail. Second, the Borrower should ensure\n            that donors' contributions are properly coordinated\n            with overall program objectives. The education and health\n            ministries will need to develop their institutional\n            capacities to ensure this coordination. Third, timely use of\n            technical assistance is critical for project success; there\n            has been lack of clarity about TA needs and implementing\n            agencies have lacked absorptive capacity. Fourth,\n            operational support to implementing units is critical to\n            establishing technical and managerial capacity. Also\n            integration of the implementing unit into the structure of\n            the ministry, and continuity of implementation staff, are\n            needed for sustained supoport when a project closes."}, "docdt": "2001-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
