The outcome of the Education and Health Rehabilitation Project (EHRP) has been satisfactory, for the
following reasons: (a) the project accomplished its objectives and assisted both the Ministry of Education
(MOE) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in establishing themselves as effective institutions and
developing sustainable sector strategies; (b) it was the first in the Banl's portfolio to target education and
health delivery services in the West Bank and Gaza; (c) it attracted co-financing from major Bank
shareholders, namely Saudi Arabia, Italy, and Australia (see Section 5); and it helped to leverage parallel
financing in the amount of US$294 million for an additional 67 projects in the health and education sectors
(see Annex 8); (d) the success of the project contributed to follow-up projects in both the education and
health sectors; and (e) its investments and activities were completed within the three-year timeframe
envisaged in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).
3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the project were to assist the Palestinian Authority (PA) in: (a) upgrading the physical
infrastructure in the education and health sectors; (b) improving the quality of health service delivery; and
(c) strengthening the institutional capabilities of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE)
and Ministry of Health (MOH). These objectives were consistent with the Bank's strategy, "Emergency
Assistance Program for the Occupied Territories," issued December 1993, and reflected essential priorities
for social development in the West Bank and Gaza at that time. Furthermore, as the education and health
ministries were in the process of institution building and formulating their respective sector strategies, the
project design was flexible enough to respond to changing constraints and opportunities.
During project preparation in 1995, MEHE was the Banks counterpart for the education component. When MOE was
established in 1996, it became responsible for implementation of this component.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of activities carried out exclusively in Gaza.
Component 1: Upgrade Physical Infrastructure (US$15.80m - Education and Health). This
component aimed to: (a) rehabilitate facilities, replace dangerous structures and substandard or undersized
classrooms at 24 basic education schools, and replace or repair broken furniture; (b) construct and furnish
new basic education schools in underserved areas; and (c) upgrade, expand, replace, and furnish 10
primary health care facilities.
Component 2: Improve Quality of Service (US$2.02m - Health ). This component aimed to: (a) initiate
a quality improvement program in primary and secondary services through technical assistance and
training; and (b) support an health education program for schools.
Component 3: Develop Institutional Capacity (US$2.18m - Education and Health ). This component
aimed to: (a) provide technical assistance to develop a five-year plan for the health sector; (b) conduct a
feasibility study on communication links among West Bank and Gaza health facilities to enable the
exchange of medical expertise and enhance the referral system; and (c) provide technical assistance,
training, and operational support to the Project Coordination Units (PCUs). [See SAR, EHRP, May 23,
1995, Annex 7, p.l].
-2-



3.4 Revised Components:
The project components were not revised in content, but their values were revised due to a reallocation of
funds within the IDA credit, and to co-financing from Saudi Arabia (US$20 million), Italy (US$8.65
million), and Australia (US$0.40 million). This ICR evaluates only those activities funded by the Trust
Fund Credit (US$20 million), as provided by IDA under the Trust Fund for Gaza.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Reviews of quality at entry by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) were not being carrried out at the time
of project preparation; QAG had not been set up yet. However, the ICR mission would rate quality at
entry as satisfactory, based on: (a) the consistency of the objectives with the priorities of the education and
health sectors; and (b) the strength of the project design, which accounted for institutional constraints and
risks by incorporating flexibility and by fostering ownership at the ministry level.
This project predated logframe concepts, so the establishment of a formal set of impact indicators was not a
Bank requirement at the time the project was prepared. The SAR (Annex 12, pp. 2-3) did attempt to
establish a framework of monitoring indicators, but during negotiations IDA and the Palestinian teams
could not reach agreement on specific outcome indicators. Therefore, during implementation, monitoring
was carried out on the basis of the agreed-upon project components, which were specific in terms of
quantity and scheduling of activities. Thus, monitoring emphasized physical investments and outputs
rather than impact and outcome.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The achievement of objectives and outputs under the EHRP was generally satisfactory. Considering the
degree of economic, political, and social turmoil during project implementation, the project's achievements
have been remarkable, with all project activities fully implemented.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Component 1: Upgrading of Physical Infrastructure
The outputs of this component were satisfactory for the following reasons: (a) new facilities were
constructed in keeping with improved standards for modem, safe, and reliable electrical, mechanical, and
sanitary installations, which will enhance operation and reduce maintenance costs; (b) under the difficult
economic and political conditions that prevailed during project implementation, the project promoted
business opportunities for local contractors; (c) local construction products were widely used in
construction, thereby creating new jobs in the local market; and (d) the EHRP-supported activities had a
poverty-reduction focus; i.e., the project (i) rehabilitated schools in the poorest areas; and (ii) upgraded
primary health care facilities to make them more accessible to the poor.
Education Sector. Upgrading of physical infrastructure accounted for 98 percent of the cost of the
project's education sector activities, and for 59 percent of overall project cost. All activities originally
envisaged (Annex 9, Table 9.1) were completed, and in some cases exceeded SAR estimates: 30 schools
were rehabilitated, compared to plans for 24; and 8 new schools were built, compared to 7 that were
planned. During project preparation, the dilapidated schools to be replaced and rehabilitated were not
identified; only a budget was allocated. This process forced MOE to set priorities, which it carried out with
competence and equity. Savings were generated by: (a) the competitive nature of the procurement process;
and (b) MOE's decision to merge the PCU into its Directorate General for Buildings and Projects (DGBP).
These savings were reallocated to construction activities.
- 3-



The outputs of this component included: (a) new facilities built to improved standards, which have
minimized the number of uneconomical small classes and saved teacher resources; (b) routine preventive
maintenance, established by MOE, which will improve functionality and lower maintenance costs; (c)
increased equity, in terms of quantity and quality, between schools run by the PA and those run by the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). In addition, the education component helped to
improve girls' and women's access to education and health services through: (a) the provision of
appropriate and adequate sanitary facilities at school sites; and (b) targeting of girl's and co-ed schools.
Sixty-one percent of students benefiting from this component have been girls. Annex 9, Table 9.3 provides
full details of total work done and actual outputs under this component. With the completion of this
component, a total of 22,000 students, 8,050 boys and 13,950 girls, are being served.
Health Sector. This component accounted for 60 percent of the cost of health sector activities and for 24
percent of overall project cost. All of the activities envisaged (Annex 9, Table 9.2) during project
preparation were completed. Health care services are now being provided to a total of 375,000 people in
catchment areas, and to a total of 213,000 outpatients per month. In addition, these facilities now have a
total of 78 day-care beds (Table 9.4). The outputs of this component included: (a) construction and full
staffing of 10 modern health faciltiies, which have reduced variations in the quality and availability of
health services, and increased the availabilty of more comprehensive health services (Annex 9, Table 9.4);
and (b) more equitable allocation of resources to address the needs of women and girls, including (i)
strengthening of maternal/child health care as part of primary health care services; and (ii) health education
targeted to the needs of women and girls. Furthermore, the project has promoted training and recruitment
opportunities for women in professional positions in the sector.
Component 2: Improving Quality of Service
The outputs of this component were satisfactory, for the following reasons: (a) the quality of MOH's health
services was improved; (b) health education for Palestinian school children was introduced; (c) teachers
were trained to be health educators; (d) a professional staff was created for DHPE; (e) new community
health programs were established for pregnant and post-partum women, and to address AIDS, smoking,
and other public health problems; and (f) an Information and Resources Center was established at two
DHPE branches in Gaza, to provide the public with access to health-related materials.
Quality Improvement Program (QIP). The project established an interdisciplinary Quality Improvement
team, which was responsible for introducing continuous Quality Improvement methods to identify and
address quality problems within MOH's health services. Major achievements included: (a) an improved
patient appointment system in Rafidia Hospital, through the introduction of an information system; (b)
significant improvements and cost savings in diabetes case management at hospital level, through the
establishment of treatment and prescription standards; (c) improved quality and efficiency of food services
at the Khan Younis Nasser Hospital; (d) identification of inadequate safety in the radiology department
(e.g., lack of lead shielding), and establishment of safety standards; and (e) training of MOH middle
management staff in QI principles.
While these pilot QI activities were generally successful, the program had the following shortcomings: (a)
the tendency of the QI team to implement QI actions itself rather than facilitating hospital management to
do so, which resulted in the QIP becoming a kind of parallel management structure, thus decreasing
ownership among health care providers and raising concerns about sustainability; (b) the lack of adequate
institutional mechanisms for translating the pilot experiences into broader policy and program changes
within MOH and participating NGO partners; and (c) the tendency to focus on hospital services rather than
primary care services.

Health Education. The overarching goals of this activity, Health Education for Palestinian School
Children (RED-PAL), were to: (a) introduce health education in government elementary schools; and (b)
develop the professional capacity and administrative infrastructure within MOH's newly established
Directorate of Health Promotion and Education (DHPE), in order to carry out projects for other population
groups and on other health topics.
The activity consisted of four core components: (1) training of teachers to function as lead health
educators; (2) preparing educational materials for use by teachers and students in the schools; (3)
organizing school-based activities; and (4) conducting formal process and outcome evaluations. By the end
of the project period, HED-PAL had succeeded in training 370 teachers in 233 schools in Gaza and the
West Bank; preparing 33 various types of educational materials and distributing more than 200,000 copies;
and reaching 80,000 children, including 6,000 who had leadership roles on the School Health Committees
(SHCs). Outputs of this activity included:
a. Initiation of Health Education in Gaza. HED-PAL contributed to: (i) development of MOH
staffs professional capacity; (ii) provision of the basic resources needed to implement health education
activities in the schools; (iii) better coordination between the ministries of Health and Education; (iv)
strengthened monitoring and supervision of school-based health education activities.
b. Improved Health of Elementary School Children. BED-PAL contributed to: (i) educating and
promoting health principles among children through daily school assemblies, broadcasts, and
extra-curricular learning activities, in which parents and health personnel were involved; and (ii)
reducing the incidence of infectious diseases and school absences due to illness, as a result of improved
knowledge and health-related behaviors.
c. Infrastructure Development. HED-PAL also had an impact on the development of DHPE as a
whole, through: (i) development of educational materials for teachers and students; (ii) establishment of
an Information and Resource Center at the two DHPE branches in Gaza City, which are open to the
public and have educational materials for use onsite, for loan, and for distribution; (iii) hiring and
training of a professional staff for DHPE; (iv) networking with other health education-related
organizations; (v) ongoing and new DHPE development projects targeting pregnant and post-partum
women, preschool children, adolescents, male partners of women who are of childbearing age, and
primary health center users; these projects give particular attention to reproductive health, smoking,
drug addiction, hepatitis, AIDS, and zoonoses (animal-borne infectious diseases).
Component 3: Develop Institutional Capacity
Some aspects of this component had less than satisfactory outputs, for the following reasons: (a) the quality
of international technical assistance provided to MOH for preparation of the Five-Year Plan for Health
(1999-2003) was inadequate; and (b) the Communications Link Feasibility Study, designed to address
MOH's need to expand ihe use of information technology, did not provide the desired outputs. The study
included a comprehensive inventory of existing informnation flow and capacity within MOH, but did not
provide adequate analysis of cost-effective options; moreover, the analysis was based only on the existing
situation and did not take into account the expected improvements in information flow as a result of MOH's
modernization.
Other aspects of this component had more positive outputs. The project: (c) contributed to capacity
building of the implementing agencies, PECDAR, MOE, and MOH. These agencies, and especially the
new PCUs established within them to carry out the project, gained considerable experience in project
- 5-



preparation, procurement, implementation, monitoring and supervision, and financial management. The
performance the three agencies and the two PCUs was satisfactory:
(i) PCU/MOE successfully implemented the replacement of dangerous structures and the rehabilitation
of dilapidated schools, after which MOE merged the PCU within the ministry's overall organizational
structure, to make better use of its experience and ensure sustainability of its implementation capacity.
(ii) PCU/MOH took the lead in successfully implementing all project activities related to the health
sector. The PCU, since transformed into a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), with full procurement
responsibilities, is now independently implementing a Bank follow-up project, the first Health System
Development Project (HSDP 1), as well as other health sector projects supported by bilateral donors.
Environmental Aspects. The project was classified "Category B" for environmental issues. Measures
undertaken to reduce the environmental impact of construction activities included: (a) fencing off
construction sites to ensure public safety; (b) disposing appropriately of construction debris at selected
dumping sites; (c) enforcing safety procedures at construction sites (first-aid kits, fencing of balconies and
lift shafts); (d) constructing new facilities so they discharge waste water into municipal sewers or septic
tanks; and (e) segregation and collection of medical waste using colored plastic bags, and of sharp infected
items into "sharp" boxes. Medical waste in plastic bags is collected by municipal garbage collectors and
transported to selected sites. The "sharp" boxes are collected from the clinics once a week and then
incinerated.
In addition, the project supported: (a) training of MOH staff on medical waste collection and disposal, in
cooperation with the Ministry of Environment; (b) training for MOH nurses and doctors on medical waste
management; (c) elaboration of a Manual for Medical Waste Collection and Disposal (ISO 14001),
currently under review by MOH; and (d) training on environmental education and public health for nurses,
doctors, students, and teachers.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
Border closures with Israel, which resulted in delays in some subprojects.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
(a) Lack of timely acquisition of land; (b) lack of tirnely issuance of building pernits; and (c) lack of
proper access to land ~sites for some subprojects.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
(a) Lack of proper coordination among PECDAR and the ministries of Education and Health during the
initial stages of the project, which negatively affected the envisaged training of the ministries' PCU staff;
(b) PECDAR, as operator of the Special Account, required MOE and MOH to submit full documentation

of contractors' payment claims, causing delays in disbursement to contractors.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The Bank appraised the program at an estimated total cost of US$126.8 million, which greatly exceeded
the available financing (US$20.0 million from the Trust Fund for Gaza). Therefore, the PA and the Bank
agreed to proceed with the core project funded by the TFG, within the framework of the larger program.
Annex 8 of the SAR showed all program components (funded by TFG and unfunded), to assist donors in
identifying areas of the program they wished to supporL Extensive efforts by IDA resulted in an additional
US$29.04 million in donor co-financing, which was administered by IDA.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainability of the project is highly likely, for the following reasons: (a) both ministries have shown
strong commitment to and ownership of the project; (b) soon after the physical facilities were completed
and handed over to the ministries, they were all fully staffed and operational; (c) the implementation
capacity gained under the project has been retained by merging PCU staff into the general structure of
MOE, and this capacity will be the basis for implementation of the recently approved Education Action
Project; (d) in the case of MOH, the PCU has added more staff and is successfully implementing a
follow-up project, HSDP 1, under an IDA Credit and bilateral donor funding from the European Union and
the Islamic Development Bank; (e) both MOE and MOH have developed instruments to monitor progress
in project activities, as well as new funding mechanisms, and are now generalizing their utilization to all
projects; the new projects in health and education have added provisions to cover counterpart funding as
well as taxes, thus avoiding the problems encountered in this project due to a lack of funds to cover taxes.
In the case of education, (f) new school facilities have minimized the number of uneconomical small
classes, thus resulting in lower unit costs and better cost efficiency; and (g) routine preventive maintenance
of buildings and equipment, established by MOE, will extend the life of infrastructure. On the health side,
(h) the shortcomings of the project have been taken into account in design of the follow-up HSDP I, which
has downsized the QIP team and clarified its role as one of facilitation and support rather than direct
implementation; and (i) QIP activities are now better integrated into the MOH program, and include
broader participation of NGOs.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Most project activities were, from the beginning, integrated into the regular operation of the ministries, thus
minimizing the need for special transition arrangements. However, the project was envisaged as the first
phase of a longer-term investment program, financing for which was not immediately available at the time
the project was prepared.
Additional financing, as provided by the Bank through the follow-up projects, was necessary to realize the
-7-



full potential of the process, and effectively utilize the systems and skills the project has created.
Furthermore, on the PA level, the arrangement counterpart contributions under the follow-up projects has
contributed to a smooth transition to regular operations.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The performance of the Bank was satisfactory. The Bank recognized and responded to the urgent needs of
the client under difficult circumstances; i.e., newly established institutions, lack of clear sector policy, and
lack of certainty on the political front. A comprehensive Bank mission with the required expertise was
fielded in February/March 1995, and appraised and prepared the project in fewer than four months. The
project was approved in July 1995 and became effective in September 1995. Notwithstanding this tight
schedule, project documentation prepared during appraisal, as well as the Implementation Volume, were
excellent and have greatly facilitated the work of the PCUs and the ministries.
The project identified activities that reflected essential priorities for social development in the West Bank
and Gaza, which were consistent with the Bank's strategy, "Emergency Assistance Program for the
Occupied Territories." Furthermore, the project design was adequate and flexible enough to take into
account the risks and institutional constraints associated with implementation. Lessons learned from
EHRP's institutional arrangements, counterpart contributions, and tax issues were reflected in the design
and implementation of follow-up projects.
7.2 Supervision:
Project supervision was satisfactory. The project was supervised by the Bank team based in the field
office. The team comprised a Senior Urban Planner (Task Manager of the project) and a Civil Engineer
(operations officer) with adequate experience in construction. The team maintained close and continuous
monitoring of implementation by: (a) advising the implementing agencies on delineation of roles and
responsibilities regarding project implementation; (b) carrying out adequate follow-up of agreed-upon
actions; (c) enforcing loan covenants; (d) showing flexibility in suggesting or approving needed
modifications; (e) visiting the construction sites and participating in construction meetings with the
implementing agencies and the contractors, to clarify issues and help resolve disputes; and (f) establishing
good working relationships with the implementing agencies, co-financiers, and other partners.
In addition, during project implementation, several comprehensive supervision missions that included the
necessary expertise were fielded from Headquarters to monitor sector-related activities; their work
complemented the expertise of the field-based team (see Annex 4). In total, there were 16 supervision
missions with a good balance of technical expertise, including an economist, education specialist, health
specialist, implementation specialist, and textbook specialist. In the early stages of implementation,
progress was rated unsatisfactory, reflecting in part the difficulties of coordinating different public
agencies. After coordination was improved, the project had a consistent rating of satisfactory for both
implementation progress and achievement of development objectives. This was due in part to open
communication with the government, which made it possible for the Project Status Reports (PSRs) to
realistically assess progress in implementation and in achieving the development objectives. Bank
supervision played a key role in overcoming implementation bottlenecks, particularly when conflicts arose
between contractors and implementing agencies, and among different government agencies in regarding
who was responsible for securing permits to undertake civil works (PECDAR and MOE, for example).
The Bank team also played a key role in providing information to contractors on contracting conditions,
construction procedures, use of reporting forms, and processing of payments.

7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. EHRP was the first of the Bank's portfolio in the West Bank
and Gaza to address education and health delivery services on this scale. The experience and benefits
gained under the project have increased the ministries' confidence in the Bank, and particularly in the role
the Bank can play in promoting sector-related policy. Both ministries have expressed their interest in
participating in follow-up projects with the Bank, and the Bank has responded positively.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The borrower (PECDAR) was not involved in the preparation of the project; MEHE and MOH were IDA's
counterparts at the preparation stage. The perfornance of MEHE (and later MOE) and MOH was
satisfactory. At the time of preparation, there was close cooperation between the ministries and the Bank.
The leadership and vision provided by the counterparts ensured that the program would be appropriate to
their needs.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The implementation performance of the PA was satisfactory. Although the PA was not involved in the
initial phase of project preparation and implementation, and the project design reflected the PA's inability to
bear a share of project cost, the PA nevertheless provided land sites, basic infrastructure, and building
permnits for schools and clinics.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The performance of the implementing agencies was satisfactory. At negotiations it was agreed that, to
expedite project implementation during the first 12 months, PECDAR (with its past experience in
implementing Bank projects) would assist MEHE/MOE and MOH in the procurement of civil works and
goods exceeding $250,000 equivalent, through joint committees. After this period, PECDAR,
MEHE/MOE, and MOH were expected to review the implementation arrangements, in consultation with
IDA, with the aim of devolving full responsibility for project implementation to the two ministries.
Although jurisdictional disputes among the three agencies caused initial delays, all parties eventually agreed
to adhere to the roles and responsibilities set out in the SAR.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall performance of the Borrower was satisfactory. Building on past experience, and in cooperation
with both MOE and MOH, the Borrower established monitoring and reporting procedures, maintained
adequate financal records, and provided IDA with timely audit reports.
8. Lessons Learned
*   The key to a successful project in a post-conflict context, with a newly formed and inexperienced
govermment body, is to establish a well-designed and simple framework for project management. In the
case of West Bank and Gaza, simple but comprehensive responsibility matrices facilitated successful
implementation. The SAR (Annex 10) clearly spelled out staffing and functions of the PCUs in great
detail.
*   The Borrower should ensure that donors' contributions are properly coordinated with overall program
objectives. MOE and MOH will need to develop their institutional capacities to ensure this
coordination; particularly, in the case of MOE, to coordinate donors' contributions to the new
IDA-financed Education Action Project.
*   Timely use of technical assistance is critical for project success. Donor-funded assistance has not
-9-



always been available when the implementing agencies needed it, due to a lack of clarity about TA
needs and agencies' own lack of absorptive capacity.
*   Operational support to implementing units is critical to establishing technical and managerial capacity.
In addition, integration of the implementing unit into the structure of the ministry, and continuity of
implementation staff, are essential for sustained capacity once a project has closed.
*   Taxes should be factored into project costs. The project ran into funding shortages because of the
assumption of zero taxes, and the failure to anticipate that the Ministry of Finance would introduce a
VAT during implementation. In subsequent projects, separate categories have been created to cover
both taxes and counterpart funding.
*   The parameters for technical assistance must be clearly spelled out, to avoid the creation of a parallel
management structure and ensure that the beneficiary develops its own implementation capacity. For
example, component 2 established an interdisciplinary Quality Improvement team to work with
hospitals, but the QI team had a tendency to take over the implementation of the activities rather than
facilitate implementation by the hospitals.

Additional Annex 8. Program Co-financiers
Bank Group Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement: Bank policy for the West Bank and Gaza,
at project appraisal, had four main objectives that had been identified in close collaboration with the
Palestinian counterpart team in December, 1993, and formed the basis for the "Emergency Assistance
Program for the Occupied Territories." These were to: (a) restore and further develop basic and social
infrastructures; (b) build policymaking and institutional capabilities; (c) support emergence of the private
sector; and (d) sustain the financial viability of the PA. The Bank has been in the forefront of institutional
efforts to help the PA define a feasible rehabilitation and development strategy. It has played a prominent
role in setting a policy and investment framework with: (a) a six-volume study, "Developing the Occupied
Territories: An Investment in Peace"; (b) establishment of the US$50 million Trust Fund for Gaza (TFG),
from its own surplus, in 1993 (allocating US$30 million to the Emergy Rehabilitation Project and US$20
million balance to this project); and (c) acting as administrator of the Technical Assistance Trust Fund and
the Holst Fund (the latter for recurrent-cost financing). As the Secretariat for the Ad Hoc Liaison
Committee, the Bank supplies regular information and analysis on aid flows and requirements to all parties.
[SAR - May 23, 1995, para. 1.18, p. 6]
For this project, the Bank developed a program of US$126.85 million, and provided US$20.00 million
from the TFG. The project attracted a total of US$29.04 million in co-financing from other donors. A
summary of donors' contributions and areas of support is given below.
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributed a grant of US$20.00 million, divided equally between education
and health. The grant became effective in February 1997. The contribution supported construction,
expansion, furnishing, and equipping of education and health facilities, in addition to consultancy services
for design and supervision. As of end September 2001, 87 percent of funding has been committed and 80
percent has been disbursed. The closing date was extended until December 2002 to allow for the
completion of remaining components.
Government of Italy contributed three grants totaling US$8.65 million, the first (US$1.85 million) and the
third (US$5.8 million) supported education-related activities, and the second (US$1.0 million) supported
health-related activities. The grants became effective in August 1997, August 1999, and November 1999,
respectively. The contributions supported construction, expansion, furnishing, and equipping of education
and health facilities, including community centers for the handicapped; curriculum development; provision
of teaching and learning aids; and consultancy services for design and supervision. As of end September
2001, 66 percent of funding has been committed and 47 percent disbursed. The closing date for the three
grants was extended until December 2002 to allow for the completion of the remaining components.
Government of Australia contributed a grant of US$0.40 million, which became effective in July 1996.
The contribution supported policymaking and planning capacity in MOE, (establishment of pilot schools
mapping and maintenance scheduling database), and training of relevant personnel in the use and updating
of the database. The grant is fully committed and disbursed. The closing date was December 1999.
Building on the success of the EHRP, the Bank has developed other infrastructure projects that attracted
another US$29.71 million in co-financing from other donors for education and health sector-related
activities. The table below summerizes the involvement of the Bank and other donors (including those under
EHRP):

As the PA institutions were being established, the Bank shifted from emergency assistance to development
and adopted a sectoral approach in lending operations. Other donors followed this sectoral approach, and
the Bank provided bilateral funding to both MOE and MOH. The tables below provide full details.

Additional Annex 10. Borrower's Evaluation
IMPLEMENTAION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
WEST BANK AND GAZA
EDUCATION AND HEALTH REHABILITATION PROGRAM (EHRP-IDA)
(Trust Fund Credit # 26065)
PECDAR's (Implementing Auencv) Comments
The main objectives of the fund were fully and successfully achieved through upgrading health
and education physical infrastructure, strengthening the institutional capabilities of Ministry Of
Education (MOE) and Ministry Of Health (MOH) and improving the quality of health services
as well as health education. Altogether 32 projects were implemented through the fund for
education and health sectors. 22 projects were for education (369 classrooms), which served
about 23,000 students and 10 projects are for health in 7 major cities in Gaza with a total area
of 11,805 m2 that served about 213,000 patients per month.
The created job opportunities (direct and indirect laborers) were associated to improve the
construction industry and several related economic and financial services. The civil and supply
works components were implemented in compliance with the World Bank procurement
guidelines. This ensured fair competition, reasonable construction and supply cost.
The tangible indicators that shaped the implementation phase of EHRP-IDA could be
summarized as follows:
1- The main overall obiectives and merits of implementinfL the fund:
* Upgrading parts of the physical infrastructure in education and health sectors. The
achievements were great and served as mitigation measures all the devastating conditions that
faced the two sectors in the targeted areas. As to the health sector it promoted the provision
of local treatment that relieved patients' sufferings. Within the education sector it reduced the
classrooms' over crowdedness and solved partially multiple shifts' problems contributing to
better and healthier educational environments.
* Strengthening the institutional capabilities of MOE and MOH. This objective was
successfully achieved through gaining considerable experience in various disciplines.
* Improving the quality of health services as well as health education through QIP and
HED-PAL projects that are regarded as catalysts for a dynamic process of development.
2- Proiect Implementation output:
* It created employment opportunities for different labor categories (over 86,670 persons)
contributing to the different engineering and administrative sectors. Implementation induced
all these sectors for development.

* The project created the atmosphere needed for the development of the construction
industry, which absorbed skilled snd semi-skilled laborer.
* Many support services were developed such as banking and insurance services.
3- Weakness factors that affected the rapid implementation:
* The weak and modest capacity and mobility either financial or technical of the private
sector (consultants, contractors and suppliers) to mobilize fund was the main factor in the
slow disbursement of the committed allocation.
*  The capacity building of many LGU's institutions was under development, which delayed
the implementation in the first period due to the lack of the required land, preparing it and the
issuance of building permits.
* The severe closures imposed on the Palestinian areas hampered the transportation of
goods and discouraged investment in the local construction industry.
4- Difficulties faced durins the implementation with the assigned time horizon:
* Starting the establishment of Project coordination Units (PCUs) simultaneously with the
starting of the project delayed the implementation in the first period.
* The biding documents to implement some projects from which consultant firms have to be
hired for the provision of consultancy services to prepare the desgin and tender documents for
implementation were not ready, which caused delay.
*  It was important to re-specify many of the construction methodology to fit with the
employment target and to the encouragement of local investment.
Nevertheless, all counterparts: the World Bank, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education,
PCU unit and benefited municipalities were cooperative and showed magnificent interest in
implementing the program to their best which in turn led to a successful conclusion of the
Fund, achieving all the pre-drawn objectives and goals.
