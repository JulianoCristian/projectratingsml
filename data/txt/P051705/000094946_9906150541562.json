aims\n            to increase economic activity along the Fuzhou-Shenzhen\n            high-priority transport corridor through relieving\n            congestion, facilitating trade and mobility, and helping\n            increase efficiency and traffic safety in Southern Fujian.\n            There are three project components. The first component\n            constructs an expressway, a divided, four-lane,\n            access-controlled toll highway; interchanges; service areas\n            providing facilities for refueling and vehicle repair,\n            restaurants, parking and rest stops; facilities for\n            expressway administration and maintenance; and electrical\n            and mechanical installations for toll collection, traffic\n            monitoring, telecommunications and tunnel lighting, and all\n            interchanges and annex areas. This component also improves\n            existing and constructs interconnecting roads as well as\n            other roads, provides equipment, and funds construction\n            supervision services. The second component funds studies and\n            technical assistance in highway maintenance management, and\n            toll rates and road safety; and designs an institutional\n            development plan. This component also trains staff in\n            programs covering all aspects of highway planning, design,\n            construction, operation, finance, and maintenance. The third\n            component supports a front-end fee while the fourth\n            component finances land acquisition and resettlement mainly\n            through providing compensation at replacement cost and subsidies."}, "docdt": "1999-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
