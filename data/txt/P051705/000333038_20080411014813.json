    Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            measures included in the project to prevent or reduce\n            occurrence of problems, mainly related to engineering\n            designs, bid documents, and quality control during\n            construction were appropriate and did contribute to reducing\n            problems that had happened in past projects. However, more\n            could have been done in further strengthening the detailed\n            designs to allow better estimations of resettlement needs\n            and bid market prices, as well as in undertaking more\n            extensive geological investigations to reduce the amount of\n            variation orders and increases in the initial contractual\n            costs. Added emphasis in these activities is essential to\n            strengthen the quality of the overall preparation of future\n            similar type of projects. The project showed that in the\n            case of the Zhangzhou Zhao'an Expressway (ZZE) some\n            items, such as number of houses relocated, turned out to be\n            close to twice as large as the initial estimate. While final\n            compensation payments reflected the more detailed designs\n            and the actual impact of the new construction, a better\n            initial assessment will have permitted a better budgeting of\n            expenses and ensuring that funds were available when needed."}, "docdt": "2007-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
