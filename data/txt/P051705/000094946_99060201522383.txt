1 INTRODUCTION
This Environinental Action Plan (EAP) covers the EAP for Zhangzhou-Zhaoan
Expressway both in the construction phase and in the operation one. It is compiled
based on the assessment conclusions and major environmental issues in the Statement
of Environmental Impact Assessment, the approval documents of the Environmental
Protection Office of Ministry of Cornmunications and State Enviromnental Protection
Administration (SEPA), as well as the memorandums of the meetings attended by the
senior enviromnental specialist from World Bank on May 1998, Oct. 1998 and March
1999.
The construction of the road section KO+000-K8+000 and the proposed
environmental protection mitigation measures in the EIA/EAP of the road section
KO+000-K8+000 will not be financed by the World Bank Loan for this project.
However, Fujian Provincial Communication Department (FPCD) will implement the
environmental protection mitigation measures of this road section according to the
requirements of the EIA/EAP.
The enviromnental management and monitoring plan during construction and
operation periods are put forward according to the conclusion of environmental impact
assessment and major environmental problems in the EIA statement, and the
authorization reply to the EIA outline from EP Office of MOC, and NEPA.
1.1 Project Description
The proposed Zhangzhou - Zhaoan Expressway is an access-controlled, grade-
separated expressway with divíded two lanes in each direction and with a total length
of 140.459km. There are two major link road: 5km Dongyuan-Fugong Link Road is
access-controlled class 1 highway; 8km Huxi-Fuotan Link Road is class 2 highway.
1.2 Assessment Standards
1. Assessment Scope
Social environment-Directly impacted areas on both side of the expressway;
Social economy- Directly and indirectly impacted areas;
Ecological, acoustic, atmospheric and surface waters environment - Areas within
200m from both sides the expressway. Earth borrowing and spoil sites should be
involved in the assessment scope.
2. Assessment Standards
Considering the characteristics of EIA of expressway project and the natural
environment in different sections, EIA of this project is based on the following
standards:
(1) For ecosystem
I



Standard for Soil Environrent Quality " GB15618-1995, Class 2, the lead
content in soil is limited as Pb<350mg/kg.
" National Food Sanitation Standard of Lead Limitation " GB14935-94, lead
content in crops is limited as follows: for beans: Pb<0.8mg/kg, for potatoes: Pb<
0.4mg/kg, for vegetables: Pb 0.2mg/kg, for cereals: Pb 0.4mg/kg.
(2) For noise
"Environmental Noise Standards in Urban Areàs ", GB 3096-93.
Class 1 standard ( 55dB in daytime, 45dB in nighttime ) is adopted for schools and
hospitals;
Class 2 standard ( 60dB in daytime, 50 dB in nighttime ) is adopted for densely
residential sites between 100 - 200m from the road side;
Class 4 standard (standard 70dB in daytime, 55 dB in nighttime ) is adopted for
residential sites within 1 OOm from the roadside.
(3) For surface water quality
t Surface Water Quality Standards " Class II and Class III in GB3838-88
(Table 1-1), " Seawater Quality Standards " GB3097-97 (Table 1-2), and " Fishery
Water Quality Standards ", GB1 1607-89 ( Table 1-3) are used. Because there is no SS
(Suspended Solid) standard for surface water, the SS of irrigation water is used. The
limitations are: 150mg/1 for water farming irrigation water, 200 mg/l for dry farming
irrigation water, and 100 mg/1 for vegetable irrigation water.

1.3   Major Conclusions of the Environmental Impact Assessment
1. EIA on Ecological Enviromnent
(1) The perTnanent acquired land by construction of this project is 11385 mu,
which will induce 20.2926 million yuan worth of annual loss on grain production,
2608mu orchard acquired-will induce 52.16 million yuan annual loss; 195 mu fishpond
acquired induce 5.85 million yuan annual loss.
(2) In this EIA assessment, the total area of plantation for road side, separation,
service center, interchange, and both sides of the road is 10269.07 mu, which is
53.25% of the engineering land occupation.
(3) In the rather long period of construction, a large amount of earth and stone
works may cause the deterioration of vegetation, and make worse the situation of soil
erosion. It is predicted that the soil erosion volume will be 5.211 times of that before
the construction of this project. To mitigate the situation of soil erosion, this EIA
statement put forward the measures as 66 places of large area siope protection, 7
3



chosen spots of spoil plants, 10269.07 mu total area of plantation along the road, which
is 53.25% of the engineering land occupation.
2. EIA on Social Environment
(1) Construction of this project will improve the investment environment of local
areas, it will surely promote the regional economic development.
(2) In the assessment scope within 200 m along the proposed highway, there are
65 villages, 14 schools, and 1 hospital. Altogether 20858 m2 of concrete brick mixed
house; 41161 m2 of brick, wood and stone house; 2126 m2 of simple constructed house
will be demolished. Although economic compensation will be given to the resettled
families, there is still a lot of inconvenience brought to the residents.
(3) To minimize the adverse impact on residents by the separation of highway,
altogether 9 interchanges, 79 grade separations and 292 underpasses will be built to
satisfy the necessary of local residents.
(4) During construction of the expressway, the construction vehicles may damaged
the local roads to some extent, repairing work should be done by the construction unite
after construction.
(5) Measures should be strengthened for the management of the expressway to
eliminate traffic accidents.
3. EIA on Acoustic Environment
(1) According to investigation and monitoring, the acoustic environment along the
alignment is quite good except for Beitou and Changmaolin where the noise at night
exceeds class 2 standards.
(2) The prediction telis us that the acoustic environment will be impacted
significantly in operation. The excess ratio in short term, mid term and long term
operation is 68.8%, 72.5% and 77.5% individually.
4. EIA on Environmental Air Quality
(1) Concentrations of CO, NOx and TSP in the Study Areas meet class 2 standards
in GB3095 - 1996, so the air is quite good.
(2) Predicted concentrations of CO and NOx by 2020 in operation will not exceed
assessment standards of ambient air, so the operation of the highway will not have
significant impact on environment.
(3) During the construction phase, fugitive dust from hauling trucks will pollute
the air, so mitigation measures will be taken. Water spraying will be done regularly at
construction sites and roads. 4 new spraying vehicles have been prepared, each
construction site will provided with a simple spraying vehicle.
(4) The asphalt for pavement will come from mixing stations. The Asphalt mixing
equipment will be equipped with dust collectors and wili be located at least 300 m
from residential areas on the down wind directions. The locations of asphalt mixers
will be determined in construction drawing design stage because they are related to the
4



locations of construction sites. Open or half-open operation will not be allowed. The
asphalt and concrete mixers must have dust removing installations.
(5) The design mechanical ventilation for Kuzhishan Tunnel is 2,352 m3 / min, 12
axial fans needed. While the design mechanical ventilation for Dabushan Tunnel is
1,825 m3 / m of ventilation, 8 axial fans needed.
(6) Beginning from Jan. 2000, only lead-free petrol can be used all over the
country. Therefore the exhausting gas from traffic vehicles will not result in lead
pollution to air and soil.
5. EIA on Surface Water Environment
(1) Assessment results and analysis of present water quality
a. Nanxi Stream of Jiulongjiang River System
The water quality of Nanxi Stream met the adopted Surface Water Quality
Standard (Class III), but exceed the adopted Seawater Quality Standards (Class 2).
b.Yiangmei Reservoir
The water quality of Yiangmei Reservoir satisfied the adopted Surface Water
Quality Standard (Class II).
c. Jiouzhen Port
The water quality of Jiouzhen Port satisfied the adopted Sea Water Quality
Standard (Class 2).
d. Zhangjiang River
The water quality of Zhangjiang River met the adopted Surface Water Quality
Standard (Class III), but exceed the adopted Seawater Quality Standards (Class 2).
e. Zhaoanwan Port
The water quality of Zhaoanwan Port met the adopted Seawater Quality Standards
(Class 2).
(2) According to the prediction calculation, except for the oil index of the water
quality of Yangmei reservoir and Nanxi Streamn, the water quality of the other surface
waters along the alignment will meet their assessment standards when the proposed
highway being put into operation.
(3) The construction of extraordinary large bridges will induce unfavorable impact
on water bodies.
2 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION MANAGEMENT PLAN
2.1 Environmental Protection Measure
1. Protection Measures for Ecological Envirornnent
(1) In the construction stage, the following measures will be taken to protect
ecosystems. The construction procedures and sequences will be well arranged. It will
5



be constructed section by section and the period of construction will be as short as
possible. In the early construction, the following works will be completed at the sarne
time if possible: subgrade, slope protection, drainage, retaining walls, plantation of
trees and grass. In this way, the vegetation will be restored very soon and soil erosion
will be reduced to a great extent. It is suggested that after the subgrade works and
protection works are completed, the earthworks of another section be started.
(2) Management of temporary land use will be enhanced. As soon as the
construction is finished, the land for temporary úse will be restored and rehabilitated
without any unreasonable delay.
(3) To ensure flood discharge and irrigation, the construction of bridges and
culverts will be conducted prior to other works.
(4) No waste earth and stones will be allowed dumping freely. Spoil, slugs and
domestic garbage will not be perminted to be dumped on the siopes of valleys to
prevent from silting rivers or irrigation canals.
(5) Borrow sites and spoil sites will be reconstructed or leveled on completion of
the works for rehabilitation and plantation.
(6) The top soil layer will be saved and returned to the land after the construction
work is completed to minimize impacts on ecosystem and agriculture.
(7) Measures and Suggestions about Vegetation Restoration
a. Plantation of roadsides and medium dividers
The scope from the shoulders on both roadsides to the boundaries of right-of-way
and dividers will be treed or grassed; the total plantation area of both dividers and
roadsides is 515.27 mu and 8,412.6 mu respectively.
b. Plantation of Interchanges
Calculated according to the Drawings for Interchanges, the areas to be greened are
estimated to be 120 mu. There are 9 interchanges, covering 1,108 mu of plantation.
c. Plantation of service centers and toll stations
There are 11 toll stations and 2 service centers. If one toll station needs 3.6 mu and
one service center needs 6.6 mu for plantation, the total plantation area will be 46.2mu.
d. Plantation of tunnel portals and two ends of extra large bridge approaches
There are two tunnels and 7 especially large bridges. If each portal needs 20 mu
and each bridge needs 25 mu for plantation, there will be 215 mu for plantation put
together.
2. Mitigation Measures of Impacts on Social Environment
(1) Mitigation Measures of Impacts of Land Acquisition and Resettlement
a. Institutions responsible for the land acquisition and resettlement at different
levels will be established prior to the commencement of the construction.
b. The resettlement office of this project is responsible to make the statistics of the
amount of acquired land exactly for compensation on the basis of policy and
6



regulations.
c. The compensation will be sent directly to the bottom organizations for
argritertiary or argribusiness to increase income of the farmers.
d. Part of the compensation will be sent to the farmers whose land are acquired to
compensate the economic loss.
e. For the households that will lose land, the cultivated land will be realloted to
them or they will be resettled by providing employment opportunities by the local
government. In China, land belongs to the state, reallotment of land to them ís easy to
come true.
f. The resettlement office of this project will directly send the compensation for
young crops to their owners to ensure that their life will not be impacted.
(2) Mitigation measures for resettlement include
a. The households to be removed will be resettled prior to the beginning of the
project.
b. The resettlement office of this project is responsible to make the statistics for the number of
the householders to be removed exactly for compensation on the basis of the policy.
c. Resettlement wilI be carried out with the help of the local government, and the
funds for compensation shall not be used for other purposes.
d. Resettlement places will be planned by the local government to save land
resources.
(3) Irrigation Protection Measures
a. The construction of facilities related to irrigation or streans such as small
bridges, culverts, aqueducts or canals will be conducted before the rain season. And the
construction will be completed before the rainy seasons to ensure the farmland
irrigation.
b. 68 medium or small bridges and 585 culverts, with an average of one culvert at
an interval of 31 5.6m, have been designed to ensure smooth flow of water irrigation
canals or streams, and the acceptance of water in ponds will not be blocked.
3. Mitigation Measures against Noise
Due to the great traffic volume, the noise will be significant excess of the
standards. So, the following measures will be taken at the sensitive locations of excess.
(1) Due to the impact of noise, 2 schools and part of the buildings of the 27
villages will be removed. See Table 2-1.
(2) There will be all together 20 places of soundproof screens with a total area of
10450m2. See Table 2-2 for their specific locations.
(3) There will be 18 places of heightening surrounding walls with total area of
7780m2., see Table 2-3 for locations and amounts. As to the afforestation for noise
mitigation, the forest area planted should be wider than 1 Om. The noise level reduced
is about 2 dB. See Table 2-1 for the locations.

4. Environmental Air Protection Measures
(1) Measures against Construction Dust
Quarries, material borrow sites and transportation routes to construction sites
were identified as the major places that create dust and other air pollution.  Road
surfaces, excavation areas and construction sites will be sprayed with water and kept
moist particularly near town and villages. By doing so the dust can be reduced by 70%.
The trucks transporting earth and stones will be covered to prevent air pollution.
(2) Measures against Asphalt Smoke
The proposed highway will be paved with asphalt, so a great amount of asphalt
12



will be used. The asphalt for pavement will come from mixing stations. The Asphalt
mixing equipment will be equipped with dust collectors and will be located at least
300m away from the residential areas on the down wind directions. The locations of
asphalt mixers will be determined in construction drawing design stage because they
are related to the locations of construction sites. Open or half-open mixing of asphalt
will be absolutely forbidden. The asphalt and concrete mixers must have dust
removing installations.
(3) The design mechanical ventilation for Kuzhishan Tunnel is 2,352 m3 1 min, 12
axial fans needed. While the design mechanical ventilation for Dabushan Tunnel is
1,825 m3 1 m, 8 axial fans needed.
(4) Mitigation measures for the accidents in the tunnels:
a. More than 50% of the ventilation fans should operating routinely in the
accident inspection period.
b. Multi-source electricity supply systems should be arranged for tunnels.
Electricity supply should be resumed in a short period of time by adjusting
switch operation in case of electricity cuti off.
(5) The safety protection measures considered in tunnel designing are as follows.
a. Fire hydrants will be built.
b. Expressway emergency telephone system will be built.
c. i.5cm thick fireproof materials will be paved on the inner surface of the
tunnels.
d. Crossing passageways will be built in the long tunnels.
(6) Training plan for members of tunnel management groups will be been made.
Fire fighting equipment and vehicles will be provided.
(7) The waterproof measures in the tunnels should be adopted. Although the
exploration revealed the Dabushan Tunnel locates in an area with low water content,
the waterproof layer for the tunnel still should be planed in the design.
5. Water Environmental Protection Measures
(1) Suggestions against pavement runoffpollution
a. Roadside drainage will not be discharged directly into rivers or fishponds.
Runofffrom pavement of Xinxu Bridge will not be discharged into Yangmei Reservoir.
The drainage and runoff water should be drawn into irrigation channels by roadside
ditches.
b. The drainage system will be provided with gates and/or other settling facilities
before the wastewater discharged into the river.
c. In case of emergency such as spills of oil, chemicais or toxic substances, lhe
water gates will be closed to prevent pollution of the water bodies.
(2) Environrental Protection Measures in Service Centers
a. Filling stations and car-washing shops will be installed with oil separating tanks,
13



and the water will be recycled;
b. The service centers will be provided with class 2 sewage disposal device. After
treatment, the wastewater must satisfy the standard requirement before discharging.
The domestic sewage from restaurants and toll stations will be treated in septic tanks.
The treated water will be used for irrigation and fertilization.
(3) Measures against water pollution during the construction phase
a. Advanced techniques such as steel case coffering or drop shaft sinking method
will be adopted in bridge construction to reduce mud loss.
b. Oil leakage from bridge construction machinery will be avoided strictly. Waste
oil and garbage will not be allowed to be discharged or dumped into water bodies. Oil
collecting tanks should be set under machines. Ships should be installed with oil-water
separators.
c. Fixed garbage collecting stations should be set on ships or in construction sites,
to insure periodical cleaning and assemble treatment of garbage.
d. Construction materials such as asphalt, oil or chemicals will not be allowed to
be stocked near the rivers.
e. One garbage heaping plant and one septic tank will be set up for every
construction camp.
f. Muddy water from material washing should be settled before discharged.
g. Wastewater from washing vehicies, ships or other machines, or other kinds of
oil-contained wastewater should be treated before discharging.
(4) Management during operation phase
a. lhe management stations of expressway will inspect the load of vehicles, and to
prohibiting over loaded vehicles at the toll stations. Leakage or spilling of oil, earth or
sand will be avoided;
b. Administration Station will be informed of the haulage of hazardous materials,
which should be strictly monitored and supervised.
c. Garbage will be collected regularly and disposed of at fixed places in the nearby
counties instead of dumping into rivers directly.
d. In case of emergency such as car crash near water bodies or leakage of toxic
materials, Public Security Department and environmental protection agencies will be
informed of immediately by the management stations or patrolling men to take
appropriate measures to minimize pollution.
2.2 EP Measures and Management
The environnental protection measures to be taken for Zhangzhou-Zhaoan
Expressway will be divided into design phases, construction one and operation one.
The item, quantity, time, construction units and the corresponding overseeing agencies
for each measure during each phase are as tabulated in Table 2-4.

2.3 Estimation of EP Investment
According to environmental protection measures put forward by this EIA report,
the cost in EP works has been estimated. For the EP measures will be adopted in this
project. See Table 2-5. The cost has involved the cost for EP engineering works, staff
training, environmental monitoring during construction period, and link road EP
investment, while it does not include the engineering cost of plantatíion, sides lope
protection, and water drainage, which has already been listed in the cost of
engineering.

The total investment of the project is 5.054 billion yuan RMB, including 42.6445
million yuan EP  investment, which is 1.05%  of the total investment. The cost of
plantation, resettlement and side slope protection has not been involved. Compare to
the total amount of project investment, the cost of EP works is rather a small part of the
investnent. However, when this part of EP investment surely be used for the EP
facilities, the environment problems will be settled once and for all.
