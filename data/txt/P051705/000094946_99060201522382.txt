1 INTRODUCTION
Fujian Provincial Road Project II consists of Zhangzhou-Zhaoan Expressway and Its
two link roads as well as the other road projects..
The construction of the road section K0+000-K8+000 and the proposed
environmental protection mitigation measures in the EIA/EAP of the road section
KO+000-K8+000 will not be financed by the World Bank Loan for this project. However,
Fujian Provincial Conmmunication Department (FPCD) will implement the environmental
protection mitigation measures of this road section according to the requirements of the
EIA/EAP.
1.1 Purpose of EIA
1. To investigate and assess the present environmental background, such as natural
and social environment, ecosystem, noise, surface water and atmosphere.
2. Prognosis and analysis on the extent and scope of the environmental impact by the
proposed expressway in construction and operation phases.
3. We will put forward the environmental protection measures and analyzing its
technical feasibility and economic reality. We will deduce the aligmnent rationality of the
expressway from the point of view of environmental protection.
4. We wili promote a set of environmental engineering mitigation measures as the
base for leaders decision, design of engineering and management of environment.
1.2 Bases of EIA

9. "World Bank OD 4.01", Oct.1991, and WB EIA Handbook;
10. Laws and Standards Concerning Environmental Protection including" Water and
Soil Protection Act of PRC ", " Land Management Act of PRC ", "Environmental Noise
Standards in Urban Areas ", " Environmental Air Quality Standards ", " Seawater
Quality Standards", etc.
1.3 Scope and Standards of EIA
According to the reply document Ref. No. 032 [1998] from FPEPB, the assessment
scope and standard are decided as follows for specified EIA subjects.
1. Assessment Scope
Social environment-Directly impacted areas on both side of the expressway;
Social economy-- Directly and indirectly impacted areas;
Ecological, acoustics, atmospheric and surface water environment- Areas 200m at
both sides of the expressway. Earth borrowing and spoil sites should be involved in the
assessment scope.
2. Assessment Standards
Considering the characteristics of EIA of expressway project and the natural
environment in different sections, EIA of this project is based on the following standards:
(I) For ecosystem
" Standard for Soil Environment Quality " GB15618-1995, Class 2, the lead content
in soil is limited as PbA350mg/kg.
" National Food Sanitation Standard of Lead Limitation " GB 14935-94, lead content
in crops is limited as follows: for beans: PbS0.8mg/kg, for potatoes: PbA0.4mg/kg, for
vegetables: PbS0.2mg/kg, for cereals: PbA0.4mg/kg.
(2)For noise
" Environmental Noise Standards in Urban Areas ", GB 3096-93.
Class I standard ( 55dB in daytime, 45dB in nighttime ) is adopted for schools and
hospitals;
Class 2 standard (60dB in daytime, 50 dB in nighttime ) is adopted for densely
residential sites between 100 - 200m from the road side;
Class 4 standard (standard 70dB in daytime, 55 dB in nighttime ) is adopted for
residential sites within 1 00m from the road side.
(3)For surface water quality
" Surface Water Quality Standards " Class II and Class III in GB3838-88 (Table 1-
1), " Seawater Quality Standards " GB3097-97 (Table 1-2), and " Fishery Water Quality
Standards ", GB11607-89 ( Table 1-3) are used. Becau3e there is no SS (Suspended Solid)
standard for surface water, the SS of irrigation water and fishery water quality standards
is used. The limitations are: 150mg/I for water farming irrigation water, 200 mg/l for dry
farming irrigation water, and 100 mg/l for vegetable irrigation water.

3.1 Present Natural Environment along the Proposed Highway
3.1.1 Land Features and Topography
The topographical terrain of the expressway rises from southeast to northwest. It is a
rolling area in southeast part of Fujian Province, which is an extending part of Daiyun
(north) & Buoping (northwest) Mountains. Geology of this area where the rout line will
go through belongs to low-hill rolling areas, terra rossa terrace & plain.
3.1.2 Meteorology
Being of subtropical climate with marine seasonal winds, the regions along the
expressway are mild & humid, with abundant rainfall. Crops have three ripe seasons a
year. For meteorology information along the line, see Table 3-1.

3.1.3 Hydrogeology
The major water bodies are Jiulongjiang River (Nanxi Stream), Gangtouxi Stream,
Jiuzhengang, Zhangjiang River, Gangkou, and Dongxi Stream, etc. The water coming
from northwest, flowing southeastward into the sea.
There are three types of developmental sub ground water along the line:
(1) Bedrock joint water;
(2) Residual accumulation- sloping accumulation interstitial plerotic water;
(3) Alluvium-diluvium interstitial plerotic water.
3.2 Assessment of Status Quo of Soil Erosion
Fujian is one of the provinces suffering from severe soil erosion with a total eroded
area of 13,560 km2, accounting for 11.9% of the total land area of Fujian Province. It is
not only a disaster to local agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry, but also affects
7



navigation and power generation.
According to the information provided by the water and soil reservation committee
of Zhangzhou City, the average erosion module along the highway is 402.5-484.2 t /
* y . See Table 3-2 for the present soil erosion status. From Table 3-2, we know that
the soil erosion in Zhaoan county is rather serious. Therefore, the major reservation
works to mitigate soil erosion are in Zhaoan County.

3.3 Present Assessment of Lead Content in Soil and Crops
For lead content in the soil,  Class 2 of" Standard for Soil Environment Quality"
GB15618-1995 is applied, in which the lead content in soil is limited as PbS300mg/kg.
The monitoring result shows that the lead content in 5 soil samples is between 24.5-34.6
mg/kg, which is far below the assessment limitation (300mg/kg), and near to the back
ground level of Fujian Province (geometric average 36.4 mg/kg). This reveals that soil
along the proposed highway has not been deteriorated by lead yet, and there is still a
rather large capacity between current situation to the standard limitation.
Analogous analysis has done for this project according to the monitoring information
of lead content of crops and fruits along Fuzhou-Quanzhou Expressway. The assessment
results shows that the lead content in crops and fruits has not exceed the standard, so the
crops and fruits belong to unpolluted foods.
3.4 Present Situation of Social Environment
3.4.1 Present Situation of Social Economic
There are four counties along the whole line of the proposed expressway
(Longhai, Zhangpu, Yunxiao and Zhaoan), under the jurisdiction of Zhangzhou City,
which is at the southem tip of Fujian province, connecting with Xiamen City, facing
8



on the Taiwan Straits in the southeast.
The area of Zhanzhou City is 12607km2. According to statistic information in
1996, the population is 436,2340; population density, 343/ kin2; birthrate, 16.81%o,
and the average population density along the expressway is 34%o higher than the
provincial average.
The climate is warm and humid, which is suitable for tropical and subtropical
plants. For farm crops there are three harvest seasons a year. Grain yield of Longhai
City is the highest in the province. Zhangzhou City is rich in agriculture products
such as sugar cane, mushroom, asparagus, peanut, tobacco leaf, jute, tea, tremella, etc.
More than 40 kinds of fruit such as: longan, orange, litchi, banana, and pomelo,
pineapple, and among these fruits, yield of banana, pineapple and lithi is 70% of the
provincial yield. Zhangzhou City is also famous for narcissas in the country and
overseas.
Thanks to the long coastline of Zhangzhou City, this region is rich in various
kinds of marine products, such as laver, kelp, shrimp, eel, scallop, clam, sturgeon, etc.
The primary industry of Zhangzhou City is light industry, various industries have
been developed, such as food processing, textile, building materials, chemical
industry, machinery, electronic industry, etc. A diversified industry system has been
formed already. For the major economical indexes in 1996, see Table 3-3.

3.5 Living Environment Quality
3.5.1 Assessment of Present Environmental Noise along the Alignment
According to the acoustic monitoring results in Table 3-5-2, and the assessment
standard in " Environmental Noise Standards in Urban Areas ", GB 3096-93, there are
only two spots (Beitou and Changmaolin) exceeding the Class 2 standard, which are the
rnost seriously impacted spots by the traffic noise on the existing highways. Beitou is at.
the start point of Xiamen-Zhangzhou Expressway, with a large traffic volume due to
dense population and developed economy. Its noise level is 63.7dB in daytime, 52.5dB in
nighttime, both of which exceed the Class 2 standard. Changmaolin is near to the existing
national road No.324, its noise level is 58.0dB in daytime, which is below Class 2
standard, 52.5dB in nighttime. exceeding the Class 2 standard.
From the present acoustic data of sensitive spots in Table 3-5-3 and 3-5-4 we can see
that none of the present noise Leq values of residential sensitive spots of villages and
towns exceed the adopted accustic standards. Only the present noise Leq values of Neixi
Prim. Sch. and HoiIdai Prim. Sch. exceed Class 1 standard. Except for these two spots,
noise Leq value range of the other schools or hospital is Leq (A)=45.2-53.4dB in
daytime, Leq (A)=37.4-4i.3dB in nighttime, which satisfied Class I standard of
GB3096-93. Therefore, we can draw the conclusion that the present acoustic
environment along the proposed highway is rather good.
3.5.2 Present Air Environment Quality
(1) One-hour average concentrations of CO in the ambient air of the 4 monitoring
spots range from 0.75 to 3.00 mg/Nm3, and daily average values of CO range from 0.84
to 1.95 mg/Nm3. Both of the one-hour average values and daily average values of CO
tested did not exceed the Class 2 standards in GB3095-1996, in which one-hour average
concentration of 10.00mg/Nm3 and daily average concentration of 4.00mg/Nm3 are
specified respectively.
(2) One-hour average concentrations of NOx about the ambient air at the monitoring
spots range from 0.005 to 0.020 mg/Nm3, and daily average concentration range from
0.005 to 0. 016 mg/Nm3. Both of the one-hour average concentrations and daily average
concentration of NOx tested did not exceed the class 2 standards in GB3095-1996, in
which one-hour average concentration of 0.1 5mg/Nm3 and daily average concentration of
11



0.1 Omg/Nm3 specified respectively.
(3) Table 3-6-5 indicates daily average concentrations of TSP in the ambient air at
the monitoring spots range from 0.018 to 0.164 mg/Nm3, which is not higher than the
limitation of the Class2 standards in GB3095-1996 (0.30 mg/Nm3).
From the analysis above, it can be seen that the pollutants concentration of local air
is rather low, so the ambient air quality along.the proposed highway is good.
3.5.3 Present Water Environment
1. Nanxi Stream of Jiuiongjiang River System
The water quality of Nanxi Stream met the adopted Surface Water Quality
Standard (Class III), but exceed the adopted Seawater Quality Standards (Class 2).
2.Yiangmei Reservoir
The water quality of Yiangmei Reservoir satisfied the adopted Surface Water Quality
Standard (Class II).
3. Jiouzhen Port
The water quality of Jiouzhen Port satisfied the adopted Sea Water Quality
Standard (Class 2).
4. Zhangjiang River
The water quality of Zhangjiang River met the adopted Surface Water Quality
Standard (Class ILI), but exceed the adopted Seawater Quality Standards (Class 2).
5. Zhaoanwan Port
The water quality of Zhaoanwan Port met the adopted Seawater Quality Standards
(Class 2).
3.5.4 Present Ecological Environment
The vegetation along the proposed expressway is mainly of agriculture. The major
farm crops includes rice, wheat, soy bean, corn, potato, etc. The economic crops mainly
consist of tea, sugar cane, peanut, and fruits.
In the EIA assessment scopes of the other road projects (Tankou-Chengguan
Highway, Huxi-Chiling Highway, and Baishui Large Bridge Longhai City), the air
quality environment and surface water environment are similar to that of the main line,
so the environmental quality is fairly good. Only the acoustic environment in 30% of the
suburban area of Huaan town is beyond the required standard.

4 PREDICTED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS & MITIGATION MEASURES
4.1 Major Environment Impacts During Construction Phase
1. Based on the prediction, after the highway is put into operation, the lead dust will
be accumulated continuously because of the increased traffic volumes, thus leading to
increased lead content and decreased of lead capacity. The background value of lead
content at present at Xinzhong, for example, is 26.8 mg/kg. In 2010, the 7th year of
operation, however, the lead content will come up to 36.62 mg/kg. While in 2020, the
amount will be as high as 47.75 mg/kg, which is far less than the assessment standard
300mg/kg. The increase of lead content year after year in soil, or the decrease of lead
capacity in soil, is caused by the pollution of the lead particulate from the vehicular
exhaust pipes. However, beginning from Jan. 2000, only lead free oil can be use in our
country, the exhausted gas from traffic vehicles will not cause lead pollution to the
environment.
2. The total land area for permanent land use (including paddy and non-irrigated land)
will be 11,385 mu. Assuming that the average yield is 1,114 kg per mu, the reduction of
grains every year will be 12.682.89 t, meaning a loss of 20.2926 million RMB yuan (1.6
yuan per kilogram). The construction will use 2,608 mu of orchards, which means a loss
of 52.16 million yuan per year (20 thousand yuan per mu). The alignment will use 195
mu of aquatic ponds. which means a loss of 5.85 million vuan per year ( 30 thousand
yuan per mu). Considered the suggestions from farmers of Neixi and Dongyuan asking
for less land acquirement, the designing institute has changed the 4km long of high
embankment road section at the start point to viaduct, 144 mu cultivated land is
preserved.
3. In the rather long period of construction, a large amount of earth and stone works
may cause the deterioration of vegetation, and make worse the situation of soil erosion.
It is predicted that the soil erosion volume will be 5.211 times of that before construction
of this project. To mitigate the situation of soil erosion, this EIA statement put forward
the measures as 66 places of large area slope protection, 7 chosen spots of spoil plants,
10269.07 mu total area of plantation along the road, which is 53.25% of the engineering
land occupation.
4. Based on the result of investigation, no state protected wild animal and plant have
been found in the assessment scope along the proposed highway. However during the
process of construction, the workers should be informed of the relevant laws and
regulations of animals and plants protection. In construction activities, if these animals
and plants are encountered, the authorities should be informed of findings in order to take
proper measures to protect them. Clauses concerning protection of wild animals and
plants should be involved in the biding construction documents.

4.2 Social Environment Impact
1. The amount of house demolition is shown in Table 4-3-1. In the alignment design,
although efforts were made to avoid towns and villages, some demolition is unavoidable
because of dense population and developed economy. In the scope that within 200 m
from the road side along the proposed highway, there are: 65 villages, 14 schools, and I
hospital. The houses demolished altogether are 70,097 in2, including 20,858m2 of brick
and concrete buildings, 41,161m2 of brick and timber buildings, 2,126m2 of timber and
earth buildings, and 5,952 m2 simple structure buildings.
2. During construction of the expressway, the construction vehicles may damage the
local roads to some extent, repairing work should be done by the construction unite after
construction.
3. To minimize the adverse impact on residents by the separation of highway, the
following facilities will planned to be built: 9 interchanges, 79 grade separations, 292
passageways. There are 2.7 average cross passages on every mile of highway, which will
satisfy the necessary of local residents.
4. To ensure the safety of the two tunnels, two tunnel management groups have been
set at the entrances of the tunnels. They will be responsible to the management, safety,
and environmental monitoring of the tunnels.
4.3 Acoustic Environment Impact
1. During construction period, the noise from construction machinery will impact the
residents within 150m. Construction in nighttime is prohibited.
2. The prediction shows that the acoustic environment will be impacted significantly
in operation. The excess ratio in short term, mid term and long term operation is 68.8%,
72.5% and 77.5% individually.
3. Traffic noise mitigation measures are as follows
(1) Temporary sound proof screen 100 X 2m will be built at Houdai Prim. Sch.
(2) 27 villages and 2 schools will be removed.
(3) Altogether 10450 m2 of soundproof screens will be built at 20 places.
(4) Altogether 7780 m2 of surrounding walls for villages and schools will be
heightened at 18 places; 27 places of soundproof afforestation will be adopted.
(5) The red line of traffic noise in 2020 (long- term operation) is 139 m at night, so it
is suggested that the new houses be built 150 m beyond.
4.4 Impact on Environmental Air Quality
1. Concentrations of CO, NOx and TSP in the Study Areas meet class 2 standards in
14



GB3095 - 1996, so the air is quite good.
2. Predicted concentrations of CO and NOx by 2020 in operation will not exceed
assessment standards of ambient air, so the operation of the highway will not have
significant impact on environment.
3. During the construction phase, fugitive dust from hauling trucks will pollute the
air, so mitigation measures will be taken. Water spraying will be done regularly at
construction sites and roads. 4 new spraying vehicles have been prepared, each
construction site will provided with a simple spraying vehicle.
4. The asphalt for pavement will come from mixing stations. The Asphalt mixing
equipment will be equipped with dust collectors and will be located at least 300 m from'
residential areas on the down wind directions. The locations of asphalt mixers will be
determined in construction drawing design stage because they are related to the locations
of construction sites. Open or half-open operation will not be allowed. The asphalt and
concrete mixers must have dust removing installations.
5. The design mechanical ventilation for Kuzhishan Tunnel is 2,352 m3 / min, 12
axial fans needed. While the design mechanical ventilation for Dabushan Tunnel is 1,825
rn3 / m of ventilation, 8 axial fans needed.
6. Beginning from Jan. 2000, only lead-free petrol can be used all over the country.
Therefore the exhausting gas from traffic vehicles will not result in lead pollution to air
and soil.
4.5 Impact on Surface Water Environment
1. Assessment results and analysis of present water quality
(1) Nanxi Stream of Jiulongjiang River System
The water quality of Nanxi Stream met the adopted Surface Water Quality
Standard (Class III), but exceed the adopted Seawater Quality Standards (Class 2).
(2)Yiangmei Reservoir
The water quality of Yiangmei Reservoir satisfied the adopted Surface Water Quality
Standard (Class II).
(3) Jiouzhen Port
The water quality of Jiouzhen Port satisfied the adopted Sea Water Quality Standard
(Class 2).
(4) Zhangjiang River
The water quality of Zhangjiang River met the adopted Surface Water Quality
Standard (Class 1EI), but exceed the adopted Seawater Quality Standards (Class 2).
(5) Zhaoanwan Port
The water quality of Zhaoanwan Port met the adopted Seawater Quality Standards
(Class 2).
2. According to the prediction calculation, except for the oil index of the water
15



quality of Yangmei reservoir and Naxi Stream, the water quality of the other surface
waters along the alignment will meet their assessment standards when the proposed
highway being put into operation.
3. The construction of extraordinary large bridges will induce unfavorable impact on
water bodies.
4. The following measures will be adopted
(1) The service area originally set at the vicinity of Yangmei Reservoir is changed to
Heken, which is 5km away from the reservoir.
(2) The service centers will each set up Class2 waste water disposal stations.
(3) Toll stations and tunnel management stations will set up waste water facilities.
(4) Cofferdams should be used during pier construction;
(5) Oil-water separators will be installed on construction ships;
(6) Domestic garbage will be collected and assembled, then transport to nearby cities
or counties for central treatment.
4.6 Environmental Impact of Interchanges and Link Roads
1. Either side of the Xialoucun village near Duxun Interchange will be impacted by
the ring road of the interchange. Guanyinting village and Xiagaoxi village near Yunxiao
Interchange will be impacted by the ring road of the interchange and the existing 324
National Highway. Afforestation will be adopted out side the village to aleviate the noise
and exhaust gas pollution.
2. Zhangpu Interchange locates between two hills with no villages nearby. However,
the route line and several ring road of the expressway will pass through the existing
irrigation ditch for 6 times. To avoid the impact on the farmland irrigation system, fly-
over or channel alternation works for the irrigation system should be finished before the
construction of interchanges.
3. The construction of the extra-large bridge on Nanxi will impact the water quality.
To eliminate the impact by the construction of bridge piers on the river water, reasonable
procedures such as cofferdam method or drop shaft sinking will be taken in construction.
Oil-water separator will be installed on the construction ships.
4. Dongyuan Mid. Sch. is the most seriously standard exceeded spot. Heightening
surrounding wall (High 3m, Length 140m) and afforrestation in the school will be
adopted for mitigation of the noise impact.
5. 11 passageways will be built for the convenience and safety of the residents
separated by the expressway.
6 The domestic sewage of construction camps and toll station will be treated by the
septic tanks. Garbage collection stations will be built for regular assemble and disposal.
7. Rain water accumulation under the interchange is a general existing problem of
interchange. It should be paid attention to in the designing. Drainage facilities such as
16



pumps should be provided in case the pavement under the interchange is not high enough
for drainage.
It is evident that all the major construction materials for each sections, such as earth,
sand, gravel, stones and lime etc will be obtained in the vicinity of the alignment, most of
which will be hauled to the site via the simple hauling road or existing roads. Steel,
cement, lime, timber etc for the project will come from local areas. The roads for such
materials mainly includes G324 line and Zhang-Yun provincial highway. The total
weight of such materials will amount to 762329.4t. As to the 4 years construction period,
the first construction period will be 3 years for the construction of embankment and
bridges. During this period, about 7 or 8 vehicles per hour in daytime will be added to
each section of the existing roads. This is predicted based on the assumption that there
are 300 working days per year, 8 working hours per day, and the loading capacity of the
vehicle is 5t (standard medium-sized one). Therefore, though the hauling vehicles have
no marked impact on the acoustic environment, the dust resulting from such hauling
vehicles will impact the environmental condition to a certain extent.
4.7 Environmental Impact of the Other Road Projects
1. Tankou-Chengguan Road Section
(1) Impact on Ecological environment
Total land occupation of the road project is 1,104 mu. In addition to the existing road,
only acquisition of 167.5 mu land will be needed. According to the on-site investigation,
the alignment of the road project basically goes along with the Jiulongjiang river, which
is confined by the landform. Therefore very little farm land will be included in the land
acquisition, with some only for temporary use. And there are unused land which can be
developed to mitigate the impact on the farm land loss.
Owing to the land occupation and the cutting and filling work in the construction
period particularly for the widened subgrade, some cover plant will have to be damaged.
However, due to the fact that one side of the road is beside the Jiulongjiang river and the
other side is at the foot of hill slope, where the cover plant is few; therefore, on the whole
the impact arising from the road project on the cover plant is small, and the damage
caused by the road project will be mitigated by plantation and greening engineering work,
taking advantage of the local humidity and warm climate.
The maximum soil erosion during the construction period of the road project may be
5.211 times as much as that before the road construction.
(2) Impact on Water environiment
Local river substrate silt resuspension will occur in the beginning of the bridge
construction caused by piling or cofferdam construction, which will have negative impact
on water quality. The sewage and wastes from the labour camp and the construction site
may be brought over into river to cause water pollution. The dusts arising from subgrade
construction and construction material transport may also be brought over into the river,
17



which will have impact on water quality. However, on the whole this kind of impact is
temporary and slight.
(3) Impact on Acoustic environment
According to the prediction: By the year of 2000, there will be no exceeding of the
noise level over the standard limit for all the sensitive points either by day or by night;
By the year of 2005, there will be exceeding of 3.2dB(A) by night for the first raw
building beside the road at the sensitive points of Huangzao and Xinyu; and exceeding of
1.2dB(A) for Xinyu primary school; By the year of 2010, there will be exceeding of
different extent for all the sensitive points except for the Xinyu hospital by night , with
the maximum exceeding of 4.7dB(A) (Huangzao, Xinyu); By the year of 2015, only the
Xinyu primary school will have noise exceeding of 1.2dB(A) over the standard limit by
day; and there will be some noise level exceeding over 0.5-6.2dB(A) for all the
sensitive points by night, which show that the irnpact of the road traffic noise on the
sensitive points is small for the school; by night, however the impact on the residents
close to the road may be significant.
(4) Impact on Air environment
The TSP arising from material transport may be serious, with TSP concentration
may exceed the Class II standard within the areas 1 50m from the roadside.
It can be seen from the prediction results that CO and NOx concentrations are below
the standard limit, which shows that the impacts on the ambient air qualitv caused by the
road traffic is small.
2. Huxi-Chilin Highway
(1) Impact on Ecological environment
The farm land occupation is 272.1 mu, with 680 trees and 1,790 clumps of banana to
be cut, which will have direct impact on the farmers' income and production.
The maximum soil erosion during the construction period of the road project may be
5.211 times as much as that before the road construction.
(2) Impact on Water environment
During construction period, the factors may cause water pollution are as the
following: Oil leaked from construction machines; Flying dust arising from construction
materials and the run-off caused by rainfall; Discharge of wastes from bridge
construction; Discharge of sewage and wastes from labour camp.
During operation period the pollutants arising from the road traffic is small with little
impact on the water quality.
(3) Impact on Acoustic environment
It can be seen from predicted results, noise level at all the sensitive spots will not
exceed the Class IV standard limit.
(4) Impact on Air environment
It can be seen from the table that the TSP concentration at samnpling point 50m on
the leeward of road is 10 times over the standard limit, and when the distance is 150m the
TSP concentration still exceeds the standard limit by 4 times, which indicate that the dust
18



pollution caused by construction work is quite serious for area around road.
Therefore, after the road open to traffic, the emissions of NOx and CO from the
traffic in the operation period are in small quantity, up to the Class II standard.
3. Longhai Baishui Bridge
(1) Impact on Ecological environment
The land acquisition for the Baishui bridge project will be 59.4 mu, which is small
amount and will have little impact on the agricultural system.
(2) Impact on Water environment
During construction, Local river substrate silt resuspension will occur caused by
piling or cofferdam construction, which will have negative impact on water quality. The
sewage and wastes from the labour camp and the construction site may be brought over
into river to cause water pollution. During the operation period, the impact on water
pollution cause by the road project will be small.
(3) Impact on Acoustic environment
The acoustic situation in the assessment scope satisfied the acoustic assessment
standards.
(4) Impact on Air environment
Comparison study shows that TSP arising from material transport will be serious.
After the road bridge open to traffic, the impact of the emissions from the traffic in
the operation period on the ambient air quality is small. For the sensitive spot of
Neijiayang 40 m from the road side, the traffic emission impact is slight, according to the
forecast.
(5) Impact on Social environment
Construction of Baishui bridge will satisfy the demand of the local people of
Dongyuan and Baishui town. The Baishui bridge will not only directly link the two
towns closely together, but also link the two towns with the outside world by way of the
Zhang-Zhao expressway, via the Dongyuan interchange, which will further the area's
economic development.
5 ALTERNATIVE SCHEMES
5.1 Introduction of Engineering Schemes
Two major two alternative alignment schemes (West Line Scheme and East Line
Scheme) have been put forward by Fujian Communications Planning and Design
Institute in the Project Pre-feasibility Study Report. The East Scheme was determined as
the recommended scheme after pre-feasibility study. There are three sections of
alternative schemes in the recommended East Line Scheme, including
19



1. Three alternative schemes of the section from Beitou to Jiuzhen
2. Two alternate schemes for the section from Andou to Xizhang
The recommended Yunxiao Inner Line Scheme have two road sections
(Wutian-Dapu Section & Shudong-Guanlin Section) of alternative schemes
A. Two Alternative Schemes for Wutian-Dapu Section
B. Two Alternative Schemes for Shudong-Lintou Section
3. Two Alternative Schemes for Zhongzai-Houling Section
See Figure 2-1 for the specific alignment.
5.2 Environmental Comparison of Schemes
From the point view of environmental protection, the advantage and disadvantages
of the alternative schemes are compared specifically in follows.
1. Environmental Comparison of the three schemes on Beitou-Jiuzhen section
See Figure 2-1 for the three schemes of Beitou--Jiuzhen section. Environmental
factor comparisons are shown in Table 5-2-1.
(1) Middle Line scheme has the least amount of villages along the highway, with less
land acquisition and house removal. The disturbance to the social environrnent and life of
residents is the lightest.
(2) The rout line of the Middle Line Scheme will distribute in mountain area, which
will bring benefit to the economic development of mountain area. It will greatly satisfy
the social and economic demand of Zhangzhou area.
(3) With less residential areas along the highway, Middle Line Scheme will have the
lighter impact on the life of local residents during construction and operation period. The
cost of environmental protection will be less than the other two schemes.
From the enviroitment point of viev, the Middle Line Scheme is superior to the Inner
Line Scheme and Outer Line Scheme. However the following environmental issues
should still be paid attention to.
a. Spoils from the Kuzhishan Tunnel should be properly arranged to prevent from
soil erosion.
b. Safety management in tunnels should be strengthened.
c. Life environment of the local residents should be protected properly.

2. Environmental Comparison  of the Alternative  Schemes for Andou-Xizhang
Section
See Figure 2-1  for the alignments of alternative  schemes for Andou-Xizhang
Section. The comparison of the Inner Line Scheme and the Outer Line Scheme are
shown in Table 5-2-2.
(1) The route line of Outer Line Scheme is near to the seashore, the safety of the
vehicles on the highway which will be impacted by typhoon and fog weather. The route
line of Outer Line Scheme is distributed in the rolling and mountain area along the
seashore with more tunnels and spoils, and the subgrade of the highway will be scoured
by tides, which will impact the safety of the proposed highway. But with less land taken
and removal, this scheme will have lighter impact on the environment during operation
period.
(2) The Inner Line Scheme will cause 7134m2 more houses demolished, and 541mu
more land acquisition. The impact on the life environment (acoustic) of the residents by
this scheme will be heavier than the Outer Line Scheme, but the impact on the ecological
environment and soil erosion will be much lighter, and the social and economic benefits
21



of this scheme is superior to the Outer Line Scheme.
Based on the comparison, we agree with the Inner Line Scheme. However, the
following environmental measures should be adopted.
a. Jizai Prim. School will be removed.
b. Soundproof screen will be built for Xiqian Prim. School.
c. Proper mitigation measures will be adopted for other impacted sensitive spots.
d. Locations of tunnel spoil plants should be appointed.

3. Environmental comparison of alternative schemes for W-utila-Dapu Section
This road section is a part road section involved in Andou-Xizhang section. See
Table 5-2-3 for environmental factor comparison.
(1) Dabushan Tunnel Scheme will have less residential sites along the highway,
which will have lighter impact on the environment during operation period. Although the
mileage of the tunnel is rather long, the construction work is not difficult. The benefits of
Dabushan Tunnel Scheme are the same as that of the Baita Tunnel Scheme.
(2) Baita Tunnel Scheme will have more residential sites along the highway, which
will need much more noise mitigation measures than the Dabushan Tunnel Scheme.
Based on the comparison, we believe that the Dabushan Tunnel Scheme is superior
to the Baita Tunnel Scheme. So, we suggests that the Dabushan Tunnel Scheme be
determined as the recommended scheme. While the following EP issues should be paid
attention to.
a. The water pollution may caused by the construction of Zhangjiang River Bridge.
22



b. Locations of tunnel spoil plants should be appointed.
c. Water seepage problem of the tunnels should be solved.

4. Environmental comparison of alternative schemes for Shudong-Lintou Section
This road section is another part road section involved in Andou-Xizhang section.
See Table 5-24 for environmental factor comparison.
(1) Social environment:
The Outer Line Scheme passed area conforms to the local planning, with fewer
disturbances to local road and irrigation facilities, which will bring more benefits to the
local society and economy.
(2) Ecological environment: Outer Line Scheme will have much less cutting and
fillings than the Inner Line Scheme, which will have less impact on the vegetation and
soil erosion status. The max excavation depth of the Inner Line Scheme is more than 30m,
which will seriously impact the vegetation and soil erosion.
(3) Inner Line Scheme locates in mountain areas, with a complexity geological
condition, the construction work will become very difficult. It will fly over No.324
National Highway two times, and water net will be disturbed.
Based on the comparison, we believe that the Outer Line Scheme is superior to the
Inner Line Scheme. We recommended the Outer Line Scheme. However the following
EP measures should be adopted.
a. Jizai Prim. School will be removed.
b. Surrounding wall will be heightened for Haifeng High School.
c. Soil erosion mitigation measures should be adopted.

5. Environmental comparison of alternative schemes for Zhongzai-Houling Section
See Figure 2-1 for the alignments of alternative schemes of Zhongzai-Houling
Section. The comparison of the Inner Line Scheme and the Outer Line Scheme are
shown in Table 5-2-5.
(1) The number of the impacted people of the Inner Line Scheme is about one times
more than that of the Outer Line Scheme. The cost of EP measure will be much lass.
(2) The Outer Line passed area has a smooth land feature, no tunnel, with much less
earth and stone work tharn the Inner Line Scheme, which will have less impact on the
ecological environment. But the amount of construction land taken and the removal is
more than the Inner Line Scheme.
(3) Outer Line Scheme conforms to the traffic planning of Zhaoan County. It is
favorable to the development of local areas.
The comparison shows that both schemes have advantages and disadvantages. The
Outer Line Scheme will have less impact on the life environment of the local residents
and ecological environment than the Inner Line Scheme. And the social economic
benefits of the Outer Line Scheme will be better than the Inner Line Scheme. Therefore,
we recommend the Outer Line Scheme. But proper EP measures should be adopted for
the recommended scheme.

5.3 Comparison Analysis on Alternate Schemes of Sensitive spots
Based on the suggestions from WB expert, EIA working team, designing institute
and resettlement office studied environment of the major sensitive spots. Alternative
schemes are put forward and comparisons have been done.
1. Changed scheme of Jiangcuo-Neijiafang Section
The sensitive spots impacted by the Original Scheme are Cuozai, Jiangcuo, Xinxu,
Xinhe, Neijiafang and Baishui Mid. Sch. The Changed Scheme goes around the villages
with less land acquisition, less impact on the residents while satisfied the engineering
indices. The Changed Scheme will not pass through Xinhe and Neijiafang, which greatly
mitigated the removal and number of impacted people. See Table 5-3-1 for the
comparison of between two schemes.

2. Huxi sensitive spot
The Original Scheme will pass through Huxi Village with a large volurne of
resettlement and serious impact on the villagers. Although the Changed Scheme need
more engineering works and investment, it goes around the Huxi Village, avoided the
impact on the residents. See Figure 5-2 for the route trend. See Table 5-3-2 for the
environmental factor comparison.

4. Gaoshan Village Sensitive Spot
The Original Scheme passes through the middle of the Gaoshan Village. 84
household will have to be removed. If the route line move to the north of the Gaoshan
Village (the Altemative Scheme in Figure 5-4), there will be no removal. However the
alignment can not satisfied the engineering standard. Study result shows that the
Altemative Scheme is infeasible due to the low standard line shape, which will impact
the safety of running vehicles. So, the designing institute insisted that the original scheme
be adopted. The EIA unit suggested that the opinions and requirements from villagers
should be paid attention to, and Original Scheme should be moved considering the
unfavorable impact on the village. After discussion arnong EIA unit, villagers and
designing unit, agreement is attained that the route of the Original Scheme will be moved
50m northwards (the Changed Scheme in Figure 5-4). Then, 25 household will not
remove. However, the environmental impact still exists. To mitigate the unfavorable
impact of traffic noise, 160m X 3m and 120m X 3m soundproof screen will be built here.
27



34 household will be removed, and a crossing passageway will be built under the
expressway for the convenience of the villagers. The changed scheme and EP measures
are all informed to the villagers, who accepted the solving methods. See Figure 5-4 for
the route trend. The comparison of the schemes is shown in Table 5-34.

6 ANALYSIS ON LOSS AND BENEFIT OF ENVIRONMENT
6.1 Estimation of EP Investment
According to environmental protection measures put forward by this EIA report, the
cost in EP works has been estimated. For the EP measures will be adopted in this project.
See Table 6-1. The cost has involved the cost for' EP engineering works, staff training,
environmental monitoring during construction period, and link road EP investment, while
it does not include the engineering cost of plantation, sides lope protection, and water
drainage, which has already been listed in the cost of engineering.
The total investment of the project is 5.054 billion yuan RMB, including
42.6445 million yuan EP investment, which is 1.05% of the total investment. The cost of
plantation, resettlement and side slope protection has not been involved. Compare to the
total amount of project investment, the cost of EP works is rather a small part of the
investment. However, when this part of EP investment surely be used for the EP facilities,
the environment problems will be settled once and for all.
6.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis of Environmental Protection Investment
The planned highway will have severe adverse effect on the environment in many
ways. During operation of the highway, vehicle exhausts will pollute the atmospheric and
water environment; dust and noise will impact on the environmental quality in residential
areas. The health of people living on both sides of the highway will be affected to some
extent and the normal life and work of these people will be affected as well. Therefore,
practical environmental protection measures must be taken, such as sound proof
measures and plantation along the road sections near sensitive spots to reduce the
negative effects caused by traffic on the environment. After taking environmental
protection measures, the economic loss will be retrieved each year (equal to the direct
economic benefit of environmental protection), See Table 6-2 for the economic loss
retrieved each year.
The retrieved economic loss is calculated according to the analogical EIA data for
Sanyuan-Tongchuan class 1 highway in Shaanxi Province. The data were provided by
the High Grade Road Management Agency of Shaanxi Province.

E         economic benefit ratio of environmental protection expenditure
Si--   economic loss that can be retrieved each year after environmental
protection measures are taken
H - expenditure of environmental protection investment per year
The total EP investment of this project is 42.6445 million yuan, during 20 years of
operation, 2.1322 million yuan annual investment, then the economic benefit for
environment protection each year is calculated out based the formula above: Ej =2.31,
which illustrates that the investment of environmnent protection is reasonable. Thus, it
is of great importance to execute the environmental protection measures suggested in
the EIA when building the highway. The construction unit should take environmental
protection measures step by step as suggested in the assessment to ensure the
coordinate and sustainable development of construction and environmental protection.

8 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
8.1 Investigation Subjects and Way of Participation
Public participation is one of the most important parts in determination of the
proper alignment scheme. Opinions from affected masses and enterprises should be
paid full attention to, and the benefits of them should be considered substantially. The
investigation and consultation work such as visiting, discussion, meetings, mail
contacting, especially the random collection of questionnaires along the proposed
highway. There are 441 forms of questionnaires spread to private persons, units and
government agencies with 388 forms returned.
The investigation subjects are:
(DDivisions of EP, Agriculture, Water conservancy, soil conservation and plann
ing, and governments of different levels were consulted;
(9)Opinions from ordinary masses were collected;
®Opinions from experts and enterprises were solicited;
I)Opinions from households to be removed were sought in particular.
8.2  lypical Consultations and Hearings
For the purpose of hearing and collecting public opinions from the impacted areas
46



along the proposed highway, especially from the removing households, EIA working
team and Expressway Headquarter of Zhangzhou City had held consultation meeting
and hearings with villagers, students and teachers at Qiuzhong, Neixi, Jiangcuo,
Hekeng, Houdai, Liugaowei, Xiagao, Gaoshan, Putou, Chuanchang, Tianpuyu,
Changmaolin, Shangyingcun, Zhangqian Prim. Sch., Gaolin Mid. Sch., Shaxi Mid.
Sch., Tulou Prim. Sch., Jizai Prim. Sch., Shudong Prim. Sch., etc. , altogether 19
sensitive spots from Dec. 16 to Dec. 22, 1998. There were 195 participants with
different sex, age and education level.
8.3 Statistic Results of Public Participation and Opinion Treatment
1. Public Opinion
Public opinions are collected and organized as follows:
(1) Local farmers generally demanded that land acquirement should be as less as
possible. For example, at Dongyuan and Neixi, the farmers agree that the highway
project will be beneficial to the local economy, but feel regret to the land occupied in
their village, which all belong to the Class I protected farm land.
(2) The leaders of Zhangpu County demanded that a interchange be set between
Longhai and Jiuzhen. It will bring benefits to the communication and economic
development of the two She Race people towns at Chiling and Huxi.
(3) The public strongly demand that economic compensation for land acquisition
& removal should be strictly based on the regulations of polices. Ensure the
compensation be paid practically, no other usage or interception is permitted. Works of
this part for public or individuals should be done carefully and considerately, for it is
critical for highway construction.
(4) Villagers in Gaoshan Village and several other villages demanded passageways
should be built near there village for their convenience.
(5) EIA working team had expiained the to the villagers of the sensitive spots as
Qiuzhong, Neixi, Jiamgcuo, Putoi, etc. that sound proof wall will have to be built at
their villages. The mass shown an attitude of understanding, while they strongly
demanded that the sound proof wall must be built simultaneously with the expressway.
(6) Part of the villagers in Gaoshan Village demanded that the highway should be
move toward north, then it will avoid the ancestral hall of their village (Ancient
buildings in Qing Dynasty).
(7) During authorization of EIA report, environmental experts suggested that the
service center set near Yangmei Reservoir will induce water pollution.
(8) The removing households hold diverse opinions. People with new houses
worry about the compensation may be not enough. However people living in old
houses hope to remove as soon as possible, then they can build new houses with the
compensation.
47



(9) The mass along the proposed highway had known the information of this
project three years ago. They hope the construction of this project start as soon as
possible. Then the local farmers can arrange the positions of their new house and
business.
2. Treatments of Public Opinion
Through the consultations and hearings, the EIA working team had explained and
shown the mass the information of this project, instructed the alignments of the
highway, the possible impacts on their environment and solving methods. We collected
and organized the public opinions, then informed FPECDO and FPCPDI. Most of the
problems have been solved as:
(1) The service center originally set near Yangmei Reservoir has been moved to
Heken, which is 5km away to the reservoir. The impact on the water quality has been
avoided.
(2) The designing institute has move the alignment at.Gaoshan 50m toward north,
then the ancestral hall is reserved.
(3) After discussion and consultation, the designing institute has changed the
alignments at following sensitive spots: Cuozai, Jiangcuo, Xinyu, Xinhe, Neijiafang,
Baishui Mid. Sch., Huxi, Liuban, Zhulin, Tulou. (See Chapter I for the alternative
schemes).
(4) Considered the suggestions from farmers of Neixi and Dongyuan, the
designing institute has changed the 4km of high embankment road section to viaduct,
144 mu cultivated land is preserved.
(5) The farmers at sensitive spots as Hekeng, Houdai, Xiagao, and Chuanchang
had shown an warm and welcome attitude to the expressway. They believe it will be
beneficial and convenient for them to transport their vegetables, flowers, and fruits to
other provinces or abroad. They are now unsatisfied to the low prices selling at local
areas.
(6) EIA working team has informed the owner the opinions demanding more
interchanges and passageways and their specific position; and in formed the
resettlement office the public opinion about economic compensation for land
acquisition & removal should be strictly based on the regulations of polices, to ensure
the compensation be paid practically, no other usage or interception is permitted.
9 CONCLUSIONS
The Fujian Highway Project II includes Zhangzhou-Zhaoan Expressway with two
link roads and the other road projects.
Zhang-Zhao Expressway is an access-controlled, grade-separated expressway with
48



divided two lanes in each direction and with a total length of 140.459km. Investment
of this project will be 5054 million yuan. With superior climate condition, high
covered rate of vegetation, the natural environment and living environment along the
proposed expressway is very good.
Other road projects include
1. Longhaibaishui Large Bridge
It is 487m long with a total cost amounting to RMB 3452,000 yuan. It is to be
built based on the gener-al class 2 standard in slightly rolling area. Its construction will
start in Oct. 1999 and be finished in Sept. 2001.
2. Huaan Highway (Tankou-Chengguan)
Its total length is 41.73 kin, with a total investment of RMB243,518,000 yuan. It
is to be constructed in accordance with the general class 2 road standard and the
construction period will be from May 1999 to May 2001.
3. Huxi-Chiling Highway
Its total length is 9,07 km. It is to be paved according to the general class 2 road
standard (in heavily rolling areas). Its total investment amounts to RMB243,518,000
yuan and it will be built from May 1999 to May 2001.
Construction and operation of Zhang-Zhao Expressway will be beneficial to the
traffic, economic development and investment circumstances. The environmental
issues impacted by this project are as follows.
In construction period: loss of land resources, plantation deterioration, soil erosion
increased during construction, construction noise and dust, asphalt fume pollution.
In operation period: traffic noise impact, the impact on water quality and other
aspects of environment by domestic sewage and garbage from service centers and on
other assistant facilities.
Environmental protection measures with 4264.45 million yuan RMB investment
have been put forward in this EIA. According to the assessment, if all the measures of
environmnent protection are implemented, the environmental impact problems caused
by the project can be effectively controlled and mitigated. So we can draw the
conclusion that the construction of this project is feasible based on the results of
environmental impact assessment.
The other road projects consist of two roads and one large bridge, and they will
considerably enhance the social and economical development in the region. The
construction of Longhai Baishui Large Bridge will bring about communication
convenience to the local people. Environmental issues of the projects will mainly occur
49



during the construction phase, such as the sewage at the construction camp, domestic
garbage as well as pollution caused by the construction of the bridge, etc. Noise from
traffic may be a problem during the operation phase. All these adverse impacts,
however, can be controlled effectively if the corresponding measures in EIA are
carefully taken. Therefore, construction of the other road projects is also feasible.
