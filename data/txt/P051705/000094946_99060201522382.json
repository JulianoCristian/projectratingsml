the Zhangzhou-Zhao'an\n            Expressway and an interconnecting road and bridge program to\n            relieve traffic congestion and improve the mobility and\n            integration of inter-provincial trade, commerce, and tourism\n            between Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Negative\n            environmental impact mitigation include: Road surfaces,\n            excavation areas, and construction sites will be sprayed\n            with water and kept moist. Trucks will be distanced from\n            residential sites or other sensitive spots. Ventilation fans\n            will reduce air pollution. Asphalt mixing equipment will\n            have dust collectors and be distanced from residential\n            areas. Vegetation restoration including greenbelts on\n            roadsides will rehabilitate the land. Afforestation, a\n            soundproofing screen, and a restricted schedule for\n            operating construction equipment and vehicles will reduce\n            noise levels. Dumping levels will not exceed the surrounding\n            ground level, intercepting ditches will be installed, blind\n            pipes will discharge seepage, and borrow and spoil sites\n            will be reconstructed or leveled after construction. To\n            prevent water pollution, oil collection tanks, oil-water\n            separators, garbage collecting stations, drainage gates, and\n            controlled sand digging will be used, along with treatment\n            of wastewater and sewage. Hazardous materials will be\n            strictly monitored. Displaced persons will be resettled and compensated."}, "docdt": "1999-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
