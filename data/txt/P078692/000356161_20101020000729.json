{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Post Secondary Education\n            Project for China were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: throughout\n            the project period universities failed to provide reports to\n            Ministry of Education (MOE) on time. Universities enjoy\n            significant autonomy worldwide. Universities, as a rule,\n            resent frequent reporting to ministry officials on their\n            activities. The failure of the project in responding to the\n            changed priority resulted in the loss of the borrower's\n            ownership, and as a consequence, unsatisfactory project\n            outcomes. The project did not allocate funds for predefined\n            activities of universities but it allowed them to use\n            predetermined Institutional Development Grant (IDG) and\n            Development Innovation Fund (DIF) resources as per their own\n            choice. As such the absorption capacity of universities was\n            contingent upon their initiative, commitment and capacity.\n            There is nothing wrong in setting ambitious goals. But it is\n            important to acknowledge that always there will be some\n            binding constraints."}, "docdt": "2010-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
