           will directly support one of the Government's primary\n            national development, and sectoral goals as identified in\n            Ethiopia's Poverty Reduction Strategy: the expansion\n            and strengthening of human capacity, to lead the transition\n            from an agrarian economy, to a service and production\n            oriented one. The two main project components will: 1)\n            improve university undergraduate and post-graduate\n            education, through a) institutional development grants to\n            support basic capital expenses of eligible institutions, on\n            a proportionate basis in accordance with the\n            Government's new funding formula for block grants; b)\n            support provided to: the Quality and Relevance Assurance\n            Agency (QRAA), the Ethiopian Higher Education Strategy\n            Institute (EHESI), the National Pedagogical Resource Center\n            (NPRC) and Institutional Pedagogical Resource Sub-centers,\n            and, the central ministry in the form of resources for some\n            capital expenses, research, seminar development, equipment,\n            publications, and technical assistance; and, c) through the\n            Development Innovation Fund (DIF), as the centerpiece of the\n            Bank's support to university development in Ethiopia.\n            The Fund is a flexible mechanism designed to stimulate\n            innovation, promote modernizing changes, and reward\n            quality-enhancing efforts within universities; and, 2)\n            expand and deepen the system reform activities currently\n            spear-headed by the Ministry of Education, by developing the\n            capacities to implement the system changes which are under\n            way. These capacity development efforts will provide a\n            foundation for the five pillars of the Technical and\n            Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Innovation Program\n            transformation: Decentralization of service design and\n            delivery; Strengthening partnerships among stakeholders,\n            especially between training providers and employers;\n            Development and implementation of a trades testing, and\n            certification system; Cost-sharing by beneficiaries; and,\n            Market-based demand orientation that shapes training."}, "docdt": "2004-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
