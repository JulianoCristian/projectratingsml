Overall\n            World Bank performance has been satisfactory, in that it\n            maintained realism and flexibility, as its staff kept\n            themselves focused on the project's development\n            objectives. Similarly, Borrower performance overall has been\n            satisfactory, which has resulted in the successful\n            implementation of the project. Lessons learned include the\n            following: Flexibility was the key to success in this type\n            of project--a flexible approach was used in selecting and\n            prioritizing areas for installing new sub-surface drainage\n            or for their rehabilitation. Also, the Bank and implementing\n            agency maintained flexibility in the program to reallocate\n            resources to cover urgently needed areas, which arose during\n            implementation. In the Egyptian context, the project\n            implementation timetable should give full consideration to\n            the length of time required between board approval and\n            effectiveness because Parlaiment does not often ratify\n            loan/credit agreements within a short period. Further\n            institutional building is needed to computerize the design\n            process, the operation and maintenance of the drainage\n            system, and the monitoring and evaluation of drainage\n            impacts. Crop compensation should be incorporated into the\n            drainage installation contract to be paid directly to\n            farmers to circumvent delays."}, "docdt": "2001-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
