Almost two-thirds\n            of the poor live in rural areas and are primarily dependent\n            on agriculture and related industries for survival. Arable\n            land resources are extremely limited, consisting of a narrow\n            strip along the Nile River amounting to less than 5 percent\n            of the country's total land area. Agriculture, except\n            for the Mediterranean littoral and desert oases, is almost\n            totally dependent on the Nile and the irrigation and\n            drainage it provides. Water availability is limited, and a\n            major planning goal is to maximize the returns from this\n            resource in an environmentally sustainable manner. The\n            project also focused on creating institutional and community\n            mechanisms for the development and maintenance of the\n            systems, and for cost recovery. This included organizing\n            farmers into drainage associations, known as collector user associations."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
