unlikely sustainability as\n            opposed to likely by the ICR, and uncertain by the ICR\n            review; negligible institutional development impacts in\n            contrast to substantial by both the ICR and ICR review; and,\n            both Bank and Borrower performances are downgraded to\n            unsatisfactory from satisfactory by the ICR and ICR review.\n            However, ratings on the National Drainage Project fully\n            concur on satisfactory project outcomes, likely\n            sustainability, substantial institutional development\n            impacts, and satisfactory Bank and Borrower performances.\n            Experiences offer two lessons. First, it is reinforced that\n            disbursement, and physical achievements are not always good\n            indicators of project success, aggravated if failure to\n            address systemic institutional problems, adversely affect\n            operational efficiency and sustainability of project works,\n            making lending ineffective. This not only hampers the\n            Bank's reform agenda, but causes also concern among the\n            Bank's development partners, who see the Bank as the\n            interlocutor capable of advancing institutional, and policy\n            reforms with the Government of Egypt. Second, it should be\n            taken into consideration the fact that in-country Bank\n            partnership with bilateral development agencies, is a\n            powerful instrument for institutional reform, who develop\n            long-term institution-building relationships with government\n            in specific sectors, potentially, and significantly\n            increasing the utility, relevance, and leverage of Bank\n            assistance. In Egypt, bilateral agencies bring differing\n            perspectives to the water, and agriculture sub-sector, and\n            are notably strong at capacity building in drainage, and\n            community development."}, "docdt": "2004-02-26T00:00:00Z"}
