                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has reached the targets set for most of the key performance indicators (KPIs), which suggests that the overall development objectives will be achieved. As of December
                         2013, the Project has completed community-based activities in more than 80 percent of the villages. However, the Project restructuring was approved in February 2014 which
                         involved the use of the about $1.9M community grants for repair of selected sub-projects which were damaged by Typhoon Yolanda. Thus, about 59 additional sub-projects were

                         initiated in February 2014. Nevertheless, the Project has completed about 93 percent of the community activities as of end of March 2014. The project continued to build community
                         capability of to participate in local development planning as evidenced by accomplishments in reference to three KPIs:         (i) About 86 percent of the barangays have prepared a
                         community development plan through participatory process which exceeded the target of 80 percent; (ii) 86 percent of the villages participated or were represented in municipal-level
                         resource allocation by citizens other than the formal officials; and, (iii) 95 percent of municipalities have expanded the representation in its Municipal Development Council to generate
                         inputs for the municipal development plan. Furthermore, the mobilization of the communities resulted to the financing of 2,334 community sub-projects that were intended to improve
                         access to basic services such as education, potable water and primary health care.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         While the key contents and focus of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) involves joint discussions with DSWD even at early stages of preparation, the DSWD would furnish
                         the Bank with its own version of the completion report that would be submitted to the National Economic and Development Authority by August 2014. The DSWD also commits to
                         submit the data on the achievement of the intermediate or outcome indicators such as the improved access to sustainable public services based on the recently completed impact
                         evaluation don with support from the Millenium Challenge Corporation by August 2014 in time for finalization of the Completion Report in November 2014.
