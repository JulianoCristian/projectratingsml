The program aims to achieve this by\n            providing resources to poor rural municipalities to invest\n            in public goods and by reviving local institutions to\n            enhance people's participation in governance.\n            KALAHI-CIDSS was originally targeted at the poorest 25\n            percent of municipalities in 42 of the poorest provinces in\n            the Philippines. KALAHI-CIDSS was designed to minimize the\n            risk of elite capture and it appears to have been successful\n            in doing so. The project had a positive impact on household\n            consumption. Consistent with the project development\n            objective, KALAHI-CIDSS led to an increase in participation\n            in barangay assemblies, associated with greater knowledge\n            about the barangay's income and expenses. The project\n            led to improvements in basic service delivery. The project\n            also had positive impacts on a number of social capital\n            outcomes, which have been shown to be important determinants\n            of household welfare."}, "docdt": "2013-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
