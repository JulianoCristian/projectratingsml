    DELIVERY OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROJECT (KALAHI-CIDSS) PROJECT
 (P077012) EXTENSION FOR CLOSING DATE FOR THE CO-FINANCING TRUST
FUND FROM THE AUSAID-WORLD BANK PHILIPPINE DEVELOPMENT TRUST
                           FUND (TF011939)
                                P071007
                          Restructuring Paper

1. This Restructuring Paper seeks your approval for an extension of the closing date
   from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 for the Recipient-executed Grant.
   This Grant in the amount of $10 million was financed from the AusAID-World Bank
   Philippine Development Trust Fund and approved as Additional Financing to
   KALAHI-CIDSS on May 30, 2012. The purpose of this extension is to allow the
   Recipient to complete the implementation of the community subprojects under the
   grant. The closing date of the original project remains the same as May 31, 2014.

2. The whole grant is underpinned by the KALAHI-CIDSS community driven
   development approach and supports the community-managed construction/
   rehabilitation of about 200 day care centers (DCCs) as well as construction/
   rehabilitation of about 250 classrooms in approximately 200 villages covered by both
   the KALAHI-CIDSS and the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program or 4Ps
   (Philippines Conditional Cash Transfer Program), both of which are implemented by
   the DSWD.

3. The Grant Agreement was signed on May 30, 2012 and the initial funds were
   transferred on September 3, 2012. Based on the results of the Implementation
   Support Mission conducted on August 27 to September 14, 2012, the KALAHI-
   CIDSS Project performance was found to be satisfactory. Specifically, the Project is
   steadily making progress towards achieving its overall development objectives as
   indicated by the significant progress in terms of the key performance indicators
   related to increased access to community basic services as well as mobilizing and
   building the capacities of communities to participate in local development planning.
   In terms of the implementation of the Grant, the Mission found that DSWD has
   undertaken all the preparatory activities for the community-level operations.

4. As of end of November 2012, community-level social mobilization has been
   completed, which resulted to finalization of detailed sub-project technical plans for 53
   day care centers and 190 classrooms. Actual community-managed constructions are
   expected to start in December 2012 and completed by first quarter of 2013. Another
   cycle of social mobilization will be completed by KALAHI-CIDSS in about 100
   municipalities during the first quarter of 2013 which are expected to identify
   additional day care center and classrooms that will be supported by the Grant.

5. The Grant implementation is within track of achieving its development objective. As
   DSWD indicated in its letter, the extension of the Grant closing date is requested to
   allow more time for completion of community sub-projects which were identified,

                                            5
   designed and being implemented by marginalized communities through KALAHI-
   CIDSS Project. The DSWD has prepared the work and financial plans which the
   Bank found acceptable.

6. This will be the first extension of the project.

7. The EAPFM confirmed that KALAHI-CIDSS Project has no outstanding audit report
   and Interim Financial Report.

8. In light of the above and in view of the recently approved amendment of the
   Administration Agreement extending the closing date, it is recommended that the
   closing date of the Grant be extended until December 31, 2013 to provide sufficient
   time for completion of grant activities in accordance with the plan.
