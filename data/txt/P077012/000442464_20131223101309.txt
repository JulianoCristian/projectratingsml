   DELIVERY OF SOCIAL SERVICES PROJECT (KALAHI-CIDSS) PROJECT
 (P077012) EXTENSION OF CLOSING DATE FOR THE CO-FINANCING TRUST
 FUND FROM THE AUSTRALIA-WORLD BANK PHILIPPINES DEVELOPMENT
                       TRUST FUND (TF011939)
                               P071007
                         Restructuring Paper

1. This Restructuring Paper seeks approval for an extension of the closing date from
   December 31, 2013 to May 31, 2014 for the Recipient-executed Grant. This Grant in
   the amount of $10 million was financed from the Australia-World Bank Philippines
   Development Trust Fund and approved as Additional Financing to KALAHI-CIDSS
   on May 30, 2012. The purpose of this extension is to allow the Recipient to complete
   the implementation of the community subprojects under the grant. The closing date
   of the original parent project remains the same as May 31, 2014.

2. The whole grant is underpinned by the KALAHI-CIDSS community driven
   development approach and supports the community-managed construction/
   rehabilitation of about 200 day care centers (DCCs) as well as construction/
   rehabilitation of about 250 classrooms in approximately 200 villages covered by both
   the KALAHI-CIDSS and the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program or 4Ps
   (Philippines Conditional Cash Transfer Program), both of which are implemented by
   the DSWD.

3. The Grant Agreement was signed on May 30, 2012 and the initial funds were
   transferred on September 3, 2012. Based on the results of the Implementation
   Support Mission conducted from November 6-11, 2013 the KALAHI-CIDSS Project
   performance was found to be satisfactory. Specifically, the Project is steadily making
   progress towards achieving its overall development objectives as indicated by the
   significant progress in terms of the key performance indicators related to increased
   access to community basic services as well as mobilizing and building the capacities
   of communities to participate in local development planning.

4. In terms of the implementation of the Grant, the Mission found that it within track of
   achieving its development objective and targets. The grant has reached 390
   barangays in 76 municipalities of 24 provinces as of September 30, 2013. The
   disbursement rate was 97.9 percent as of December 18, 2013.

5. More than 14, 000 community volunteers have been mobilized and trained on
   community-based sub-project management. About 61 percent of the volunteers are
   female while 39 percent are male. A total of 478 classrooms (167 percent of the
   target 286 classrooms) as well as the 148 day care centers (65 percent of the target
   229 centers) have been financed with a total cost of approximate $11 million of
   which 81 percent ($9 million) is grant while 19 percent ($2 million) are local
   counterpart contribution. The classrooms and DCC s will benefit approximately
   94,135 households. About 33 percent of these classrooms/DCCs have been

                                            5
   completed and another 17 percent are more than 90 percent complete while the rest
   are originally targeted to be completed by end of December 2013.

6. As DSWD indicated in its letter, the extension of the Grant closing date is requested
   to allow more time for completion of community sub-projects which were identified,
   designed and are being implemented by marginalized communities through the
   KALAHI-CIDSS Project. Further, the request letter cited the following reasons
   which led to compounded delay in completing the grant thus justifying the request for
   extension:

          Armed conflict in Zamboanga City where the DSWD Field Office 9 is
           located: Due to the conflict, offices in Zamboanga City were suspended for
           more than a month which resulted to delay in processing the request for fund
           releases from the community for 82 sub-projects (21% of total sub-projects
           being financed through the grant).
          Barangay elections on October 28, 2013: As part of the election ban, the
           barangay treasurer, who is one of the co-signatories to the community bank
           account, was not allowed to sign any transactions for community projects for
           more than a month before and after the election.
          Yolanda disaster: The typhoon gravely affected Regions IV-A, V, VI and
           VIII, all of which have a total of 188 sub-projects (48%) that are financed
           through the grant. As part of the post-disaster recovery plan, the DSWD is
           now in the process of assessing the damages to the completed and on-going
           sub-projects.

7. The DSWD has prepared the work and financial plans for the extension period, which
   the Bank found acceptable.

8. This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension was approved
   since the grant agreement was signed on May 30, 2012 and the original closing date
   was on December 2012, thus the implementation period of 7 months was insufficient.
   The first extension was also approved in view of the approved amendment of the
   Administration Agreement, extending the closing date of the parent trust fund.

9. The EAPFM confirmed that KALAHI-CIDSS Project has no outstanding audit report
   and Interim Financial Report.

10. In light of the above it is recommended that the closing date of the Grant be extended
   until May 31, 2014 to provide sufficient time for completion of grant activities in
   accordance with the plan.
