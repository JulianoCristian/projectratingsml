                         It was agreed that a joint Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared given the close collaboration that has been forged between the KC team and the Bank, and to
                         ensure that the ICR reflects the views of both sides. It was also agreed that the ICR will be prepared within six months of project completion, which will be November 2014. The next
                         mission is tentatively planned in February 2014.
