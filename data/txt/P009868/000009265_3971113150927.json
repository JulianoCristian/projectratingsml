The main objectives of the project were:\n            (i) to improve the quality of coal available to consumers,\n            (ii) to increase the supply of thermal coal to the power and\n            industrial sector, and, (iii) to increase the supply of\n            coking coal to the steel sector. The performance of the Bank\n            in identification and supervision was rated satisfactory.\n            The performance of the borrower and its implementing\n            agencies was marginally satisfactory. The main lesson\n            learned concerns the difficulties of resettling villagers\n            owning and occupying land on a mine site. (a) persuading\n            project-affected people that they can and will benefit\n            financially and physically in a well-planned and mutually\n            agreed resettlement scheme will make land acquisition far\n            easier than it has been to date in Sonepur-Bazar; (b) the\n            procurement of mining equipment is very different from the\n            procurement of major construction works such as the two\n            repair and maintenance workshops and internal equipment\n            required in this project. Future operation of the project\n            mines can be confidently predicted to continue to be\n            successful, albeit with a year delay on attainment of\n            programmed output from Sonepur-Bazari."}, "docdt": "1997-04-23T00:00:00Z"}
