MENORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIOMAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO INDIA FOR THE
COAL MINING AND COAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to India for US$340
million is submitted for approval.  The proposed loan would be at the
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including a
5-year grace period. The Government of India (GOI) would relend US$180
million of the proceeds of the loan to Coal India Limited (CIL) for 15
years including five years grace and at an effective interest rate of not
less than 13.75% per annum. GOI would bear the foreign exchange and the
interest rate risks.
2.        Background.  Coal is and will continue to be India's most
abundant domestic energy resource. In 1985/86 coal production reached 153
million tons making India the 6th largest coal producer in the world. Coal
presently accounts for about 60% of all commercial energy produced in India
and even allowing for new oil and gas discoveries, coal's contribution is
expected to remain at more than 50X over the next decade. India's vast
thermal coal reserves will be sufficient to meet the country's needs for
the next 100 to 150 years.
3.        The principal objectives of GOI's energy policy may be summarized
as to: (a) develop energy supplies economically at a rate commensurate
with growth in the economy; (b) substitute indigenous energy resources for
imported petroleum wherever this is both technically and economically
feasible; and (c) encourage the efficient use of energy resources. GOI's
energy strategy was largely shaped by the steep increase in international
oil prices during the 19709. In response to these price increases, which
placed a heavy burden on the balance of payments and led to widespread fuel
shortages and disruptions in the economy, GO adopted a two-pronged
strategy which aimed at (a) accelerating energy supplies from economic,
indigenous resources and (b) reducing oil consumption by lowering total
energy consumption and replacing oil with other fuels.   GOI's coal
development strategy emphasizes (a) rapid expansion of highly mechanized,
low cost open pit mines, especially for thermal coal; (b) rehabilitation
and mechanization of deep underground collieries to increase the supply of
higher quality grades of coal, especially prime coking coal; (c) increasing
efficiency and productivity of both underground and open-pit mines,
thereby, lowering production costs; (d) improving coal quality to
consumers;-and (e) improving coal transportation and handling. The
Government is also undertaking a major construction program for coal based
thermal power plants located near the mines as part of an attempt to
overcome, at least in part, transportation constraints and distributional
problems resulting from the greater use of coal.



-2-
4.        GOI's coal development strategy is largely being implemented
through the operations of the government-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) and Its
subsidiaries which account for over 90% of coal production in India. CIL
is the largest coal mlning company in the world. The CIL group operates
over 400 mines ranging from very large, highly mechanized projects using
state of the art mining equipment to small, labor intensive mines with
rudimentary mining methods. CIL has been successful in increasing thermal
coal production in recent years, although consumers have been concerned
about poor coal quality and shortages of coking coal and superior quality
thermal coal. After several years of losses in the late 1970q, CIL was
profitable in 1981/82 and 1982/83. Since then, CIL's financial performance
has deteriorated and CIL is presently in a loss-making situation. As a
result CIL has been unable to meet a minimum debt service coverage ratio of
1.3 agreed under both the Dudhichua and Jharia Projects (Loans 2393 and
2498 respectively). Coal prices were last adjusted in January 1986, and
are broadly in line with efficiency pricing criteria. CIL is, thus,
attempting to improve its financial performance and meet the agreed debt
service coverage ratio by introducing measures to improve efficiency and
reduce costs. This is not an easy task given the heavy burden on CIL of
unionized labor costs (about half of total production costs) and social
pressures against reducing real wage rates or cutting employment in the
sector. GIL has prepared a Medium Term Coal Efficiency Improvement Program
(1986-1990) which includes inter alia steps to restrict hiring and improve
labor productivity (such as retraining and redeployment of surplus worlers,
early retirement schemes and recruitment freeze for unskilled workers),
computerization of spare parts systems and improved operating and
maintenance capabilities (to increase availability and utilization of
highly mechanized mining equipment) and stringent cost control (to contain
increases in administration, stores, power and transport costs). These
measures, combined with coal price increases to offset inflation, are
expected to improve CIL's financial position but will not fully achieve the
required strengthening. Therefore, GOI is examining further options such
as financial restructuring and coal price adjustments in real terms in
order to reestablish CIL's financial viability within four years and enable
CIL to meet its agreed debt service coverage ratio.
5.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the project are to
increase the supply of thermal coal (to the power and industrial sectors)
and coking coal (to the steel sector) and to improve the quality of coal
available to consumers. The project is also designed to increase the
efficiency of existing coal mining operations and strengthen the
managerial, commercial and financial practices of both CIL and its
subsidiaries thereby helping CIL improve its financial performance *
6.        Project Description.  The project would include the development
of the second phase of the Gevra open-pit mining complex (to increase
production from 5 to 10 million tons per year of low grade thermal coal to
feed the Korba power plant) and the construction of the Sonepur-Bazari
open-pit mining complex (to produce 3 million tpy of intermediate and
superior grade thermal coal), including infrastructure such as wor ibhops,
training institutes and coal handling plants. Environmental protection
measures would provide for air and water quality protection, erosion



-3-
control, reforestation and land reclamation. Resettlement arrangements
have been made for both mining complexes and over half of the resettlement
activities are already completed at Gevra. The project would support the
institutional development of CIL by strengthening its manpower planning and
organization, by improving training, and by Improving the maintenance of
equipment through modernization of workshops. The project would also
include the importation of about three million tons of low-ash coking coal
(average 10% ash) which will make-up for a shortfall in domestic supplies
aul which will improve the average quality of coking coal supplied to steel
mills through blending with domestic coking coal (average 21% ash).
7.        The total financing required for the project is about US$643
million, of which about US$319 million (50%) will be in foreign exchange.
The proposed project would finance 100% of foreign costs and 7% of local
costs. The project would involve retroactive financing of up to US$20
million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, as well as the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. The loan allocation for
coking coal imports would be released in two tranches. The first tranche
(US$100 million) would be released at loan effectiveness and the second
tranche (US$60 million) on receipt by the Bank of a satisfactory program of
measures to enable CIL to meet its agreed financial perfcruance targets.
A timetable of hey project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
(IBRD No. 19279R) showing the project areas is also attached. The staff
appraisal report (Report number 5843-IN), dated March 25, 1987 Is being
distributed separately.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. The main objectives of the
Bank's assistance in the coal sector are (a) improvements in the efficiency
of coal mining operations; (b) institution building to strengthen the
management and finances of the industry; and (c) improvements in the
transportation, distribution and use of coal, including enhanced coal
quality. The project would fit in with the Bank's strategy by supporting
CIL's efforts to increase production, Improve efficiency and restore its
financial viability, By including training programs and training institute
design in the project and by introducing state-of-the-art mining
technology, the Bank would contribute to CIL's efforts to improve the
efficiency of its mining operations as well as strengthening the skill and
capabilities of its workers and managers to meet the needs of the
industry's development program. By importing high quality coking coal, the
project would help improve the efficieny of the steel industry.
9.        Agreed Actions.  In addition to management, financial, reporting,
auditing, safety, environmental protection, and project completion
covenants, the following were also agreed with the Government and with CIL
and its subsidiaries:
(a) the Government would (i) prepare a detailed implementation
schedule for measures to improve coal quality; (ii) review
coal prices with a view to, under conditions of efficient
operation, ensuring the financial viability of CIL and providing
increased resource mobilization in the sector; (Ili) furnish the



-4-
Bank with a program of measures to enable CIL to meet its agreed
financial targets including its debt service coverage ratio; the
receipt of a satisfactory program of measures by October 1, 1988
would be a condition of release of the second trancte of funds
for coking coal; and (iv) execute a subsidiary loan agreement
with CIL satisfactory to the Bank as a condition of loan
effectiveness.
(b) CIL and its subsidiaries would (i) retain assistance for the
design of workshop facilities, for the design and development of
training institutes, and for the improvement of manpower planning
and training; (11) review with the Bank its annual operating
performance; (iii) furnish the Bank with a report on detailed
mine planning and slope stability; (iv) implement a
rehabilitation program for certain loss making mines and extend
the program to additional mines; (v) undertake a resettlement
program for people affected by the project; and (vi) confirm the
possession of 68 ha of land requlred for the Sonepur-Bazari mine
complex as a condition of disbursement for the Sonepur-Bazari
component.
10.       Project Justification and Benefits.  Economic benefits under the
proposed Project would include a) increasing the supply of coal to power
plants which would help increase power availability in Madhya Pradesh and
help alleviate acute power shortage and associated losses in industrial
output in West Bengal; (b) reducing shortages of higher grade coal;
(c) importing low-ash coking coal which would help Improve the quality of
coking coal supplies to the steel sector thereby helping improve blast
furnace productivity and efficiency in the steel industry; and (d)
implementing efficient operating practices and supporting the transfer of
modern mining technology to CIL. The economic rate of return (ERR) is 32%
for the Gevra component and 19% for the Sonepur-Bazari component.
11.       Project Risk. The project would face minimal technical and
marketing risks. There is a risk that the Sonepur-Eazari component may be
delayed by land acquisition difficulties, The required land is in the
hands of the Government of West Bengal and handover is expected shortly.
Possible financial risks would be mitigated by (a) CIL's efforts to improve
its efficiency and financial performance; (b) the Government's commitment
to preparing a program of measures, including price increases if
appropriate, that would assure CIL's future financial viability; and (c)
the high priority GOI places on developing its critically needed coal
resources in a timely and efficient manner.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
