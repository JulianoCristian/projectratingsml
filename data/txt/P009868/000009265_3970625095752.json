{"cdata!": "The main objectives of the Coal Mining\n            and Coal Quality Improvement Project are to increase the\n            supply of thermal coal (to the power and industrial sectors)\n            and coking coal (to the steel sector) and improve the\n            quality of coal available to consumers. This project is\n            designed to support Coal India Limited (CIL) in its efforts\n            to develop and implement efficiency improvements and,\n            thereby, improve its financial performance. The project will\n            support the institutional development of CIL by\n            strengthening its manpower planning and organization, by\n            improving training, and by improving the maintenance of\n            equipment through modernization of workshops. The project\n            consists of the development of: 1) the second phase of the\n            Gevra open pit mining complex which will increase output\n            from five to ten million tons per year of low grade thermal\n            coal; and, 2) the construction of the Sonepur-Bazari mining\n            complex to produce three million tons of intermediate and\n            superior grade thermal coal."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
