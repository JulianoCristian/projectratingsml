The extension is necessary for the purpose of\n            completing five transmission line packages that have been\n            delayed in execution, and the replacement of two\n            transformers that were used at alternate locations. PLN has\n            provided a specific action plan with identifiable milestones\n            to complete all outstanding work. These milestones have been\n            prepared to provide reasonable assurance of adequate\n            monitoring and follow up so that the work can be expected to\n            be completed by the new requested completion date. The\n            request for this extension was made by the Ministry of\n            Finance for the Republic of Indonesia in a letter dated\n            December 20, 2011. The project was initially restructured in\n            June 2008 in order to remove the major sector-restructuring\n            activities of the project because the legal basis for\n            successfully implementing them no longer existed, to expand\n            the deployment of the Enterprise Resource Planning System\n            (ERP) to include the entire Java-Bali power system, and to\n            extend the closing date of the project by one year to\n            December 31, 2009. The loan was further extended in December\n            2009 by two years through December 31, 2011 to allow for the\n            completion of outstanding project works. This will be the\n            third extension of the project which had an original closing\n            date of December 31, 2008."}, "docdt": "2011-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
