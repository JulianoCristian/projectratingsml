7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The revised development objective of the project is to improve the reliability and efficiency of the power
system in Java-Bali and strengthen PLN and PGN#s management capabilities. This objective is to be
achieved through the provision of Bank financing toward priority investments and technical assistance for
PLN, and technical assistance for PGN. In particular, project components for PLN will: (i) achieve greater
utilization of existing generation capacity on East Java, by relieving constraints in the bulk transmission
grid; (ii) improvee the reliability of existing generation supply at the PLN and independent power producer
(IPP) geothermal power plants on West Java, by strengthening the associated local transmission system;
(iii) improve the reliability of power supply at various locations throughout Java and Bali, by strengthening
and debottlenecking local transmission and subtransmission networks; and (iv) by strengthening iPLN's
management capabilities by enhancing the company's information systems. Technical assistance to PGN
will enhance its capabilities for expanding gas utilization on Java.
