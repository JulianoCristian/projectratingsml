Java-Bali Power Sector\n            Restructuring and Strengthening Project for Indonesia were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the key lesson to take away from this project is\n            the need to better understand and assess the tradeoffs\n            between the political economy and country engagement issues\n            and the need for the Bank to preserve its best practices and\n            ensure quality at entry in project design. The lesson here\n            is that a balance needs to be found between these competing\n            interests and there must be the willingness to make the hard\n            decisions that may sometimes be required. The second lesson\n            from this project has to do with transmission projects\n            themselves. The delays with the transmission lines in this\n            project are not unique. It is known to be happening with\n            several other transmission projects in the country where\n            very similar issues have caused or are causing delays in\n            project implementation. The third lesson here has also to do\n            with a tradeoff of sorts. With respect to right of way\n            issues, the question arises as to whether or not and under\n            what circumstances the Bank should intervene at higher\n            levels in the country to address such right of way issues.\n            There is always the tension between the need to intervene in\n            order to expedite the project vs. the need to provide\n            guidance without intervention, in order to allow country\n            systems to evolve and develop so that they are better able\n            to move expeditiously address these issues in the longer\n            term. Finally, it is important for sector practitioners to\n            look more closely at ERP deployment and also at what was\n            done here specifically, to explore opportunities for\n            applicability in other utilities in other countries and\n            regions. This lesson is also relevant and topical in the\n            context of the present reorganization and increased sector\n            wide approach being introduced within the Bank."}, "docdt": "2014-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
