7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The current development objective of the project (as of the date of the last restructuring of December 2009) 
is to improve the reliability and efficiency of the power system in Java-Bali and strengthen PLN and PGN's 
management capabilities.  This objective is to be achieved through the provision of Bank financing toward 
priority investments and technical assistance for PLN, and technical assistance for PGN.  In particular, 
project components for PLN will: (i) achieve greater utilization of existing generation capacity in East 
Java, by relieving constraints in the bulk transmission grid; (ii) improve the reliability of existing 
generation supply at the PLN and independent power producer (IPP) geothermal power plants in West 
Java, by strengthening the associated local transmission system; (iii) improve the reliability of power 
supply at various locations throughout Java and Bali, by strengthening and debottlenecking local 
transmission and subtransmission networks; and (iv) by strengthening PLN's management capabilities by 
enhancing the company's information systems. Technical assistance to PGN will enhance its capabilities 
for expanding gas utilization in Java.
