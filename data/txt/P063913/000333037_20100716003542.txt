SUMMARY
1. The Bank received a letter from the Ministry of Finance dated January 21, 2010 seeking a
   cancellation of the undisbursed portion of the PGN component of the Java Bali Power Sector
   Restructuring and Strengthening Project (IBRD 7758 ­ ID, formerly IBRD 4712-IND)1 which
   has a total loan amount of US$ 141 million. The original loan amount for the PGN
   component (Loan Agreement Schedule 1- Component 3c - PGN Restructuring and
   Institutional Strengthening TA) was US$ 6,060,6062 of which PGN has disbursed US$
   2,487,672. PGN is seeking through the Ministry of Finance, a cancellation of the balance of
   funds undisbursed in category 3c (see Table 1), or US$ 3,572,933.93.



PROJECT STATUS
2. The PGN TA activities already funded under the Loan have been completed, and their key
   performance and outcome/impact indicators have been achieved through the combined use of
   Loan funds and PGN's own financial resources. As a result of the restructuring of the TA
   program to reflect changes in PGN's capacity building needs, and the significant
   improvement in PGN's financial condition, PGN decided to use its own funds to finance the
   balance of the TA activities. The status of key TA deliverables funded by the Loan, and
   follow-up activities financed by PGN are as follows (see Table 1).

3. The TA to PGN Component has been rated as Satisfactory during the last two ISRs.

  On July 6, 2009, the undisbursed portion of the original variable spread loan (IBRD 4712-IND) was converted to a
fixed spread loan and given a new loan number (IBRD 7758-ID).

  Component 3c. Part B, the PT PGN technical assistance component had an initial allocated amount of US$6 million
plus a front-end fee of 1 percent, of which US$2,487,672 has been disbursed including US$2,427,066.07 of loan funds
and US$60,606.06 front-end fee. The remaining US$3,572,933.93 is being cancelled.

                                                                                 3
PROPOSED CHANGES
       ·    Components

4. There have been no significant changes to the project components, and neither will there be
   any implications to the PDOs.

5. The technical assistance to PGN included the following activities at project inception: (i)
   developing a rationalized gas pricing policy; (ii) PGN corporate restructuring; (iii) preparing
   for an IPO for a portion of PGN's gas distribution activities; (iv) preparing for the
   involvement of a strategic partner in PGN's transmission operations; and (v) PGN capacity
   building and training for business transformation within a deregulated market environment.

   allocated to each of the categories set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the
   Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the International Bank for

                 o   Financing Plan

7. As a result of the restructuring of the PGN TA program to reflect changes in PGN's capacity
       building needs, and the significant improvement in PGN's financial condition, PGN has
       decided to use its own funds to finance the balance of the TA activities. The activities that
       will no longer be financed from IBRD loan proceeds will therefore be taken up by PGN's
       internal funds. The total cost of the project will remain unchanged as follows (see Table 3).

            o Cancellation

8. The original loan amount for the PGN component (Loan Agreement Schedule 1 Component
   3c- PGN Restructuring and Institutional Strengthening TA) was US$ 6,060,606 of which
   PGN has disbursed US$ 2,487,672. PGN is seeking through the Ministry of Finance, a
   cancellation of the balance of funds undisbursed in category 3c., or US$ 3,572,933.93.

9. The TA component to PGN has been carried out satisfactorily through the combined use of
   Loan funds and PGN's own resources. PGN's performance is satisfactory and there are no
   unfulfilled covenants or outstanding or qualified audit reports or financial reports, nor are
   there any problems with the audit or FM reports that have been submitted by PGN.

10. Based on the work effort undertaken under Component 3c. (the PGN component) of the
    Loan, the key deliverables have been successfully completed. We believe that the TA has
    met its development objective, and that the key performance indicators, and the outcome and
    impact indicators have been achieved.

11. Please note that we have followed the Bank's guidelines on loan cancellation initiated by the
    Borrower. We therefore recommend that the undisbursed portion of the Loan for this
    component be cancelled as per the request received from the Ministry of Finance. We hereby
    request your clearance of the request for loan cancellation.
