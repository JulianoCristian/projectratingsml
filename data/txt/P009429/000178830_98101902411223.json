telecommunications network of Bangladesh through the\n            provision of additional: (i) local telephone switching\n            facilities and subscriber lines; (ii) long distance\n            transmission facilities; (iii) telephone service to rural\n            areas; (iv) receivers and other equipment for international\n            satellite communications; (v) buildings and equipment for\n            telephone exchanges, transmission centers, and training\n            facilities; and (vi) technical assistance to help TTB\n            strengthen its project planning and implementation\n            capabilities and its financial and administrative structure.\n            In strengthening the telecommunications system, the project\n            would improve the efficiency of a wide range of economic and\n            social activities. In particular, the project would benefit\n            smaller urban and rural communities and isolated commercial\n            and industrial enterprises which currently have no access to\n            telecommunications service."}, "docdt": "1982-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
