of\n            small-scale activities, and increase of official earnings\n            enshrined in the project objectives have been effectively\n            achieved.  However, two of the objectives, namely: improving\n            mining skills, and access to equipment and capital, have not\n            been effectively addressed.  Marketing of the precious\n            minerals by small-scale mining leaves much to be desired.\n            The study recommends the following: 1) more mineral lands of\n            the large scale mining concerns be released to small-scale\n            miners; 2) the project should form small groupings or\n            cooperatives of small-scale miners to enable them to benefit\n            from credit, tools and equipment lease or high-purchase; 3)\n            the government should amend the small scale gold mining law\n            to include limited prospecting and \"blasting\", and\n            the inclusion of other precious metals; 4) marketing; 5)\n            relationship between the project and the Precious Minerals\n            Marketing Corporation (PMMC) should be streamlined to\n            encourage transparency; 6) relationship between Mines\n            Department and District Administration should be streamlined\n            to ensure success of the second phase of the project; and 7)\n            there should be proper needs assessment of the project\n            officers to enable the project to develop a training programme."}, "docdt": "1993-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
