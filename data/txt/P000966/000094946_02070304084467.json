and institutional\n            development impacts substantial. Regardless of success, some\n            lessons learned convey the following. Technical assistance\n            is not an optimal instrument to implement a sector reform,\n            particularly as in this case, where policy issues and\n            restructuring requirements were not clearly identified, nor\n            agreed to by the Government, neither in the Staff Appraisal\n            Report, or Credit Agreement. Most importantly, and given the\n            fact that small-scale mining is a poverty-driven activity,\n            the project design should have accordingly, taken an\n            integrated approach, recognizing this fact as a\n            poverty-reduction component. As for project implementation,\n            it is important to have effective inter-ministerial, and\n            inter-agency coordination to ease the achievement of project\n            goals, since, as in this particular case, performance tends\n            to be affected by that of state agencies, generally\n            under-performing private sector standards."}, "docdt": "2002-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
