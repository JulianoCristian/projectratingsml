unsatisfactory;\n            project sustainability is rated unlikely because the\n            Minerals Commission, on of the project's successes, is\n            in financial difficulty, threatening its future performance.\n            Both Bank and Borrower performances are assessed as\n            unsatisfactory, given poor project quality at entry,\n            inadequate supervision, and the inability of the government\n            to make hard deciosions. The overall outcome of the Mining\n            Sector Development and Environment Project is assessed as\n            moderately satisfactory in light of the project's\n            continuing relevance and the substantial progress in its\n            capacity-building objective. However, the sustainability of\n            the capacity building achievements of the project is now in\n            doubt and overall project sustainability is rated unlikely.\n            Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory, albeit only\n            marginally, given shortcomings in the project's quality\n            at entry. Borrower performance is assessed as unsatisfactory\n            because the Government did not provide proper sector\n            leadership, failed to reform the Geological Survey\n            Department and latterly did not provide adequate funding for\n            the Minerals Commission to operate effectively. The main\n            lessons learned are: 1) Improving the legal and fiscal\n            framework for private investors can be highly effective in\n            attracting inflows of capital to the mining sector. 2)\n            Legalization of artisanal mining is desirable but needs to\n            be accompanied by measures to tax and control the\n            environmental damage caused by such mining. 3) Effective,\n            transparent, and equitable mechanisms for transferring\n            resources back to communities affected by large-scale mining\n            are essential sociopolitical tools to ensure that tangible\n            economic benefits are felt by local people and that mining\n            has legitimacy in the eyes of the public."}, "docdt": "2003-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
