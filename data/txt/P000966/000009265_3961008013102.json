Ghana's mining sector on an\n            environmentally sound basis through strengthened mining\n            institutions and the provision of appropriate technology and\n            organizational support to small-scale miners. The project\n            will strengthen mining sector institutions through: 1)\n            support to the Minerals Commission to improve its\n            organizational structure; expand its promotional activities;\n            formulate regulations and amend existing legislation;\n            develop guidelines and standards for environmental\n            monitoring and control; 2) support the Mines Department to\n            carry out its inspection, monitoring and enforcement\n            responsibilities; 3) support the Geological Survey to\n            improve its geological information base; 4) support to the\n            Ministry of Energy and Mines to carry out its policy\n            planning and coordination role. The project will also\n            provide assistance to small-scale mining enterprises\n            through: 1) pilot testing of identified modules of\n            small-scale mining equipment for improving both productivity\n            and yields; 2) a program to make better geological\n            information available to small-scale miners through the\n            assistance of geologists to delineate recoverable ore\n            bodies; 3) improvements in the sector framework for small\n            scale mining operations (SSM); and 4) reclamation and\n            rehabilitation of priority areas degraded through past SSM\n            activities as a pilot exercise."}, "docdt": "1995-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
