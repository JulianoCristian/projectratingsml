Environment Project is to support the\n            development of Ghana's mining sector on an\n            environmentally sound basis through strengthened mining\n            institutions and the provision of appropriate technology and\n            organizational support to small-scale miners. The project\n            will strengthen mining sector institutions through: 1)\n            support to the Minerals Commission to improve its\n            organizational structure; expand its promotional activities;\n            formulate regulations and amend existing legislation;\n            develop guidelines and standards for environmental\n            monitoring and control; 2) support the Mines Department to\n            carry out its inspection, monitoring and enforcement\n            responsibilities; 3) support the Geological Survey to\n            improve its geological information base; 4) support to the\n            Ministry of Energy and Mines to carry out its policy\n            planning and coordination role. The project will also\n            provide assistance to small-scale mining enterprises\n            through: 1) pilot testing of identified modules of\n            small-scale mining equipment for improving both productivity\n            and yields; 2) a program to make better geological\n            information available to small-scale miners through the\n            assistance of geologists to delineate recoverable ore\n            bodies; 3) improvements in the sector framework for small\n            scale mining operations (SSM); and 4) reclamation and\n            rehabilitation of priority areas degraded through past SSM\n            activities as a pilot exercise."}, "docdt": "1995-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
