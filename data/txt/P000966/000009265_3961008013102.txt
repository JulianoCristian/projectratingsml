MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A MINING SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 7.9 million, the equivalent of US$12.3
million, to help finance a project for mining sector development and environmental
improvement.
2.    Country/Sector Background. During the 10 years prior to the introduction of
the Economic Recovery Program (ERP), real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell by 2
percent per annum. Since the ERP was adopted in 1983, the GDP has grown at an annual
average rate of around 5 percent. Significant policy reforms and fiscal adjustment
occurred under the ERP. The policy reforms included the reform of trade and exchange
rate systems, the elimination of price controls, and liberalization of interest rates and
investment regulations including those applicable to mining, which resulted in better
incentives for efficient and sustainable growth. In addition, increased mobilization of
revenue under the ERP permitted the Government to make significant investments in
infrastructure, while at the same time reducing fiscal deficits. Inflation fell from more than
100 percent in 1984 to less than 20 percent in 1991.
3.    Notwithstanding a decade of sustained fiscal adjustment, in 1992 the election-
related wage increases and other fiscal slippages resulted in a re-emergence of fiscal
deficits and inflation. There was some improvement in the fiscal situation in 1993 and
1994. The economy grew by 5 percent in 1993 but, due to unexpected rains and conflict
in the Northern areas, GDP growth was less than anticipated in 1994, averaging about 3.8
percent while inflation rose to 25 percent. Macroeconomic stability is expected to be
restored in 1995 and sustained after that, which should result in more rapid private sector
growth in the medium to long term.
4.    The mining sector in Ghana accounted for about 45 percent of export earnings in
1993. The sector employs about 20,000 workers in the larger mines and 30,000 people in
small-scale mining (SSM). Gold is its principal product, with about 85 percent of total
mining sector export value and 85 percent of formal employment. Since 1985 when the
sector was opened up for private investment, investment in gold production has exceeded
US$500 million and output has grown steadily from 277,000 ounces in 1983 to 1,261,000
ounces in 1993. Large-scale mining involves a few producers, and the largest among
these, Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, accounted for 74 percent of the country's output in
1992. The Government recently reduced its stake in Ashanti Goldfields from 55 percent
to 31.3 percent, raising US$400 million in a transaction that saw the Corporation's stock
successfully floated on the Accra and London Stock Exchanges. The lack of a robust



- 2 -
pipeline of exploration targets and a recent drop in the level of new investments, however,
raise concerns about the future of the sector, stimulating a review of current policy and
strategy and the adequacy of the Government's institutional capability to carry out
promotional activities. If the sector is to continue to expand, there is now a pressing need
for the government to improve the availability and dissemination of basic geological data
from which private investors can identify new sites with promising mineral potential for
follow-up with detailed exploration work. -
5.    The main Government agency dealing with the mining sector is the Ministry of
Energy and Mines (MEM). The Mines Department (MD) and the Geological Survey
Department (GS) are the Ministry's main departments responsible for the sector. The MD
is responsible for mine safety, enforcement of licensing and leasing provisions of minerals
concessions, and environmental monitoring. The GS gathers and publishes information on
Ghana's mineral resources as a basis for attracting investment. The Minerals Commission
(MC) was established in 1986 as a semi-independent agency designed to help formulate
Government policy, and generally to encourage the development of the mining sector.
The International Development Association's (IDA) support for the mining sector included
the Mining Sector Rehabilitation Project (IDA Credit No. 192 1-GH), which primarily
supports the rehabilitation and privatization of three Government-owned and operated
gold mines. The privatization of one mine has been completed and another is under
private management with the related agreement shortly to be ratified by Parliament.
Negotiations for joint venturing of the third mine have been completed. The related
agreement is yet to be ratified by Parliament and management transferred to the joint
venture partner.
6.    For many years, the adverse environmental- impact of mining was ignored, with
resultant degradation of the land, adverse effect on water quality, and air pollution from
the large-scale mining operations. These effects have had an adverse impact on the
communities near the mining operations. During the last several years, large-scale mining
operations run by foreign investors have generally adhered to internationally acceptable
environmental practices, and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) have been
required for all new mining concessions. Government capacity to carry out any type of
environmental monitoring has been lacking due to the paucity of operational funds, skills
and tools. The present project aims to address this constraint. The Government-operated
mnines have made the least progress in remedying past environmental damage, although
this is now being remedied through the inclusion of provisions for mitigation of past
damage (financed in part by funds made available through the Mining Sector
Rehabilitation Credit) in connection with the privatization of these operations.
7.    SSM of both gold and diamonds is widespread, especially in the Southern and
Eastern parts of the country. The Government adopted, in 1989, a law specifically
regulating SSM gold operations. It also set up the Precious Minerals Marketing
Corporation (PMMC) to buy the output of both gold and diamonds, either directly or
through licensed traders, in order to attract these flows to legal channels. Nevertheless,
substantial amounts continued to be sold through unauthorized parallel channels. During



- 3 -
1994, several initiatives have been taken by the Government to improve the market
competitiveness of gold and diamonds produced by small-scale miners. In the case of
diamonds, PMMC has introduced competitive buying and exporting with the licensing of
five international operators who carry on their activities in its Accra office. In the case of
gold, PMMC has opened a buying office in Tarkwa, and the Government has authorized a
private company, Miramex, to purchase gold in competition with PMMC. Also, PMMC
has become more competitive with the unauthorized buyers of gold by offering better
prices (97 percent of the international market price as compared to 93 percent in the past).
This has resulted in doubling of purchases in 1993 over 1992, and additional increases in
1994. The Government plans to liberalize the market further, as indicated in a Letter of
Sector Development Policy dated May 3, 1995 (Schedule E).
8.    SSM production in Ghana is carried out with hand tools in the most rudimentary
fashion, and incomes from SSM operations are minimal. Recovery is typically only 20 to
30 percent of the gold contained in the mined ore, and there is a general lack of
knowledge and disregard for safety and environmental regulations. The MC is engaged in
trying to improve SSM of gold and diamonds through implementation of a pilot Small-
Scale Mining Project (SSMP), carried out with assistance from German technical
assistance (TA) provided through Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit
(GTZ). This project included an analysis of the needs of the sub-sector, identified the
main constraints and initiated pilot testing of improved mining and processing techniques
and equipment, pilot tested a credit program and completed an assessment of the social
and environmental impact of SSM. Assessments have also been completed on the role of
increased participation of women in the sector, as well as marketing mechanisms for gold
and diamonds. The pilot testing activities of SSMP have confirmed significant potential
for improvement in output, productivity and yields but the specific means to achieve this
potential are yet to be proven for Ghanaian conditions.
9.    Project Objectives. The overall objective of the project is to support the
development of Ghana's mining sector on an environmentally sound basis through
strengthened mining institutions and organizational support to small scale miners to
encourage the use of appropriate technology. Specifically, the objectives are: (a) to
enhance the capacity of the mining sector institutions to carry out their functions of
promoting and regulating investments in the mining sector in an environmentally sound
manner, and (b). to support the use of techniques that will improve the productivity,
financial viability and reduce the environmental impact of SSM operations.
10.   Project Description. In order to achieve these objectives, the project would
consist of the following components:
(a)   Strengthening of the mining sector institutions (US$5.44 n.) through:
(i) support to the MC to: a) improve its organizational structure; b) expand
its promotional activities; c) review existing monitoring and enforcement
practices including jurisdictional responsibilities of MC, MD and the EPA
with regard to environmental monitoring; d) develop guidelines and



- 4-
standards for implementing sectoral and environmental regulations; and e)
establish a minerals and environmental information system; (ii) support to
the MD to: a) carry out its inspection, monitoring and enforcement
responsibilities, particularly with regard to environmental impact and health
hazards; and b) to assist small-scale miners in the application of the new
technologies developed under the SSM component of this project; (iii)
support to the GS to improve its geological information base through an
aerial survey and to publish and disseminate the results; and (iv) support to
the MEMto carry out its policy planning and coordination role for the
mining sector in a more effective manner.
(b)   Assistance to Small-Scale Mining Enterprises (US$7.82 m.) through: (i)
pilot testing of identified modules of SSM equipment for improving both
productivity and yields, and the dissemination of successfully tested models
to determine their applicability to Ghana's conditions and acceptability by
the small-scale miners; (ii) a program to make better geological information
available to small-scale miners through the assistance of geologists to
delineate recoverable ore bodies on SSM concessions; (iii) improvements in
the sector framework for SSM operations, including review of laws and
regulations, and improvements in the marketing arrangements for SSM
production; and (iv) reclamation and rehabilitation of priority areas
degraded through past SSM activities as a pilot exercise to determine best
practices and cost-effective methods for future reclamation programs.
11.   Project Implementation. The MC would be the main executing agency for the
project with the GS, MD and the MEM as participating agencies. A Project Coordinator
would be appointed at the MC to manage and coordinate project implementation
activities. The environmental aspects of the project would be implemented in close
collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
12.   Project Sustainability. The strengthening of the sectoral agencies is intended to
ensure sustained growth of the sector, attract private investment as well as encourage
Government to establish environmental controls to be maintained beyond the life of the
project. The strengthening of sectoral agencies to provide capacity for environmental
monitoring as well as the establishment of a mining cadastre and environmental baseline
monitoring are expected to be completed during the project life, and would therefore
minimize recurrent costs thereafter. Environmental guidelines that are put in place during
project implementation, through the TA anrd guidance to be provided under the project,
are expected to be maintained because of economic incentives to be gained. If the
improved packages made available to small-scale miners increase their financial return
significantly, as anticipated, there is a high probability that the improvements, including
envirqnmentally responsible processing procedures, will be adopted and sustained since
there will be a strong economic incentive to do so. Since the project has been designed in
response to proclaimed needs of the Government, there is significant commitment on the



- 5 -
part of participating agencies to take all necessary steps for effective project
implementation.
13.   Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. There were three
operations in Ghana that focused on developing the mining sector. These included the
Export Rehabilitation Project, the Export Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Project and
the ongoing Mining Sector Rehabilitation Project. The two former projects identified
mechanisms for the development of the state-owned mining enterprises and the latter
project focused on the rehabilitation and divestiture of these mines. While there was some
amount of technical assistance and training provided to sectoral agencies to build capacity
in these agencies, the implementation of the project revealed the need for substantial
strengthening of the institutional framework and the setting in place of an effective
regulatory framework. Recently, the Government has started to address the
environmental impact of past mining activities through the Ghana Mining Sector
Rehabilitation Project. Sectoral agencies lack capacity to carry out environmental
monitoring of either the large-scale operations or SSM activities. The existence of a large
and growing SSM sub-sector, and related social, economic and environmental issues
remain unaddressed. The proposed project will address these weaknesses through
capacity building assistance for environmentally sustainable sectoral development.
Consistent with the Mining Policy for Africa, the project also focuses on providing
technical and organizational support as well as improved social and health conditions for
the SSM community.
14.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ghana which was discussed by the Board on
May 9, 1995, of supporting the Government's program of accelerated growth through
private sector development, poverty alleviation, capacity building, investment in
infrastructure, human resource development, and improvement of environmental
management. This project seeks to encourage environmentally sound development of the
mining sector and to improve the economic, social, health and environmental conditions of
small-scale miners. It complements the ongoing Mining Sector Rehabilitation Project
(IDA Cr. 1921-GH) and the Environmental Resource Management Project (IDA Cr.
2426-GH).
15.   Agreements Reached. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government on the following:
(a)   to carry out a comprehensive mid-term review jointly by the MC and IDA,
to be held not earlier than April 1, 1997, and not later than June 30, 1997;
(b)   to carry out an EIA after the completion of the pilot testing activities, and
to review the findings during the mid-term review;
(c)   to provide to IDA, not later than December 31, 1996, a draft report
outlining recommendations for further liberalizing the market for precious



-6-
minerals. On the basis of the final report, an action plan would be
prepared, satisfactory to IDA, by June 30, 1997;
(d)   to submit to IDA, not later than December 31, 1996, a draft report
outlining recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of sectoral
institutions. The final report, satisfactory to IDA, will be used as the basis
to prepare an action plan, not later than June 30, 1997, to further
strengthen the effectiveness of sectoral institutions;
(e)   to submit to IDA, not later than December 31, 1996, a draft report
outlining recommendations for modifying the regulatory framework
including relevant environmental, health and safety regulations. During the
mid-term review, progress of developing reforms in the regulatory
framework will be assessed and an action plan for further reform prepared
byJune 30, 1997;
(f)   to deposit amounts necessary to meet project requirements into a project
account established for this purpose on a periodic basis;
(g)   to prepare annual work programs, including training, for each of the
participating agencies by December 31 of each year starting from
December 31, 1996, based on an evaluation of the previous year's
experience; and
(h)    on the contents of the Project Implementation Manual, including key
performance indicators, terms of reference and schedules.
16.   Poverty Category. The project contains a program of targeted interventions for
poverty alleviation, which includes pilot activities to improve the economic, social, health
and environmental conditions of small-scale miners. In addition, the development of the
sector, including the SSM sub-sector would result- in increased job opportunities in rural
areas and lead to the growth of a small-scale industrial sub-sector of local contractors,
suppliers, consultants and others.
17.   Environmental Aspects. The project is expected to have a positive
environmental impact both through capacity building in sector institutions for
environmental monitoring and management, and through the adoption of specific measures
to minimize the impact on the environment. In addition, the project has a sub-component
that will specifically address the rehabilitation of lands degraded by past SSM activity. A
cost benefit analysis carried out to determine the potential benefits to be obtained by
reclaiming three pilot sites indicate that positive returns are to be derived from the
exercise. Detailed reclamation plans are currently being prepared for these three sites.
Similar studies will be carried out prior to undertaking more reclamation work under the
project. The project has been classified as environmental category "B". An environmental
analysis (EA) of the proposed project has been prepared and is available for review by the



- 7-
public at the MC and the EPA, and is attached to the SAR as Annex G. Specific
environmental analysis will be carried out as part of the project execution with regard to
SSM technology and processing techniques when these have been tested for acceptability
by the end of Phase I of the project.
18.   Program Objective Categories. The project aims at providing support to
institutional and regulatory reforms that will ensure environmentally sustainable growth
and management of the sector. The project also aims at promoting private investment and
entrepreneurship and the improvement of the social and econornic status of small-scale
miners. The technology and processing techniques to be introduced under the project are
aimed at enhancing the productivity and incomes of the small-scale miners. Addressing a
significant proportion of the poor population in rural areas of Ghana, the project provides
a targeted program for poverty alleviation. Finally, the project seeks to fully integrate
environmental concerns into one of the key sectors of the economy.
19.   Participatory Approaches. The project has been prepared in very close
collaboration with the mining sector agencies in Ghana. A beneficiary participation
workshop was held in July 1994, which was attended by officials of all the participating
agencies under the project and all other stakeholders including the Precious Minerals
Marketing Corporation, Miramex, representatives of sectoral agencies including the EPA
and Forestry department, NGOs, members of the private sector and small-scale miners.
Recommendations emanating from the workshop have been incorporated into the design
of the project.
20.   Project Benefits. The main potential benefits of the project include: (a) increased
private sector exploration and investment as a result of improvements in the regulatory
environment and in the capabilities of the mining sector institutions; (b) improvement in
productivity and incomes of small-scale miners through active technical and organizational
support; (c) reduction of the negative environmental impact of mining through the
strengthening of environmental monitoring and enforcement; (d) improved health, safety
and working conditions for large numbers of small-scale miners through the introduction
of appropriate technology and equipment; (e) reduced environmental impact of SSM
activities through the introduction of environmentally responsible technology and
processing techniques; and (f) mitigation of past environmental degradation caused by
SSM activities through land reclamation and rehabilitation activities. The benefits
identified in (b), (e) and (f) are contingent upon the success of the pilot program to assist
small-scale miners.
21.   Risks. The main risks include: (a) the possibility that new technologies
appropriate to SSM in Ghana will not be adopted by the mine operators; and (b) the
institutions responsible for carrying out the project may lack the staff, capability or
incentive to carry out the project successfully. Appropriate technologies for small-scale
miners have been proven to be successful in other countries with similar mining
conditions. Adoption of the new processes by the miners would be facilitated by the field
demonstrations and by making equipment available to them for trial periods. The last risk



-8 -
is addressed by the capacity building nature of the project, which aims to strengthen the
mining institutions.
22.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

Ghana - Implementation Issues
Ghana's overall project implementation performance continues to compare
favorably with other countries in the Region, but compared with Ghana's historical good
performance (if disbursement ratio is used as a measure), past momentum became difficult
to sustain. The disbursement rate for investment projects was 13 percent in FY94,
compared with 17 percent over the previous five years. The June 1994 CPPR discussions
in Ghana acknowledged the benefits that more streamlined procurement procedures have
brought about. It also identified the need to continuously strengthen the Borrower's
knowledge of Bank procurement procedures. But the more challenging issues that affect
implementation over the longer term point to the need for improved project management.
This will be an area of focus at the May 1995 CPPR discussions.
Notwithstanding the above, a common understanding has been reached with the
Government that inimediate improvement in Ghana's portfolio performance is essential for
its economy. The June 1994 Country Portfolio Performance linked for the first time,
fuiture lending levels to disbursement performance. Indeed, greater attention to
implementation by both the Government and the Bank have begun to yield results. Total
disbursements for the FY95, as of March 31, 1995, amount to $106.3 million as compared
to $79.6 million a year ago, an increase of 34 percent.
The number of problem projects in the portfolio has also steadily fallen: from
seven in FY92, to five in FY93, to four in FY94. At present, there are only two problem
projects in the active portfolio. This is expected to be reduced to one shortly. The status
of these projects is as follows:
Forestry Resources Management (FY89). This has been a problem project for
four years due to slow movement on the policy component of the project. The policy
measures include Parliamentary approval for amending the Timber Concessions Act and
legislative action that would establish an executive authority for future changes in royalty
rates. With recent progress on the submission of legislation to the Parliament the project
will soon be upgraded. This action will result in the final tranche release of US$7.5
million.
Water Sector Rehabilitation (FY90). The project has been rated unsatisfactory
for FY93 and FY94. The Action Plan agreed with the government is now progressing
reasonably well. The main reason for delayed implementation was poor management of
the utility. The government recently (March) held a workshop to discuss options for
restructuring the sector and bringing in the private sector.

Dear Ms. Smith:
Mining Sector-Development and Environment Project:
Minerals Sector Development Policy
The purpose of this letter is to define the Mineral Sector Policy of the
Government and to outline the strategies for implementation of the policy
objectives. This statement also provides the background for the execution of
the proposed Mining Sector Development and Environment Project, prepared
with the assistance of the staff of the International Development Association.
We have been pursuing policies that encourage the development of the mineral
sector since the beginning of the Economic Recovery Program in 1983, and the
following policy statement represents a continuation of the earlier initiatives as
well as further measures now deemed necessary to provide additional stimulus
to the sector.
Sector Objectives
There has been significant growth in the Minerals Sector from the
period 1986 to 1994, mainly in the mining of gold. Revenues accruing to the
Government from minerals currently surpass those derived from cocoa. The
key objectives of the Sector Development Policy are to sustain the growth of
the mining sector in order to assure increased foreign exchange earnings and
increased revenues to the Government in the form of taxes and royalties; the
creation of employment and development in rural communities where the
mining activities take place; and ensure that sectoral growth is environmentally
sustainable and does not harmfully impact the local population.

Strategy for Achieving These Objectives
The overall strategy for achieving these objectives is based on four
inter-related approaches:
1.    Emphasis on the Role of the Private Sector: The experiences of
the past have led the government to conclude that the State should concentrate
its efforts on creating a suitable investment climate that will encourage the
private sector to carry out not only mining operations but also provide the
support services required by the mining industry. Attention will thus be focused
on encouraging direct private investment in mineral exploration and mine
development, and on the growth of mining service enterprises such as assay
laboratories and drilling contractors, and establishment of factories to produce
other mining inputs.
2.    Improve the Investment Climate for Large-Scale Mining: Much
has been done to improve the investment climate for large-scale mining during
the past 1 1 years, with considerable success, but now renewed efforts are
needed to keep the momentum going forward through additional measures co
encourage further investment not only in gold production,, but also in the
development of other metallic and industrial minerals in order to expand the
base of Ghana's mining industry. Emphasis will be placed on efforts that would
ensure that the applicable fiscal regime remains fair and stable, with taxes and
royalties applied in a non-discretionary manner.
3.    Promotion of Small-Scale Mining: The strategy will focus on
providing the encouragement needed to improve the small-scale mining sub-
sector, which provides employment for large numbers of people, in a manner
that will lead to increased incomes for the miners, and at the same time, reduce
and contain the current adverse environmental impact of their operations. This
will require educating the small-scale miners in improved mining techniques and
environmental practices, and introducing modern and appropriate processing
equipment that can increase labor productivity and output.
4.    Establishment of Environmental Safeguards: It is a central tenet
of the Mineral Sector strategy that environmental safeguards will be established
and enforced, in order to ensure that the mining industry is developed on a
sustainable basis that does not adversely impact the neighboring communities
and the natural habitat in the vicinity of the mining operations. This will apply
to both large- and small-scale mining operations. The strategy has already been
effectively implemented with regard to the large-scale, privately operated mines.
Provision has been made for mitigation of past damage caused by the State-
owned mining operations. The next step will be to concentrate on measures to
encourage the small-scale mining operations to comply with good
environmental practices.

Action Program to Implement the Strategv
We propose to execute the above strategic approaches by implementing
the following actions over the next several years:
Divestiture. In accordance with our view that mining operations should
be carried out by the private sector, all of the remaining State mines will
be privatized within the next year, with minority Government
shareholding and with the mining operations fully in the control of the
private sector shareholders.
Mining Laws and Regulations. - Some aspects of the laws and
regulations applying to the minerals sector need updating. In some
cases, this can be achieved by administrative directives and in other
cases, it will require action by Parliament. This will require careful
review and assessment, and will also include a comparative study of the
laws, policies and procedures used in other countries that compete with
Ghana for investments in the minerals sector to assure Ghana's
competitiveniess. Particular emphasis will be placed on clarifying the
definition of the rights and obligations of investors so as to ensure
security of tenure and transferability of rights. We expect to undertake
this review with a view to implementing the recommendations
emanating therefrom within the next two years.
Institutional Strengthening. The key mineral sector institutions,
including the Minerals Commission, the Geological Survey and the
Mines Department, will be strengthened in order to make them more
effective in carrying out their respective functions in order to support a
sustainable private sector-oriented development. This will, as you
know, be one of the key aspects of the Mining Sector Development and
Environment Project.
Creation and Publication of a Mineral Database. We propose to
develop a comprehensive database that identifies investment
opportunities in the minerals sector. This database will be accessible to
persons who wish to conduct investigations into the prospects for future
investment, and will be publicized so that potential invescors will be
aware of its existence.
Improvement of Small-Scale Mining. This will be accomplished by the
introduction of new technologies, improved access to geological
information, expanding the access of small-scale miners to markets for
their output, and encouraging the private credit markets to explore
mechanisms for making credit available to small-scale miners. With
regard to the marketing of gold, under a pilot program one private
company has already been licensed to purchase and export gold. This
company has been operating for almost a year. Preliminary indications



Schedule E
Page 4 of 4
-4 -
show that the scheme is successful. We intend to carry out a full review
of the pilot program to determine the guidelines within which additional
licensees will operate, and to expand the market by licensing at least two
additional private companies to purchase and export the production of
gold by December 1995. We will expand the market further in line with
the recommendations of the market liberalization study to be undertaken
by the proposed Mining Sector Development and Environment Project
by December 1997. This will ensure competition in the market, thus
assisting the small-scale miners to realize the maximum price for their
production.
Environmental Improvements. Our program to reduce the
environmental impact of mining operations envisages close cooperation
with the Environmental Protection Agency, particularly with regard to
enforcement of the regulations applicable to the large-scale mines, and
with regard to the development of viable techniques for reducing the
negative impact of small-scale mining operations. This also will be a
central theme of the proposed Mining Sector Development and
Environment Project.
We trust that this statement of sector strategy provides convincing
evidence that our policy for the sector is consistent with the objectives and
strategy contained in the proposed Project. We see this project as providing a
vehicle to achieve the objectives of our strategy, and we request your support in
securing its approval at the earliest possible time.
