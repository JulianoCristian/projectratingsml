The\n            Project was the third cooperative effort by the Government\n            of Algeria and the Bank to work in the agricultural sector\n            and the first effort in the irrigation sub-sector. It was\n            considered by the two parties as the preliminary phase for\n            an anticipated wider Bank involvement in the irrigation\n            sub-sector. Its objectives were to safeguard the\n            continuation of irrigated agriculture in the Bas Cheliff\n            district, to improve operation and maintenance of the\n            existing systems, and to determine, through studies, the\n            most viable follow-up irrigation development program in Bas\n            Cheliff. At appraisal, the Project was intended to provide\n            for rehabilitation of the irrigation head works by the\n            replacement or repair of the head reach and main canal\n            structures and the hydromechanical and electromechanical\n            equipment, the purchase of operation and maintenance\n            (O&M) equipment and the preparation of studies for\n            follow-up irrigation development in Bas Cheliff."}, "docdt": "1987-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
