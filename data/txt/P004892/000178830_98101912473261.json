irrigation\n            infrastructure, reclaiming lands lost to salinity and\n            rationalizing and developing irrigated agriculture in the\n            Bas Cheliff district. The proposed project would focus on\n            the most urgently needed civil works to ensure the\n            continuation of irrigated agriculture on some 4,000 ha in\n            the district, and on measures to improve operations and\n            strengthen maintenance. Studies are included for the\n            preparation of second- and third-stage project which would\n            emphasize respectively: (i) improvements in irrigated\n            agricultural production and reclamation works for some\n            10,000 ha, and (ii) the construction of water mobilization\n            works and extension of the irrigation network. The project\n            would consist of: (i) the repair of diversion weir, the main\n            and primary canals, sluice gates, pumping stations and an\n            aqueduct; (ii) the reconstruction of part of the primary\n            canal and three aqueducts, the replacement of several sluice\n            and automatic gates and pumping station equipment and the\n            provision of a power supply line; (iii) purchase of\n            maintenance and transport equipment; and (iv) the provision\n            of technical assistance and studies,most of which relate to\n            the prep"}, "docdt": "1980-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
