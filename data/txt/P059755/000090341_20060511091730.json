Technical Assistance Credit was unsatisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was modest, and the Bank and borrower performance\n            were both unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from the project:\n            Implementing broad ranging institutional reforms, such as a\n            civil service reform, through a simple technical\n            assistance/capacity building instrument in\n            politically-fragile environments such as post conflict\n            situations, is very risky. When commitment exists, the\n            combination of a policy and a capacity building instrument\n            can yield important synergy (e.g. privatization component),\n            provided there is a good synchronization of the two\n            instruments. Despite their small size and lack of\n            visibility, capacity building projects are staff intensive,\n            and often require expensive specialist inputs, if they are\n            to be effective and successful. Large multi-year technical\n            assistance contracts for public sector reform tend to be\n            inflexible in their design, strain the limited\n            implementation capacity of the borrower and are usually\n            neither suitable nor compatible with an opportunistic,\n            pragmatic and incremental approach to reform which has been\n            found preferable to the big bang approach.\n            Institution-building operations are notably difficult to\n            monitor and evaluate. Thus a thorough annual and afortioria\n            midterm review involving independent reviewers are crucial.\n            Documentation and record keeping of key decisions taken\n            during the implementation period is critical."}, "docdt": "2006-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
