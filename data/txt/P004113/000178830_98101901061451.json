The project has\n            been designed to support the Government's effort to\n            reduce interregional disparities by promoting economic\n            development in major urban areas and the poorer mountain\n            areas and islands of the Jeonju Region. The project consists\n            of: (a) urban development which involves construction of an\n            industrial and housing estate and improvement of drainage in\n            Iri City as well as construction of an industrial estate and\n            expansion of the water distribution system in Jeonju City.\n            It also consists of; (b) tourism development which aims at\n            improving access to scenic areas and development of a\n            tourist site in Namweon City to promote Mt. Jiri National\n            Park, construction of a tourist road in Mt. Naejang National\n            Park, and linking of the major islands in the Seonyu Island\n            group through two pedestrian foot bridges and jetties.
