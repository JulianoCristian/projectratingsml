The project consists of: (a)\n            the installation of 1,100 km of 500-kV transmission line,\n            (b) the installation of two new 500-kV substations and the\n            extension and reinforcement of four existing 500-kV\n            substations, and (c) consulting services for (i)\n            implementing a system for the collection, storage and\n            retrieval of data on power, (ii) a load research and demand\n            management study, and (iii) a feasibility study and detailed\n            engineering for a power generation complex based on imported\n            coal.  The project consists of normal electric utility work\n            entailing no unusual risks and no particular difficulty is\n            foreseen in its execution."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
