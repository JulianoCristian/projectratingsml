IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
FIFTH WAPDA POWER PROJECT
(Loan 2556-PAK)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
Pakistan's large hydropower stations are located in the north; major thermal plants are in the center and south.
During periods of low hydel availability, power has to be transmitted from thermal plants to major load centers,
requiring a strong and reliable high voltage network. In the early 1970s, the Water and Power Development Authority
(WAPDA) started the implementation of a 500-kV network connecting the major generating plants to load centers.
WAPDA's updated load forecast and generation expansion plan prepared in the mid-1980s indicated the need for a
second 500-kV transmission line between Jarmshoro, Lahore and associated substations to interconnect generation
facilities coming on stream with load centers.
Project Objectives
The primary objectives of the Fifth WAPDA Power Project were to develop the 500-kV transmission network
and ensure its economic expansion and operation; it included: (a) the installation of about 1,100 km of 500-kV
transmission line between Lahore and Jamshoro; (b) new 500-kV substations at Lahore and Sahiwal, and the extension
of the existing 500-kV substations of Multan, Guddu, Dadu and Jamshoro; and (c) consulting services for the
collection, storage, and retrieval of power system data, a load research and management study, a feasibility study and
detailed engineering for a power station based on imported coal. The project objectives were clear, realistic, and
consistent with the GOP's and Bank's strategy for the power sector (paras 3.1 and 3.2).
Implementation Experience and Results
The sector reform components of the project were limited since a comprehensive reform program (supported
by the Bank's Energy Sector Loan, Loan 2552-PAK) had been initiated shortly before the project was approved (para
4.1). Against these objectives, WAPDA's institutional and financial performance under the project was generally
satisfactory, and it was able to meet the financial targets agreed under the Loan (para 6.2-6.4). The project did not
include any macroeconomic reform component.
The design and scope of the project were modified as follows: (a) the planned 500-kV substation at Sahiwal
was deferred and a new 500-kV substation was constructed at Peshawar; (b) the site of a 500-kV substation at Lahore
was changed due to geographic conditions; (c) the extension of the 220-kV substations at Bund Road (Lahore) and
Sahiwal was carried out; and (d) the installation of an additional bank of shunt reactors at Tarbela and a circuit breaker
at Gatti was also completed under this project. These revisions were undertaken following WAPDA's revised load
forecast and generation and transmission programme, and load flow analysis (para 5.2). While these changes were
based on detailed investigations and analysis, they also partially affected timely implementation of the project, as
additional time was required to obtain the necessary approvals.
Two sections of the 500-kV transmission line (from Guddu to Multan and Multan to Lahore) were completed
and energized in January 1990 and May 1991, respectively, compared to the appraisal target of June 1990.  The
extension of Multan, Guddu. Dadu and Jamshoro substations were completed in 1990 (para 5.4). The Jamshoro-Guddu
section was affected by the delay in the construction of the Jamshoro power station and the adverse law and order
situation in Sindh province; construction of the line was completed in mid-1995, about five years later than envisaged.
The construction of the Lahore 500-kV substation and the extension of the 220-kV Bund Road (Lahore) substation
were completed and are in operation. Reactor banks have been installed at Tarbela.



-ii-
A study on the feasibility of a coal-fired power generation complex was completed by consultants in 1991. As
regards the collection, storage and retrieval of data on the power system, this exercise was completed in-house by
WAPDA. While no separate study on load research and demand management was carried out under the project,
WAPDA carried out a number of reviews of the load profile and demand-side management activities (para 5.6).
The final cost of the project is about USS403.5 million. This is about 34.1% higher than the appraisal
estimate. The increase is partly attributable to the enhanced scope of the substation component (para 5.7), specifically
the additional equipment and works at Tarbela, Gatti, Bund Road and Sahiwal 220-kV substations. These costs include
an increase in the transmission line component (US$ 167.7 million versus the appraisal estimate of US$129.8 million) as
well as the substation component (US$161.1 million versus US$65.4 million). Financing for the project was provided
by IBRD, OECF, the Swiss and French Governments, CIDA, KfW and WAPDA (para 5.6). Disbursements under the
Bank Loan up to end-May 1994 amounted to US$99.8 million. Following the last disbursement under the Bank Loan
in May 1994, a balance of US$186,755 was cancelled. WAPDA has arranged its own finances for the balance work
estimated at about US$15 million (para 5.10).
Sustainability
The project was successful in enhancing WAPDA's capacity to transmit power from south to north in periods
of fluctuating hydel availability. It also reduced transmission losses and improved the voltage profile. WAPDA needs
to introduce specific measures to ensure the continued efficient operation of the facilities installed under this project so
that the full benefits over the life of the assets may be derived (para 8.1). Overall, the physical objectives of the project
were fully met (para 5.12).
Summary of Findings. Future Operations. and Key Lessons Learned
Findings
Among project gains are the following: (a) enhancement of an efficient north-south transmission system
capable of conveying loads from hydel generation facilities in the north and thermal facilities in the center and south, to
the major consumption centers; (b) reduction in transmission losses; and (c) qualitative improvements in voltage
stability, improved voltage profile, and improvement in the power factor. In addition, WAPDA's institutional capacity
for the expansion of the bulk transmission network was enhanced. However, because of substantial delays mainly in the
commissioning of the Jamshoro-Guddu link, and the grid-stations added to the project scope during implementation,
the full benefits of north-south power transmission were achieved with a delay of about five years.
Future Operation
In order to sustain the benefits of the transmission network, particularly the assets installed under this project,
an operational plan was agreed with WAPDA, which identifies the technical, financial and institutional arrangements
that WAPDA needs to institute in order to operate the network at its maximum efficiency. The operational plan covers,
inter alia, the indicators or targets that would be used to measure the performance of the transmission lines and
substations, technical and financial resources which WAPDA would need to allocate annually towards the operation
and maintenance of these assets, and indicative timetables for monitoring the continued achievement of the
performance indicators by both WAPDA and the Bank (paras 12.1-12.6).
Key Lessons Learned
Completion of the project was delayed substantially because of delays in procurement (sample bidding
documents were finalized only in 1987), the unavailability of local currency funds, the adverse law and order situation
in Sindh, a change in the commissiong of Jamshoro power staion which led to rescheduling of the main Jamshoro-
Guddu line, and finally changes to the original project design and scope. While these changes were based on sound
analysis of conditions evident at the time, it impacted completion of the project because of the need to obtain approvals



-iii-
for the modified project design and to arrange financing. Therefore, quality at entry should be improved, sample
bidding documents should be finalized during project preparation, and, to the extent possible, finalization of additional
financing arrangements should be expedited to reduce implementation delays (para 13.2).
WAPDA should enhance its project supervision skills, in particular its management of the procurement
process and contractual arrangments, and control over suppliers and contractors, in order to avoid implementation
delays. It also needs to ensure the availability of adequate counterpart funds through better cash-flow management, so
that payments to civil contractors or duties/taxes on imported equipment can be made on time. Senior WAPDA
management should make institutional arrangements for regular monitoring of, and taking corrective actions on, the
physical and financial progress with concerned project staff (paras 10.1-10.3).

PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Project Setting
I      Project Identity
Project Name:                  Fifth WAPDA Power Project
Loan No.:                      2556-PAK
RVP Unit:                      South Asia
Country:                       Pakistan
Sector:                        Energy
Sub-sector:                    Power
Backgrund
2.1     Pakistan's large hydropower stations are located in the north. Due to extreme seasonal variations in water
flow, hydro generation has to be compensated by thermal capacity, located in the south. Power transmission along
the north-south axis required the construction of a reliable high voltage network.
2.2     The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) started construction of a 500-kV network
connecting major generating plants to load centers in the early 1970s. An update of the transmission program, to
cater to projected expansions in generation, called for the construction of a second 500-kV line and substations
between Jamshoro and Lahore. This line, together with the establishment of a national load dispatch center, was
expected to enhance the optimal operation of generation facilities and reduce transmission losses.
2.3    Prior to 1985, the Bank had provided four loans to WAPDA  to develop the EHV and secondary
transmission networks. The Fifth WAPDA Power Project, which is the subject of this report, was the Bank's fifth
operation with WAPDA for which it provided a loan of US$ 100 million in 1985.
B. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
3.1    PrjQect Objectives. The primary objective of the project was to assist in the development of a 500-kV
network to ensure its economic expansion and operation. Institution-building efforts initiated under earlier Bank
operations were to be supported by strengthening WAPDA's capability to formulate and implement an investment
program to improve efficiency in electricity supply.
3.2    Project Description. The original project consisted of the following components:
(a) the installation of about 1,100 km of 500-kV transmission line between Lahore and Jamshoro via
Sahiwal, Multan, Guddu and Dadu;
(b) the installation of new 500-kV substations at Lahore and Sahiwal, and the extension and reinforcement
of existing 500-kV substations of Multan, Guddu, Dadu and Jamshoro; and



-2-
(c) studies for the collection, storage, and retrieval of data on the power system, for load research and
management, and for feasibility and detailed engineering for a power complex based on imported coal.
3.3    Poject Cost. Total project cost, including contingencies and custom duties (as originally planned), was
estimated at US$287.6 million; total financing required, including interest during construction, was US$300.9
million. Of this, US$156.8 million was expected to be in foreign exchange, while the remaining US$144.1 million
was to be in local currency. The Bank Loan of US$100 million was expected to cover about 64% of the foreign
exchange requirement. Local costs (US$144.1 million - Rs. 2204 million equivalent) were to be covered by
WAPDA and the Government of Pakistan (GOP). Cofinancing was sought from the French, Japanese and German
authorities who had expressed interest in the project.
3.4    Project Preparation. Design and engineering for the enhancement of the EHV network was carried out by
WAPDA with local and foreign consultants' assistance. The network was designed to withstand faults without
system separation, line overloading, cascade tripping and loss of load. Local consultants were also hired to prepare
detailed designs, specifications and bidding documents.
3.5    Procurement and Construction. Transmission line equipment (US$90 million) and the supply/erection of
equipment for the substations at Lahore and Sahiwal (US$48 million) were to be procured through International
Competitive Bidding, while construction of transmission lines (US$51 million) was to be carried out through Local
Competitive Bidding. For substations at Multan, Guddu, Dadu and Jamshoro (US$16.7 million), WAPDA proposed
to extend existing contracts with French and Japanese suppliers. The procurement schedule under the Loan
envisaged to start the bid invitations process by June 1985 with first bid opening in September, first award decision
by November and first contract signature in December 1985.
3.6    Evaluation of Objectives. Project objectives were clear, realistic, and consistent with the Bank's and GOP's
strategy for the power sector. However, the timetables for procurement and construction were not realistic in terms
of the time envisaged for WAPDA to carry out the required procurement actions, Bank review and approval,
delivery and installation of equipment, and the construction of transmission lines.
C. Achievement of Objectives
4.1    Sector policies. The project was approved shortly after the approval of the Energy Sector Loan (Loan
2552-PAK), which supported a comprehensive program of policy reforms to be implemented by GOP;
consequently, only the components of the sector reform program relating to the strengthening of WAPDA's
capabilities for formulating and implementing the least-cost investment program, and satisfactory financial and
operational performance by WAPDA, were retained under the project. WAPDA's operational and financial
performance during the past decade has been satisfactory, and it has achieved the financial performance targets
agreed under Bank Loans with the exception of its collection of government receivables which improved starting in
FY95 (paras 6.2-6.4). In addition, WAPDA has developed adequate capacity to formulate and implement the least-
cost expansion program for the sector (para 5.5). Therefore, the sectoral objectives were met substantially. No
macroeconomic policy reforms were agreed under the project.
5.     Physical Obiectives
5.1    Loan Effectiveness. The project was appraised in November/December 1984; negotiations were held
during April 15-18, 1985; and the project was approved by the Board on May 28, 1985. The Loan and Guarantee
Agreements were signed on July 19, 1985, and the Loan was declared effective on October 17, 1985.
5.2    Project Revision. The design of the project was modified based on WAPDA's revised load forecast and
investment programme, and updated load flow studies, as follows: (a) the Sahiwal 500-kV substation was deferred,
and a 500-kV substation constructed at Peshawar; (b) extension of 220-kV substations at Bund Road, Lahore and
Sahiwal were carried out; and (c) shunt reactors at Tarbela and a circuit breaker at Gatti were installed. While these



-3-
changes were based on detailed investigations and analysis, timely implementation of the project was affected, since
additional time was required to obtain the necessary approvals.
5.3     Project Start-up and Implementation Schedule. The implementation schedule, under which the project was
to be completed by June 1990, was affected by several factors including changes in project scope (para 5.2), as
indicated in the Key Lessons Learned paragraph of the Evaluation Summary. A revised schedule for construction of
transmission lines by October 1991, and substations by December 1993, was developed.
5.4     Psical Achievements. Table I summarizes physical achievements under the project. The Guddu-Multan
and Multan-Lahore lines were completed (as per the revised timetable) in 1990 and 1991 respectively. The
Jaishoro-Guddu line was completed in August 1995, about five years later than the revised schedule. The Lahore
500-kV substation and extension of 220-kV Bund Road substation were completed in October 1992 and January
1993 respectively and are in operation. Reactor banks were installed at the Tarbela 500-kV substation. The
extension of Multan. Guddu. Dadu and Jamshoro substations was also completed in 1990 and are in commercial
operation. While the length of transmission lines was the same as the appraisal estimate, the substation component
was 15-20% larger than envisaged. Table 5, Part II provides details of the work planned and completed, highlighting
both delays and under/over-achievements.

5.5     Evaluation.  Transmission capacity was a major objective of the project and was largely accomplished.
During periods of low hydel availability, WAPDA was able to meet electricity requirements in the central regions by
transmitting power from the south. The line has operated very closely to its designed capacity without major
tripping or breakdowns, indicating satisfactory operating performance. Although qualitative analysis on voltage
profile and system reliability was not available, selected data for the periods before and after the commissioning of
the lines and substations indicate that performance improved in both respects (see Table 6). The completion mission
proposed that in the future WAPDA should undertake formal reviews on a regular basis to monitor the performance
of the assets installed under the project.
5.6     The following is the status of the studies agreed under the Loan:
(a)     although no separate study was carried out for load research and demand management WAPDA
conducted a number of reviews of the load profile and Demand Side Management measures, e.g.,
a demand management study conducted by consultants in 1988. The National Power Plan
(completed in 1994 with financing from the Canadian Intemational Development Agency) also
included a comprehensive review of Demand Side Management prospects and identified potential
annual energy savings of up to 3200 GWh by the year 2000;
(b)     as regards the collection. storage and retrieval of power system data WAPDA instituted adequate
systems for the compilation and retrieval of input data for the WASP III model, which is used by
WAPDA to update its long-term generation expansion plans; and



-4-
(c)    the feasibility and detailed engineering study for the coal-based power complex near Karachi was
completed in 1991; the reports were reviewed by the Bank.
Table 7, Part II provides a summary of the studies described above, as well as three other studies which were
completed in fulfillment of the project Agreement.
5.7    Project Costs. The total cost of the project, as implemented, was about US$403.5 million - an increase of
34.1 % over appraisal estimates. The cost of the transmission line component rose to US$167.7 million (compared to
US$129.8 million); the cost of the substation component increased to US$161.1 million (versus US$65.4 million).
The latter is partly attributed to the larger scope of the substation component (para 5.4). Financing was provided by
the Bank, with additional financing provided by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF - Japan), the
Swiss and French Governments, Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW - Germany) and WAPDA. Part II, Tables 8A and B present a detailed breakdown of project
costs and the financing arrangements.
5.8    Extension of Closing Date. The Loan Account was to be closed on December 31, 1990. This date was
extended ftrst to December 31, 1991, and subsequently to December 31, 1992 and December 31, 1993, in response
to requests from the Borrower. While some activities relating to the Jamshoro-Guddu line, the 500-kV Peshawar and
220-kV Sahiwal substations were ongoing, the Bank Loan had been almost fully disbursed by end-1993. No further
extension in the Closing Date was therefore deemed necessary, and the Loan was closed on December 31, 1993.
5.9    Procurement. The procurement process was delayed with the first set of bidding documents issued almost
one year after the project was approved, and the sample bidding documents finalized only in FY87. This situation,
combined with WAPDA's internal contract processing, led to lengthy and cumbersome approval of the bidding
process and affected the timely implementation of the project. Contracts worth US$237 million for materials and
equipment, and US$79 million for works, were awarded (compared to appraisal estimates of US$160.7 million and
US$67 million respectively). Eleven contracts (valued at US$30.4 million) were awarded to local bidders. The
splitting of procurement into smaller packages increased the work for project staff; however, it promoted local
participation and contributed towards developing the local manufacturing industry. Part 11, Table 8C presents a
summary of the main contracts.
5.10    Disbursements. The disbursement schedule was seriously affected by substantial delays in project start-up.
As of June 1987, only US$36,000 was disbursed, against an envisaged amount of US$20 million. The major
disbursements were made during FYs 89-91, when the Lahore-Multan and Multan-Guddu transmission lines, and
500-kV Lahore substation were constructed.  Following the last disbursement in May 1994, a balance of
US$186,755 was cancelled (Table 4, Part II). WAPDA arranged its own finances (about US$15 million) for the
balance of the works.
5.11    Environmental Aspects. The environmental objectives of the project were limited. The Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) stated that a 500-kV transmission line is equal to five 220-kV transmission lines in terms of
transmission capacity; the right-of-way requirement is thus greatly reduced by upgrading the network to 500-kV,
resulting in reduced impact on the landscape. The project assisted in achieving this limited objective. Also,
conductor sizing was designed to ensure that there were no audible noises or interference with radio/television
signals. WAPDA's standards for the construction of 500-kV transmission lines require that the lines be located at a
reasonable distance from populated areas, and adequate clearances be provided over roads, railway lines, dwellings
or structures, where close proximity is unavoidable. These standards were met and contributed towards minimizing
the potential environmental impacts of the project. Under a subsequent operation (the Power Sector Development
project, Loan 3764-PAK, approved in 1994) the Bank is supporting a program to strengthen WAPDA's
environmental management capacity, which would, inter alia, assist WAPDA in further improving its capabilities for
the design, construction and operation of 500-kV transmission lines.
5.12    Overall, the physical objectives of the project have been fully met.
6.     Operational, Financial and Institutional Performance



-5-
6.1    The Lahore-Guddu transmission line has been operational since 1991, and was loaded to near its design
capacity in selected months of the year; tripping/losses data indicate that operating performance has been
satisfactory. Similarly, the substations have operated without major breakdowns or excessive losses, and transformer
loadings at these substations indicate satisfactory performance. Details of operational performance indicators for the
transmission line and substations are presented in Table 6, Part II.
Financial Performance
6.2    The WAPDA Act (1958), which govems WAPDA's financial affairs, requires the utility to operate on
commercial lines, cover operating costs, and achieve a reasonable return on investments. WAPDA has agreed with
the Bank on an Internal Cash Generation (ICG) covenant which requires it to generate annually from internal sources
at least 40% of its average capital expenditures. It must also maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.5 times.
WAPDA's annual tariffs are set to ensure that these two financial objectives are met. Table 9A, Part II presents
details of WAPDA's main financial indicators in recent years.
6.3    WAPDA's recent financial performance has been satisfactory. The ICG was at least 40% in all years except
FY94, when a high debt service requirement due to WAPDA's inability to rollover its second Bond Issue (Rs 5.6
billion) and lower hydro generation limited its self financing to 28%, while its debt service coverage ratio fell to 0.9
times. A tariff increase (24%) in November 1994 improved WAPDA's financial performance and enabled it to meet
the financial covenants during FY95. While WAPDA's debt:equity ratio has been satisfactory (57:43), WAPDA had
to resort to substantial short-term borrowings in recent years, in part due to high levels of receivables especially from
Government departments and agencies, and difficulties in mobilizing long-term finances.
6.4    WAPDA's overall accounts receivables have varied at around three months of sales. While private sector
collection performance has been steady at around two months, until recently Government receivables exceeded three
months' sales. As a result, WAPDA incurred cash-flow problems which had a negative impact on the timely
availability of counterpart funding for the project. Since November 1994, GOP and WAPDA have taken major steps
to improve the collection of Government receivables, including deduction at source from budgetary allocations and
withholding payments due by WAPDA to these agencies for adjustment against arrears. In June 1995, about Rs 3
billion were deducted from Government budget releases and adjusted against WAPDA's debt service to the
Government. This has enabled WAPDA to comply with agreements under Bank operations as of end-FY95.
Overall, financial performance is conisidered substantial.
Institutional Development
6.5    Management. Professional and Other Staff. WAPDA's professional staff is well qualified and competent,
particularly in operating and maintaining the 500-kV network. However, project-related expertise (e.g., in financing
arrangements, procurement and contract management) needed to be strengthened in order to reduce the delays that
were encountered during this project.
6.6    Training and Transfer of Technology. WAPDA has a comprehensive training program, with eleven
training establishments located in eight cities, which caters to the training needs of managerial, technical and
accounting staff.
6.7    Compliance with Loan Covenants. WAPDA successfully complied with the agreed covenants (Table 10,
Part II): the ICG level was in line with the agreed targets, while its debt service coverage ratio was also adequate
(except FY94 when the ratios fell to 28% and 0.9 times respectively). Its compliance with the accounts receivable
covenant was, however, unsatisfactory until FY95.



-6-
6.8    Evaluation. If the actual implementation experience of the project is taken as a yardstick, the performance
appears to be mixed. While WAPDA gained valuable experience in implementing 500-kV transmission projects, its
contract management and supervision skills could be further improved.
D. Major Factors Affecting the Project
7.1    Implementation delays were encountered both on transmission line and on some of the substation
components. The major factors identified are:
(a)    delays in the initiation of the procurement process and finalization of sample bidding documents;
(b)    the adverse law and order situation in Sindh affected the pace of work, particularly on the Guddu-
Jamshoro section;
(c)    the location of the Lahore 500-kV substation and route of the Lahore-Multan line were changed
due to heavy floods at the original site in 1988;
(d)    technical difficulties were encountered in some areas, which required engagement of specialized
contractors to construct pile foundations in the Indus bed, and convert some dry foundations to
pile foundations;
(e)    delays were experienced in finalizing additional financing arrangements. Local currency
constraints faced by WAPDA also hampered the progress of civil works, as well as the timely
receipt of imported material/equipment, as these remained in bonded warehouses for a long time;
and
(f)    changes in overall project design and in specific components (para 4.2) were introduced by
WAPDA after the project had been initiated.
E. Project Sustainability
8.1    Sustainability. The project was successful in enhancing WAPDA's network for transmitting power from
south to north in periods of fluctuating hydel availability, efficiently and with reduced losses, and in improving the
voltage profile. Because of the inherent advantages of EHV transmission, WAPDA is already implementing the
third circuit to carry power on the north-south axis. However, a number of steps must be taken by WAPDA to ensure
the sustainability of the facilities completed under this Loan (and other similar projects) in order to derive the full
benefits over the life of these assets. These actions are discussed in greater detail in paras 12.1-12.5 below and in the
Operational Plan agreed during the completion mission (Appendix A).
8.2    Economic Rate of Return (ERR). The SAR estimated a range of ERRs, from 5.9% (based on WAPDA's
actual average revenues in 1984) to 15.1%, assuming an increase of 12% per annum (in real terms) in average
revenues during FYs 86-90. The ex-post ERR was calculated by the completion mission. This ERR was derived for
the WAPDA system as a whole, since in the absence of a formal transmission tariff (or transfer prices for generation,
transmission and distribution) it is not possible to value the benefits attributable to transmission alone. Assumptions
used for the ERR are listed in Table 9, Part II. Based upon these assumptions which are equivalent to those leading
to a higher rate in the SAR of 15. 1%, the ERR is 10.4%. Such difference is mostly due to lower tariff increases that
projected during the period.



-7-
F. Bank Performance and Other Financiers
Bank Performance
9.1    Bank appraisal was based on WAPDA's plan for the expansion of the 500-kV network. The SAR also
identified specific activities that were essential to meet project objectives, and thus provided an overall framework
for undertaking this project. While initial preparation was sound, a number of technical issues (e.g., routings of the
lines and sites of substations) were not investigated in sufficient detail by consultants. The Bank relied on WAPDA
and the consultants' work while appraising the project, and should have insisted on better finalization of these
aspects prior to project approval. Overall, Bank performance during identification, preparation and appraisal is
considered satisfactory.
9.2    The Bank exercised fairly close control over physical implementation, costs and allocation of funds. Three
extensions in the Closing Date were agreed by the Bank to allow physical activities to be completed. It also allowed
WAPDA to use the Loan for civil works (which was not originally planned).
9.3    The Bank carried out eleven supervision missions with reasonable continuity in staff. The frequency of
missions was adequate (Table 13, Part 11). The missions reviewed critical aspects of the project and identified factors
impeding implementation, as well as remedial actions, for follow-up by WAPDA. However, it is felt that the
missions (due to their large agenda) had insufficient time to carry out detailed reviews and site visits, meet
implementation staff, and provide assistance to resolve implementation problems. The Bank's overall performance
during supervision is considered satisfactory.
Performance of Other Financim
9.4    A number of financiers provided funding for the project. Difficulties were encountered in finalizing the
funding arrangement with some of the financiers (paras 5.6, 7.l d, and 10.2).
G. Borrower Performance
10.1   Partly as a result of the project, WAPDA is now able to transmit power at full capacity on the north-south
axis with reduced losses and improvement in voltage profiles. WAPDA undertook the project with full commitment
for the obvious gains it had to offer; however, its performance suffered because of a number of controllable and
uncontrollable factors which resulted in implementation delays.
10.2    WAPDA's inability to finalize additional financing arrangements expeditiously, and its relative non-
familiarity with disbursement requirements of the financiers, led to delays in disbursements. Availability of local
currency was at times constrained, resulting in delays in payments. In its comments on the ICR, WAPDA attributed
the delays in disbursement to the lengthy disbursement procedures of the financiers. It also reported instances where
Bank disbursement procedures were cumbersome, e.g., the limit of US$20,000 below for which applications for
direct payment to suppliers or contractors are not processed by the Bank and the requirement (which according to
WAPDA was introduced by the Bank from 1993) that evidence of payment of WAPDA's share of invoices be
provided to the Bank before the Bank processed WAPDA's requests for payment from the Loan (Appendix B, pages
6-8, para 3).  While the Bank might have appeared to have changed its disbursement procedures during
implementation, the instances quoted by WAPDA relate mainly to the enforcement of Bank's official disbursement
guidelines, of which WAPDA should have been aware since they had been agreed with WAPDA during appraisal
and negotiations.
10.3    While WAPDA benefited from the professional experience gained through the project, there was scope for
improvement in WAPDA's management skills, specifically in: (a) managing financial arrangements; (b) meeting
local currency requirements, and contingency planning; and (c) maintaining greater control over contractors and
suppliers to ensure compliance with contractual obligations. Overall, the performance of WAPDA in all phases of
the project is considered satisfactory.



-8-
H. Assessment of Outcome
11.1    The following are the major achievements of the project: (a) enhancement of an efficient transmission
system for conveying power from hydel generation facilities in the north and thermal facilities in the south to major
consumption centers; (b) reduction in transmission losses; and (c) improvements in voltage stability and the power
factor (para 5.5). In addition, WAPDA's institutional capacity for the expansion of the bulk transmission network
was enhanced. Substantial delays were encountered in project implementation due to reasons described earlier.
Because of such delays, especially the five-year delay in the completion of Jamshoro-Guddu link, full advantage in
terms of north-south power transmission was not achieved in a timely manner. Overall, the project met its
objectives, and implementation is considered satisfactory.
1. Future Operation
12.    Operational Plan
12.1   In order to sustain the benefits of the EHV network, an operational plan covering technical, financial and
institutional aspects was agreed. This plan identifies staffing and resource requirements, defines performance
indicators, and lists the understanding reached with WAPDA on follow-up actions.
12.2   Technical Aspects.  WAPDA should carry out performance tests, and monitor and analyze system
operating performance immediately before and after commissioning of transmission lines or grid stations. Systems
for collecting and analyzing operating data should be reviewed and strengthened, and the information generated
should be reviewed by senior WAPDA management at regular intervals.
12.3   Financial Aspects. There is a need to ensure timely budget allocations for operations and maintenance
requirements of the network, so that financial constraints do not impede the required maintenance activities. Also,
WAPDA needs to generate adequate resources for funding expansions of the network.
12.4   Institutional Aspects. WAPDA acquired valuable experience in undertaking EHV projects, which could be
institutionalized by creating a project group under the Managing Director (Transmission and Grid). This group
should continuously monitor progress of ongoing projects, and liaise with other WAPDA departments.
12.5   Performance Indicators. A formal program for monitoring the performance of transmission lines and
substations, and the 500-kV network, must be put in place. Selected performance indicators were discussed by the
completion mission with WAPDA and are listed in the Operational Plan (Appendix A). These indicators should be
reviewed by General Managers/Chief Engineers every month, the Managing Director every quarter, and Member
(Power) every six months; decisions on corrective actions should be taken and implemented during the following
periods.
12.6   Follow-up by the Bank. The Bank under follow-up operations should review progress on selected
technical, financial and institutional aspects. These include: (a) instituting a regular monitoring system; (b)
establishing a project group to evaluate progress on ongoing projects; (c) facilitating studies on transient over-
voltages underswitching operations/line outages; and (d) ensuring adequate and timely budget allocations for
operations and maintenance.
J. Key Lessons Learned
13.1    Qualiy at Entry. Most of the technical issues should be investigated during project preparation. Sample
bidding documents should be provided and the procurement process initiated prior to loan approval.



-9-
13.2    Major Changes in Project Scope. Changes in the scope of the project were introduced by WAPDA once the
project got underway. While the changes introduced were technically sound, timely implementation of the project
was affected since additional time was required to obtain the necessary approvals. Also, changes in scope that are
introduced during implementation make it difficult to evaluate project outcomes relative to appraisal targets.
13.3   Financing and Local Funds. WAPDA should pay closer attention to the timely finalization of financing
arrangements, ensure adequate counterpart funds, and maintain stricter controls over its suppliers and contractors. In
addition, WAPDA should improve its cash-flow management to enable it to pay its suppliers and contractors in a
timely manner.
13.4   Supervision by WAPDA. WAPDA should strengthen the supervision systems of its ongoing projects to get
timely feedback for taking remedial actions. In order to avoid delays and cost overruns, procurement procedures and
actions need to be expedited, and all ongoing projects must be reviewed in sufficient detail, at least each quarter, by
senior WAPDA management.

Note:
1. The ERR has been calculated for the WAPDA system as a whole; in the absence of explicit tariffs for transmission segments, or transfer
prices between generation-transmission, and transmission-distribution, it is not possible to isolate the benefits attributable to the
transmission system from those attributable to the power system as a whole.
2. All cost and revenue streams are expressed in constant 1994 Rs, using appropriate inflator/deflator; benefits are calculated on the basis
of existing (1994) power tariffs (i.e. other benefits, including consumers willingness to pay for electricity, have not been quantified).
3. WAPDA's capital costs are actual investments made during the period FYa6-94
4. Assecs created through the above investments are assumed to have an economic life of 20 years
S. Standard Conversion Factor for converting financial costs to economic investments is assumed at 0.85
6. 0 & M costs include fuel costs, maintenance expenses, wages, and other operation and administration expenses and are based on WAPDA's actual
costs for these components during FY86-94; incremental 06M is calculated by subtraccing the base year OEM cost
7. Energy generated, sales and TaD losses are actuals for FY86-94; progressive reduction of TiD losses in future years is assumed
3. Reduction in transmission losses from 22.84% to 18% over the next five years is assumed
9. Revenues generated by WAPDA during FY96-94 are as per actuals beyond FY94; assumed to increase up to FY99 due to reduction in T&D losses

Fifth WAPDA Power Prolect
(Loan 2556-PAX)
Implementation Completion Report
Aide Memoire
1.    A World Bank mission comprising Messrs Rashid Aziz (Bank Staff) and Waqar
Haider (Consultant) visited WAPDA from November 27 to December 15, 1994, to
prepare the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Fifth WAPDA Power
Project (Loan 2556-PAK) . The Bank loan for this project was closed on December
31, 1993. This aide memoire presents the mission's findings and recommendations,
which would be confirmed through a post mission letter from the Bank's
management. The members of the mission would like to record their appreciation
for the courtesies and cooperation extended by WAPDA during the mission.
A. Project appraisal
2.    Project Obiectives.  The primary objective of the Project was to focus on
the development of 500-kV transmission network to ensure its economic expansion
and operation.   The project was also envisaged to contribute towards the
institution-building efforts by strengthening WAPDA's capabilities in formulating
and implementing an investment program for improving energy efficiency, and
thereby rationalizing the consumption of primary energy, and production and
delivery of secondary energy.
3.    Proiect Description.  The Project consisted of the following components:
a.    installation of about 1,100 km of 500-kV transmission line between
Lahore and Jamshoro via Sahiwal, Multan, Guddu and Dadu;
b.    installation of new 500-kV substations at Lahore and Sahiwal, and
the extension and reinforcement of the existing 500-kV substations
of Multan, Guddu, Dadu and Jamshoro, with associated 500/220-kV
transformers and 220-kV facilities, including compensation equipment
to maintain adequate voltage profile along the line and improve the
power factor; and
c.    consulting services for the collection, storage, and retrieval of
data on the power system, a load research and management study, and
a feasibility study and detailed engineering for a power station
complex based mainly on imported coal to be located in the vicinity
of Karachi.
The Project was appraised in November/December 1984; negotiated during April 15-
18, 1985; and approved by the Bank's Board on June 28, 1985.   The Loan and
Guarantee Agreements were signed on July 19, 1985, and the Loan was declared
effective on October 17, 1985. The (original) Closing Date for the Bank Loan was
June 30, 1990.
4.    Project cost and financinc.  The Project cost, including price and physical
contingencies and custom duties, was estimated at about US$ 287.6 million. The
total financing required, including interest during construction of US$ 13.3

Appendix A
Page 2 of 7
million, was US$ 300.9 million, of which US$ 156.8 million was in foreign
exchange.   These cost estimates were based on quotations for similar ongoing
works updated to reflect December 1984 prices, and included (a) physical
contingency of 5% of base costs on equipment,  material  and services,  (b)
escalation of foreign exchange costs between 6.25-8.00 % per annum, and (c)
escalation of local costs between 6.0-6.5* during the implementation period of
the project. The Bank Loan of US$ 100 million was expected to cover about 64%
of the foreign exchange requirement; the balance foreign exchange requirement was
envisaged to be covered through co-financing from other bilateral/multilateral
sources (France, Japan and Federal Republic of Germany).  Local costs of US$
144.1 million (Rs. 2204 million) were expected to be entirely met by WAPDA/GOP
through its own resources; additionally, the risk of cost overruns and foreign
exchange fluctuation was to be assumed by WAPDA and GOP respectively.
5.    Proiect preparation.  The design and engineering of the 500-kV grid, which
included around 2,900 km of transmission lines and six substations, were prepared
by WAPDA, with the assistance of local (NESPAK) and foreign consultants. The 500
kV network has been designed to withstand faults without system separation, line
overloading, cascade tripping and loss of load.  In order to ensure adequate
design for the 500-kV network, specific studies were conducted in the following
areas: (a) load flows for normal and emergency conditions, and in typical cases
of generation during low and high water seasons;  (b)  short circuits;  (c)
transient and steady-state stability;  (d) switching surges and dynamic over-
voltages; (e) reactive power management for improvement of system power factor;
(f) mechanical and electrical design for the conductor selection, tower structure
and substation layout; and (g) control, metering and relaying scheme in
association with telecommunication requirements and integration into the System
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network. The experience gained by WAPDA and
NESPAK through the above involvement enabled them to prepare the project design,
based upon standardized criteria for equipment and materials. NESPAX was hired
as consultants for the preparation of detailed design, specification and bidding
documents, and construction supervision for specific components of the Project.
6.    Implementation arrangements.  The Project was planned to be implemented by
undertaking work concurrently on the transmission lines and substation
components. Similarly, WAPDA planned to hire consulting services to (a) assist
in the preparation of a study for the collection, storage and retrieval of data
in the power system (in keeping with the WASP III Model requirements);  (b)
preparation of a load research and management study; and (c) carrying out a
feasibility study and detailed engineering for a power station complex based
mainly on imported coal near Karachi.   The Project was primarily handled by
WAPDA's Chief Engineer EHV North; however, because of the nature of the
activities, construction of transmission lines and substation components in the
south were implemented by Chief Engineer EHV South, and the studies were handled
by General Manager Planning (Power) in WAPDA, except for the feasibility study
for thermal power complex at Karachi, which was handled by General Manager (D&D).
B.   Proiect implementation experience
7.    Project  revision.    While  undertaking  the  project,  the  design  and
implementation  schedule  was modified  as  follows:  (a)  the planned  500  kV
substation at Sahiwal was deferred, and a new 500 kV substation was constructed
at Peshawar; (b) work on the 220 kV substation on Bund Road (Lahore), and 220 kV
substation at Sahiwal was undertaken as part of this project; and (c)

Page 3 of 7
installation of an additional bank of shunt reactors at Tarbela (3x37 MVAR), and
a circuit-breaker at Gatti was also completed under this project.   These
revisions were undertaken following WAPDA's revised load forecast, and generation
and transmission programme, and load flow analysis carried out by the consultants
(NESPAK)  in  May  1992.    Firstly,  these  studies  indicated  the  need  for
strengthening the existing Bund Road (Lahore) substation, in order to transmit
power from the South (Multan) and North (Tarbela) to Lahore and its suburbs.
Also, Lahore and Tarbela 500 kV substations were interconnected through a
separate line; while the 500 kV bay at Tarbela was constructed under ADB funding,
the shunt reactor on the line was constructed under this project. Further, it
was shown that the Sahiwal 500 kV substation could be deferred until early 1996
due to non-availability of additional transmission capacity via Multan-Vehari-
Sahiwal-Bhaipheru-Kot Lakhpat double circuit line before end FY1993. Also, WAPDA
subsequently planned a 600 MW Combined Cycle Power plant at Sahiwal, and the 500
kV substation was envisaged to be included in that project.
8.    Project results.  Two sections of the 500 kV transmission line (Second
circuit) from Multan-Guddu and Lahore-Multan were completed and energized on 500
kv in 1991 and 1992, respectively. The Guddu-Jamshoro section is currently under
implementation; foundation work is complete, and transmission towers are being
erected, and stringing is also underway. Jamshoro-Dadu section of this line has
already been energized, and the remaining portion is expected to be commissioned
by mid-1995. The construction of Lahore 500 kV substation and the extension of
220 kV Bund Road (Lahore) substation have been completed, and these are in
operation. Reactor banks have been installed at Tarbela 500 kV substation, which
is also operative. Extension of Multan, Guddu. Dadu and Jamshoro substations has
also been completed in 1990,  and these are in commercial operation.   The
following activities now remain under the scope of this project: (a) completion
of 500 kV Guddu-Dadu transmission line; (b) extension of 220 kV substation at
Sahiwal; and (c) installation of 500 kV substation equipment (originally meant
for Sahiwal) at Peshawar.
9.    The Project provided for studies for (a) the collection,  storage and
retrieval of data on the power system; (b) load research and management; and (c)
the feasibility and detailed engineering for a power station complex based mainly
on imported coal to be located in the vicinity of Karachi.
a.    The Load research and demand management study was expected to
provide a better understanding of the pattern of electricity
consumption by sector and time of day, to allow WAPDA to design a
tariff structure that would provide incentives to consumers to shift
non-essential consumption to off-peak periods.   While a specific
study was not carried out under the project, WAPDA has carried out
a number of reviews of the load profile and Demand Side Management
(DSM) measures that could be implemented, in order to curtail peak
demand for electricity. For example, a demand management study was
conducted by EDF (France) in 1988, the National Power Plan (NPP)
completed in April 1994 with CIDA financing, and a comprehensive
review of DSM prospects was carried out, which has identified true
potential for annual energy savings of upto 3200 GWh by the year
2000, representing a reduction in peak demand of 965 MW.
b.    The study for the collection. storage and retrieval of data on the
power system was designed to enhance WAPDA's capacity for regularly

updating its long term generation expansion program through the WASP
III computer model, installed at WAPDA under the Fourth WAPDA Power
Project (Loan 2499-PAK) . WAPDA has been successfully operating the
WASP III model for updating its generation expansion plans, and has
instituted adequate systems for the compilation and retrieval of
data which is required as inputs for the WASP III model.
c.    The feasibilitv and detailed engineering study for the coal based
power complex near Karachi was completed in 1991 by consultants
(Shawinigan Integ from Canada) and the reports reviewed by the Bank.
More recently, interest has been shown by private foreign investors
in installing thermal generation facilities based on indigenous and
imported coal in Pakistan, in response to the Government's 1994
Policy for attracting private investment in power generation.
10.   Table 5 of Part I1 provides details of the work planned and accomplished
on the project, both in terms of schedules and physical achievements,
highlighting implementation delays (if any) and under/over achievements.
11.   Reasons for delays.  Implementation delays have taken place on the project,
both on transmission line and substation components. Some of the major factors
identified by WAPDA are as follows: (a) Guddu-Jamshoro and Guddu-Rajanpur 500 kV
transmission line has been affected by poor law and order situation in the
region. Work was commenced almost six months after the signing of the contract;
there are severe restraints on the working hours affecting overall progress;
Chinese engineers on the project were kidnapped in May 1991, resulting in
suspension of work for four months. The route for this section of the line was
also changed; (b) the cofinancing arrangements, especially for KFW loan, took
a long time affecting the overall schedule of the project; negotiations with the
cofinanciers, the World Bank and WAPDA/GOP were prolonged due to procedural
matters, and because of lack of experience on the part of the client in
assembling a financial package of this kind. Similarly, the approval procedures
for variation orders have also been time-consuming; (c) Multan-Lahore 500 kV
transmission line was to be originally terminated at Burj Attari (near
Sharaqpur); however, this site was adversely affected by the high floods of 1988,
and the site had to be changed to Muradey Kalan  (near Sheikhupura) .  This
necessitated the re-routing of Lahore-Multan transmission line, and the
relocation of Lahore 500 kV substation, causing a delay of about one year; (d)
tower 577 on Multan-Guddu transmission line was required to be constructed in the
Indus river-bed due to change of its course. Due to high flood levels, these
could not be constructed in time, and specialist contractors for pile foundations
had to be arranged. Also, due to weak soil strata on the route of this line,
most of the dry foundations were converted to wet locations, and pile foundation
was laid; and (e) there have been local currency constraints faced by WAPDA/GOP,
hampering the progress of civil contractors. The slow progress on civil works
in turn affected the overall progress on the project. Also, the local currency
constraints affected the receipt of imported material and equipment (because of
the non-payment of duties and taxes), which remained in bonded warehouses for a
long time.
12.   Prolect  Costs  and  Financing.    The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  as
implemented, is about US$ 403.5 million; this indicates an increase of 34.1%
relative to the appraisal estimate. However, this increase must be viewed in the
context of changes in the original scope of the project, specifically, the



- 32 -
APPxix A
Page 5 of 7
additional equipment and works at Tarbela, Gatti, Lahore 220 kV (Bund Road) and
Sahiwal 220 kV substations, and the changes in the foreign exchange rate during
the implentation period. The above cost included an increase in the transmission
line component (US$ 167.7 million versus the appraisal estimate of US$ 129.8
million) while the cost of the substation component is also higher than estimated
(US$ 161.1 million versus US$ 65.4 million) . The total cost of the project was
covered through IBRD, OECF, Swiss Credit, CIDA Grant, KFW Loan and WAPDA/GOP
funds. Part II, Table 8 presents a detailed breakdown of Project costs and the
financing plan.
13.   In line with current practices, WAPDA did not report in its final accounts,
expenditures on this project separately from expenditures on the overall
transmission investment program. For a utility the size of WAPDA (with about 400
accounting units), it is not unexpected that the final accounts would report
project-related expenditures only in a consolidated manner. Nevertheless, this
practice makes it very difficult to compile project-wise expenditures at any
given time; consequently, at the time of preparation of this ICR, project
accounts and expenditures had to be compiled item by item from WAPDA's detailed
records. This shortcoming is expected to be removed in the near future, with the
completion of the work on automation of accounting and financial information
systems at WAPDA Headquarters.
14.   Disbursements.  The actual IBRD disbursements on the project upto end-May
1994 is US$ 99.8 million (Part II, Table 4). Following the last disbursement
under the Bank Loan in May 1994, the balance of US$ 186,755 was cancelled. WAPDA
is arranging its own finances for the balance work. It is estimated that there
would be additional requirement of US$ 14.991 million to complete the remaining
activities.
15.   Compliance with covenants.  The major covenants agreed under the Project
relate to the financial performance of WAPDA; in particular, WAPDA had agreed
to finance 40W of its average capital investment program through internal cash
generation. In addition, WAPDA has agreed not to incur additional debt unless
its net revenues are at least equal to 1.5 times its debt service requirements.
During the period of implementation of this Project WAPDA has successfully
complied with these covenants - the level of internal cash generation has been
in line with the agreed targets, while its debt service coverage ratio has also
been adequate (with the exception of FY94 when the ratio fell to 1.4 times).
16.   Operational Plan.  The mission also discussed with WAPDA a Plan for the
operation of the transmission lines and substations installed under the Project,
with a view towards sustaining the benefits of the Project for the expected life
of these assets.   The operational plan covers, inter alia, the institutional
arrangements required for effective operation of these assets, indicators or
targets that could be used for measuring the performance of the transmission
lines and substations, the resources (technical and financial) which WAPDA would
need to allocate annually towards the operation and maintenance of these assets,
and indicative timetables for monitoring by both WAPDA and the Bank the continued
achievement of the performance indicators. A draft of the Operational Plan that
was discussed with WAPDA is attached as Annexure 1.
17.   Client evaluation.  As per the Bank guidelines, WAPDA would submit its own
evaluation of the project which would be appended to the ICR. It has been agreed



- 33 -
Page 6 of 7
that it would submit its formal evaluation by March 31, 1995.
C. Conclusions
18.   While significant delays were experienced in the implementation of the
Project, and the Closing Date was extended by four years, the overall outcome of
the Project has been satisfactory. Because of the commissioning of different
sections of the transmission lines and the substations in a phased manner, the
partial benefits are already being derived. The additional transmission capacity
has enabled WAPDA to transmit power from south to north during periods of low
hydel availability.   The project has also contributed to the improvement in
voltage profile and power factor in areas served by the substations, and provided
transient stability in the WAPDA system.
19.   In order to sustain the benefits of the Project over the life of the
assets, WAPDA needs to:
a.    ensure that the operation and maintenance requirements (technical,
financial and personnel) are adequately catered for in the annual
budgets;
b.    institute more rigorous and timely mechanisms for determining the
performance indicators, monitoring and efficiency tests for the
transmission lines and substations, including periodic review by
WAPDA management;
c.    identify and develop project proposals for strengthening other
segments of the transmission network for overall system stability,
which would otherwise impinge upon the operational performance of
Lahore-Guddu Second circuit; and
d.    endeavour to enhance on a continuous basis the capability of its
operating staff and managers through training and exposure to modern
techniques, for which resources must be identified and allocated as
part of the annual budgets.
e.    in view of the improvement in availability of financial (cost and
expenditure) information that it is likely to generate, the
completion of the automation of financial and accounting systems at
WAPDA Headquarters should be accorded a high priority.

1.   BORROWER'S ASSESSMENT
(a)    Pro-ect Obiectives
Development and Control of Power System in Pakistan
except for the power network of Karachi and its
environs is the responsibility of Pakistan Water
and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). Prior to
the start of Jamshoro-Lahore 500 KV Transmission
Line Project, the installed generation capacity of
WAPDA Power System was 4924 MW out of which 2897 MW
was hydel and 2027 MWJ thermal.
A brief review of Pakistan Power System reveals
that almost all of the existing and planned hydro-
electric generation  is located  in north whereas
most  of  the  thermal  generation  (existing  and
planned) is in the southern and central parts of
the country. According to the generation expansion
program of WAPDA, 1050 MW of thermal generation was
to be added to the existing generation by 1988,
while by the year 1992 WAPDA had plans to increase
its generation capacity to 9044 MW out of which
thermal contribution would be 4851 MW.
Higher load growth rate, seasonal variations in the
stream flows coupled with irrigation requirements
over the past few years have clearly manifested the
need to supplement the hydro-electric generation by
thermal   generation.   The   location   of   hydel
generation in the northern and thermal generation
in the southern and central areas of Pakistan have
necessitated a strong and reliable transmission
network to interconnect the power plants and major
load centers.
The  first stage of  interconnection  program com-
prised a 500 KV transmission system from Tarbela to
Jamshoro covering a stretch of 1350 km which was
connected to the KESC system through a double
circuit 220 KV line completed in December 1984.



- 38 -
AppeniUx B
Page 4 of 12
In order to increase the transmission capability
and to improve the reliability of supply between
south and north region another 500 KV transmission
networkc was planned between Tarbela and Jamshoro.
The induction of this line was necessary because
during low water months when the hydel generation
reduces drastically because of reduction in irriga-
tion releases or low head in the reservoirs, all
thermal generating stations are required to operate
on their maximum to meet the power requirements of
major load centers located in the central regions
of the country. In this second stage of intercon-
nection programme comprising  the second Tarbela-
Faisalabad 500 KV Transmission Line Project was
completed in August 1985 to cater for generation of
Tarbela units 9 and 10 rated at 175 MW.
Further studies necessitated construction of 500 KV
Transmission circuits from Tarbela to Lahore and
another 500 KV Transmission Line from Jamshoro to
Lahore along with the associated substations in
Lahore and extensions in Multan, Guddu, Dadu and
Jamshoro.
(b)    Design
Both transmission line and substation were designed
for optimal conditions and by adopting Internation-
ally recognized parameters and standards, which
were further substantiated by carrying out various
engineering studies such as , conductor and span
optimization, load flows and system studies, con-
tamination studies and communication and scada
interfacing. For transmission lines previous design
criteria was analyzed and power design was modified
to suit the requirements. Conductor bundle configu-
ration was changed from three bundle to. four bundle
configuration to cater for expected load flows and
to improve corona performance.



39-
Aprdix B
Page 5 of 12
Transmission line route selection was optimized not
only to ensure cost effective lengths but in order
to ensure that the line design has minimum environ-
mental impact, electrical parameters and clearances
selected were according to internationally accepted
standards due to which there is no unacceptable
threat of shock to human or other animal life.
Proper size of conductor and bundle configuration
selected ensures no problem of audible noise and
corona  discharges.  Because  of  improved  corona
performance, no ozone concentration is expected.
The routing of third stage of Project i.e Jamshoro-
Guddu had to be modified during the construction
phase in order to obtain greater separation (ap-
proximately 4 km) between the existing and the new
line. This was necessitated to mitigate damage to
the line due to local change in weather conditions
(towers of lst Multan-Guddu Transmission Line
collapsed in April 1992 due to localized effect of
wind storm).
For substation design, all prevalent design prac-
tices were reviewed and adopted ensuring compati-
bility with existing WAPDA system. Substation
layout, equipment ratings and characteristics were
confirmed through various engineering studies and
review.  Static   var   compensation   studies were
carried out to determine the requirements of var
compensation. Various layout schemes were reviewed
for    selection    and  implementation  of  optimal
substation layout and maximum reliability through
which breaker and-a-half scheme was adopted. It was
also ensured that provisions for future fbreseeable
expansion existed in each layout. Studies were also
carried out to determine the tertiary schemes of
the auto-transformer.

(c)    Implementation
The following arrangements were made to affectively
implement the project:
(i)     WAPDA appointed a Project Director to
oversee the implementation of the Project
on behalf of Authority.
(ii)    WAPDA engaged NESPAK as Consultants to
carry out necessary engineering and
construction supervision.
(iii)   Total project was divided in various
components for independent planning and
execution.-
(iv)    Various contract packages were prepared for
the procurement of materials and works
through International competitive bidding.
These packages were prepared according to
IBRD guidelines.
(v)     In order to effectively monitor the Project
CPM netwiorks were developed and progress
was continuously reviewed by WAPDA and the
Consultants in order to determine the
bottlenecks and take corrective measures.
(vi)    WAPDA also engaged M/s. Fichtner for
providing Consultancy Services alongwith
NESPAK for the substation coinponents of the
Project.
(vii)   WAPODA  sobilized all requisite resources in
shape of manpower, funds and equipment for
completion of the Project in a sound and
efficient manner.
(viii) A system of regular reporting was
established at all levels of project
management.
(d)  Qperation Experience.
WAPDA has a strong and efficient team of Engineers
and Technicians to operate and maintain Transmis-
sion Lines and Sub-Stations. The organization to
perform these jobs is known as Grid System Opera-
tion (GSO) which is headed by! a General Manager.
Operation and maintenance activities are being
supervised by the Four Regional Chief Engineers
stationed at Islamabad, Lahore, Multan and Hydera-
bad. WAPDA has also trained its crews for hot line

Originally route of the Second 500 KV Multan-Guddu
and Guddu-Jamshoro Transmission Line was selected
in parallel and in vicinity of the already existing
500 KV Transmission Line. During April 1992, due to
a local cyclone both the Transmission Lines col-
lapsed near Guddu. As such, it was decided by WAPDA
to modify the route of Guddu-Jamshoro Transmission
Line to obtain an approximate separation of 4 K.M.
between the existing and the new line. Now it has
been standardized that the separation between  two
500 KV Transmission Lines should not be less than
4 K.M.
500 KV Circuit Breakers with two series breaks were
installed on Reactors at 500/220KV Sub-Station at
Dadu and Jamshoro. High Voltage Bushings of Nine
Reactor Units had developed fault and were damaged.
The studies conducted so far have indicated that
potential reason for the damage of the bushings
might be the 500 KV circuit breakers installed on
these Rectors. Therefore, WAPDA has decided not be
procure any 500 KV Circuit Breaker with two series
Breaks.
To ensure maximum availability of 500 KV Transmis-
sion Lines WAPDA has trained its crews for hot line
maintenance as well. Design of the Window of the
Transmission Lines towers has been reviewed to meet
the requirements of hot line maintenance. As such,
the design of tower, for this Transmission Line i.s
suitable for hot line maintenance.
2.    EVALUATION OF BORROWER'S OWN PERFORMANCE.
WAPDA has generally performed all obligations required
for  completion  of  the  Project.  Efforts  were  made  to
mobilize adequate human and financial resources diligent-
ly and efficiently to achieve the targets. However,
various   factors   created serious constraints  on  the
completion of  work both for transmission line and sub-
station. Some of the major reasons causing delay was as
under:-



- 42 -
Appendix B
Page B of 12
(i)   The proposed site for Lahor-e substation was
adversely affected by unusual high floods in River
Ravi in 1988. Consequently the site had to be
shifted to Muradey Kalan near Sheikhupura. This
affected the schedule for substations and also.
resulted in re-routing of Multan-Lahore 500 KV
Transmission Line.
(ii)  Adverse law and order situation in certain areas
has adversely affected the construction of Jamshoro
Guddu section of Transmission Line.
(iii) Unprecedented rains and floods particularly in
1988, 1992 and 1994 resulted in delay in work-
(iv)  Shortage of local currency component led'to
in bonding of various line material. Exbonding of
this material resulted in delays in delivery of
material at site.
(v)   Procedural delays in establishment of Letter of
Credit and Import Licenses.
(vi) Civil construction award for Lahore substation was
also affected due to delay of approval from IBRD.
3.    EVALUATION OF BANK PERFORMANCE (AND CO-FINANCIERS).
To meet with the scarcity of funds a loan No:2556-PAK
amounting to US.$ 100 million was obtained from IBRD to
finance Lahore-Jamshoro Transmission Line and various
projects of Sub-Stations. The procedure of withdrawal of
fund was through submission of withdrawal application for
each and every job done, to the World Bank, which direct-
ly transferred the amounts into the Bank accounts of the
respective contractors/suppliers. The mode of payment by
withdrawal applications was 100% of invoice in case of
supplier's contract and 80% of invoice in case of con-
struction contracts. The loan was regulated by  certain
general conditions of the agreement, which were supposed
to contribute in achieving an efficient administrative
and financial practices on the part of WAPDA and in
making timely payments against withdrawal applications on
the part of the Bank to achieve above objective. This was
because of the consideration that the  timely payment to
the contractor is,a sin qua non for the timely c6mpletion
of the project       assuming that all other factors are
favorable.

Evaluating Bank's performance in this background, WAPDA.
experienced   some   bitter   and  harsh measures which
definitely created difficulties for the project authori-
ties because due to these measures the supposed smooth
cash flow was disturbed. In this regard the major draw-
back was the condition that any invoice less than $
20,000 would not be sent to World Bank for payment. This
condition imposed right from the commencement of the loan
delayed inordinately the payments of the Contractor to
their financial hardship. Because WAPDA was already short
of funds paying these invoices was not possible, there-
fore these invoices were kept pending until other in-
voices of the same contractors were received and sent to
IBRD for payment. This process usually took months.
As per loan agreement WAPDA fulfilled all requirement of
providing all supporting documents as an evidence for the
payment alongwith Withdrawal application sent to IBRD;
besides all other changes occurring in contracts were
immediately notified to IBRD before payment against these
changes was asked for.
But, unfortunately, WAPDA was subjected to comply certain
conditions imposed by the Bank, which in our opinion put
question mark before integrity of WAPDA as a reputable
national organization of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Though such harsh conditions were met, but with heavy
heart as well as for the good of the country. During the
year 1993 when the loan was about to expire, the Bank all
of   a sudden and strangely  enough,  started  demanding
evidence of payment of 20% WAPDA 'share and made the
provision of such evidence mandatory for releasing pay-
ment of each and every Withdrawal application submitted
to it. It was perhaps assumed that WAPDA was not paying
its share of financing and was getting the entire amount
from IBRD. This environ of doubt was very embarrassing
for WAPDA. Not only   this   but  such practice was also
exercised in supplier's contracts where the Bank had to
pay 100% of the invoice . Many of our withdrawal applica-
tions  were returned without making payment for  want  of



-44-

evidence of payment of 20% WAPDA share.  The Bank was
pursuaded to drop this condition but all in vain. Such a
un-necessary and unjLlstified condition at the end of the
loan, caused inordinal;.e delay both in finalizing the work
and the loan. As per usual practice the invoices received
in our office were processed for both shares (80% + 20%)
and sent for paytnent to IBRO as well as to our accounts
department. Keeping these 80% of invoice pending until
the clearance of 20% bill was rather unjustified act on
our part, hence we had to face a lot of difficulty in
persuading  the contractors to accept this new arrange-
ment.
Apart from above harsh and difficult conditions,  Bank's
performance in other areas, that is, timely disbursements
against invoices sent to it etc., was quite satisfactory.

Partial completion of the Project has increased the
Transmission Line capability of WAPDA System. The project
will improve the reliability of supply between South and
North regions. During the low water months when the hydel
generation reduces drastically all the thermal stations
are required to operate at maximum to meet the power
requirements of major load centers located in the central
region of the country.    500 KV  Transmission Lines are
needed to transmit the bulk of power from South to Cen-
tral region during low water months and from North to
South region during high water months.
The  facilities  insta]led under  the  project  are  being
operated and maintained by experienced and trained crews
of Grid System Operation Organization is headed by a
General Manager   with   four   regional Chief Engineers.
Engineers and Technicians responsible for operation and
maintenance of the project have been trained locally as
well as abroad.
The load forecasts are conducted by power market survey
divisions of WnPDA's Planning department. The potential
demands are estimated on the basis of detailed survey of
the area carried out by WAPDA. The load forecasts are
based on actual door to door survey of prospective con-
sumers. The information regarding public tubewells is
obtained from WAPDA 's SCRAP Directorate. The provincial
Planning  and  Development  department  are  contacted  to
elicit  information  regarding  their  developm ent  pro-
grammes. These loads are being adjusted for the future
years.

Load   flow   studies   are being conducted regularly by
General Manager (Planning) Power to assess and envisage
the pririiary transmission system required for the disper-
sal of added generation in the country for the future
years. On the basis of load flow studies future projects
in Transmission Line and Sub-Station etc. are identified.
Four engineers under this project, have received training
for  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  Sub-Station  in
Germany.  Training was also imparted by M/s Siemens of
Germany for the operation and maintenance of fault and
event recorder   installed at 500 /220 KV Sub-Station,
Lahore in Pakistan. OFFicers from WAPDA's finance depart-
ment were also sent abroad for the managerial and finan-
cial training under this project. As such, the implemen-
tation   of the project has strengthened WAPDA institu-
tional capability.
