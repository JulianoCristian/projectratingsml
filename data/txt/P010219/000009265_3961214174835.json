The project achieved\n            its objectives, its impact on institutional development has\n            been substantial, sustainability is likely, and both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, most of the\n            technical issues should be investigated during project\n            preparation. Also, sample bidding documents should be\n            provided and the procurement process initiated prior to loan\n            approval. Second, changes in the scope of the project were\n            introduced by WAPDA once the project got underway. While the\n            changes introduced were technically sound, timely\n            implementation of the project was affected since additional\n            time was required to obtain the necessary approvals. Also,\n            changes can make it difficult to evaluate project outcomes\n            relative to appraisal targets. Third, WAPDA should pay\n            closer attention to the timely finalization of financing\n            arrangements, ensure adequate counterpart funds, and\n            maintain stricter controls over its suppliers and\n            contractors. Finally, WAPDA should strengthen the\n            supervision systems of its ongoing projects to get timely\n            feedback for taking remedial actions."}, "docdt": "1996-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
