Overall project performance was satisfactory.\n            The project was also quite successful with respect to\n            institutional and program strengthening, as detailed below.\n            Lessons derived from the implementation of this project\n            include: a) The project brings to the fore once again the\n            on-going discussion in the Bank regarding the extent to\n            which project implementation arrangements should be\n            organizationally and functionally integrated with the\n            responsible Government Ministry or agency. Overall the\n            project was a success. As discussed in greater detail below.\n            the project was particularly successful in reorganizing the\n            family planning services, and in expanding and upgrading\n            primary health care services in rural and urban areas. There\n            was close communication, and collaboration between Bank, and\n            Government as these variances occurred. During\n            implementation, when it become clear that some elements\n            could not be carried out as planned, relevant changes were\n            made with full consideration for the Government."}, "docdt": "1993-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
