The irrigation schemes comprising\n            this project are environmentally acceptable with negative\n            impacts either nil or minor. This report discusses  likely\n            these negative social and environmental impacts and the\n            measures proposed to mitigate them, which generally consist\n            of engineering interventions incorporated into the design of\n            the scheme, or modifications to farming practices (through\n            training schemes) to reduce groundwater and drain pollution\n            by agrochemicals. Potential negative impacts caused by the\n            rehabilitation works during construction include\n            disturbance, noise, and dust, and disposal problems. It is\n            proposed to program work to minimize disruption during\n            sowing and harvesting, avoid cultivated areas, and monitor\n            construction activities. Also, these impacts are temporary\n            and will cease when the works are completed. During the\n            operational phase, potential environmental impacts may arise\n            from sediment accumulation in canals, deterioration of water\n            quality downstream and groundwater sources, disturbance to\n            localized ecosystems, and hydrological disturbance (the\n            latter is not expected in any of the six schemes).\n            Mitigations include regularly inspecting and clearing\n            canals, deep ploughing, using water efficiently, maintaining\n            drains, monitoring groundwater levels and salinity,\n            restricting nitrogen application on fields, providing health\n            awareness to farmers, well water sampling (for nitrates,\n            phosphates, and F. coliform bacteria), managing the\n            watershed, and using river training works and inspecting and\n            reporting riverbank erosion."}, "docdt": "2004-03-23T00:00:00Z"}
