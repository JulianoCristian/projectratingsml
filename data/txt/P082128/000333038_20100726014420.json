Lessons learned include: costing of project\n            activities should be based on updated data and targets at\n            appraisal should be based on realistic estimates and not on\n            inaccurate budgets. More comprehensive approach should have\n            been used in improving dam safety including more detailed\n            geotechnical and hydrological investigations to determine\n            the characteristics of the dams and their resistance to\n            earthquakes which can reduce the risk of dam failure\n            substantially. Adequate capacity should be developed and\n            maintained in the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and\n            Consumer Protection (MOAFCP) to deal with dam safety issues\n            of the large number irrigation dams. Dam safety problems\n            were identified during the inventory study but the effort\n            can be lost if there is poor capacity and/or commitment for\n            action. Similarly, the MOAFCP capacity for supervision of\n            civil works should be formally included in the Ministry\n            structure and proper training should be provided to the\n            unit. Also, incentives should be considered to enable the\n            experts to carry out their work beyond the regular working\n            hours to respond to the project needs. The cost of\n            contracted supervision services should be based on\n            competitive basis and not on the fixed regulation of the\n            Government that ignores the required work involved. The\n            transfer of Project Management Unit (PMU) staff and its\n            functions during implementation to the line ministry to\n            create capacity can also fail if there is not a strong\n            commitment to make it work. The transfer had to be reversed\n            in the case of supervision of works. Importance of having\n            the legal framework for irrigation institutions that clearly\n            defines duties and responsibilities to ensure Water Users\n            Association (WUO) sustainability."}, "docdt": "2010-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
