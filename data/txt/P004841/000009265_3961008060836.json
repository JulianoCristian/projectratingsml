The project will operate at two levels,\n            the first national and the second in a selected group of15\n            provinces. The project's objectives are: a) to increase\n            utilization of family planning and related family health\n            services; b) to improve the quality and range of family\n            planning and related family health services; c) to enhance\n            the National Committee for Population and Family\n            Planning's (NCPFP) management, planning and policy\n            formulation capabilities; and d) to expand the knowledge\n            base on which policy and technical guidelines would be\n            founded. For the selected 15 provinces, the focus will be on\n            strengthening of the Primary Health Care (PHC) system at\n            commune and district levels, with a particular emphasis on\n            Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and family planning\n            services. The project consists of five components, of which\n            four are national in scope and focused on family planning\n            and the fifth covers the primary health care system (commune\n            and district-level). These components consist of: service\n            delivery; information, education and communication;\n            contraceptive supplies, family planning management and\n            institutional development; and service delivery model initiative."}, "docdt": "1995-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
