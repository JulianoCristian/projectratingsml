 About this Report
        The IndependentEvaluationGroupassesses the programsand activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
 first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Bank'swork is producingthe
 expected results,and second, to helpdevelop improveddirections,policies,and procedures through the
 disseminationof lessons drawn from experience.As partof this work, IEGannuallyassesses about 25 percentof the
 Bank's lending operations. In selectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to those that are innovative,
 large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which Executive
 Directorsor Bank management have requested assessments;and those that are likelyto generate important lessons.
 The projects, topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessmentsupport largerevaluationstudies.
       A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
 PPARs, IEG staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
 the borrowing country for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to
 validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
 IEG studies.
       Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and IEG management approval. Once cleared internally, the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
 sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
 Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


 About the IEG Rating System
       The time-tested evaluation methods used by IEG are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
 methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
 sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
 the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the IEG website:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
       Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
 current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Sustainability: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutional Development Impact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutional arrangements. InstitutionalDevelopment Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

 Preface

         This i s a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Vietnam
 Population and Family HealthProject (PFHP, US$126.9 million). The PFHP was the
 first World Bank-supportedpopulation project inVietnam. It was approved on January
 16, 1996 andbecame effective on M a y 24, 1996. It provided financing o f SDR 33.6
 million (Credit 28070, US$50 million equivalent), with co-financing from the Asian
 Development Bank (ADB, $41million) and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
 Entwicklungbank (KfW, $20 million), and a government counterpart contribution o f
 $18.6 million. The credit was closed on September 30,2003, following a three-month
 extension o f the original closing date, with 99 percent o f the credit and 83 percent o f the
 total project funding disbursed.

         This PPAR was preparedbyMartha Ainsworth, IEG, drawing from a field
 assessment inM a y 2005 by Day1Donaldson, consultant. The findings are based on
review of: project files; the end-of-project evaluation; the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) o f the World Bankproject team; the Project Completion Report o f the
ADB; published andunpublished literature onpopulation, family planning,reproductive
health and development inVietnam; data from the Demographic and Health Surveys
(DHS) and Vietnam Living Standards Surveys (VLSS); and interviews with the project
task manager, staffo f the Project Management Unit (PMU) inthe National Committee
for Population, Family and Children (NCPFC) and o f the National Health Support Project
(NHSP), and representatives o f donor and NGO organizations contributing financially
andor technically to the project or to family planning and reproductive health inVietnam
more generally. Duringthe two-week mission to Vietnam, government staff were
interviewed and ongoing HIV/AIDS activities launchedby the project were observed in
ThanhHoaprovince; both a Village HealthPost and Commune HealthCenter were
visited inThaiNguyinprovince. A list o fthose consultedis inAnnex B. IEGwould
like to express appreciation to those interviewed and to the PMUand World Bank
Resident Mission staff who helped make appointments, arranged for translation and
transportation, and assembled key documents.

         The mission for the PFHP occurred concurrently with a mission to evaluate the
PrimaryEducation Project, with an interest inunderstanding the complementarity o f
investments inthe population and education sectors. The findings fi-om this PPAR will
serve as input for a forthcoming IEGevaluation o f the World Bank's support for the
health, nutrition, and population sector.

        Following standard IEGprocedures, copies o f the draft PPAR were sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comment. These are presented in
Annex E. To the extent that IEGi s inagreement with any o f the comments, they have
beentaken into account inthe final report.

  Summary
           Inthe early 1990s,Vietnam was increasingly opento the world economy andentered a
  period o f rapid socio-economic change, poverty reduction, and sustained growth. Vietnam already
  had a longstanding commitment to reducingpopulation growth andhighfertility because o f its
  negative impact on economic development. The government hadpromulgated a "one or two child"
  population policy, with mass mobilization to promote a small family norm and material and social
  incentives for couples and family planningproviders to comply. It also had aimed to make methods
  o f modem contraception widely available, with an emphasis on the IUD,while abortion and
  menstrualregulation were legal and widely available inthe event of contraceptive failure. However,
  by the early 1990s the extensive primary health care infrastructure through which family planning
  services were deliveredhad deteriorated, inpart due to the collapse o f communal sources o f finance.
  Total fertility rates were decliningbut the principal method o f family planning -the IUD- didnot
  address households' needs for modem, highly effective temporary methods of fertility regulation. The
 highshare ofwomen usingless effective traditional methods offamily planning ledto highrates of
  abortion.

           The Population andFamilyHealthProject (PFHP) was one o fthe World Bank's early
 operations inVietnam with objectives to: (a) improve the quality and range o f family planning and
 related family health services; (b) increase utilization o f modem methods of family planning and
 relatedhealth services; (c) enhance the capabilities o f the National Committee for Population and
 Family Planning (NCPFP) inmanagement, planning, and policy formulation; and (d) expand the
 knowledge base as the basis for policy and technical guidelines. The implementing agency was the
 NCPFP. The project was apart o f a broader effort to support the government's strategies to revitalize
 the primary health care (PHC) systemto improve the health status o f the population and bring about a
 further reductioninfertility andpopulationgrowth. The project was designed concurrently with a
 NationalHealth Support Project (NHSP) that also focused on improving PHC, although with a
 different geographic focus and a greater emphasis on communicable and childhood disease.

          The PFHP's design was complex, involving activities at the national level to increase the
 demand for family planning services and, in20 provinces, to improve the quality and range o f family
 planning and reproductive health services. Inaddition to the World Bank, the project had cofinancing
 from the Asian DevelopmentBank (ADB)and Germany (KfW). There were initial delays in
 implementation, andwith the availability of new informationfrom surveys and studies as well as
 substantial unanticipated savings to some components, project financing was reallocated after the
mid-termreview. The most notable among the changes were: a dramatic increase inthe number o f
 facilities financed for civil works; financing o f additional equipment, includingfor information
campaigns; replacement of "information, education, and communications" for smaller families by
"behavior change communication" to improve reproductive health; a new emphasis on the
reproductive health of adolescents and onpreventing HIV/AIDS; and launching o f reproductive
health campaigns inpoor and more remote areas. The management informationsystem to be
developedfor the NCPFP at all levels was eventually dropped, however. Leadership o f the project
management unit (PMU) within the NCPFP and Bank supervision o f the Project remained constant
throughout the project. The credit was nearly entirely disbursed with only a three-month extension o f
the completion date.

          Project investments to improve the quality o f services contributed to increased use of
antenatal care and o f health facilities for delivery and broader immunization coverage. The
reproductive health campaigns and HIVIAIDS activities began to address concerns relatedto the high
prevalence of sexually-transmitted infections. A socially marketed low-dose oral contraceptive, with
intensive marketing inurban areas, was successfully introduced. However, while fertility continuedto

                                                     X



decline at an unprecedented rate, the percent o f women usingmodem contraceptive methods didnot
change, the use o f oral contraceptives rose only slightly, and resort to less effective traditional family
planning methods actually rose. Recourse to abortion and menstrual regulation was unchanged. The
project's outcome i s rated as moderately satisfactory, institutional development as substantial,
sustainability as likely, and overall Bank and Borrower performance as satisfactory.

        The PFHP produced lessons for Vietnam and the Bank that may be relevant for lending in
countries with similar initial conditions:

    Efforts t o raise contraceptive use and improve method mix need to: (a) take into account
    pre-existing incentives, sanctions, and targets within the populationprogram that may not
    be compatible with this objective; and (b) ensure that demand-generating activities and
    other "software" investments proceed inparallel with efforts t o improve physical access.

    Population policy and family planning programs incountries undergoingthe transitionto a
    market economy need to adapt to the increasingrole of the private sector as a service
    provider. The potential complementarities and comparative advantages o f the public and private
    sectors needto be exploited, while appropriate regulations and policies need to be put inplace to
    ensure the quality o f both.

   Itis critically important that populationandreproductivehealthprograms reachout to
   unmarried young adults, inorder t o promote highly effective temporary methods o f birth
   control, prevent unwanted pregnancy and recourse to abortion, and prevent H I V / A I D S and
   other sexually transmitted disease.

   The effort to improve institutional performance can be undermined by lack o f institutional
   analysis, weak articulation o f institutional objectives, mis-identification o f the main
   constraints for improvement, and omission o f appropriate indicators t o measure success. In
   the PFHP, this affected not only the ability to strengthen capacity o f the NCPFP, but also the
   ability to re-orient the population program toward a reproductive health approach.

   Inorder to attribute changes inoutcomes to public policy, programs needto document their
   inputs and outputs over time and t o monitor other factors outside o f the program that
   plausibly could account for those outcomes. Lackingthis informationfor the PFHP, one
   cannot be certain that continued fertility decline and the increased use o f family health services in
   Vietnam was infact due to improved service quality, as opposed to increases ineducation and
   family income.

 1.      Introductionand Background

 Governmentand BankDevelopmentStrategy
 1.1     In 1986, Vietnam beganan economic reform program, knownasDoiMoi, andby
 1989was undertaking structural reforms that reduced the budget deficit, current account
 deficit, and inflation (from 400 percent in 1988 to 5.2 percent in 1993). Exports increased on
 average by 30 percent per annum. To achieve these measures the government sharply
 reducedpublic expenditures and growth inthe wages o f civil servants. The provision and
 maintenance o f public services suffered as a result.

 1.2     As a result o fVietnam's opening and the end o fthe United States' embargo, the
 World Bank launched a number o f sectoral studies and financed a Vietnam LivingStandards
 Survey (VLSS, 1992-3) to inform policy- andproject-based lending. The first IDA credits -
 primarily focused on infrastructure rehabilitation inproductive and social sectors -were
 approved in 1993. The Country Assistance Strategies o f the Bank, dated 1994 and 1995,
 highlightedfive goals o fgovernment policy: (i) maintain macroeconomic stability; (ii)
                                                   to                                         to
 make a steady transition to an open market economy; (iii)    to improve basic infrastructure;
 (iv) to alleviate poverty and address regional inequalities; and (v) to preserve the nation's
natural resourcebase. By 1998 the PrimeMinister and senior leadership o f the government
had changed and, following the East Asian financial crisis, the government expressed
concern about the highsocial costs o f rapidreform, the widening o f urban-rural disparities,
and that capital-intensive growth was not giving rise to sufficient jobs. The World Bank's
strategy shifted to strengthening the linkages betweenprojects andpolicy dialogue;
deepeningthe focus on poverty, social issues, and integratedrural development;
decentralizing management to the Resident Mission; and increasing efforts to aid
coordination and move to program lending.

1.3      Over the decade o f the 1990s, Vietnam's economy doubled insize and the rate o f
poverty was halved. The NinthParty Congress inMarch 2001 endorsed a 10-year
development strategy based on continued transition to a "market economy with a socialist
orientation", modernizing the system o f governance, increasing openness to the global
economy, and heavier investment inrural and lagging regions to ensure pro-poor
development. The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy provides an
"umbrella" under which aid from all sources can be coordinated. The World Bank continues
to co-chair the Consultative Group including government, donors and NGOs, and it provides
support to the program through a series o f Poverty Reduction Support Credits.

Demographicand FamilyHealthIndicatorsand Trends

1.4      Demographic change inVietnam is closely linked to economic, environmental,
gender, and social considerations. The government first articulated a policy to reduce
population growth in 1963 with the Ministryo f Health (MOH) inNorth Vietnam as the main
agency for delivering family planning services. Inthe south o f the country, family planning
was not promoted untilthe early 1970s and was still not extensive at the end o f the war, in
1975 (NCPFP 2003). Following unification, in 1981the Council o f Ministers at the Fourth

                                                              2


 Party Congress set three guidelines: each couple should have only 2 children; children should
 be spaced 5 years apart; and women should be 22 years old before marrying and having a
 child. In 1984, the National Committee on Population and Family Planning (NCPFP) was
 created, with the objective o f coordinating all population and family planning activities inthe
 country and implementing nationwide social mobilization to promote family planning.
 However, delivery o f family planning and abortion services remained the responsibility o f
 the MOH. In 1986, the Sixth Party Congress set the goal o f reducing population growth to
 replacement-level fertility by 2005. In 1988, the government officially adopted a "one child
 or two child" policy, including guidelines on age at first pregnancy, spacing intervals, and
 associated incentives and disincentives (Goodkind 1995), and it formalized a system o f vital
 events registration with local authorities.

 1.5       By 1989, Vietnam was a county o f some 64.4 millionpeople, the second most
 populous country inSoutheast Asia after Indonesia and the 14thmost populous country in
 the world. With one o f the highestpopulation densities inthe world, Vietnam's natural
 environment faced population-relatedpressures, such as deforestation, landissues arising
 from the intensity o f rice production, limited availability o f national sources o f power for
 electrification and industrialization, and declining water quality. That year, the NCPFP was
 elevated to being the sole advisory body to the Government on population policy and
program development and was also tasked to facilitate intersectoral coordination and conduct
population-based studies. By 1993, the NCPFP set up its own nationwide cadre o f hamlet-
level outreach workers ("collaborators") who received a small allowance plus performance-
based incentives for the promotiono f family planning, includingthe distribution o f condoms
and oral contraceptives.

1.6       Bythe mid-1990sVietnam's populationwas inthe process o f a rapiddemographic
transition (Table 1.1). Over the previous decade, the total fertility rate (TFR) fell from 3.98
to 2.67 children per woman.' The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) among currently
married women rose from 54 to 75 percent, including an increase inthe use o f modem
methods from 38 to 55 percent.' Child health improved dramatically, due both to rising
incomes and the use o f antenatal care and maternal and child health (MCH) services. The
infant mortality rate (IMR) and low birthweight deliveries declined substantially. As a
result, although Vietnam's population grew from 64.4 million to 75.4 millionbetween the
1989 and 1999 censuses, its intercensalpopulation growth rate slowed from 2.1 percent
(1979-89) to 1.7 percent (1989-99).

1.7       Despite this demographic success, the total abortion rate (TAR), which i s the average
number o f abortions a woman would have duringher lifetime ifshe experienced current age-
specific abortion rates, was among the highest inthe                            an indication o f highunmet

 rhythmandwithdrawal. The highresort to menstrualregulation(MR) and abortion was a
 result o f the failure o f traditional contraceptive methods and unwanted pregnancie~.~

 StructureandEvolutionof the HealthSector

 1.8         Untilthe late 1980shealth services were provided entirely bythe public sector.
 Health facilities were structured ina pyramid with a Commune Health Center (CHC) at the
base providing primarycare services, supported by more sophisticated procedures available
 at district andprovincial hospitals. The CHCs depended for their financing on agricultural
work brigades, butwith the collapse o f the communal production system, the availability o f
funds for infrastructure, equipment, training, and eventhe salaries o f commune health
workers dried up (World Bank 2001). The extensive community-based health network,
which was inlarge part responsible for Vietnam's relatively strong health outcomes for a
country o f its level o f income, deteriorated dramatically.

1.9         Doi Moi reforms also applied to the health sector. After 1989, user fees were
introduced at government hospitals. A decree on decentralized decision-making for state-
owned enterprises included those manufacturing pharmaceuticals and condoms. Private
medical practice andthe commercial sale o f medicines, drugs and contraceptives were
legalized. The number of private providers, particularly drugoutlets and private pharmacies,


and Thai Binhand then"divid[ed] the resulting age-specificabortiontotals by the population from Vietnam's 1989 census,
aged forward by three years." (p. 351). This estimate includesreportedabortions for all women, irrespectiveo ftheir marital
status. However, there is no TAR calculatedina similar way from service statisticsfor any subsequent year. The 1997
Demographicand Health Survey (DHS), estimated a TAR over the period 1992-96 of only 0.54, basedon reports of a
representativesample o f ever-married women 15-49. While abortionsare likely to be under-reportedin surveys, this
statistic is also lower than expectedbecausenever-marriedwomen(a third of the population ofwomen 15-49at that time)
were included inthe TAR calculation, with an assumptionthat they hadno abortions(A. Cross, personal communication).
Neitherthe 1997nor the 2002 DHScollectedabortionor contraceptiveuse information onnever-marriedwomen.
4. Of the overall modemCPR of 56 percent,38.5 percentagepointswas accountedfor by the IUD.
5. InVietnam, menstrualregulation (MR)refers to vacuumaspirationless than 6 weeks from the start of the lastmissed
period, while abortion is used for procedures after 6 weeks' gestation(Hienand others 1999).

                                                               4


 grew rapidly, quickly outstripping the ability o f government to regulate and monitor their
 quality (World Bank 2001).

 1.10       After the fall o f the Soviet Unionin 1991and the elimination o f contraceptive aid
 from Eastern countries, the UnitedNations Population Fund(UNFPA) provided most o f
 Vietnam's contraceptive supply. Vietnam hadits own condom production capacity, although
 there were quality issues. As o f 1996, all women had a CHC intheir commune and almost
 90 percent had IUDinsertion services available at their CHC (Behrman andKnowles 1998).
 However, only 77 percent o f women had access to oral contraceptives (OC) at the CHC,
 ranging from 65 percent among women inthe lowest income quintile to 85 percent inthe
 highest quintile. Almost all women (95 percent) had access to OC at the nearest district
 hospital, but the poorest women lived an average o f 20 km away. Only about 65 percent o f
 thepoorest women hadapharmacy intheir commune, comparedwith 84 percent o fwomen
 inthe richest income quintile. AvailabilityofOC at pharmacies was low, however, for both
 the poorest women (25 percent) andthe wealthiest (46 percent).6

 1.11 Aside from the FP services providedby CHCs and district hospitals, mobileunits
 provided FP services inrural areas, including gynecological examinations, IUD insertions,
 distribution o f pills and condoms, and performance o fmenstrual regulatiordabortion and
 sterilization. By the early 1990s, reliance on the mobile units was declining as each o f the
 district hospitals had a complete family planningunit (World Bank 1992).



2.         ProjectObjectives and Design

2.1        The Population and Family Health Project (PFHP, $127.6 million equivalent, 1996-
2003) supported the Government o f Vietnam's strategies to strengthen and revitalize the
current primaryhealth care (PHC) system andprograms inorder to improve the health status
o f the population and bring about a further reduction infertility andpopulation growth. The
project was designed concurrently with a National Health Support Project (NHSP, $127.3
million equivalent, 1996-2006) that also focused on improving PHC, although with a
different geographic focus and a greater emphasis on communicable and childhood disease.

2.2        The specific objectives o f the PFHP were to:

0    increase utilizationo f family planning and related family health services;
0    improve the quality and range o f family planning and related family health services;
0    enhance NCPFP's management, planning andpolicy formulation capabilities; and
0    expand the knowledge base on which policy and technical guidelines would be founded.

2.3       At the time that the project was approved, itwas expected to contribute to lowering
the TFR from 2.9 to below 2.5 andthe IMR from 40 to 25 and to raise the contraceptive
prevalence rate (CPR) for modern methods to 56 percent by 2002. However, the 1997
baseline survey revealed that these had already been reached or nearly reachedbefore the


6. Similar information on the availability of contraceptivesupplies, especiallytemporarymethods, at CHCs, district
hospitals and pharmaciesat the end of the project is not available.

                                                              5


 project started. The targets were then revised: the TFR was to decline from 2.7 to 2.1 and the
 IMRfrom 28 to 25 per 1,000 livebirths, by2002. The revised target for family planning
 was to raise the modern CPR from 56 to 65 percent. Inaddition, the share o f temporary
 modem methods (pills, condoms, and injectables) among contraceptive users was to increase
 from 10to 25 percent, and the total abortion rate (TAR) decline by 30 percent, from 0.54 to
 0.38 (Annex Table D.1).

 2.4       Activities were grouped under five components (Box 1). The first component
 supported strengthening the PHC system at the commune and district levels, particularly
 M C H and FP service delivery, in 15 (later 20) o fthe country's 53 provinces.' The


 Box 1, PopulationandFamilyHealth ProjectComponents

 Provincial ServiceDelivery (US$ 61.7 million, 49 percent o fbaseline cost). Provincial PHC service
 delivery was to be improved in 15 provinces by providing: (a) upgraded facilities; (b) furniture, equipment,
 and vehicles; (c) essential drugs and supplies; (d) in-service training; and (e) strengthened outreach
 services. Drugs and medical supplies were to be provided to set up revolving drugs funds, although in
 mountainous and remote communities they were to be provided at no charge.

 Information,Education and Communication(IEC, US$ 12.9 million, 10percent). IECprograms and
 activities o f the NCPFP, both interpersonal outreach of FP collaborators and mass and print media, were to
 be strengthened and expanded. A social marketing programfor oral contraceptives inurbanareas was to
 be launchedthroughpharmacies inbetter-offneighborhoods, coupled with community-based door-to-door
 promotion and resupplyprogram inpoor neighborhoods.

 ContraceptiveSupplies(US$ 24.2 million, 19 percent). This component was to fundthe bulk o fmodern
 contraceptive commodities for a broadenedmethod mix over the years 1997-2000, including OCs for the
 social marketingprogram, but excluding condoms, which were to be financed through the NCPFP budget.

 Family PlanningManagement andInstitutionalDevelopment(US$ 5.5 million, 4 percent). The
 management and planning capabilities o fthe NCPFP and its committee network were to be strengthened
 through training and the development o f a management information system (MIS)that would track changes
 inprojectprovinces and facilitate strategic planning.

 ServiceDeliveryModelInitiatives (US$6.0 million, 6 percent). Pilot studies were to be conducted to
 .dentify cost-effective approaches for expansionto appropriate areas. a Studies were proposed on: (a)
 strengthening the community-based FP collaborator system; (b) village healthposts; (c) private sector
 ;upport for family planning and reproductive health; (d) user fees for contraceptives; (e) improved
 ipproaches to safe motherhood; and (e) improved access for ethnic minorities.

 L.Scalingup of successful pilot activities in the PFHPprovinceswas to be financed throughthe first component.

 xovinces were selected based on: their low health and FP status; adequate management
 ;apacity; absence o f other substantial donor FP assistance; and regional spread. Many
provinces were among the poorest and nine had significant ethnic minority populations. The
other four components focused on strengthening the family planning program nation-wide.

7. Soon after effectiveness, some o fthe 15 selectedprovincessubdivided, resulting in 18 project provinces: LamDong,
Dong Thap, Thai Nguyen, Bac Kan, HaiDuong, NamDinh,HungYen, Thua ThienHue,Lao Cai, NamHa, Hai Phong, Dac
Lac, Tuyen Quang, Lai Chau, Vinh Long, ThanhHoa, Tra Vinh andKienGiang. The NHSP supported a similar package of
inputsin 15 (later 16) additionalprovinces,selectedon similar criteria. By2002, these two projectscovered36 of
Vietnam's (then) 61 provinces.

                                                                  6



  2.5       Indesignating the NCPFP as the ExecutingAgency, the project expandedthe scope
  o f the NCPFP's activities to include delivery o f family planning and reproductive health
  services, normallyprovided by the MOH.' Average annual levels o f project funding (US$
  18.5 million) added about 40 percent to the NCPFP's estimated budget o f US$45.6 million
  in1996from government sources. Implementationwas managedbya Project Management
 Unit(PMU), consistingo faProjectDirector, aDeputyDirector seconded from the MOH,
  and 13 other staff. Provincial Project Management Units(PPMUs) managedproject
 implementation inthe provinces participating inthe first component. Oversight was
 provided by an inter-ministerial Project Steering Committee with representatives o f the
 PMU, MOH, Ministry o fPlanning and Investment, Ministryo fAdministrative Services, and
 Ministryo fHumanResources Development.

 2.6       The project receivedtechnical and financial contributions o fthree donors -the Bank,
 ADB, andKfW. There were 7 preparation andappraisalmissions over aperiodo f25
 months. Project planning meetings were conducted at the provincial level, a facilities survey
 was fielded in5 provinces, and consultant input was supported by a Population and Human
 Resources Development grant. The project became effective on M a y 24, 1996.

 2.7       Itis strikingthat the project designdidnot explicitly address the strong incentives
 embedded inVietnam's population policy, given that these factors that could potentially
 affect the success o f efforts to expand method mix and support contraceptive c h ~ i c eThe                           . ~
 Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) notes that among the strategies necessaryto reach the objective
 ofvoluntary participation, freedom o f choice, and a reproductive health approach, are
 "improved remuneration, training, and working conditions for collaborators and motivators,
 coupled with a gradual phasing-out o f incentives" (World Bank 1995, p. 16). However, there
 i s no evidence that the Bank entered into any policy dialogue with government on the issue
o f targets, incentives, or provider remuneration inconjunction with this project, nor are these
policies addressed inthe assessment o f risks or inany o f the covenants or agreements.



3.         Implementation

3.1        The PFHP made significant up-front investments intraining project staff inBank
processing procedures at the outset, to avoid the extensive delays experienced with the earlier
approved Primary Education Project (PEP). However, even with this training the project had


8. The NHSP financed a substantially similar set o f family health services in 16 additional provinces through the MOH.

9. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) notes, for example, that contracts between the MOH and the NCPFP typically specify
targets to be achieved by the service providers, in terms o f "numbers o f acceptors for a given method or o f different types o f
procedures to be performed annually" and that the budget i s calculated based on these targets. It also notes that the NCPFP
and CPFP network at sub-national levels include "incentives for adoption o f a method (paid to both acceptors and the
collaborators who motivate them)" (p. 12). This is not to suggest that the fertility reduction objectives o f the population
program are inappropriate, but rather that to the extent that these incentives or targets favor more permanent, highly
effective methods (like the IUD or sterilization), they are not likely to be conducive to greater use o f temporary modem
methods by women who have not yet started a family or who are spacing births. A 1999 report by WHO, other UNagencies
and the Bank suggested that the remuneration system for abortion providers at that time created an incentive for unnecessary
procedures (Hien and others 1999).

                                                               7


 an overly ambitious disbursement schedule. The complexity o f the project (which grew over
 time as savings were reallocated), highstaff turnover inthe PMU, and over-estimation o f the
 costs o f some activities also contributed to lower than anticipated disbursement rates at the
 outset. At the time o f the mid-termreview (MTR) inDecember 1999, 11.8 percent o f the
 credit had been disbursed and about halfhad been committed. However, disbursements were
 more rapid during the second halfo f the project, and it closed on September 30,2003, with
 only a 3-month extension. Ultimately, 99.3 percent o f the IDA credit and 83.0 percent o fthe
 original project budget inUS dollars were disbursed."

 3.2       Substantial savings were experienced insome components, which provided an
 opportunity to reallocate resources and expand the scope (and complexity) o f activities.
 Competitive bidding dramatically reduced the costs o f civil works, furniture and equipment.
 Further, followingthe initialprocurement o f essential drugs, it was foundthat CHCs already
 had adequate supplies, releasing roughly $10 million for other activities.

 3.3       There were also developments ingovernment policy that shaped the activities
 actually implemented. First, population and FP policy shifted from a family size limitation
 approach, emphasizing IEC for smaller families, to a behavior change communication (BCC)
 approach, promotingFP andreproductive health (Socialist Republic of Vietnam 2000).
 Second, concern was mounting about the needto thwart the rapidly spreading HIV/AIDS
 epidemic by integrating HIV/AIDS prevention into the population program andhealth
 system. Third, following severe flooding, inApril 1998 the government requestedthat the
 provinces of Bac Lieu and Ca Mau, at the far southern tip o f the country, be added, raising
 the number o f "project provinces" to 20, from the original 15-18.

 3.4       As a result, althoughthe objectives o fthe PHFPremainedunchanged:l2

           About 60 percent more CHCs were upgradedthan planned and 12provincial
           education centers were built, though the latter had not beenplanned inthe project
           design. Ninety-two village health posts were constructed on a pilot basis.l3
           Communications equipment and vehicles, not originallyplanned, were financed at the
           province, district, and commune levels inbothproject and non-project provinces.
           An integratedpackage o finvestments inIEC and supervision systems was introduced
           at the district level inthe 36 provinces supported by the PFHP and the NHSP, as well
           as additional equipment for district hospitals, including anesthesia, ultra-sound and X-
          ray machines. l4


10. The final disbursement indollars was lower thanplannedlargely becausethe IDA credit was denominatedin SDR and
the dollar appreciatedagainst the SDR over the lifetime of the project. Thus, the availablebudget inUS dollarswas lower
thanthe amount at appraisal.
11. This also might havebeen anticipatedby the time that the PFHPwas approved, basedon the experience of the PEP.

12. See Annex C for a detailedlist o fplannedand actual expenditures and commodities.
13. The S A R advocated construction o f a maximum o f440 healthposts, assuming that the model was found to
be sustainable by the activities o fthe fourth component.
14.The district packagewas to be basedon the re-oriented governmentpopulation policy that includedfamily planning, safe
motherhood,RTIISTDIHIV prevention, safe abortionand information and counseling.

                                                                   8


            IECwas replacedbyBCC," and a new activity aimed at adolescents -family and
            reproductive health education inupper secondary schools (grades 10-12) -was added
            for the 36 PFHP andNHSP provinces, albeit late inthe project (2002-3), buildingon
            curricula development supported by UNFPA.
            The project, initially relying solely on government funds for condoms, spent $2-3
            million on additional condom procurement toward the end o f the project in
            anticipation o f future unmet need, for free distribution to the provinces.
            Roughly $1.5 million from the studies component was allocated to support local
            responses to HIV/AIDS inseven provinces with 33 cities. This was intended to be an
            investment inlearning more about local conditions and constraints, as the basis for
            planning future culturally appropriate, larger scale efforts to prevent HIV.                            l6


 3.5        Eight "service delivery modelinitiatives" were piloted, most for less than $400,000
 each (see Annex Table C.6). However, twice the planned amount was spent on the
 component because of a single activity -the "Campaign on Reproductive Health Services for
 DisadvantagedAreas". These campaigns provided FP/RH counseling and services, antenatal
 services, gynecological examinations and treatment o f STIs. A total o f five rounds o f this
 campaign were launched from October 2000 - September 2002 over most o f the country."
 Far from being a "pilot", the campaign was effectively one o f the major activities o f the
 project to increase outreach o freproductive health services to remote areas.

 3.6       Because o f the decision to discontinue drugprocurement, only 17 percent o f the
 budgeted amount for essential drugs was expended, releasing about 15 percent of the total
 project budget for reallocation. This and other savings resulted inexpending twice as much
 on service delivery models as was planned, and more than twice the budgeted amount for
 furnishings, equipment, and vehicles.

 3.7       The activities addressing the supply and demand for FP andreproductive health
 services were not implemented inparallel. Most o fthe improvements ininfrastructure were
 completed by 2001. The efforts to raise demand did not occur untilthe end o f the project.
 There was one spurt o f IEC activity in 1999. The RHcampaign inunderserved areas was




 15. Specific BCC activities introduced at the mid-term review included: developing management capacity for BCC at the
national and provincial levels; BCC research; development o f client-centered counseling skills in 36 provinces; two national
campaigns, one for married couples and one for adolescents and unmarried adults, with mass media and provincial-level
market-segmented approaches.

16. The seven provinces were BinhDuong, SOCTrang, BinhPhuoc, Long An, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and H a Tinh. The
three stated objectives o f these activities were: (a) to increase awareness and full ownership o f the local risks o f HIV/AIDS
among local political leaders; (b) to create basic technical capacity inthe provincial health service; and (c) to demonstrate
key elements o f effective community actions to reduce vulnerability and risk to HIV infection. The activities, including IEC
and peer educators, diagnosis and treatment o f STDs and serological and behavioral surveillance, particularly o f sex workers
and their clients, paralleled those financed b y a $3-million, 3-year ADB pilot community-based HIVIAIDS prevention
project infive provinces that focused on "hot spots" o f high-riskactivity financed by the Japanese Poverty Reduction Fund.

17. They were carried out infive stages, reaching 5,541 communes in 54 provinces inthe first two stages, 4,702 communes
in57 provincesinthe third stage, and 8,064 communes inall 61 provinces inthe fourth and fifthstages.

  launchedin2000-2002. The BCC program was not launched until2003 (after the second
  DHSto evaluate the project).18

  3.8        The baseline survey for the PFHP-a national Demographic andHealth Survey
  (DHS) -was conducted inJuly-October 1997, more than a year after the project became
  effective. The results were not publisheduntilFebruary 1999, shortly before the MTR, at
  which time it was learned that many o f the project's outcome targets hadbeen reached or
  nearly reached before the project's launch. New targets were adopted (though not all were
  defined).

  4.         Outcomes by Objective

  4.1       Inassessing the contribution ofthe PFHPto population and familyhealth outcomes,
  it is important to recognize the possible influence o f other contemporaneous developments.
  Over the period 1993-2002, per capita income grew by 5.9 percent per year, halvingthe
 poverty rate, from 58 to 29 percent (ADB and others 2003). Between 1991 and 2002, State
 Budget health spending per capita more then tripled, from VND 20,000 to VND 64,000 in
 real terns.      This understates the increase ingovernment health spending, however, because
 the share financed by the central government declined from about 35-40 percent inthe mid-
  1990s to 25 percent in2002. Over the four-year period 1998-2002, the gross enrollment rate
 inlower secondary school rose from 62 to 72percent andthe share o fworkers earning a
 wage rose from 19 to 30 percent. The demographic transition was already underway, and
 Vietnam's continuing socio-economic transition, interms o f rising female education and
 labor force participation and declining poverty, surely influenced the demand for children,
 F P Nand family health services.

 4.2       Vietnam's demographic transition continued over the course ofthe PFHP. Between
 1997 and 2002, the TFR declined from 2.67 to 1.87 children per woman -below replacement
 level (see Figurela). Considering the already relative low level o f fertility inVietnam, the
 rapid fertility decline inthe first halfo f the 1990s, and compared with other countries, the
 VDHS Final Report concluded that the country's rate o f fertility decline was
 "unprecedented".         The infant mortality rate also declined dramatically, from 28.2 to 18.2 per
 thousand, although the confidence intervals around both statistics are sufficiently large that
this drop is not statistically significant (Figure lb)."


 18. A new Director of the IEC Department was appointedin2002. The major substantiveshift to combining reproductive
healthand family planning messages and targetingaudienceswith specific messageswas not adopted untilthat time. Itwas
not possiblefor the end-of-projectevaluationto assess the impact o f the new BCC strategyon demand generationgiven that
it was implementedso late inthe project.

19. SocialistRepublic of Vietnam and World Bank2005, p. 57. The increaseinper capita spendingis inconstant 1994
terms. From 1991-2002, State Budget spendingon healthrose from 1 to 1.6percento f GDP and from 6 to 6.5 percent of the
overall budget. Other important developmentsinthe healthsector included shift of paymentof CHC workers from
commune to the state and a dramatic expansioninprivately-provided health care, including private pharmaciesand drug
vendors. Governmentattemptedto increasethe postingo fmedicaldoctors at CHCs, although IEG could not document the
extent to which this effort succeeded.
20. Trends inkey demographicand service utilization outcomes from 1997-2002for which confidence intervalswere
calculated, are inAnnex Table D.3. The 2002 DHSFinal Report admits that the IMRestimate of 18.2 deathsper thousand
live births is muchlower than would have beenpredictedandthat the true number i s probably somewhat higher.

 4.3              The PFHP set demographic targets that were exceeded, but there were many changes
 inVietnam's economy andsociety beyondthe project outputs that couldhavebrought this
 about. Improvedquality and availability o f FPRH services and other outputs o f the PFHP-
 both national and inthe project provinces -may have contributed. However, given that the
project provinces were not randomly selected, that similar FP/RH services were being
 financed by the NHSP andthe government inall o f the non-project provinces, and that many
 o f the PFHP interventions were national inscope,                                                                                     21 there is no simple or straightforward way
 o f attributing even that part o f demographic change to improved quality and range o f FP/FH
services or better IEC due to this project. Thus, inthis section we review the evidence that
each o f the project's four objectives were achieved and that the achievements plausibly could
be attributed to these collective efforts, particularly for the first and second project objectives
o f improvingthe quality and range o f FP/RH services and increasing utilizationo f these
services. Didthese efforts raise the share o f modern family planning methods, reduce
traditional methods and the number of abortions? The evidence for achievement o f the third
and fourth objectives o f improvingNCPFP management and the knowledge base,
respectively, are more easily linked to specific PFHP investments.


Improvethe QualityandRangeof FP/RHServices

4.4             The project made substantial investments, mainly through the first component, in
improvingthe quality and range of FP/RH services inthe 20 PFHPprovinces, although it
also financed some o f these investments (training, equipment) inthe 16NHSP provinces.
The quality and range o f FP/RHservices at the end o f the project were relatively high, and




21. The NHSP financeda package of services that included communicablediseasecontrol, MCH, F P N , and otherbasic
care, for example, in 16provinces. According to the Final Evaluation Report, the governmentpopulation budgetper capita
was 65 percenthigher and the governmenthealthbudget54 percenthigher inthe non-PFHPprovinces. Including the value
o f PFHP investments, total spending was still 21 percent higher innon-PFHPprovinces, and this appears to exclude
resourcesexpendedby the NHSP (TFGI and others 2003, pp. 30-31).

                                                              11


 sometimes higher than innon-PHFP provinces, according to the Final Evaluation report
 (TFGIand others 2003):22

      An exemplar sub-set o fthe FP/RH/MCH equipment providedbythe project was
      available at over 90 percent o f CHCs inproject provinces.23This generally matched the
      availability o f the same items innon-project provinces, with the exception of infant and
      adult scales and pelvic rulers.
      Over 90 percent o f workers inproject provinces received training in 10 o f 16 topics. In
      all 16 subjects a higher percent o f workers inproject provinces hadreceived training
      withinthe past 5 years (Figure2).24The extent oftraining incounseling on FP generally
      and on specific methods inboth project andnon-project provinces i s particularly
      significant, as the concept ofcounseling as part o f FPIRHservices was uncommonin
      Vietnam prior to the launch o f the project.
      As o fthe end o fthe project, the share o f CHCs inPFHPprovinces having each o f20
      essential drugs instock usually equaled or exceeded the share innon-project provinces.
      Over 80 percent o f CHCs inproject provinces had 12 o fthe 20 drugs, and over 90
      percent o f the CHCs had 7 o f the 20 drugs. However, no specific essential drugwas
      available at all CHCS.~'
 4.5       While it i s likelythat these represented improvements over time inthe quality and
range o fpubliclyprovided FPIRHservices inboth the project andnon-project provinces, the
magnitude o f the improvement has not been systematically assessed.26The availability at
 CHCs o f effective modern methods - the pill, the condom, and injectables -was not
tabulated inthe DHS final report or inthe end-of-project evaluation. There i s some evidence
from the DHS o f improved availability o f the pill and condom inrural areas o f PFHP


22. The FinalEvaluationReportundertook a comparisonofresults in2003 for 5 project provincesmatchedto 5 non-project
provincesinthe same regions. Comparisons inthe DHSfinal reports, however, are for all project and all non-project
provinces.
23. Surveyeditems available at fewer than 60 percent ofproject CHCs were ENT equipment sets, microscopes,refrigerators
and telephones- althoughthesehadnot beenincludedas part ofthe project's standardequipment. Communalleaders
complained,however, that the electricaldryer for dry sterilization was too power consumingfor a CHC with limited budget
for electricity and too largefor the capacityof the communal electrical system. This raises questionsabout whether the
ability of CHCs to conductmore sophisticatedprocedures was accompaniedby adequatemeans to reduce iatrogenic
infections.
24. The training assessment scores o f CHC RHstaff inproject provinceswere not statistically different than for staff innon-
project provinces,however, accordingto the end-of-projectevaluation. Information about the initial levels of subject
masteryby the PFHP andnon-projectgroups is not available, althoughthe fact that the PFHPprovincesare consideredmore
disadvantaged is aconsideration.Areas o fweakness inclinical knowledgeinall provincesinthe end-of-project evaluation
included: (a) clients' RHrights; (b) condomuse demonstration;(c) abnormaldelivery scenarios; (d) abortion services; (e)
STI counseling; (f)treatment o f cervicitis and vaginal candida; and(g) syndromic treatment of STIs. Low scores for
counselingwere attributedby the Training ManagementCommitteeto the low value trainers gave to counseling. The
questions on STI treatment were basedon newly developedstandardsthat hadnot beendisseminatedto the local level.

25. The PFHPprovided only an initial procurementof essential drugs to the project provinces;it is plausible that the training
providedby project resources contributedto better managemento f drug stocks inthese CHCs, but there is no evidence that
this was aresult ofthe project.
26. Neitherthe FinalEvaluationReport, nor the ICRpresentedan analysis of changes inquality of services over time,
althoughsuchan analysis would have beenpossibleusingthe results from the healthfacility surveys inboththe 1997 and
2002 DHSs. Instead, both evaluationsdrew almost exclusively on evidence from a single round of the National Health
Survey (NHS), conductedin2002.

4.6       The project supported social marketing o f the first low-dose OC, New Choice,
nationwide, with an emphasis on urbanmarketsS2*While OC hadbeen socially marketed in
Vietnam by DKT International since mid-1995, DKTwas contracted by NCPFPto develop a
brandname and social marketing campaign for an OC to bepricedsubstantially below the
prices o f those available inprivate pharmacies inVietnam. The social marketing program
discontinued the previous brand, Choice, at the end o f 1999, andNew Choice replaced it
nationally inJanuary 2000. It was first marketed inDanang, Hanoi, and Ho Ch MinhCity in
2000. The subsidized price was VND 1,000 per cycle, considerably below the prices o f other
commercially available products o f up to VND 50,000 per cycle. In2004, the marketing o f
New Choice was extended to Hai Phong. These efforts likely improved the access o f urban
marriedandunmarried women to a highly effective andtemporary methodo fbirthcontrol,
with the potential to reduce recourseto abortion. Although the price o fNew Choicedoubled
to VND 2,000, sales o f O C increasedover 50 percent from 1.9 to 3.2 millioncycles.

4.7      Finally, the civil works financed by the project substantially improved the physical
quality o f 55 to 92 percent o f CHCs in75 percent o f the communes inthe 20 project

27. Access to mobileclinics declinedinrural areas duringthe project, though this may represent a substitutiono f CHC for
mobileFP services.

 provinces, and from 78 to 92 percent o fthe CHCs inmountainous areas (TFGI and others
 2003). However, there were shortcomings inthe designo f the CHCs notedby community
 leaders andhealth workers inthe end-of-project evaluation: (a) the procedure room, used for
 clinical family planning and gynecological services i s too small; (b) there is no separate room
 for injections or examinations or for retained patients who need to stay at the CHC; and (c)
 the roofs are too low for sufficient ventilation and often leak. The national standard for CHCs
 issuedin2002, after the PFHP civil works were completed, requires 8-9 rooms with a floor
 area o f at least 90 m2,while the CHCs renovatedby the project have 5-7 rooms and an area
 o f only 70m2(TFGIand others 2003, p. 39).29

 Increase the Use of Family Health and FP Services

 4.8      Over the period 1993-98, duringwhich time much was invested inimproving the
 physical quality o f CHCs, the annualized contact rate o f the population with CHC staff rose
 from a level that was 60 percent o f the contact rate for public hospitals to near equality -
 0.57 annual contacts, compared to 0.60 for public hospitals (see Annex Table D.5). Analysis
 o f the 1992/93 and 1997/98 Vietnam Living Standards Survey (VLSS) found that CHCs are
 far more likely to be used by the poor and that as incomes rise (as they did over this period),
use o f public hospitals increases (Trivedi 2004). Thus, the relative increase incontact rates
 for CHCs compared to hospitals signals relatively greater utilizationby the poor by 1997/98
o f services supported by the PFHP, the NHSP and other government programs.3o

4.9       Use o f a number o f specific family health services increasedover the life o f the
project: the share o fwomen receiving tetanus and o f children fully immunized, the share o f
deliveries ina health center, and the share o f women receiving medical care at birthall
increased(see Figure 3). Though the project didnot provide inputs to the immunization
program, the improvement inthe quality o f health infrastructure supported by the project and
any increase inthe number o f physicians posted to CHCs by government may have supported
the observed increases inuse o f family health services provided through CHCs.

4.10      Incontrast, the anticipated outcomes for contraceptiveuse among currently married
women were by and large not realized. The CPR rose about 3 percentagepoints (from 75.3
to 78.5 percent, statistically significant), which i s remarkable given the already high
percentage o f women using contraception at the start o f the project. However, the CPR for
modem methods was unchanged, at roughly 56 percent, andthe goal o f increasing short-
term, highly-effective supply-based contraceptive methods to 25 percent was not met. Use o f
the pillrose modestly from 4 to 6 percent, though this was not statistically significant, but so
diduse o fless effective traditional methods, from 19 to 22 percent (see Annex Table D.6).




29. Ina few communes, the PFHP CHCs were as large as 95m2. The procedure room ofthe upgradedCHCs was only
1Om2, comparedwith the new standard of 16m2. Complaints about the small size o fthe CHCs were most frequent in
heavily populated communes, while less frequent inremote areas (TFGI and others 2003).
30. Unfortunately, comparable data for 2003, the end of the project, are not available. The contact rates for 1992/93 were
0.19 for CHCs and 0.32 for public hospitals, but the data from the two surveys are not strictly comparable. The 1997/98
survey had a less restrictive question to capture more contacts. See the footnote to Annex Table D.5.

 The small absolute increases inpilluse nevertheless were observed among married women in
 both urban and rural areas andparticularly among women 20-29. For both urbanwomen and
 women 20-24, there was evidence o f modest substitution o fpills and/or condoms for IUDs,
 reflecting greater choice for some women, which was an objective o f the PFHP. It is also
 notable that the CPR for rural women rose from 74 to 78 percent, almost reaching the same
 level as inurban areas (79 percent). Women 20-24 also raised their all-method CPR (from
 55 to 58 percent). However, for both o fthese groups the increase inthe CPR can be largely
 accounted for by increaseduse o f traditional methods. One o f the objectives o f promoting
 the pill was to reduce the substantial reliance on traditional methods, which have a high
 failure rate. Yet recourse to them continued to rise and the overall use o f modernmethods
 was flat inalmost all cases.31

4.11 Given the continued highrecourse to traditional family planning methods, it i s
perhaps not surprising that the abortion rate (including both abortion and menstrual
regulation, or MR) for ever-married women was also constant over the life o f the project
(Annex Table D.7).32Eighty-five percent o fwomen undergoing a pregnancy termination


31. Annex Table D.6also shows evidence o f substitution o f the pill and female sterilization for the IUDwithin project
provinces (although with no change inthe modern method or total CPR). However, the number o f project provinces
increased over the life o f the project, from 15 to 20. Three o f the original provinces were sub-divided, but two others were
new, so the results for "project provinces" are not strictly comparable over time.

32. The Staff Appraisal Report proposedmonitoring the "Total Abortion Rate" (TAR), which is the number of abortions and
MRsthat a woman would have inher lifetime ifshehadthem at the current age specific rates over her entire reproductive
lifetime. However, the two DHS did not collect data on unmarriedwomen. To calculate the TAR they added never-married

                                                                15


  previously were using a traditional method o f contraception or no method. However, the
  share o f induced abortions among all procedures declined from 38 percent to 21percent and
  the share o f MR increased. This patternwould be consistent with an improvement in
  services at CHCs (where MRs can beperformed if staff have been trained to do so, but not
  later-term procedures), leading women to seek services earlier at the CHC rather than later at
  public hospitals.33 While the total number o fprocedures was unchanged, a substantial share
  o f MRs - 18 percent o f them ina study o f rural Thai Binhprovince - are performed on
  women who are not actually pregnant (Vach and others 1998).34 Thus, with the relative
, increase inMR, the number o f actualpregnancyterminations inever married women may
  have declined. However, unless pregnancy tests have come into greater use, this would also
  implythat an even greater number o fprocedures was beingperformed onwomen who are
  not pregnant.

  4.12      What can account for the modest results for the pill, continued highresort to the IUD,
  stagnation inthe modernmethod CPR and the abortion rate, and the increase intraditional
  methods?

  4.13      One hypothesis is that the demand-generating activities occurred too late inthe
  project to register an impact, and/or that the project under-estimated the influence o f
  entrenched provider attitudes and incentives. Previous studies suggested that supplies o f the
  pill andcondoms were not the bindingconstraint to raising their use (Knodel and others
  1995). Rather, there was a need for a re-orientation o f provider information, attitudes, and
  incentives to provide better counseling and freer choice, to emphasize less family size and
  more reproductive health, and to better inform consumers of the advantages of these other
  methods. However, the PFHP focused first on the supply side and only on the demand side
  much later. The population education program inupper secondary schools was implemented
  in2002-3 andBCC was not introduceduntilMarch-June 2003, after the final DHS survey
  (TFGI and others 2003). Trends inthe sale o f socially marketed condoms andpills support
 this hypothesis (see Figure 4). Over the life o fthe project, condom sales increasedsteadily
 though not as rapidly, while pill sales were fairly flat, on average. But there was a surge in
 the sale o fboth methods the year after the launch o f the B C C campaign in2003, especially
 sales o f the pill. The results might also suggest that entrenchedprovider attitudes are
 difficult to change quickly and/or that within the decentralized family planning infrastructure
 there are still pressures, targets, or provider and client incentives that operate against the new

 womento the denominator, assumingthat they hadno abortionsor MR. This results inanunderestimateof the true TAR,
 but evenmore important, it distortsany trendbecausethe TAR will be affectedby the share of never-marriedwomen inthe
 population. Between 1997 and 2002, this share of never-marriedwomen actually decreased, from 33.5 to 32.0 percent.
 Thus, the increaseinthe TAR reportedinthe DHSis inpartdue to alargershare ofever-marriedwomen in2002. A more
 accurateindicator of the trendamong ever-marriedwomen would be the annualabortion rateper 1,000 ever-marriedwomen
 (TFGI and others 2003).
 33. However, between 1997 and 2000, the share o f proceduresfor which ahealthproblemwas reportedrose from 33 to 48
 percent, and the increase in healthproblems was particularly great for MRs (29 to 47 percent,Annex TableD.8). This could
 indicatethat practitionersneedadditional training on sterile procedures. The share of those reporting aprocedureandwho
 sought medicaladvice or treatmentincreaseddramatically, from 17to 69 percent, but the sample size i s small. This could
 indicatean increaseinserious complicationsor, alternatively, better counseling o f clients and greater access to health
 care. This is an area warranting urgent analysis.
 34. A study inCao Bang andNinhBinhprovinces in2000 foundthat more than 90 percent of women presentingfor
 abortionsor MRare not given pregnancytests (Anh andDzung 2002).

 approach. The final evaluation report attributed the lack o f change inmethod mix to
 continued highcommitment byproviders to the IUD.

4.14      A secondhypothesis is that some o fthe impact o fthe project has beenmissed
because contraceptive use and abortion were not monitored among unmarried women, who
were roughly a third o f all women 15-49 inboth DHSS.~~                          A recent survey o fpremarital
sexual activity among individuals married duringthree different time periods - 1963-71,
1977-85, and 1992-2000- showed clear increases over time inthe percent o fmen and
women engaging inpre-marital sex, inseven provinces inthe Red River Delta and six
provinces and Ho Chi MinhCity inthe Mekong Delta (Ghuman and others 2005). Inthe
Red River Delta, premarital sex among menrose from 7 to 13 to 31percent inthese three
cohorts, reaching levels inthe MekongDelta. Among women, they rose from 0.5 to 12
percent inthe Red River Delta and from 3 to 8 percent inthe Mekong Delta between the first
andlast cohort. Unfortunately, there are no trend data on sexualbehavior among the
unmarried over the life o f the project. A survey o f adolescent behavior conducted in 1999 in
six provinces found that 10 percent o f males and 5 percent o f females age 15-22 had
engaged inpremarital sex before the age o f 21 (Mensch and others 2003). InL a i Chau,
QuangNinh, and KienGiangprovinces, the figure for young women was 8-9 percent. More
recently, a survey o f young adults 15-24 in Gialam, a suburb o f Hanoi, found that 17.1
percent o f males and 4.5 percent o f females had ahd premarital sex (Le and others 2006).
This is a group withpotentially highdemand for effective yet reversible modemmethods,


35. Indeed,in2002,96 percent ofwomen 15-19and 52 percentofwomen 20-24were unmarried. None ofthe previous
demographicsurveys (1988 DHS, 1992/93LSS, 1997198LSS, 1994Inter-CensalDemographicSurvey, ICDS) collected
contraceptiveuse for never-marriedwomen.

                                                                       17


 like the pill, and for whom contraceptive failure i s highlylikely to lead to MR or abortion.
 Estimates o f the percentage o f abortions and MR accounted for by unmarried women range
 from 10-30 percent, but the true level i s uncertain because social stigma often leads
 unmarried women to lie about their marital status (Goodkind 1994, DHS Final Report 2002).

 4.15       Ifone impact oftheproject was to raisemoderncontraceptiveuse amongunmarried
 couples, we might expect to see a decline inabortions and MR inthat group. Indeed, the
 numbero fabortions and MRreported from the public health system for all women (married
 and unmarried) declined byhalf over the life o f the PFHP, incontrast to the constant
 abortiodMR rate for ever-married women (EMW, see Figure 5). The results are not
 definitive evidence o f a decline inabortiodMR among never-married women, however,
 since a switch indemand from public to private providers o f abortion and MRwould produce
 a similar effect.36

36. Unfortunately, the DHSdidnot ask women where obtained an abortion or MR, so it is not possible to assess the extent
to which this decline represents a switch to private providers. Another factor that could leadto this decline inpublic sector
abortions i s increased use o f emergency contraception, which is available inpharmacies.

 Enhancethe NCPFP's Management,Planning, and PolicyFormulationCapabilities

 4.16      The project aimed to strengthen the management, planning and policy formulation
 skills o f the staff o f the NCPFP and its provincial, district, and commune committees
 primarily through improvedtraining o f staff and implementation o f a Management
 Information System (MIS) to monitor activities.

 4.17      Itis difficult to assess the extent to which this objective was a~hieved.~'There were
 no baseline measurements taken o fNCPFP management capacities at any level. The
 indicator proposed inthe S A R - a 13-point "management information score" -was never
 constructed and inany event focused only on monitoring o f deliverables, not management
 capacity (World Bank 1995, p. 82-83).

      Bythe time o fthe MTR, management training hadbeenprovidedto 10,000 commune-
      level population workers and 1,200 district population ~ t a f f . 'The Final Evaluation
                                                                                            ~
     Report notes that planningcapacity at the national andprovincial level improved steadily
      over the life o f the project, with provincial plans "increasingly more practical andbetter
     tailored to the needs o f the individual provinces." (TFGI and others 2003, p. 20).
     However, district-level planning capacity was not much affected.

 0   One o fthe major vehicles for improvingmanagement andplanning -the M I S -was
     never implemented. Thus, to the extent that management andplanning capacity
     improved, it cannot be attributed to the project's MIS.

     Evidence that management improved decision-making through the use o f information
     generated by monitoring and evaluation activities -notably the two national DHSs as
     well as the evaluations o f many individual project activities -i s weak.39 The 1997 DHS
     "baseline" results were not available untilthe MTR. They were usedto define the
     baseline and targets. It is not clear whether other information from the survey fed into
     programmatic decision-making. The 2002 DHS was conducted with enough lead time to
     use for project evaluation purposes a year later, so was not timed to help fine-tune the
     program. A planned mid-term survey was not conducted. The "Campaign on
     Reproductive Health Services for Disadvantaged Areas" was expanded nationwide before
     it was evaluated- a missed opportunity to learn and improve.

0    The FinalEvaluationReport highlightsimprovements inNCPFP capacity to conduct and
     use research results, but notes that: "the PMUwas challenged by poor capacity among
     PPMUstaff to define their research needs."(p. 18)



     ____~

37. The performance o f the PMU-which is not includedinthe assessment o f this objective - is discussed inthe
"Borrower's performance" section o f the ratings.
38. The coverage o f these training programs i s not documented inthe Final Evaluation Report, nor are results presented to
document their effectiveness.

39. According to TFGI and others (2003), evaluations were conducted of: the impact o f IEC on targeted population groups;
health care training activities; the national AIDS program; training activities for local population and family planning staff;
and the reproductive health services campaign for difficult areas.

                                                              19


      There is very little evidence to document improvement instrategy development over the
      life o f the project. The initial emphasis was on service delivery, not on strategy, and
      there were major difficulties inobtaining the expertise to develop and implement the new
     BCC strategy, leading to its adoption very late inthe project.

 Expandthe KnowledgeBasefor Policy/TechnicalGuidelines

 4.18      The PFHP significantly expanded the knowledge base for improving policy and
 developing technical guidelines, particularly with respect to the two national demographic
 surveys and the community-based HIV/AIDS prevention activity launched toward the end o f
 the project. Pilot studies were carried out inall o f the areas indicated inthe SAR, most
 costing less than $0.4 million. The NCPFP didnot find them to be sufficiently cost-effective
to scale-up to the provincial level, but understandingwhat doesn't work does expand the
knowledge base.40So the knowledge based was infact expandedby these efforts. However,
there i s a compelling and urgent needfor deeper analysis o f existing demographic and FP/RH
data and improvedtechnical design o f action-oriented research.

4.19       The 1997 and2002 DHS provided essential information on demographic trends -
which were found to be changing more rapidly than expected - and the continued high
persistence o f abortion and traditional methods. A major shortcoming is that the surveys
neglected to collect information on unmarried women, who constituted a third o f women o f
reproductive age and a group that was greatly influenced byrapid social and economic
changes. The omission o f recording whether women sought abortions from public or private
providers also limited its usefulness inassessing trends and policy actions. The data could
also have been mined ingreater depth to assess the relationbetween increased availability
and quality o f services and their use, particularly among the poor. There has been scant
analysis o f the impact o f increased availability, quality on use o f services by the poor, ethnic
minorities and those inremote locations.

4.20      The community-based HIV/AIDS prevention activities launched in2002 provided
important experience for design o f the follow-on World Bank financed HIV/AIDS
PreventionProject ($38.5 million). Because the activities were launched so late inthe
project, only a baseline survey was conducted inthe 7 provinces. However these results
were disseminated promptly to program managers before the end o f the project. Further, the
design, which focused on reducing transmission in"hot spots", closely paralleled the ADB-
financed pilot infive provinces, which was evaluated and found successful inraising condom
use (see Box 2). The model provided experience with peer approaches to counseling and
educating intravenous drug users and sex workers about risk reduction; it also developed                               '

guidelines for voluntary counseling and testing.41

4.21      Incontrast, muchless was learnedfrom the IntegratedFWCampaigns for Remote
Areas, which were expanded nationwide without rigorous evaluation. Given their scope and
scale, one cannot conclude that the campaigns were pilot efforts to buildthe knowledge base


40. Many o f the study reports were only available inVietnamese, so the quality of the reports could not be assessed.
41. The pilot areas also received laboratory equipment and training for HIV testing by provincial health personnel.

                                                           20


 for policy/technical guidelines. Concerns were expressed with respect to: whether
 mobilization for sterilization and treatment for STIs would encourage the free and informed
 choice o f method by FP clients; the efficacy ofmass vs. syndromic treatment for STIs; the
 extent to which the campaigns strengthen or detract fi-om regular service delivery; whether
 patient follow-up for side-effects, complications, and identified high-risk cases can be
 assured; whether this mode o f delivery i s cost-effective relative to alternatives; and whether
 this approach could be sustained by government over the long run.


 Box 2. Focusing on "hot spots" to reduce HIV transmission
 The PFHP supportedexpansionto 7 additional provinces o f an approach launchedthrough the parallelADB
 "Community Action for Prevention HIV/AIDS Project" in5 provinces. These efforts supported HIV prevention
 in"hot spot" situations andgroups where transmission is mostlikelyto occur -street-based female sex workers
 (FSW), karaoke-based sex workers, injecting drug users (IDU),migrant construction workers and traders, long-
 distance truck drivers, fishermen, sailors, and people livingwith HIViAIDS (PLWHA). Interventions included
 peer education, STI treatment, condompromotion, harmreduction activities (for IDU), and voluntary
 counseling and testing (VCT).

 An evaluation o fthe activities inthe five ADB-supportedprovinces found substantial increases inconsistent
 (100%) condomuse incommercial sex from 2002-2004: among street-based FSW with non-regular partners
 from 18 to 58 percent; among IDUfrom 22 to 54 percent; and among migrant workers from 28 to 67 percent.
Prevalence o f gonorrhea andor chlamydia declined from 20 to 11percent among FSW.a However, the
prevalence o f syphilis and needle-sharing behaviors were not muchchanged. And although condom use more
than doubled to about 60 percent among PLWHA who frequented FSW, more than 90 percent o f PLWHA had
contact with FSW at both the baseline and final survey.

a. The evaluation also monitored changes inHIV prevalence in these groups. However, since both mortality and out-
migration from these groups can affect HIV prevalence trends, the latter is not a useful indicator o f the trend innew HIV
infections, which i s the objective of the project.

5.        Ratings

Outcome

5.1       The project's overall outcome rating i s moderately satisfactory based on the
relevance o f each o f the project's objectives and efficacy and efficiency at meeting them.
The ratings are summarized by objective inTable 2.

5.2      Relevance. The first two o f the project's objectives remain highly relevant.
Reduction o f the rate o f population growth has continued to be a highpriority o f the
Government and the Bank for reasons o f economic growth andpoverty reduction, gender
considerations related to women's choice, and reduction o f the rate of environmental
degradation. While the Government's objective to reach replacement fertility levels by 2005
has been achieved, the plateau inuse o f modem contraceptive methods and continued high
reliance on traditional methods and abortion indicate the need to increase the utilization,
quality and range o f modem FP services. The third and fourth objectives remain
substantially relevant. Effectivelyresponding to rapidly changing needs, especially with

                                                               21


 greater decentralization, requires continued strengthening o f the NCPFP's management
 capabilities and policy and planning formulation at all levels. The need for developing new
 and more targeted public and private sector approaches to FP/RH for sub-populations such as
 adolescents and those living inpoor urbanand remote areas remains.

5.3        Efficacy. Based on the analysis inthe previous chapter, the project was substantially
efJicacious inimprovingthe quality andrange o f FP/RH services, increasing the utilization o f
RHservices, enhancingthe NCPFP's capacities inpolicy, planning andmanagement.
capacity, and generating new knowledge. However, efficacy was negligible interms o f
raising use o f modem contraception among married women, shifting the method mix to
temporary and highly effective modern methods, and reducing recourse to abortion.42 The
neglect o f addressing the needs o f adolescents and unmarried couples was a missed
opportunity to enhance the efficacy o f the program inmeeting its overall objectives.

5.4        Efficiency. The project was substantially efficient inincreasing the utilization o f RH
services and inincreasing the quality and range o fFP/RH services overall, particularly with
respect to the savings for civil works and equipment due to competitive biddingand the
widespread investments intraining. Allocative efficiency was enhanced to the extent that the
project focused on improvingthe quality o f basic PHC services inrural and remote areas,
where they can be provided more cost-effectively than through expansion o f hospital
services. An important caveat is that the basic design o f the CHC improvements was not
well tuned to local needs and led to sub-optimal allocations o f space. Ultimately, the model
supported was less than the national standard adopted toward the end o f the project. There
were, thus, unnecessary technical inefficiencies introduced through the limited variability in
construction design and equipment "packages" and a "blanket" geographic approach that
would not have targeted specific project expenditures to areas o f greatest need.



42. As notedearlier, there is a strongpossibility that overall moderncontraceptiveuse, including use of modemtemporary
methods, might have increasedinthe population of all women o freproductive age (including unmarriedwomen),
particularly in light of the sharp declinein the reportednumberof abortions inpublic facilities. However, without other
corroboratingevidence that this is the case, IEGconcludes that the efficacy of the FP objectiveswas modest.

                                                  22


 5.5     The efficiency with which the remaining objectives were achieved was modest. While
 support for social marketing o f the pill and involvement o f the private sector improved
 efficiency over a purelypublic-sector approach, the lag indemand generation activities and
 the neglect o f adolescents untillate inthe project, the scant efforts to promote injectables,
 andthe lack o f attentionto unmarried women's FP/RHneeds are evidence ifimportant
 inefficiencies. The repeated difficulties indeveloping and implementing the M I S suggest
 that the efficiency o f efforts to enhance the NCPFP's capabilities inpolicy, planning and
 management were also modest. Finally, the nation-wide expansion o f RHcampaigns before
 evaluation o f their design and impacts, problems inorienting pilot research toward
 programmatic priorities, the omission o f unmarried women and adolescents from the two
 DHSs, and lack of analysis o f the relation between improved services and their use, using
 those data, suggest that the efficiency o f expanding the knowledge base was modest as well.


 Sustainability

 5.6     The sustainability o fproject activities and achievements i s rated as likely. The
 probability o f project activities being sustained administratively is high.FP and RH continue
 to be priorities o f the Government. The project supported new programmatic efforts -
 HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment o f STIs, and FP/RH/STIeducation for adolescents at upper
 secondary schools -that will be continued by the government or with donor financing.
 Economic growth, urbanization, and increased education will contribute to a sustained
 demand for small families, birthspacing, and women's interest inreproductive health
 services, and the services that support them. Withrespect to financial sustainability, the total
recurrent costs o f the project activities are estimated at US$17 million, representing 5.2
percent o f the NCPFP budget (for the RHcampaigns) and 2.6 percent o f the MOHbudget
(for maintenance). Assuming the economy o f Vietnam continues the growth trends o f the
previous 10 years these levels o f additional recurrent costs will likely be sustainable. After
the end o f the PFHP, the NCPFP provided limited financing to DKT to continue the social
marketing effort. DKT's marketing efforts are now financed solely from sales revenue, with
the continued donation o fproduct from Germany. A Vietnamese firm is working inajoint
venture with the Germanfirm donating the cycles to produce them within Vietnam.

InstitutionalDevelopment

5.7      The institutional development impact o f the project, considering both public and
private sector inputs, i s rated as substantial.

5.8     Public Sector: The project substantially changed both the scope o f activities within
the NCPFPand they way that they are done. It developed the capacity o f the NCPFP and
other levels o f FP institutions to supplyFPRH services that were previously (and
subsequently) the responsibility o f the MOH. As was the case for projects inother sectors,
the project introduced the practice o f competitive bidding and contracting for services at the
national andprovinciallevel. The HIV/AIDS model developed inthe last years o f the
project set the course for emphasis on efficient, highly targeted approaches for HIV
prevention that was adopted inthe HIV/AIDS Prevention Project. The mechanisms for a
continued program o f operational research were put inplace, although those mechanisms

                                                              23


  were not always followed43andthere is a continued need to ensure that these activities
  address programmatically relevant and high-priority issues.

  5.9      Private Sector: Aside from investment inexpanding social marketing o fthe pill and
 piloting o f private physicians associations inone province, institutional development for the
 private delivery o f population and family health services was weak, even as this share o f the
 market was expanding dramatically. More could have been invested inunderstanding the
 capacity and barriers o f private sector delivery o f temporary modern methods and o f the
 quality o f privately provided FP/RH services (including abortion andMR), as a basis for
  strengtheninginstitutional development relative to the private sector.


 Bank Performance

 5.10      The Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory, based on assessments o f quality at
 entry and supervision.

 5.1 1     Quality at entvy: The quality at entry o fthe PFHPwas satisfactory, though with some
 major shortcomings. Early Bank experience with significant implementation delays with the
 PEP should have ledto a simplified project designandmodest expectations for initial
 implementationprogress and disbursements. Instead, the project design was comprehensive,
 geographically dispersed and thus inherently complex. Early training inBankprocurement
 procedures for staff inthe PMUresulted infar fewer delays inimplementation than
 experienced bythe PEP. But the project's activities were over-budgeted; the team should
 have anticipated the considerable savings from competitive biddingbased on the experience
 o f the PEP and either scaled back the resource requirements or programmed the additional
 funds based on an analysis o fprogrammatic priorities andtheir cost-effective use.

 5.12     The project design included components to address both demand- and supply-side
 factors affecting FPIRHoutcomes, and recognized the need to target poor women and ethnic
minorities. However, important policy issues were overlooked. For example, changing the
method mix was treated as a matter o f simply improving client information, increasing the
supply o f temporary methods, and improving the quality o f infrastructure and services.44
There was no analysis inappraisal documents o f the implications on the method mix o f fees
for temporary contraceptive methods, coupled with continued incentives for accepting I U D s
or sterilization, particularly among low-income groups, despite a significant literature
pointingto these issues.45 Inanother example, oral contraceptives were listed as a Toxic B
drug, requiring a physician's prescription for dispensing by a pharmacy. Project design also
didnot address the highprevalence o f sexually transmitted infections or the needto provide
training insterilization o f needles and other medical equipment and proper disposal o f

43. While management of a competitiveprocess for study identificationhadbeen sub-contracted to the Instituteof
Sociology, there was little evidence to suggest that this mechanism was used. Inone case, the NCPFP effectively blocked

 medical waste. Preparation also did not undertake institutional analysis that might have
 allowed better understandingo f the roles o f the NCPFP and the MOHinthe upgrading and
 management o f the health delivery                              Finally, the Bank should have pressed harder
 for a systematic field assessment o f existing infrastructure and equipment prior to embarking
 on renovations and construction inthe PFHP (and NHSP)                                            An initialplanto
 develop all project inputs in5 "pilot" provinces was later dropped infavor o f a plan to
 complete the construction and equipment o f all CHCs inthe first three years o f the project.
 This decision was responsible inpart to the late implementation o fcomponents related to
 IEC/BCC, in-service training, and studies.

 5.13      The decision at the design stage for the NCPFP to manage the provisiono f family
 planning and reproductive health services, including civil works, instead o f the MOH, was
 poorlyjustified and had important negative repercussions for the effectiveness o f the project.
 There i s remarkably little discussion o f the rationale or potential consequences inthe S A R .
 The MOHis responsible for providingthese services and the NCPFPinfact initially
 requested that these elements o f the project be implemented by the MOH. The CHC package
 for the PFHP was identical to that for the NHSP, ina similar number o f provinces, but the
 latter was managedby the M O H ina parallel operation. While the PMU and the NCPFP
 excelled inthis task, the overwhelming effort inthe first years o f the project was on
hardware. The demand-side efforts (like IEC/BCC and in-service training) that were keyto
changing the method mix and reducing reliance on abortion were delayed, many o fthe policy
issues constraining them were never addressed, and inputs like the M I S that are important for
improved management o f population and family planning activities -which is the long-run
responsibility o fthe NCPFPstructure-were                       dropped. Capacity was developed in
procurement and civil works, but following closure ofthe project, responsibility has reverted
back to the MOH.

5.14      Supervision: Overall, supervision was satisfactory. Supervisionmissions worked
closely with the NCPFP to identify solutions to issues inproject implementation and
provided subsequent follow-up. They were facilitated by highcontinuity o f the Bank TTL,
who changed only once ineight years. The Resident Mission provided continued guidance
assistance on Bank procurement requirements and important adaptations were made at the
MTRto adapt the project to changing government strategy. Inthree areas, supervision could
have been improved. First, early supervision missions focused on the level andrate o f
financial disbursement at the expense o f technical issues.

5.15      Second, the substantial savings early inthe project coupled with the decision not to
continue the drug supply sub-component ledto a continuous process o f reallocation o f funds,
often to new activities and an expanded number o f provinces. This raised the complexity o f
the project over time and ensured that even after the initial packages o f civil works and
equipmentwere provided, a focus on hardware andhow to use up the money (a moving


46. The decision to place the facility upgrading component under the NCPFP rather thanthe MOHwas rationalized by the
Bank inorder to keep implementation o f the comprehensive set o f FP/RH inputstogether. However, the operation and
maintenance o f these facilities i s normally the mandate o f the M O H and similar services to the PFHP were provided by the
M O H for the sister project, the NHSP.
47. A survey o f the facilities in 5 provinces was financed during project preparation, using grant funds (World Bank 1995).

                                                              25


  target) - even if consistent with the project's objectives-would                      continue to divert attention
  from the project's "software" activities, particularly BCC and strengthened management
  capacity. With the benefit o f hindsight, one option at the MTRwould have been to cancel
  that part o f the credit that was surplus, to focus efforts on the software, and to complete the
  project on or ahead o f schedule. Based on internal correspondence, it does not appear that
  this optionwas ever seriously discussed. This mighthave substantially improvedthe
  project's performance with respect to the family planning and capacity improvement
  objectives.

  5.16     Finally, better coordination between the three donors would have substantially
  reduced demands on the PMU. World Bank and ADB supervision missions were being
  coordinated by the end o f the project, but KfW worked directly with the PMU. There was no
  harmonization o fprocedures between the Bank and the ADB - the PMUhadto master both
  organizations' processing rules.


  Borrower Performance

  5.17     Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory, based on the performance o f the
  government and NCPFP/PMU on preparation, implementation, and compliance.

  5.18    Preparation: The Borrower's involvement and contributions duringproject
 preparation were satisfactory. The highlevel o f commitment to the project's objectives was
 reflected instrong ownership throughout the design and implementation phases. Trust funds
 for project preparation were fully utilized. However, the lack o f a baseline inventory o f CHC
 deficiencies and inadequate involvement o f local authorities inproviding feedback on the
 design o f improvements inthe CHC ledthe project to invest insub-optimal improvements in
 civil works insome cases.

 5.19     Implementation: Overall, implementation performance was satisfactory. The
 implementation schedule developed by the Borrower and the Bankproved overly ambitious
 duringthe early phases o fthe project. Additionally, delays were inherent inthe political
 system inVietnam (for example, the lengthytime for MOF approvals) and there was high
 turnover o f PMUstaff due to low wages, a problemnot reconciled until late inthe
 implementation. These delays led to unsatisfactory project performance ratings from
 September 1996 to December 1997. The initial heavy central control over project activities
 evolved into more decentralized management through the PPMUs.

 5.20     Component 4 receivedunsatisfactory project component ratings from June 1997
 through November 2000. With the exception o f the DHSs, the NCPFP relied almost entirely
 on Vietnamese technical assistance for the conduct ofthe pilot                                Greater use o f
 complementary international technical assistance inthe design o f the pilot studies might have
 facilitated the transfer o f knowledge and skills related to action-oriented research. It is

budgeted inthe S A R to support the conduct of the pilots and studies was actually used.

                                                                  26


 unclear what efforts were taken on the part o f the Borrower to ensure that women inthe RH
 campaigns inunderserved areas were fully informed o f their contraceptive

 5.21        Nevertheless, the leadership andwork effort o f the PMUand its staff was
 exceptional. The project management structure was clear and the PMUdirector was highly
 capable andremainedwith the PMUthrough the life o f the project. Aggressive use o f
 competitive biddingfor construction resulted insignificant savings, which were used to
 renovate more CHCs thanwere originally planned.50 The NCPFP was proactive at
 suggesting priority uses for reallocating funds, and these reallocations often further increased
 the complexity o f activities. Despite initial delays andthe constant changes inthe number
 activities and expansion o f their geographical coverage, the Borrower spent 99 percent o f the
 credit with only a three-month extension o fthe closing date.

 5.22        Compliance: The PFHP credit included 22 covenants. The Government complied
 with all o fthem, althoughthree covenants relating to baseline studiedsurveys or studies o f
 drug financindtargeted free provisionwere fulfilled after the June 1997covenant date.
 Three other covenants related to scaling-up specific pilot studies were only partially met in
that the pilot efforts were carried out but some that were found to be not particularly cost-
effective were nevertheless taken to scale, Overall, compliance was satisfactory.

Monitoring andEvaluations1

5.23        The M&Edesign called for monitoring of outcomes through three national
population-based surveys -baseline, mid-term, and end-of-project - and tracking o f project
outputs. However, the S A R didnot anticipate the need to account for: (a) other socio-
economic factors affecting the demand for children and thus family planning and
reproductive health services; (b) service delivery outputs innon-project provinces (which
were influenced by NHSP and parallel government investments); and (c) the availability and
price o f FP/RHservices inthe private sector, where demand has been growing fastest. In
light o fthe emphasis o fthe project onimprovingprovider-client interactions (by more
counseling on other methods) andthe longstanding role o f various financial and non-
financial provider and client incentives for adopting different methods, it is surprising that
the M&E strategy did not include any type o f qualitative monitoring o f client-provider
exchanges. Finally, there were no baseline or final indicators (beyond outputs) to measure
outcomes for the objectives o f improving the management, planning, and policy formulation
capacity o f the NCPFP and expanding the knowledge




49. Principles of informed choiceshouldbe included in IEC/BCC training and supportedby supervisionas well as included
as part ofprint andradio/TV media spots on FPiRH subjects.

50. The NCPFPwas able to completeCHC constructionand at a lower cost than the same facilities under the NHSP of the
MOH.
51. This sectionevaluates the designand implementationof the project's monitoring and evaluation (M&E). However, IEG
does not yet formally rate it.

52. This i s indicative of alack o f specificity inthe project design of exactly inwhat dimensionscapacityneededto be built,
which would have been strengthenedby an institutional assessment and baselinesurvey during project preparation.

                                                           27


 5.24      Inimplementingthe M&Edesign, there were both successes andshortcomings. Two
 national DHSs were conducted to measure baseline and end-of-project outcomes. The
 questionnaires were identical, improvingthe comparability o f results over time. However,
 the baseline survey didnot occur until 1997, a year after project effectiveness, with results
 forthcoming only shortly before the mid-term review in 1999. This revealed that many
 demographic targets set at the beginningo fthe project hadbeen surpassed as the project was
 beinglaunched, leading to revisedtargets. The mid-term survey that mighthave pointed to
 successful and problem areas was not fielded. The final DHS was timed to produce results to
 feed into the completion report. BothDHSswere deficient inexcluding unmarried women
 from the sample and collecting insufficient information on private sources o f contraception,
 RHservices, and abortion.

 5.25     Inanalysis of the DHS,the approach o fusing "non-project provinces" as the
 counterfactual was fundamentally flawed, inlight o f similar investments beingmade by the
 NHSP and government inthese provinces and the fact that many o f the PFHP interventions
 were national inscope. Furthermore, the project provinces were selected based on specific
 characteristics, which affect not only their baseline outcomes but the rate o fimprovement in
outcomes relative to other provinces. These issues might have been addressed inthe final
 evaluationby multivariate analysis o f contraceptive and RHservice use, controlling for
individual characteristics and access to and quality o f services, and usingboth the 1997 and
2002 data. However, this apparently was not done. Although the emphasis o f the project was
on improving the access to and use by disadvantaged groups, including ethnic minorities, the
poorest o f the poor, andpeople inremote areas, neither o f the evaluation reports (TFGI and
others 2003, World Bank 2004) mined the available data to show that outcomes had
improved for these groups. The available data were thus under-exploited and could have
been usedwith far greater effect to improve the project. 53

5.26      With respect to other dimensions o fthe project's M&E design, a number o f
individual project activities were evaluated inthe course o f the project. Evaluation o f several
o f the models piloted as part o f the fourth component revealed that they were not cost-
effective. They were not scaled up as a result, which indicates that insome instances
evaluation results were usedto improve decision-making. Baseline data for the seven
HIV/AIDS provinces were also used to inform subsequent program design. However, the
Reproductive Health Campaign model was scaled up rapidly, nation-wide and at great
expense without evaluating early efforts.

5.27      Finally, the MIS, which was to be used to track outputs and serve as a planning tool,
was dropped from the project. It could have providedinformationto inform supervisory
review o f technical issues inproject implementation. Inits absence, there is little evidence o f
a consistent effort to monitor and evaluate the project outputs against project design.




53. Analysis of the 1997-98 VLSS, which includedfertility and contraceptive use as well as manymore socioeconomic
variablesthan the DHS, could also have helpedto inform population and family planning activities during the life of the
project.

  6.      Lessons

 6.1      Over the period 1996-2003, Vietnam's demographic transition continued as fertility
 dropped below replacement levels. Infant mortality may also have declined, but the data are
 not precise enough. The commitment o f the government to the national population policy
 and demographic objectives remained consistently highthroughout this period, with multiple
 policies ineffect to promote continued fertility decline. Investments by the PFHP and other
 government programs raised the quality o f family and reproductive health services, which,
 coupled with other socioeconomic developments inVietnam, contributed to increases intheir
 use. However, it is not clear whether these improvements disproportionately reached the
 poor and ethnic minorities, as was intended, and some o f the other objectives o f the PFHP,
 particularly those concerning the family planning method mix and reduction inabortion,
 were elusive. A number o f lessons emerge from the experience o f the PFHP which may
 inform future operations inVietnam and elsewhere, both for population and family planning
 activities and for improving the effectiveness o fprograms more generally.

 6.2     Effortsto raise contraceptiveuse andimprovemethodmix needto: (a) take into
 accountpre-existingincentives,sanctions, andtargetswithin the populationprogram
 that maynot be compatiblewith this objective; and(b) ensure that demand-generating
 activities and other "software" investmentsproceedinparallelwith efforts to improve
 physicalaccess. The experience o fthe PFHPdemonstrates the difficulty o ftransitioning
 from an approach that emphasized family size limitation- a "one or two child policy",
 backedup by incentives, sanctions, and targets - to one oriented toward reproductive health
 andfree choice o f contraceptive method. Insuch an environment, increasing the supply o f
 alternative contraceptive methods, improving information to clients, and providingbetter
 training for FP staff alone are necessary but not sufficient to overcome deeply entrenched
 attitudes andmisconceptions by both providers and the public.

 6.3     Populationpolicy andfamily planningprogramsincountriesundergoingthe
 transitionto a market economy needto adapt to the increasingrole of the privatesector
 as a service provider. The potential complementarities and comparative advantages o f the
public andprivate sectors need to be exploited, while appropriate regulations andpolicies
need to be put inplace to ensure the quality o fboth. Future surveys inVietnam urgently
need to collect data on the availability, quality, anduse o f private, as well as govemment-
financed reproductive and family health services.54

6.4      Itis criticallyimportantthat populationandreproductivehealthprograms
reachout to unmarriedyoung adults,inorder to promotehighly effectivetemporary
methodsofbirth control, preventunwantedpregnancyand recourseto abortion, and
preventHIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted disease. There was an increased
emphasis and reorientation o f Vietnam's population program on adolescent reproductive
health and new investments inHIV/AIDS prevention toward the end o f the PFHP. The focus


54. Ina similar vein, it will be important to obtain more information about the demand for abortiodMR,
including whether the woman had a pregnancy test prior to the procedure, the number o f weeks since the last
period, whether the procedure was performedby a public or private provider, the type o f institution, any out-of-
pocket costs associated with the procedure, and post-procedure counseling on contraceptive methods.

                                                         29


  o f the program almost exclusively on married couples inthe 1990s was a missed opportunity
 to improve reproductive outcomes among young adults andto understand their unmet need
 for family planning.55

 6.5        The effort to improveinstitutionalperformancecan be underminedby lack of
 institutionalanalysis,weak articulationof institutionalobjectives,mis-identificationof
 the mainconstraintsfor improvement,and omissionof appropriateindicatorsto
 measure success. IEG's 1999evaluation of the World Bank's population, health, and
 nutrition support world-wide found that completion o fphysical objectives is often high,but
 performance on institutional and capacity objectives i s much weaker.56 Inthe case o f the
 PFHP, the objectives for capacity buildingo fthe NCPFP were not articulated interms o f
 performance, but rather interms o f training and other inputs. It wasn't clear what the desired
 outcome would be or how one could know whether it hadbeen reached. Further, the effort to
 re-orient the family planningprogram toward a reproductive health approach represented an
 institutional reform o f the way that things are done, notjust at the national level, but for
 committees on population and family planningat the provincial, district, and commune
 levels. Institutional analysis duringproject preparationmight have ledto a more accurate
 assessment o f the constraints underlying current performance.

 6.6        In order to attributechangesin outcomesto publicpolicy,programsneedto
 document their inputs and outputsover time andto monitor other factors outsideof the
 programthat plausiblycould account for those outcomes. Inthe case o f the PFHP,
 monitoring o fhealth and population outcomes was achieved through the two DHSs, but
 inputsandoutputs were not well tracked, nor were other factors (like individual
 socioeconomic status or the availability o f private services) that might have influenced the
 phenomenal fertility decline and increase inuse o f RHservices over the life o f the project.
Lackingthis information, one cannot be certain that continued fertility decline and the
increaseduse o f family health services inVietnam was infact due to improved service
quality, as opposedto increases ineducation and family income.




55. Future population-based demographic and health surveys should ensure that all women are questioned on
fertility, sexual behavior, contraceptive use, and pregnancy termination, including women who are not currently
married. Male sexual behavior and contraceptive use also deserves much greater study.

Notes. a. The national IMR i s measuredover the 5 years precedingthe survey, while for project provincesit is measured
over the 10years precedingthe survey because o f sample size limitations. The national IMRcalculatedover the 10years
beforethe DHSwas 34.511000 in 1997and24.8/1000 in2002. b. The target was a 30 percent declinefrom an initial value
of 0.54, measuredinthe 1997DHS.C. The TAR i s computedover the five years beforethe survey, so the statistic for 2002
i s actually an average for 1997-2001(i.e., during, not at the end of the project) and for 1997the average for 1992-96, five
years before the project.

Note. a. The availability of methodsfrom field workers andmobile clinics is basedon reportsby a community informant,
andwas not confirmedwith the providers of sources. .Accessto acommunity-basedworker was virtually universalinboth
1997and2002 (not shown), as was access to aFP fieldworker inthe community. However, access to mobile FP clinicswas
considerablylower in all areas and provinces, thoughinrural areas this could have been as the result of greater reliance on
availability of services at CHCs. b. Health services data are the same for all women in a sample cluster. As aresult o fthe
relatively small numbero findependentobservationsat the cluster level (see the last row of the table), these estimates have
relatively large samplingvariance.

 Notes: a. The absolute increase in the contact rate is exaggerated by changes inthe way that the data were collected in 1993
 and 1998. The 1993 VLSS asked only about use o fhealth care for an illness in the preceding 4 weeks and only a single
 contact for that illness, while the 1998 VLSS asked about all use o f health care inthe past 4 weeks, without conditioning on
 an illness. Ifthe 1993 conditions are imposed on the 1998 data, the overall contact rate (public and private) for 1998 is 4.35
per capita, an increase inthe service contact rate o f29 percent. Ofinterest here is that the CHC contact rate approached the
public contact hospital rate (despite the fact that rising incomes mighthave led an even larger share o f the populationto
 consult public hospitals) and that the CHC contact rates increased the most inthe lowest quintiles (represented by the
bottom quintile).

 Annex E.Borrower Comments

 June 23,2006

 Ingeneral, the Report is very careful inall aspects oftheproject with a lot o f supporting data
 and figures from various surveys. Ihave some comments as follows:

 Page 6, para 2.7: You think that the program inVietnam has strong incentives: We do not
 call it incentives, as inthe true sense, it i s not incentive at all. As you know, each collaborator
 gets 20.000 VNWmonth ($1.SO), just a pack o f sweets for their children when they come
 home. The calculation o f the budgetbased on targets o f acceptors i s the right thing ina very
 poor country with very limitedrecourse while the birthrate at that time was still very high.

 Page 11, para 4.4, dot 3: The last sentence: However, none of the essential drugs was
 available at all CHCs: Ido notfully understand this sentence, because, you wrote that 90%
 o f CHCs had 7 o f the 20 drugs.

Page 12, para 4.6: You compared New Choice at price o f 1,000 NVD and another pill at
 50,000 NVD inthe free market. Idon't really understandthis comparison. One is a
 subsidized price for poor people, the other i s for the rich ones. Therefore, you should write
something to clarify to show out the true nature o f the price difference.

Page 13, para 4.7: There is no roomfor staffhousing: all staff inCHCs are living inthe
communities, why do they need housing?

Page 21, para 5.3: FP services and modern methods; outcome is unsatisfactory: Ifyou
compare DHS 1997 and 2002, you can see a bigrise inoral pills and condoms and a decline
inIUD; this is anachievement innationalprogrambecause for many years, the programin
Vietnam has been regarded as a one method program. So Ipropose the outcome i s modest.

Page 22, para 5.5: Finally, the nation wide expansion of R H campaigns without evaluation of
their design and impacts: We had a very serious evaluation o f these campaigns done by an
independent agency, sent it to the government, made it a standard and now, they have
become a government means to provide services to people inthe difficult areas. We
regarded this model as the most successful. It sustained interms o f continuing supported by
the Government as well as the support from the poor people.
