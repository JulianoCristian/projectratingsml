Population and Family Health\n            Project (PFHP) for Vietnam. This report is based on the\n            Implementation Completion Report for the project, legal\n            documents and project files, and discussions with Bank staff\n            involved in the project. The ratings of the PPAR generally\n            concur with the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            ratings, except in the following instances : outcome (ICR\n            satisfactory, PPAR moderately satisfactory); borrower\n            performance (ICR highly satisfactory, PPAR satisfactory). A\n            number of lessons emerged form the experience of the PFHP\n            which may inform future operations in Vietnam and elsewhere,\n            both for population and family planning activities and for\n            improving the effectiveness of programs more generally. Some\n            of those lessons are : population policy and family planning\n            in countries undergoing the transition to a market economy\n            need to adapt to the increasing role of the private sector\n            as a provider. It is critically important that population\n            and the reproductive health programs reach out to unmarried\n            young adults, in order to promote highly effective temporary\n            methods of birth control, prevent unwanted pregnancy and\n            recourse to abortion, and prevent HIV/AIDS and other\n            sexually transmitted disease. In order to attribute changes\n            in outcome to public policy, programs need to document their\n            inputs and outputs over time and to monitor other factors\n            outside of the program that plausibly could account for\n            those outcomes."}, "docdt": "2006-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
