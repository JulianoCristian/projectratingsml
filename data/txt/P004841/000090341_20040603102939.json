was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was highly satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that the project addressed issues held in\n            high priority by the country, and was therefore backed by\n            strong political will. The project was designed as a well\n            coordinated package of hardware and software including civil\n            works, equipment, drugs, training, Behavioral Change\n            Communications (BCC), special campaigns, etc. The project\n            management structure was clear with clear lines of\n            authority, accountability, and procedures. The members from\n            the various ministries and agencies represented in the\n            Committee were heavily involved in project preparation, so\n            they understood it well and could implement it effectively.\n            There was a high level of ownership and transparency from\n            the communes upwards. This empowered local people to manage\n            the project, although the project design required the Center\n            to play a directive role. The Committee and the Project\n            Management Unit (PMU) were flexible in their planning,\n            needed to respond to the country's rapidly changing\n            needs and circumstances between the beginning of project\n            preparation in 1993 to the end of the project in 2002."}, "docdt": "2004-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
