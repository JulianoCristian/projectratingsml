The\n            project's objectives were to expand beef and milk\n            production so as to enable Uruguay to increase meat exports,\n            to substitute domestically produced dairy products for\n            imports, and help the Government to improve sector policies.\n            The strategy used for meeting project objectives was to: (a)\n            step up pasture production through use of phosphates\n            fertilizer and better seeds; (b) improve ranch and farm\n            management by constructing fences, water points, and cattle\n            handling facilities; and (c) initiate product\n            diversification on small-scale farm holdings. The\n            quantitative assessment of the impact of credit projects is\n            traditionally difficult, but the more so in this case for\n            two reasons: (a) although there is a project monitoring unit\n            with an excellent data base of relevant records on a sample\n            basis, it is too early to evaluate the effects of on-ranch\n            project investment on technical coefficients and production;\n            and (b) the country's sector policies have been\n            unstable and changes occurred in the international beef\n            markets upon which Uruguay depends, and which had an impact\n            on the sector difficult to quantify."}, "docdt": "1982-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
