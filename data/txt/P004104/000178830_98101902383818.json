for the Masan Region serving jointly the cities of Masan,\n            Changwon and Jinhae. At the time of the project completion\n            in 1985 the total population benefitting from improved water\n            service is projected to be 3.4 million. The beneficiaries\n            include the urban poor in these cities. The project would\n            also support the Government's efforts to improve the\n            organization and coordination of the sector as well as to\n            increase capability of institutions: at the national level\n            where the Water Resources Bureau of MOC would receive\n            assistance and training in project planning and\n            implementation; at the regional level where three cities\n            under this project would jointly build and manage source\n            works for more efficient water utilization; and at the local\n            level where individual city water bureaus would receive\n            technical assistance to improve their financial and\n            management capabilities."}, "docdt": "1981-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
