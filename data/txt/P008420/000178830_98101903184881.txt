1NTERNATIONAL BAN}; FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPIfENT
REPORT AND RECOBThENDATION OF TliE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO TIIE HELLENIC STATE
FOR A GROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $25.0 million to the
Hellenic State for a groundwater development project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourth loan to Greece, and
the first for agricultural development. Two previous loans were made to a
development finance company for industrial lending, and one for education.
The project to be financed under the proposed loan was prepared with assist-
ance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program and presented to the Bank in
September 1970. Appraisal took place in November 1970.
3.        Negotiations were held in Washington from April 21 to 27, 1971.
The Greek delegation was headed by Mr. Papadakis, Director-General, Ministry
of Coordination. It included MIessrs. Vassios and Karavias from that minis-
try, Mrs. Douma and Messrs. Zacharopoulos and Veltas from the Ministry of
Agriculture, and Mr. Coutris from the Greek Embassy in Washington.
4.        Following is a summary statement of loans to Greece as of April 30,
1971:

5.        Disbursements under the two loans to the National Investment Bank
for Industrial Development (NIBID) have progressed satisfactorily. I'he Edu-
cation loan (No. 711 GR) became effective on March 31, 1971.
6.        IFC has made investments in five enterprises in Greece totalling
about $15.3 million. This includes an equity investment in NIBID of $700,000
made in 1965; an equity and loan investment of $600,000 in a fertilizer com-
pany in 1962 (sold in 1970); $5 million in two cement companies in 1965 and
1966; and $9 million in an aluminium company in 1970. No new proposals are
in an advanced state of consideration at present.
7.        The Bank is presently considering a road maintenance project and a
third loan to NIBID.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
Borrower:                                The liellenic State
Amount:                                   The equivalent in various currencies
of $25.0 million.
Purpose:                                  To finance the foreign exchange com-
ponent of a groundwater development
program consisting of the installa-
tion of pumps and construction of
irrigation and drainage facilities
and of farm roads.
Amortization:                             In 20 years including a 5-1/2 year
period of grace, through semi-annual
installments beginning on February 1,
1977 and ending on February 1, 1991.
Interest Rate:                            7-1/4 percent per annum
Commitment Charge:                        3/4 of 1 percent per annum
Estimated Economic Return
on the Project:                         18 percent
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        An appraisal report entitled "Groundwater Development Project -
Creece" (No. PA-83a) is attached.
9.        Agriculture plays a central role in the Creek economy.     In 1970,
it employed 48 percent of the total working population, contributed 20 per-
cent to gross domestic product and accounted for about 53 percent of the



-3-
country's commodity exports. With an annual growth rate of about 4 percent
during the last decade the sector has been lagging behind GDP growth aver-
aging 7 percent.  To a large extent, this slow growth in relation to other
sectors reflects difficulties inlherent in any transition from a traditional
to a modern agriculture.  Farm holdings are small with an average size of
3.3 hectare which, on the average, is fragmented into seven parcels.   Land
consolidation is under way, but has not covered all regions adequately. iiew
cropping patterns are being introduced, particularly with the expansion of
irrigation.
10.       In ttke past, public agricultural investment has largely been di-
rected into irrigation projects, and lias been concentrated on surface irri-
gation which generally hias been more expensive than groundwater irrigation.
Moreover, limited funds were dispersed over too many projects whiclh were
often inadequately prepared, and in many cases not completed. Thie Govern-
ment is now trying to correct this situation by concentrating investments
on high priority projects and also by exploring the less costly tecliaiques
of groundwater irrigation. As the first large-scale groundwater irrigation
scheme, the proposed project would have pivotal importance in future irri-
gation development in Greece.
11.       The Land Reclamation Service (LRS) of the Ministry of Agriculture
would execute the project. It is in clharge of Government-promoted agricul-
tural development throughout Greece, and has a fairly dense network of re-
gional headquarters and local offices. Its regional headquarters in Thessaly
would be mainly responsible for project implementation, wlhile the central
Athens office, besides its supervisory function, would prepare tender docu-
ments, review bids and award contracts. In the interest of speedy project
implementation a senior official of the Athens office would be responsible
for coordinating all field activities with those of other agencies concerned.
LRS has sufficient experience in groundwater development and should be able
to discharge its functions under the project satisfactorily. Its staff,
particularly for design and construction work, would have to be expanded
to meet the needs of the project. A consultant firm with broad experience
in groundwater development would assist in project implementation and the
execution of hydrogeologic studies.
12.       The project would provide irrigation for some 40,000 hectares of
dry farming land in the Tliessaly plain. It would include drilling 1,600
deep wells for production and 35 wells for exploration, installing pumps
and electric motors, irrigation pipes, distribution canals, and sprinkler
units, and constructing farm roads and surface drainage ditches. Explora-
tory wells would be drilled in preparation of a further expansion of the
area to be irrigated under the government's groundwater development program,
partly in Tlhessaly and partly in Macedonia and Thrace. Project wells would
be about 120 meters deep and serve between 15 and 29 hectares. Pumps would
be driven by electric motors. Construction of pump houses and installation
of pumps including the motors would be the responsibility of thie pump supplier.
Sprinkler distribution systems would be used on about 80 percent of the wells.
The rest would serve gravity systems. About 1,500 kilometers of farm roads
and an equal length of drains would be built.



- 4 -
13.       As noted in paragraph 9 above, fragmentation of land holdings ham-
pers agricultural development in Greece. tiuch of the effort in land consoli-
dation to date, however, has been concentrated on the Thessaly plain, where
average farm size is larger than in the rest of the country, and wlhere al-
ready about half of the project land has been consolidated into single units.
The Government has agreed that project wells would only be drilled on con-
solidated lands. Consolidation would progress in step with project imple-
mentation.
14.       LRS would install 80 percent of wells and related equipment on
behalf of water users' associations (hereafter referred to by their Greek
acronym TOEV). Such TOEVs would be set up prior to project implementation
with the assistance of LRS. They would own wells and irrigation installa-
tions, be responsible for their maintenance, and later collect payments
from members. About 20 percent of wells would be drilled on property of
farmers large enough to run a well by themselves, or by small groups of
farmers. In this case .TOEVs would still be established for the purpose
of maintaining farm roads and drainage canals.
15.       The overall cost of the project including provision for engineering,
administration, consulting services and further groundwater exploration is
estimated at $50 million. The proposed $25 million loan would cover the for-
eign exchange component estimated at 50 percent.
16.       Construction of wells would enable farmers in the project area
to diversify their production. An increase in feed production would lead
to savings on imports of beef and dairy products. The project would create
additional employment opportunities for some 6,000 farm families.     The eco-
nomic rate of return on the project is estimated at about 18 percent.
17.       Farmers would pay for about 75 percent of total installation cost,
excluding interest. This would be in line with present practices applied
on Government sponsored groundwater irrigation works. It would allow the
Government to recover from farmers the capital cost of the well, pump and
sprinkler equipment, while it would bear the cost of farm roads and drainage
canals itself. Farmers would repay their share over 25 years, the useful
life of the well, without interest. Farmers' total annual payments, which
also include operations and maintenance cost, would amount to about $97 per
hectare. This rate is high, largely due to the highler power cost of sprinkler
irrigation, but still within the farirers' repayment capacity. For the first
two years after completion of a well, when cash generation would be less,
repayments would be reduced accordingly.
18.       Almost all deep well drilling in Greece is presently executed by
force account. The Government has agreed that drilling on force account be
limited to 600 out of 1600 wells to be financed under the project and to an
additional 35 exploration wells. The balance would be opened to international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Banlk's guidelines. In order to
render bidding attractive also for foreign firms, the Covernment hias agreed
to lump drilling orders in one contract of 200 and two contracts of 400.



- 5 -
Individual road and drainage contracts would have a minimum size of $1.7
million. Out of total project cost of $50 million equivalent, contracts for
an estimated total of $43 million would be tendered on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. Domestic manufacturers of equipment would be
accorded a margin of preference for purposes of bid comparison which would
be the existing rate of customs duty applicable to competing imports or 15
percent of c.i.f. cost, whichever is the lower.
19.       Pumps and motors would be tendered as units and the successful
bidder would be responsible for the installation of both so as to avoid
difficulties in assembling them. Pump elements are being produced locally,
and a bidder offering locally made pumps would receive a preference of 15%
on the pump element in his bid. On the other hand all electric motors, at
present, have to be imported. Since the assembly operation is simple and
therefore the value added domestically to the imported motor marginal, the
motor portion of the bid would be treated as a foreign bid for purposes of
bid evaluation.
20.       Disbursements would be made against c.i.f. cost of imported equip-
ment and foreign exchange payments for consulting services. For civil works
and locally manufactured equipment, disbursements would be made on a percent-
age basis (37%) representing the estimated foreign exchange component.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Hellenic State and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
22.       The provisions of the Loan Agreement generally conform to the
pattern of Bank loans for agricultural development. It should be noted
that Section 8.01 requires fulfillment of the following conditions of ef-
fectiveness: (a) issuance of the necessary proclamation regulating the
use and exploitation of groundwater resources in the Project area, and (b)
retaining consultants for the Project.
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - THE ECONOMTY
24.       An economic report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Greece" (DEA-36a) is being circulated to the Executive Directors con-
currently. A basic data sheet is attached.



- 6 -
25.       The economic report notes the continued expansion of the Greek
economy in the past two years when GNP at constant prices rose by 8 percent,
while prices remained remarkably stable. It also notes the high increase in
imports which was associated with rapid growth, and which entailed a consid-
erable current account deficit, largely financed by private capital inflows
and short- and medium-term borrowing from abroad. Debt service has been
rising; taking into account additional public sector borrowing the debt
service ratio will increase from the present 5 percent to between 11 and 15
percent over the next 5 to 6 years, and a cautious short-term borrowing
policy is advisable. Considering, however, the favorable prospects for
further economic growth, Greece continues to be creditworthy for Bank lend-
ing.
PART VI - RECOIIMENDATION
26.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
