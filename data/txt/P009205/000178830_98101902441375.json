assist the Federal Government in increasing the\n            availability of finished fertilizer for 1984 and 1985. It\n            will also address policy and institutional issues concerning\n            distribution of fertilizer and the Government's efforts\n            to modernize and rehabilitate the industry, thereby\n            enhancing the Government's on-going Fertilizer\n            Production-Consumption program. The loan will: (a) finance\n            sub-loans to fertilizer producers for the: (i) import of raw\n            materials, such as phosphate rock, mono-ammonium phosphate;\n            and (ii) import of spare parts for fertilizer production\n            facilities, such as corrosion resistant materials, stainless\n            steel piping and catalysts for ammonia production; and (b)\n            finance sub-loans to fertilizer producers for technical and\n            energy studies of all the fertilizer plants, with the\n            assistance of consultants, in order to assess their\n            production and energy efficiency and to make proposals for improvements."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
