It was never signed, and\n            the Bank withdrew its offer on July 31, 1986. Following\n            appraisal, there was disagreement over the Bank's\n            analysis and recommendation to channel a large portion of\n            the incremental fertilizer production to individual farmers\n            not contractually associated with the social sector. The\n            Government made clear the fact that the Bank's\n            proposals were in opposition to the stated policy of\n            socializing agricultural production. A compromise was\n            reached, and this report lists the several policy\n            conditions. Following protracted discussions, the Government\n            reluctantly agreed that most of the resulting incremental\n            fertilizer production as a result of the project would be\n            offered in sale to independent farmers rather than reserved\n            for the socialist sector. However, this very agreement\n            greatly reduced the Government's zeal for finding\n            solutions to the other basic loan issues. After the second\n            Board approval, the Government proved unwilling to implement\n            procedure that would have assured adequate foreign exchange\n            to meet the future import needs of the fertilizer industry.\n            Still, this report finds that he project was sound and the\n            potential payoff in improved resource allocation and\n            increased agriculture production was impressive. Ultimately,\n            despite monumental efforts at many levels, the disagreements\n            on policy issues between the Bank and the Government\n            prevented this loan from being signed. The report finds that\n            the Bank was absolutely correct to withdraw support for the\n            loan. The project is not rated and will not be audited."}, "docdt": "1993-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
