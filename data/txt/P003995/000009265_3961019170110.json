Pedesan (KUPEDES) Small Credit Project in\n            Indonesia. The Project's objectives were: (a) to\n            promote BRI's ongoing efforts to strengthen and expand\n            its Unit Desa system as a financially viable sub branch\n            network that mobilizes resources and provides nonsubsidized\n            credit nationwide to creditworthy small borrowers; and (b)\n            to continue support to develop BRI's institutional\n            capability as related to its Unit Desa system. Bank\n            performance in the various stages of the Project cycle was\n            satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was satisfactory. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (i) a necessary\n            condition for the success of credit and savings programs is\n            sound macroeconomic performance of the economy and an\n            overall good record of growth; (ii) objectives should be\n            thoroughly discussed by the Bank with, and understood and\n            agreed by the Borrower; (iii) the success of the Project\n            owes much to its simple design; (iv) assured access to\n            lending, convenience of location and prompt credit decisions\n            are more important to small borrowers than getting a lower\n            interest rate; (v) safety, accessibility convenience of\n            service location, and acceptable interest rate provided are\n            the needs of the potential depositors to be satisfied; (vi)\n            provided that the needs of the potential depositors are\n            satisfied and (vii) any extra reporting requirement solely\n            for Bank purposes should be minimized so that the\n            implementation agency can focus more on project implementation"}, "docdt": "1995-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
