SECOND BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 3249-IND)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second
BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project in Indonesia, for which Loan 3249-IND in the
amount of US$125 million was approved on July 31, 1990 and made effective on October
15, 1990. The Loan was closed on June 30, 1995. Final disbursement took place on
December 6, 1995, at which time a balance of US$197.39 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Yuling Zhou, Operations Officer, the Industry and
Energy Operations Division (EA3IE), Country Department III, East Asia and Pacific
Region, and reviewed by Mr. Peter R. Scherer, Division Chief (EA3IE), and Mr. Richard
A. Calkins, Operations Advisor (EA3DR).
Preparation of this PCR was begun during the Bank's final supervision and
completion mission in June 1995, and is based on materials in the project file. The
Performance Audit Report prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department for the
BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project (Loan 2800-IND) provided very useful information.
The borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by providing the relevant project- and
sector-specific data. However, its own final evaluation report on the project has not been
received.

SECOND BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 3249-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Second BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project (the Project, or KUPEDES II),
for which this Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is prepared, was a follow-up to
the first BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project (KUPEDES I) for which a Bank loan (Loan
No. 2800-IND) was approved in April 1987. KUPEDES I was implemented successfully
with all its objectives fully achieved. Both the Project Completion Report (Report No.
12973, dated April 14, 1994) and the Performance Audit Report (Report No. 14511,
dated May 19, 1995) rated the project outcome as highly satisfactory, institutional
development impact as substantial and sustainability as likely.
Project Objectives
2.    The Project's objectives were: (a) to promote BRI's ongoing efforts to strengthen
and expand its Unit Desa system as a financially viable subbranch network that mobilizes
resources and provides nonsubsidized credit nationwide to creditworthy small borrowers;
and (b) to continue support to develop BRI's institutional capability as related to its Unit
Desa system. To achieve the above objectives, three components were included under the
Project:  (a) a general credit component for financing of cottage and small-scale
enterprises in all sectors; (b) a capital expenditure component for the expansion of BRI's
five Unit Desa training centers; and (c) a technical assistance component aimed at
supporting ongoing efforts to strengthen BRI's institutional capability for improving its
Unit Desa and rural banking activities.
3.    The Project objectives were clearly stated and were realistic. They coincided with
plans and goals that were already accepted and being implemented by BRI, and were
supported by the Government. The Project design enhanced that of the first project
through an improved Bank loan disbursement formula to encourage the Unit Desas'
resource mobilization efforts and at the same time, not to penalize them if they are
successful; and a broader range of technical assistance for further strengthening of
institutional development (e.g. computerization of the Unit Desas and expansion of the
training centers).
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    The Project has successfully achieved all the objectives and generated sustainable
outcomes. The Unit Desa system has developed its full intermediation functions, and has



iii
become self-reliant. The KUPEDES loans have expanded to a broad-based clientele,
improved credit supply to a wide network of people in rural areas across Indonesia, and
made it easier for small borrowers to obtain credit at lower costs than was available from
informal credit channels. It has also created a viable banking system for channeling
savings and has therefore contributed to the important intermnediation role of the financial
system. The cadre of banking staff at the Unit Desa (branch) level, now totaling over
16,500 trained personnel, have become proficient in making loans to small borrowers and
mobilizing savings.
5.    Savings mobilization has been the most successful element of the Project and has
supplied the Unit Desas with a stable source of fund. Deposits from rural savers have
grown many-fold and have reached twice the level of outstanding loans. Profits of the
KUPEDES program have consistently risen to very satisfactory level.
6.    Project implementation has been smooth and satisfactory, though the Bank loan
disbursement was completed one year later than the original schedule mainly due to
slowdown of KUPEDES lending during the period of 1992-93 as a result of a long
drought, rural recessions and Government's tight money policy. Actual project cost
almost doubled the appraisal estimate because of the successful KUPEDES lending
expansion. The five training centers have been largely expanded and effectively utilized
to train Unit Desa staff. The computerization program, implemented satisfactorily with
each Unit Desa now equipped with at least one workstation, is expected to facilitate
increase of productivity and improvement of banking services.
7.    Many factors have contributed to the successful achievement of project
objectives. The major ones include: (a) economic growth: the Indonesian economy was
growing rapidly at the time when the KUPEDES program was expanding. The high
growth facilitated the rapid growth of incomes which resulted in increasing both demand
for credit and domestic savings; (b) borrower commitment: the KUPEDES program was
launched at the borrower's own initiative and designed closely in line with the local
environment and conditions; (c) simple design: basic to the design are the principles of
not-targeted credit except for the provision of a maximum loan size; non-subsidized
lending; and self-sustainability through deposits mobilization and profitable operations.
This design has allowed KUPEDES lending much flexibility, permitted pricing of loans
to fully recover costs and risks, and focused on long-term institutional sustainability.
Under this design, drawdown of the Bank loan was based on the growth in the Unit Desa
loan portfolio and deposits mobilization, rather than just to support KUPEDES
disbursement; (d) incentive system: institutional incentives aiming at positively affecting
individual bank staff behavior and cooperation including: performance bonus for Unit
Desa staff based on transparent criteria; interest rebate and access to bigger loans for
borrowers based on timely repayment; and local level incentives (e.g., lottery) for savers;
and (e) technical assistance: well-targeted and continued technical assistance has
complemented the implementation of the program. The consulting services supported by
the Project have been utilized effectively and played a crucial role at various stages of
program development.

8.    Overall, through the Project, the Bank has made a very positive contribution to the
successful development and strengthening of the BRI Unit Desa system.  Bank
performance in the various stages of the Project cycle was satisfactory. Borrower
performance was also satisfactory. The program enjoyed high support from the borrower.
BRI's performance during the Project cycle was generally of high quality. The loan
covenants were complied with. Both the Bank and the Government worked closely
throughout the project cycle, building up a relationship based on mutual trust and
confidence. In summary, the Project was very successful and is rated highly satisfactory.
Summary of Findings, Future Operation, and Key Lessons Learned
9.    Sound macroeconomic performance, overall good record of growth, and high
borrower commitment are necessary conditions for the success of credit programs.
10.   Project design should be simple and directly linked to objectives. In particular,
credit programs should be designed on market principles so as to encourage and support
institution's resource mobilization efforts, rather than to compensate for a lack of it.
11.   The experience of Indonesia shows that rural small and micro enterprises are
willing and able to pay an interest rate that fully covers lending costs. Assured access to
lending, convenience of location, and prompt credit decisions are more important to small
borrowers than getting a lower interest rate.
12.   Rural depositors can be a very important source of savings for financial
institutions, provided that their needs (such as safety, accessibility - immediate and
unlimited withdrawal, convenience of location, and acceptable interest rate) are satisfied.
The KUPEDES experience underlines the strength of rural savings if properly mobilized.
13.   The Unit Desa system has proven itself to be sustainable as a profit center within
BRI. A threat for its continued role is that the system could be put in the position of
subsidizing the less profitable operations of BRI, and thereby cause its resources to be
dissipated.
14.   BRI introduced in May 1995 a new interest rate structure for KUPEDES loans to
meet growing competition for relatively larger customers. This move is the first step in
the Unit Desas' broader strategy to maintain and expand their market share among the
small borrowers while preserving profitability. The next step would be for the Unit
Desas to be given the status of a truly autonomous strategic business unit with power to
hire and fire employees. Other parts of this strategy, including new product development
and improvements in services and productivity are under discussion within the institution.
This strategy will be released in the form of a new Policy and Strategy Statement for the
Unit Desas after approval by the BRI Board of Directors.

SECOND BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 3249-IND)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.    Background   KUPEDES (Kredit Umum Pedesaan, or general rural credit),
launched in 1984, is a general rural credit program providing non-subsidized financial
assistance to creditworthy small borrowers. It is implemented through the nationwide
network of small unit banks (Unit Desas, or Units) at subdistrict level within the Bank
Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), a state commercial bank. This network evolved from the highly
loss-making village banking units system which was set up in 1970 to administer a
government-directed and subsidized program (BIMASI) for rice farmers.
2.    In April 1987, a Bank loan in the amount of US$ 101.5 million was approved for
the first BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project (KUPEDES I), which allowed the Bank to
support a long advocated approach that neither promoted nor extended subsidized funds.
Major design flaws (such as poor borrower selection criteria, subsidized interest rates,
insufficient spreads to intermediaries and overly generous credit insurance) that were
identified as having contributed to the failure of the Bank's previous Small Enterprises
Development Projects were avoided, with much more focus on institutional building and
long term sustainability. KUPEDES I was implemented successfully with all its
objectives fully achieved. Both the Project Completion Report (Report No. 12973, dated
April 14, 1994) and the Performance Audit Report (Report No. 14511, dated May 19,
1995) rated the project outcome as highly satisfactory, institutional development impact
as substantial and sustainability as likely.
3.    The Second BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project (the Project, or KUPEDES II),
supported by a US$ 125 million Bank loan, the subject of this Implementation
Completion Report (ICR), was approved in July 1990, shortly after the credit line under
KUPEDES I had been fully disbursed. The design of KUPEDES II enhanced that of
The BIMAS program was aimed at improving agricultural production and practices through the
provision of physical inputs, technical assistance and short-term credit through BRI Unit Desas at an
interest rate substantially below market rates. BI/GOI bore up to 75% of the credit risk and provided
an administrative subsidy to BRI to cover the operating costs of the Unit Desas.



KUPEDES I through an improved Bank loan disbursement formula2 and a broader range
of technical assistance (e.g. computerization of the Unit Desas and expansion of the
training center). The continued Bank participation through KUPEDES II not only
demonstrated the Bank's commitment to the program but also helped ensure its long-term
sustainability, particularly at a time when the program was still young and the scope of
operations was expanding.
4.    Project Objectives  The objectives of KUPEDES II were: (a) to promote BRI's
ongoing efforts to strengthen and expand its Unit Desa system as a financially viable
subbranch network that mobilizes resources and provides nonsubsidized credit
nationwide to creditworthy small borrowers; and (b) to continue support to develop BRI's
institutional capability as related to its Unit Desa system.
5.    To achieve the above objectives, the Project consisted of three components: (a) a
credit component (US$120 million of the Bank loan) for general purpose financing of
cottage and small-scale enterprises in all sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture,
trade and services; (b) a capital expenditure component (US$2.7 million) for the
expansion of BRI's five Unit Desa training centers, including purchasing of computer
equipment; and (c) a technical assistance component (US$2.3 million) aimed at
supporting ongoing efforts to strengthen BRI's institutional capability for improving its
Unit Desa and rural banking activities.
6.    The Project objectives were clearly stated and were realistic. They coincided with
plans and goals that were already accepted and being implemented by BRI, and were
supported by the Government.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
7.    The Project's objectives have been successfully achieved. The Unit Desa system
has developed its capacity to undertake full intermediation functions, and has become
self-reliant.
Credit Generation
8.    Scope and Terms of KUPEDES Loans  KUPEDES loans, with a size range of
Rp. 25,000 to Rp. 25 million (US$12.5 - 12,500 equivalent), are for directly productive
activities in all sectors. The main criterion for loan approval is the creditworthiness of the
borrower. Basic to the design of terms and conditions of KUPEDES loans are the
2   For the credit component, the Bank loan disbursements would be on the basis of 5% of new
KUPEDES loan approvals (i.e., disbursements) during a quarter, provided that the Unit Desas/BRI
finance with their own resources at least 70% of the incremental growth in the KUPEDES loan
portfolio. This arrangement is designed not only to encourage the Unit Desas' resources mobilization
efforts, but also not to penalize them for successful performance in exceeding the 70% criterion.

principles of (a) not-targeted credit except for a maximum loan size; (b) non-subsidized
lending; and (c) self-sustainability through deposits mobilization and profitable
operations. The first principle has endowed KUPEDES with flexibility, allowing the
Units to adjust lending portfolio to the economic situation in their respective service
areas. This has also provided KUPEDES clients with similar flexibility in the choice of
businesses for financing. Furthermore, the absence of targeting keeps the loan screening
and approval process relatively free from  distortions.  The second principle, non-
subsidized lending, has permitted the pricing of loans to fully recover the costs and risks.
A funds transfer pricing scheme among the Units has also been put in place to discourage
the Units from depending on "external" funding and to encourage them to mobilize
savings and/or expand their credit activities as well.  Self-sustainability, the third
principle, has provided the impetus for the design of savings instruments, based on safety,
accessibility, simplicity and positive return, that an expanding number of small savers are
willing and able to use.
9.    KUPEDES Lending Growth              During the Project period (1990-1995),
KUPEDES outstanding loans have doubled. Outstanding loans stood .at Rp. 2,746 billion
(about $1.25 billion) at the end of June 1995 (Table 1). The large growth in 1990 was
due to an expansion in new loans and a rise in the maximum loan limit to Rp. 25 million.
The slowdown in lending during 1991 and 1992, shortly after effectiveness of the Project,
was caused by a long drought, rural recessions and the Government's tight money policy,
which also caused a deterioration of the portfolio. The credit growth then picked up
ster-dily from 1993.

b/ average account of the second quarter of 1995.
10.   Diversification   KUPEDES portfolio has become fairly diversified, with about
half for small scale trading activities. In 1994, agriculture loans accounted for about



-4 -
18%, while industry's share was minor, only 1.8%. The demand for KUPEDES has been
largely for working capital, accounting for over 80% of the loan portfolio. The
proportion of investment loans, however, has increased gradually since the removal in
1989 of the interest differential in favor of investment credit (1.0% per month vs. 1.5%
per month for working capital loan), showing that the availability of general credit was
helpful to investment loan growth.
11.   The main market niche of the KUPEDES program is in credit from Rp. 200,000
to Rp. 3.0 million (equivalent to about $100 to $1,500 currently). About 80% of total
borrowings are concentrated on the lower end of this range (below Rp. 1.5 million).
Thus, loans have been predominantly for very small business activities. The average loan
size by sector varies little, with overall average in end 1994 at Rp. 1.2 million (about
US$550 equivalent).
12. Portfolio Quality and Arrears The possibility of arrears was a concern at Project
appraisal and has been addressed as follows: (a) if overdue installments to the total loans
outstanding (Portfolio Status measure) exceeds an alarm level (8%) for 6 months
consecutively, BRI should prepare and carry out, with the Bank's approval, a plan of
action to reduce the arrears; (b) arrears more than 90 days overdue, with the upper limit
for satisfactory performance set at 6% of the total loan portfolio, would be monitored.
The above standards of portfolio quality and monitoring of arrears helped define a basis
on which performance of the Unit Desas could be held accountable. The monitoring
system, controlled from BRI headquarters, has kept a tight watch on loan arrears.
13.   Since its inception in 1984, KUPEDES portfolio has enjoyed good quality, except
during 1988 and 1991/1992 when the Portfolio Status rose beyond the agreed alarm level
(8%). The incidence of arrears in 1988 was brief and was caused by a mild and short
drought. A more serious deterioration in portfolio occurred in 1991-1992 primarily due
to external factors - the long drought during this period; recessions in the rural economy,
and the Government's tight money policy. BRI management responded to the problems
in according with the Loan covenant with an action plan prepared in time to reduce
delinquencies. The action plan included special collection efforts, increased conservatism
in new lending, some relief on past due interest, and the payment of modest commissions
on collections under certain circumstances. The results of these actions were reflected in
the improvement of all the arrears indicators to satisfactory levels by 1993. This is in
contrast to the deterioration in the overall portfolio of the Indonesian banking sector. The
turnaround with rural economy helped in addressing the problem.
Savings Generation
14.   Although Unit Desas offer a variety of savings instruments, Simpanan Pedesan
(SIMPEDES, or Village Savings Program) is the major one. It was developed by BRI in
1985 as a convenient, safe and liquid savings instrument. Withdrawal is unlimited thus
providing easy access to savers. It was developed also in part to meet the deposit needs
of rural organizations and institutions. A lottery held at the local level makes SIMPEDES



- 5 -
and its urban counterpart, SIMASKOT, more attractive. Deposit instruments offered by
Unit Desas carry market rates and have rewarded savers with positive interest rates. To
mobilize deposits, Unit Desas have employed creative approaches, such as strategic
mapping of potential savers, door to door and personal visits, outdoor advertising and
slogans, and establishing good links and relationship with the chiefs of villages and
subdistricts.
15.   Savings mobilization has also been highly successful under the BRI Unit Desa
system. It has raised more than sufficient resources for the Unit Desas to undertake
KUPEDES lending, and is capturing an ever increasing share of depositors and Rupiah
value in the country's deposit market. At the end of May 1995, savings accounts of the
Unit Desa system (excluding current accounts and time deposits) accounted for 30.1% in
number of accounts, and 11.5% in Rupiah value, of those in the entire Indonesian
banking system. Within BRI, Unit Desas savings accounted for 44.1% of the total
deposits and 76.4% of the total number of accounts. As of June 1995, deposits had
grown 31 times from the level in 1986 when SIMPEDES became a national saving
program for the Unit Desas. Deposits are far in excess of outstanding loans, with average
deposits to loan ratio being more than 2.0 since 1992 (Table 2). Over 13 million
depositors are using the deposit facilities of the Unit Desas.

Profitability
16.   Unit Desas have proven to be a very successful profit center within BRI and have
become the largest source of BRI's profits since effectiveness of the Project in 1990,
contributing more than 100% of the total BRI profits in recently years as the rest of the
BRI has not been performing well. During the Project, return to average assets and
equity have been very satisfactory. Return to average equity reached close to 50% even
during the period of 1991-1992 when the KUPEDES lending slowed down and
experienced portfolio deterioration. A record percentage of the Unit Desa (93.7%)
showed a profit in 1994, when overall profits reached Rp. 265 billion, an increase of 89%



over the 1993 level. The profitability in 1995 continues to be very high, with an
estimated total profit of Rp. 168 billion for the first six months. The annualized return on
earning assets for the fist half of 1995 was 6.0%.
Institutional Development
17.   The objective of institutional development has also been achieved. The spread of
the Unit Desa network in the countryside give the system an edge against its competitors.
With 3,388 sub-district Units and 622 village service posts as of 1994, the system is the
largest single rural banking network in Indonesia. Every subdistrict town is serviced by
at least one Unit. Service posts provide banking services in areas where business volume
is not enough to warrant a full Unit. With a staff of 4 to 11, each Unit's operational
structure has been kept simple and easily manageable. The network holds more than
16,500 staff nationwide.
18.   The outcomes of the Project's technical assistance activities have been
satisfactorily. Consulting services provided by expatriate advisors were considered a
success. They have assisted BRI and Unit Desas management on (a) policy and strategic
issues including general policy advisory, review of credit instrument, recommendations
on pricing and interest structure for KUPEDES loans and deposits, design of new
products, BRI reorganization and its implication on Unit Desas, and long-term
development plan for the Unit Desas; and (b) operational matters such as profit analysis
and income/expense forecasting, Unit Desa incentives, loan/deposit balance, arrears
management, implementation of MIS and computerization of the Unit Desas, revising of
training materials and curriculum, teacher selection and professional operations at the
training centers. The advisors have worked very closely with senior BRI management
and the Unit Desas Division. Their services have resulted in improved productivity, cost
savings and an above average quality of information on the Unit Desas operations.
19.   Construction of five training centers exclusively for Unit Desas was included
under the Project. Of them, four were completed on schedule and within the original
budgets, and one (at Ujung Pandang) ran into unexpected difficulties before its
completion.  The original plan for the training center at Ujung Pandang was to
rehabilitate the BRI regional office building and convert it to a training center. When it
became clear that it was not possible to purchase the adjoining land, it was decided to
build a new one at a different location. Construction costs (US$ 6.5 million) for Ujung
Pandang training center were substantially higher than the costs of the other training
centers (averaged at US$2.2 million). The higher cost reflected four factors: (a) the
Ujung Pandang training center had to include all utilities since it was built from scratch,
while the other centers were expansions of existing structures with utilities already in
place; (b) construction of Ujung Pandang center was started two years later than the
others due to location change, and the costs reflected inflation during these two years; (c)
at Ujung Pandang, the computer training room had to be built in addition to the three
basic classrooms, while at the other centers, one of the three basic classrooms was
converted to computer use; and (d) many furnishings, fixtures and other finishing



- 7 -
materials were not available locally in Ujung Pandang and had to be shipped from Java,
thus incurring higher costs. Upon request by the Government, a loan reallocation was
made in June 1994 in order to complete this training center, and at the same time, to
enable the computerization of the Unit Desas network and the extension of the consulting
services.
20.   All the training centers have been fully utilized year round since their completion
due to high training demand. In 1994, 8772 Unit staff received training at these training
centers. Of them, 1061 were newly recruited, and 967 were recently promoted staff to
receive training for their new positions, and the reminder attended short courses designed
to both refresh routine skills and cover topics on current interest such as credit
investigation, credit analysis and competition analysis.
21.   Under the Unit Desa computerization program, the Bank loan financed
procurement of 2379 computer workstations. The procurement was completed by June
1995, allowing BRI to computerize all the remaining manual Unit Desas and add
additional workstations at the highly loaded Units. It is expected that the computerization
program will facilitate to improve Unit Desas' productivity considerably. Once the
computers are installed, Unit Desas will focus on future system development including a
major software upgrade.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
22.   Many factors have contributed to the success of the Unit Desa system as a viable
and sustainable rural financial institution, and of the BRI/KUPEDES II project in
particular. The major ones are discussed below.
23.   Economic Growth  The Indonesian economy was growing rapidly at the time
when KUPEDES program was expanding. The real economic growth during 1986-1994
was in the range of 5% to 8% per year. Economic growth facilitated the rapid growth of
incomes in the rural areas, resulting in increasing demand for credit as well as higher
domestic savings by rural and small households.
24.   Government Commitment   The KUPEDES program was launched at the
Government's initiative. It arose out of a need to address the weakness of the failed
BIMAS small credit program and of the institutions that had previously been developed
to deliver credit. With the assistance of the long-term foreign consultants, the Program
was designed within the country, and closely in line with the local environment and
conditions.
25.   Rural Recession and Government Policy  As discussed earlier, a long drought
during 1991-1992 and the resulting rural recessions slowed down the KUTPEDES lending



- 8 -
and caused deterioration of the KUPEDES loan portfolio. The Government's tight
money policy to ease inflation during that period also contributed in this connection.
26. Simple Project Design An important ingredient for the success of the Project has
been its simple design. The objective to turn loss making units into self-sustaining profit
centers has provided the framework for designing the products and services, the financial
policies and procedures, and the organizational structure of the KUPEDES program. The
credit programn was designed with emphasis on building an institution capable of
providing banking services on a sustained basis. Under this design, drawdown of Bank
loan was based on the growth in the Unit Desa loan portfolio and deposits mobilization,
rather than just supporting KUPEDES disbursement.
27.   Incentive System    Institutional incentives aiming at positively affecting
individual behavior as well as cooperation are integrated in operations: for Unit staff,
performance bonus based on transparent criteria; for borrowers, interest rebate and access
to bigger loans for timely repayment; and for savers, lottery determined at the local level.
A maj or factor contributing to the success of the Unit Desa system has been the cultural
change within the institution. Considering the fact that the program inherited a large
number of staff long used to another system and standard of work and discipline, the
achievement in changing the institution's culture is a success story in itself Many
elements have attributed to the cultural change, including: pinpointing accountability to
the Unit, simple cash basis accounting system, setting clear targets and standards of
performance and closely monitoring them, close follow-up and supervision, performance
incentives and punishment, and intensive training for upgrading competence and
instilling pride in their work.
28.   Staffing and Training  Staffing at Unit Desas has been deliberately kept lean,
with 4 to 11 people manning a Unit. Operations are made as simple as possible. Each
staff member is required to attend at least one training course related to his/her
assignment. Some have attended more than 3 or 4 training courses. Over the years, the
BRI has built a pool of manpower in the rural areas which have become skillful in
providing banking services there. Continuing training and retooling is a strong element
of the Unit Desa system, and expenses for training come close to 6% of the total
operating cost of the Unit Desa system. Five regional training centers, established and
expanded with the Bank loan financing exclusively for the training of Unit Desa
personnel, have been utilized intensively and effectively.
29.   Technical Assistance As discussed above, well-targeted and continued technical
assistance has complemented the implementation of the program.  The consulting
services have been utilized effectively and played a crucial role at various stages of
development in the process of designing, planning and policy making, training, setting up
systems, manualization of procedures, research, computerization, setting up and refining
the management information system.

D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
30.   Financial Viability  The financial viability of the Unit Desa system has been
demonstrated by its high profitability over time. Long-term sustainability would be
doubtful without healthy net earnings. As mentioned above, net profit, after full costing
of direct Unit Desa expenses, supervision, training and conservative provision for bad
debts, rose steadily each year. A profit of Rp. 265 billion was recorded for 1994, a 4.5%
return on average assets. The Unit Desa operations continue to be highly profitable in
1995.
31.   Resource Mobilization  A sustainable credit system should be able to mobilize
sufficient funds to finance its loan portfolio. The Unit Desas have certainly achieved this
and the mobilization of deposits has supplied the Units with a stablc source of funds. The
Unit Desas has played an important role in mobilizing rural savings within the banking
system. Having a stable and credible channel for keeping financial savings for rural
households is important for continuing development in the countryside.
32.   Developmental Impact  KUPEDES has expanded credit availability to small
borrowers, improved credit supply to a wide network of people in rural areas across
Indonesia, and made it easier for small borrowers to avail of credit at relatively lower
costs than was available from other credit channels. It has also created viable institutions
for channeling savings within the same credit delivery mechanism and has therefore
contributed to the important role of intermediation of the financial system.
33.   The Unit Desa borrowing enterprises are growing rapidly and making substantial
contributions to improved incomes and employment generation in the rural and small
scale business sectors. A field survey done in 1990 gathered income and employment
information from Unit Desa borrowers over a three-year period of borrowing. After three
years of borrowing (typically three loans), Unit Desa customers experienced substantial
increases in enterprise and total family income. Average enterprise income rose about
93% and average family income rose by 76%, both in real terms. Average number of
workers of borrowing enterprise increased from 3.4 to 5.6.
34.   The Unit Desa borrowers are truly small enterprises, with average capital
investment of about US$650 equivalent and less than five workers including family
members. Women make up at least 25% of the borrowers. The amount of funds going to
enterprises headed by women is estimated to be higher however, since husbands often
sign the note (they are predominantly the title holders to land) when the funds are actually
used by their wives.

E. BANK PERFORMANCE
35.   As a follow-up of BRI/KUPEDES I, the Project's preparation and appraisal were
straightforward. As mentioned above, enhancements were brought in: (a) the Bank loan
disbursement formula was modified to further encourage the Unit Desas' resources
mobilization efforts while not to penalize them for good performance; and (b) the
technical assistance activities were expanded to further strengthen institution building.
Bank's continued support not only demonstrated its commitment to the Unit Desa
system, but also helped ensure the long term sustainability of the system, particularly at
the time when the system was expanding rapidly.
36.   The Project benefited from a high degree of supervision and monitoring and
timely identification and resolution of implementation constraints by Bank staff. During
Project implementation, the Bank went beyond focusing on investments and loan
disbursements, and looked at all aspects of the Unit Desa system (including organization,
policy and procedures). Conditionality (such as enforcement of the policy and strategy
statements, and portfolio quality measures) was used to promote the strengthening of the
institutional framework, with a clear emphasis on long-term sustainability and financial
viability. This approach has proven successful, as demonstrated by the Unit Desa
system's impressive growth and profitability on a continuing basis.
37.   The Bank's reporting requirements for BRI were set up based on BRI's existing
regular management reports. No extra surveys or reports were required solely for the
Bank purposes. When administering a system with a very large branch network,
preparation of one extra report can be very time consuming. This was avoided under the
Project so that BRI staff and consultants could concentrate more on Project
implementation.
38.   Overall, the Bank has made a very positive contribution to the successful
development and strengthening of the BRI Unit Desa system. Bank performance in the
various stages of the Project cycle was satisfactory. The Bank relationship with the
Government agencies concerned as well as with BRI on the Project has been satisfactory.
Both parties worked closely throughout the project cycle, building up a relationship based
on mutual trust and confidence.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
39.   At all levels of the Government, commitment to the Unit Desas program and the
Project, and actions taken for its effective implementation have been impressive. BRI's
performance during the Project cycle was generally of high quality. There was continuity
at the top management level.  Management of the Unit Desa Division changed
periodically in accordance with BRI's management rotation policies, but there was



- 11 -
reasonable continuity at the section and branch head level. The expatriate consulting
services were utilized effectively. The legal covenants were complied with. The
quarterly progress reports prepared by BRI have been found especially useful.
40.   An implementation problem has been BRI assuring adequate staffing at the Unit
Desas to support their rapid growth. The tendency at BRI has been to solve staffing
needs in a rather ad hoc manner, responding to actual vacancies rather than anticipating
future needs and preparing to meet them smoothly. This was exacerbated by the lengthy
training periods required, as well as the geographic dispersion of the Unit Desas. In
1994, the Bank reviewed this matter with BRI again. As a result, BRI has addressed the
staffing shortage, and there was agreement on the resumption of orderly recruitment
starting from 1994.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
41.   The Project is assessed highly satisfactory since it has successfully achieved all
the objectives and generated sustainable outcomes, without any major shortcomings. The
Unit Desa system has developed its full intermediation functions, and has become self-
reliant. The KUPEDES loans have expanded to a broad-based clientele. Deposits from
small savers have grown many-fold, and profits have consistently risen at satisfactory
levels. A cadre of unit banking staff, now totaling over 16,500 trained personnel, have
become proficient in making loans to small borrowers and mobilizing savings. As of
June 1995, the number of Unit Desas reached to 3,453 with 95% of them making
satisfactory profits.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
42.   The Unit Desa system has proven itself to be sustainable as a profit center within
BRI. To allow the Unit Desas system to expand further, Bank Indonesia has permitted
BRI to expand the Unit Desa system to 3,648 Units through 1997, which is considered
appropriate. The next step is for the Unit Desas to be given the status of a truly
autonomous strategic Business Unit in the BRI, with power to hire and fire employees.
The threat from its present successful role is that the Unit Desas system could be put in
the position of subsidizing BRI's less profitable or loss making operations. BRI should
improve profitability from its other business centers to reduce its profit dependence on
the Unit Desas thus to ensure their continued growth.
43.   On May 1, 1995, BRI introduced a new interest rate structure for KUPEDES
loans. The new structure, designed to meet growing competition for larger KUPEDES
customers, features a lower interest rates for larger KUPEDES loans. It is expected that
the spread for such larger loans is still more than sufficient to cover all the costs and risks.



* 12-
This move on lending interest rates is the first step in the Unit Desas' broader strategy to
maintain and expand their market share among the small borrowers while preserving
profitability. Other parts of this strategy, including new product development and
improvements in services and productivity are under discussion within BRI. A summary
of this strategy will be released in thc form of a new Policy and Strategy Statement for
the Unit Desas, which is expected to be approved by the BRI Board of Directors by the
end of 1995.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
44.   A necessary condition for the success of credit and savings programs is sound
macroeconomic performance of the economy and an overall good record of growth. High
economic growth likely generate high income growth, thus increasing credit demand and
facilitating savings mobilization.
45.   A project is more likely to be successful if it is clearly focused and has simple
objectives. These objectives should be thoroughly discussed by the Bank with, and
understood and agreed by the Borrower, to ensure high borrower commitment, which, as
demonstrated under KUPEDES II, is an important factor of a project's success.
46.   The success of the Project owes much to its simple design, and the KUPEDES
experience has many features (such as non-targeting, non-subsidizing, and incentive
scheme) that can be adopted in small credit programs in other developing countries. In
particular, the credit program should be designed on market principles and institutional
building so as to encourage and support the institution's own resource mobilization
efforts, rather than to compensate for a lack of it.
47.   The experience of Indonesia confirms that rural small and micro enterprises are
willing and able to pay an interest rate which fully covers lending costs. Assured access
to lending, convenience of location and prompt credit decisions are more important to
small borrowers than getting a lower interest rate.
48.   On the deposit side, it has become evident that rural and small scale savers can be
a very important source of savings mobilization and a stable supplier of funds for rural
financial institutions, provided that the needs of the potential depositors are satisfied.
These needs, in order of importance, are: safety, accessibility (immediate and unlimited
withdrawal), convenience of service location, and acceptable interest rate.  The
KUPEDES experience underlines the strength of rural savings if properly mobilized.
49.   The strengthening of the Unit Desa operations, at a time when the rest of BRI is
not performing well, can be attributed in part to the effective utilization of consulting
services. Several conclusions and lessons may be drawn in this connection: (a) clearly
defined terms of reference are essential to the successful implementation of the
assignment; and the consultant should be selected on the grounds of technical



- 13 -
qualifications; (b) the consultants should work very closely with their counterparts, and
should be able to have direct access to senior management in order that their expertise can
be fully utilized; (c) an action plan should be developed to ensure transfer of knowledge
and continuity of activities after consultant assignment terminates.
50.   A well designed and maintained information system/data base is very important to
the successful implementation of the Project, to provide both early warning signals and
the basis for timely corrective actions. The Bank's reporting requirements should be in
line with the implementation agency's existing reporting system; any extra reporting
requirement solely for Bank purposes should be minimized so that the implementation
agency can focus more on project implementation.

to be financially viable with a strong resource mobilization and lending portfolio growth.
We were also pleased to learn that the Unit Desa regional offices have now received
sufficient staff recruitment authority, and we trust the BRI Unit Desa management will
continue its efforts to eliminate the existing staff shortage.
As of end May 1995, $116.9 million (or 93.5%) of the $125 million total Bank
loan amount was disbursed. It is expected that the remaining undisbursed balance will be
fully utilized by October 31, 1995, the deadline for receipt of withdrawal applications.
Regarding preparation of the ICR, attached please find the Borrower's role and
a suggested outline for the Borrower's own evaluation report (Attachment 1) and a set of
tables (Attachment 2) that need to be completed by BRI and will be attached to the final
ICR. We will very much appreciate your help in (i) ensuring cooperation of the
counterpart agency in providing necessary information for preparation of the ICR; and (ii)
coordinating preparation of the Borrower's evaluation report.
In preparation of the Borrower's evaluation report, we would suggest that you
pay particular attention to: (i) development of a plan for future operation of Unit Desa
program. Such plan should include appropriate technical, financial and institutional
arrangements to ensure effective and sustainable operation of Unit Desa program and

should also include appropriate performance indicators by which the Unit Desa program
can be monitored and evaluated in the future; (ui) the rationale for continmed Bank support
for the BRI Unit Desa program following successful completion of the first Bank
supported project, including additionality (financial and institutional) provided by the
second project.
As agreed with BRI by the mnission, we expect to receive the complete data by
July 31,1995 and the Borrower's evaluation report by September 15, 1995.
Please feel free to contact us should you have any questions or comments.

a/ Because of the nature of KUPEDES loans (installment loans with interest calculated on a flat rate basis),
there is no accrued interest; either as income or an asset; in the Unit accounting system.
All outstanding balances are for principal only. Interest income is booked strictly on a cash basis.
Interest arrears are recorded in the individual borrower's records and are pursued with the same vigor as principal arrears.
Under the Units accounting system, interest collect rates are always greater than or equal to principal rates.
b/ Principal which has been written offbut not yet repaid.
All KUPEDES arrears over 90 days past final due date are fully reserved against.
All KUPEDES arrears over I year past the final due date are automatically written off.
