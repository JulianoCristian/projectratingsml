NQ0(RANDMI AND RUECO)ENATION OF TM PRESIDENT
OF THE ITERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMZNT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE SECOND BRI/KUPEDES SMALL CREDIT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommsndation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for $125.0 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a Second
BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent by
the GOI to Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) for a term of 20 years, including five
years of grace, at a variable interest rate reflecting the market rate for
domestic term funds. The GOI would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.       Background.  Since June 1983, the Government of Indonesia (001) has
undertaken major deregulation measures to develop an efficient financial
system. Indonesia's open capital account and the 001's reform initiatives
have made its financial sector one of the most deregulated and market-based
financial systems in the developing world. In 1984, as part of its thrust to
reduce credit subsidies, it encouraged Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) to develop
its XUPEDES credit progran scheme. Under this scheme, loans (the average loan
size in 1989 was approximately $425) are made to creditworthy small borrowers,
primarily in rural areas, for directly productive activities at -market-
determined interest rates. Concurrently, in response to financial sector
reforms aimed at increasing competition and decreasing dependence on
subsidized financing, BRI embarked on a significant progra-,of institutional
reform to enhance its efficiency and profitability. Today, BRI's Unit Dest
system is the only nationwide network meeting the needs of both small
borrowers and small savers. No policy obstacles prevent the entrance of
competing institutions, but the perceived costs and risks of establishing such
a network are high. Although several state commercial and private banks have
indicated that they intend to mobilize savings in selected rural areas,
complementary efforts to reach the small borrower are not anticipated soon.
The Unit Desa system operates as an autonomous profit center within ERlI To
ensure that the system's sustainability is not based on the availabilLty of
subsidized funds, BRI prices any funds passed on to the Uhit Desas at an
interest rate no less than the rate paid by the Unit Desas on three-month time
deposits. The Unit Desa system has taken on an increasingly important role in
contributing to BRlI's deposit-taking performance and profitability.
Accounting for less than 9 percent of BRI's total assets at end-1989, the Unit
Desas mobilized about 14 percent of its total deposits and accounted for
30 percent of its total 1989 net Income (before taxes). The quality of the
KUPEDES portfolio is good. In addition, a recently completed Development
Impact Surrey of the KUPEDES credit program shows that this scheme has had
significant socioeconomic benefits. Among the survey's findings ares a high
participation of women; direct contributions to poverty alleviation at the
village level; a high participation of landless and nearilandless farmers;
employment generation; and Improvements in borrowers' standards of living.
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank will continue to support
efforts, on the basis of demonstrated financial viability and sustainability,
to expand and to improve the efficient delivery of credit to those groups of



borrowers whose access to nonsubsidized credit has been constrained in the
past.  When BRI's KUPEDES program was introduced, it represented a significant
departure from the heavily subsidized credit programs that characterized much
of Indonesia's directed lending. This program provided the Bank (through its
first BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Project--Loan 2800-IND) an excellent
opportunity to support an approach that extended nonsubsidized funds. Major
design flaws that were identified as having contributed to the lack of success
of the Bank's three Small Enterprise Development Projects (i.e., Credit
78-11WD, Loan 2011-IND and Loan 2430-IND), specifically, poor borrowpr
selection criteria, subsidized interest rates, insufficient spreads to the
intermediary and generous credit insurance, have been avoided in implementing
the KUPEDES scheme.  BRI's Unit Desa system is the only nationwide network
that serves a large group of small borrowers and savers whose access to
competitivc. nonsubsidized credit and savings facilities, in the absence of
this program, would be limited. During the past six years, the Unit Desas'
success has demonstrated convincingly that a nonsubsidized credit scheme aimed
at enhancing the access of creditworthy small borrowers to credit can be
successfully implemented within the context of a financially viable operation
that can also produce substantial socioeconomic benefits. Equally important,
the Unit Desa system has demonstrated the potential for mobilizing large
amounts of domestic resources at the small saver level. The Unit Desa system
embodies the model that should be encouraged by the Bank in designing such
programs. The proposed loan and ongoing supervision assistance will help
ensure its long-term sustainability.
4.       Proiect Obiectives.  The primary objective of the proposed project is
to promote BRI's ongoing efforts to strengthen and expand its Unit Desa system
as a financially viable subbranch network that mobilizes resources and
provides nonsubsidized credit nationwide to creditworthy small borrowers. The
project would also provide continued support to develop BRI's institutional
capability as related to its Unit Desa system.
5.       Project Description.  The proposed project would compriset  (i) a
credit component for general purpose financing in all sectors; (ii) a capital
expenditure component for the expansion of BRI's five Unit Desa training
centers, including computer equipment; and (iii) a technical assistance (TA)
component for long-term advisory and short-term consulting services for
further developing and improving BRI's Unit Desa and rural banking activities.
The proposed Bank loan would finance: (i) productive activities undertaken by
small borrowers in all sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, trade
and services; (ii) the construction of training facilities; (iII) computers;
(iv) nine staff-years of long-term advisory services; and tv) four staff-years
of short-term consultancies. The estimated total financing requirement for
the project is $2.6 billion equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$788 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
8644-IND, dated July 10, 1990, is being distributed separately.
6.       Agreed Actions.  Prior to negotiations, BRI:  (a) implemented,
effective May 1,;1990, its revised RUPEDES loan parameters, including a



-3-
subloan ceiling and modification of the interest rate structure so that
effective cross-subsidization of investment lending is eliminated. Working
capital and investment loans to end-users now carry the same rate; and
(b) adopted its revised Unit Desa Policy and Strategy Statements. The
Government will onlend the proceeds of the loan to BRI at a variable interest
rate pegged to Bl's three-month domestic money market certificate (Sertifikat
Bank Indonesia-SBI), subject to a ceiling based on the average of end-of-day
quotations of the five state-owned commercial banks' three-month time
deposits. Terms of reference for the long-term advisory positions as well as
a number of institutional arrangements, as provided under the first KUPEDES
Project, were agreed during negotiationst (a) modification of the interest
rate structure for KUPEDES loans to final borrowers would only be done after
consultation with the Bank; (b) the agreement between BRI and BI concerning
the repayment by BRI of liquidity credits originally provided to start.up the
KUPEDES program would not be changed without the Bank's agreement; (c) BRI
would allocate (on a semi-annual basis) to the Unit Desa Development Fund at
least 50 percent of the margin between the cost to itself of the Bank loan
proceeds and the onlending rate to the Unit Desas; and td) should arrears of
one day or more exceed 8 percent of the KUPEDES loan portfolio over a
continuous six-month period, BRI would, within three months, submit to the
Bank information relating to actions taken and its action plan to reduce such
arrears.
7.       Benefits.  The Unit Desa system would be expanded and continued
access to credit by eligible borrowers would be ensured under the proposed
project. Substantial socioeconomic benefits, as achieved under the Unit
Desas' previous lending activities, can be expected from an expanding KUPEDES
program.
8.       Risks.  The major risk--portfolio deterioration--is mitigated by
BRI's satisfactory track record to date. Appropriate staff training and
advisory support services will contribute towards the continued implementation
of sound lending and supervision procedures that are associated with the
maintenance of a high-quality loan portfolio.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
