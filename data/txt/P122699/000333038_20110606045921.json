US$100\n            million on the payment terms and conditions set out in the\n            President's Memorandum (R2011-0112). Directors\n            expressed support for the DPL and acknowledged its focus on\n            creating fiscal space for social expenditures and enhancing\n            the protection and inclusion of vulnerable groups. They\n            noted that the Bank's support is critical following the\n            2009 crisis that hit El Salvador's economy and set back\n            the social progress achieved in previous years. Looking\n            ahead and noting uncertainties for growth and deficits,\n            Directors highlighted the importance of tax system reforms.\n            Directors welcomed the consultative and participatory manner\n            in which the program was prepared. Finally, aid coordination\n            and continued consultations and consensus building to\n            facilitate the implementation of the program were also encouraged."}, "docdt": "2011-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
