Program Development   The proposed DPL series supports the Government objective of
Objective(s) and      promoting social development and inclusion, while maintaining a
Contribution to CPS   sustainable medium term fiscal framework. In particular, the operation
                      supports the Government’s efforts aimed at:
                           (i) Creating fiscal space for needed social expenditure by
                                supporting actions to increase tax revenues and to improve
                                efficiency and transparency in the allocation of public
                                resources. These actions are fully consistent with the CPS
                                strategic objective of strengthening fundamentals for economic
                                recovery by addressing macro and institutional vulnerabilities.
                                In fact, the actions cover a number of strategic areas supported
                                by the CPS such as expanding fiscal space, implementing
                                results based budgeting, and enhancing access to information
                                and fiscal transparency.
                           (ii) Protecting and including vulnerable segments of the population
                                by allocating additional public resources towards social
                                programs targeting vulnerable groups such as the elderly,
                                women, and children in poor areas. The actions supported by
                                these operations are fully consistent with the CPS strategic
                                objective of strengthening delivery of social services.
Risks and Risk        The program supported by the Public Finance DPL series is
Mitigation            subject to three main risks, namely:
                      i) Political Risk: This risk arises from the polarized political climate in
                      El Salvador which could impinge on the approval of the reforms critical
                      for the success of the program and of multilateral loans by Congress.
                      This risk is being mitigated by the consultation process followed by
                      authorities on policy reform. The Government program has been
                      discussed with key stakeholders such as the private sector and civil
                      society.
                      ii) Macroeconomic Risk: This risk derives from the global financial
                      crisis, more specifically from prolonged global deceleration, or a
                      worsening of the global economy in the context of increasing fuel and
                      food prices. The global crisis has had a significant impact on El
                      Salvador’s economy, in particular on the fiscal accounts. A prolonged
                      recession or worsening of the global economy could threaten
                      sustainability. This risk is mitigated by the design of the reform
                      program and medium-term framework supported by this operation. A
                      critical component of the effort to mitigate macroeconomic risks is the
                      authority’s prudent fiscal policy.
                      iii) Natural Disaster Risk: El Salvador is vulnerable to multiple
                      natural disasters. The adverse effects of such events are being mitigated
                      by strengthening disaster management systems and building a strong
                      safety net to help the vulnerable segments of the population to better
                      withstand recurring shocks. The Bank has recently prepared a CAT-
                      DDO operation that will provide financing in case of emergency.

                    IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
           PROPOSED PUBLIC FINANCE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS DPL
                   TO THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This program document describes a proposed Development Policy Loan (DPL) in
the amount of US$100 million to the Republic of El Salvador. The operation is the first in
a proposed series of two loans. The series builds on the progress achieved under the Public
Finance and Social Sector (PFSS) DPL (January, 2009) and Sustaining Social Gains for
Economic Recovery Program (SSGER) DPL (November, 2009). It reflects the Government’s
priority of achieving fiscally and economically sustainable social progress. In particular, the
DPL series supports the Government’s program to create fiscal space needed for sustainable
social spending, enhance the social gains achieved during the last decade and protect
vulnerable segments of the population.

2.      Promoting social development and inclusion is the main objective of the Funes
administration. However, the global crisis increased the urgency of addressing
structural fiscal vulnerabilities in order to implement sustainable social programs.
Because of its strong links to the U.S. economy, El Salvador has been severely impacted by
the global financial crisis. Despite the Government efforts to restrain non-priority spending
and to focus resources in a comprehensive anti-crisis plan, the country experienced significant
economic, social, and fiscal deterioration in 2008-2009. As a result of this period of distress,
El Salvador’s public debt increased from 39 percent of the GDP in 2007 to 50 percent in
2009. While the current administration has set social progress as a key priority, it recognizes
that addressing fiscal vulnerabilities and ensuring sustainability are necessary steps for
achieving long lasting social gains. For this reason, the Government has requested the Bank’s
support for carrying out a program of reforms that will help to implement a sustainable
medium term fiscal framework, while creating fiscal space for additional social investment.
The Government also requested support for continuing advancing the social agenda, and in
particular the protection of vulnerable segments of the population, in parallel to its fiscal
achievements.

3.       The proposed operation is rooted in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
El Salvador. The proposed DPL series has been identified in the 2009 CPS as an instrument
for providing continued support to the policy areas covered by the previous DPLs, such as
fiscal reform, public sector management, and the protection of vulnerable populations. The
operation is fully consistent with the CPS’s guiding principle of supporting Government
efforts to mitigate the fiscal impact of the crisis while addressing longer-term development
challenges. It directly contributes to two of the three key objectives proposed by the
document: strengthening fundamentals for economic recovery by addressing macro and
institutional vulnerabilities and strengthening delivery of social services.

                                   II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

4.     Since the end of the 12-year civil war in 1991, El Salvador has made progress in
consolidating peace and democracy, but politics remain polarized. The national political
stage is dominated by two main political parties – the National Republic Alliance Party
(ARENA) and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front Party (FMLN). ARENA held
the executive branch of the Government from 1991 until March 2009, when the FMLN
candidate, Mauricio Funes, won the presidential election. The FMLN’s victory in both
Presidential and Congressional elections, after 20 years in the opposition, and the smooth
handover of political power are milestones in the country’s political history.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN EL SALVADOR

       Economic Developments prior to the global financial crisis

5.      The post-war period in El Salvador has been characterized by an aggressive
reform agenda. Starting in the 1990s, successive administrations undertook significant
stabilization and modernization efforts. Structural reforms included trade liberalization, re-
privatization of the financial sector, tax reforms, and improvements in the competitiveness
environment. The adoption of the US dollar as legal tender in 2001 resulted in lower inflation,
reducing business uncertainty and lowering interest rates. Committed to an outward-oriented
development strategy, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Dominican Republic -
Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) with the United States. The end of the
armed conflict and consecutive reform resulted in high economic growth, which during the
1990s, averaged about 6 percent per annum. Yet, economic performance slowed down in the
early 2000s to less than 2 percent. This deceleration reflected a series of external and internal
shocks, including the global slowdown following 9/11, a devastating earthquake in 2001, the
impacts of the “coffee crisis” on agricultural output, and a cyclical reduction in private
investment associated with the 2004 presidential elections.

6.      Economic growth peaked again in the mid 2000s driven by strong internal
demand. Over the 2005-2007 period, economic growth improved steadily from 3.1 percent to
4.3 percent (the highest level in about a decade) following an improvement in the external
environment. Growth was driven mainly by rising remittances, which accounted on average
for 17.5 percent of GDP and became a major source of financing for consumption and
investment. However, the external sector contribution to GDP growth became increasingly
negative. The current account deficit increased from 3.6 percent in 2005 to 6.0 percent in
2007, on the back of the expanding trade deficit and the interest payments on a rising external
debt stock.

7.      The mid 2000s were also characterized by improvements on the fiscal front
driven by the Government’s efforts to control spending and increase tax revenues.
Revenues increased by nearly 1.0 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2007, while spending
fell by 0.8 percent for the same period. As a result, the non financial public sector deficit
narrowed from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 1.9 percent in 2007. Notably, the primary fiscal
balance showed a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2007 for the first time in more than a
decade.

                                               6
8.      Economic growth was accompanied by advances in the country’s social
conditions. Growth, together with increases in social spending, contributed to improvements
in the country’s social indicators. The poverty headcount fell by nearly one half since the end
of the conflict. By 2007, about 34.6 percent of Salvadoran households were poor, including
about 10.8 percent extremely poor (versus 59.7 percent and 28.2 percent, respectively, in
1991). In addition, access to basic services such as safe water and sanitation increased by
more than 15 percentage points during that period and core health outcomes, such as life
expectancy, infant and child mortality, and child nutrition all improved as well.1 On the
education front, net enrollment in primary and secondary education expanded 12 percentage
points each, reaching 94 percent and 54 percent respectively in 2007.

        Impact of the crisis and Government response

9.      El Salvador was negatively affected by the global financial crisis. The crisis, and in
particular the U.S. recession, has severely affected the Salvadoran economy. As a result of the
sharp fall in proceeds from remittances, the collapse in consumption and investment, and
reduced foreign demand, El Salvador’s GDP contracted by 3.5 percent in 2009. The
slowdown affected all sectors, with manufacturing, construction, and retail being the most
impacted. In addition to the effects of the crisis, agriculture output contracted due to a tropical
storm late in 2009.

10.      Despite the economic impacts of the crisis, dollarization withstood the turmoil
without major strains. El Salvador’s financial system has not shown signs of distress during
the crisis period. The system maintained adequate levels of liquidity, although there has been
some tightening of credit. In the external sector, pressures created by the drop in exports (17
percent) and remittances (7.1 percent) were more than compensated by a sharp decline in
imports (25 percent) in 2009. The improvement in the trade balance contributed to a reduction
of the external current account deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2009 from 7.6 percent in 2008.
Net capital flows also fell, but remained positive overall, as higher Government borrowing
more than offset private capital outflows and low foreign direct investments (FDI) flows. As a
result, net international reserves rose by about US$430 million in 2009.

11.     External shocks significantly impacted social outcomes. The gains in poverty
reduction achieved during the last decade were partially reversed by the crisis. The poverty
rate reached 40 percent at the end of 2008 and remained relatively high at 37.8 percent in
2009, while extreme poverty increased to 12.4 percent and 12 percent in 2008 and 2009
respectively. The poor, and in particular the urban poor, were severely affected by the food
crisis of 2008. Food prices remained stagnant in 2009 but so did the principal sources of
income for the poor. For example, remittance flows dropped 7.1 percent in 2009, and the
number of registered jobs fell almost 4 percent (Figure 1), driven by a contraction in labor
intensive activities such as maquilas, construction, and commerce.

 Between 1991 and 2007, life expectancy increased from 64.4 to 71.3, infant and child mortality rates decreased
more than 60 percent and child malnutrition fell from 11.2 percent to 8.6 percent.

12.     The authorities prepared an Anti-crisis Plan for the period of 2009-2011. The
Plan amounted to US$587.5 million (2.8 percent of the GDP) and included actions to generate
temporary jobs and increase the coverage of the social security system. It also included
programs to build popular housing and basic infrastructure, improve nutrition, and combat
crime and violence. The extra spending resulting from the Plan was partially compensated
with cuts in the executive budget of all line ministries (except education and health), a general
hiring freeze, strict guidelines on goods and services expenditures, and limits on hiring of
external consultants. The authorities also slowed the execution of the public investment
program and re-prioritized projects.

13.     Despite Government’s efforts to restrain non priority spending, the fiscal
situation has become increasingly tight. Since 2008 total revenues have fallen at a faster
rate than expenditures. The economic slowdown contributed to a drop in tax revenues from
13.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 12.4 percent in 2009. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit
increased from 3.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 5.6 percent in 2009 while the debt-to-GDP ratio
raised from 41.1 to 50 percent. The deterioration of the fiscal situation became the main
source of macroeconomic risk.

14.     The fiscal risks are associated with structural shortcomings realized during the
crisis. El Salvador is characterized by low levels of public spending and a relatively rigid
budget, with little room for expenditure reassignments. In addition, a large part of social
spending at the time of the crisis was committed to poorly targeted subsidies. The country is
also characterized by low levels of tax revenues and a relatively narrow tax base, making
revenues particularly sensitive to economic fluctuations. These factors limit El Salvador’s
ability to accommodate external shocks without compromising productive investment and/or
fiscal sustainability.

                                                Box 1: Structural fiscal shortcomings
Public spending in El Salvador is relatively low compared to Latin American and Central
American countries and has remained consistently above Government revenues. During 2000–
2009, current expenditures averaged 16.6 percent of GDP. When needed, expenditure adjustments
relied mostly on capital expenditure (capital spending ranged from 25.4 percent of total
nonfinancial public spending in 2002 to 14.5 percent in 2009) due to the rigidity in almost two-
thirds of the budget. Three types of expenditures contribute to the spending rigidity: public sector
payroll (an average of 7.4 percent of GDP); interest payments, which have grown in the last five
years to about 2.4 percent of GDP; and current transfers, which averaged 3.5 percent of GDP.
These three items amount to about 65 percent of NFPS expenditure and over 100 percent of the
tax revenues in the last decade. In fact, more than one-third of total expenditure is dedicated to
wages and salaries. However, current transfers show an increasing trend since 2007 in response to
the establishment of new subsidies, the cost of pensions, and transfers to other autonomous
entities and local Governments. Transfers increased from 12.9 percent of total expenditures in
2006 to 20.6 percent and 18.8 percent in 2008 and 2009, partially driven by higher commodity
prices. Interest payments also increased considerably from 2000 to 2009—from 1.4 percent of
GDP to 2.4 percent of GDP, reflecting the short-term structure of the debt as well as higher
interest costs under the negative external environment.

Tax revenues as a percent of GDP are very low in El Salvador and they represent a constraint for
expanding public services and social aid. While in the OECD countries tax revenues were about
27 percent of GDP on average in 2008, tax revenues in Latin America were about 16.1 percent,
and in El Salvador, the share of tax revenue as a percent of GDP was 13.0 percent in 2008 (from
10.2 percent in 2000 and 12.5 percent in 2005). Additionally, a large part of Government revenues
are generated through indirect taxes, which makes the Salvadoran tax system regressive.
Informality is also a serious constraint, narrowing the country’s tax base. The informal sector is
estimated to represent 54 percent2 of the total economic activity in El Salvador. In addition, as
pointed out by the 2010 El Salvador Public Expenditure Review, despite the reforms implemented
in the past decade, the tax administration remained weak due to under-qualified staff, weak
delegation, dysfunctional organization and coordination among tax agencies and complex
procedures.

15.    In order to cope with the crisis, El Salvador entered an IMF Stand-by
Arrangement (SBA) in February 2010. The program envisions a gradual increase in the
primary surplus to bring the public debt to sustainable levels by 2015. Fiscal consolidation
under the program is achieved by maintaining total spending while significantly increasing
public revenues. Projections assume that the Government will implement a broad set of
reforms to address fiscal vulnerabilities. The first and second reviews of the IMF Agreement
confirmed that all performance criteria of the program were met as of March 2011, while it
emphasized the need to continue with the implementation of structural reforms.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

16.     The Salvadoran economy has started to recover from the global crisis, but the
speed of the recovery is still uncertain. Recent economic indicators suggest that the
economy is gaining strength, albeit at a slow pace. El Salvador’s economic performance
remained modest in 2010. The economy grew 0.7 percent in the year below the IMF
projections (1 percent) and much below the neighboring countries3. Economic activity started
picking up towards the end of the year, expanding 3.4 percent in December 2010 compared to
the previous year. The expansion was mainly driven by commerce and tourism (10.3 percent)
and agriculture (5.7 percent), fostered by a recovery in external demand. In fact, exports
expanded 17.8 in 2010, partially compensating for an increase of 17.5 percent in imports. The
pace of recovery in El Salvador is tied to the dynamics of the U.S. economy, which are still
uncertain. In addition, economic performance is vulnerable to other external shock such as a
significant increase in commodity prices (Box 2). Current projections foresee GDP growth
rates of about 2.5 percent in 2011, and 3 percent in 2012.

17.    Inflation is expected to remain under control in the medium term. Inflation
remains low, although slightly higher than initially forecasted. The consumer price index
increased 2.1 percent in 2010 partially driven by higher commodity prices, which are
expected to continue imposing upward pressures on internal prices in 2011. Inflation is
expected to reach 4.8 percent this year and remain between 2.8 and 4.2 percent for the 2012-
2015 period.

18.     Despite the 2009 recession, the financial system remains well-capitalized and
liquid although risks remain. Credit has contracted sharply and banks moved into liquid
assets with lower risk weighting. The capital adequacy ratio for the system reached 17.5
percent at end 2010 (up from 16.6 percent one year ago) while liquid assets covered about 43
percent of deposits. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio has stabilized at 4.1 percent in 2010
after increasing sharply in 2009 and provisions coverage remains at about 100 percent of
NPLs. Profitability has recovered with return on assets (ROA) increasing from 0.35 percent in
November 2009 to 0.9 percent in November 2010. Domestic factors are considered an
important source for systemic risks as mentioned recently by Standard & Poor’s when
downgrading the country sovereign risk. In an extreme scenario, uncertainties could trigger
deposit withdrawals and discourage the roll‐over of external funding lines.

19.     The current account deficit is expected to deteriorate in the medium term, as
import demand increases and commodity prices rise. The current account balance posted a
deficit of US$464 million in 2010 (2.1 percent of GDP), higher than the 1.8 percent reported
in 2009. Exports have increased by 17.8 percent in 2010 due to the recovery in import
demand in the United States and other Central American countries, partially offsetting import
growth of 17.5 percent in the same period. The recovery in imports and exports noted above is
expected to continue in 2011 and 2012 as both the global and domestic economic recoveries
firm up. Yet, the trade balance is expected to worsen in the period due to the evolution of
commodity prices (of which El Salvador is a net importer). The expected widening in the
current account deficit should be compensated by higher capital inflows therefore releasing
external pressures.

     Guatemala, the second lowest growing country, grew 2.6 percent in 2010.

             Box 2: Potential impacts of high commodity prices in El Salvador

Rising commodity prices will likely impact commodity importers such as El Salvador. As the
world economy recovers from the financial crisis, the demand for commodities started increasing
again, restoring upward pressures in prices. In fact, the FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) increased
by 38 percent over the past 12 months reaching its highest level since January 1990. Similarly,
international oil prices (WTI) increased 24 percent over the last year. These price increases are
already being transmitted to the El Salvador economy. The country’s Food CPI increased 6.4
percent in the last 12 months while internal gasoline and diesel prices increased 13.4 and 26
percent, respectively over the same period.

Higher fuel and food prices can affect different dimensions of El Salvador’s economy. On the
macroeconomic front, higher fuel prices can generate inflationary, external and fiscal pressures.
During the 2008 fuel and food price rise, pass-through effects from commodity inflation to core
prices resulted in an increase of CPI inflation from 3.2 percent in mid-2007 to 9.7 percent in mid-
2008. El Salvador terms of trade deteriorated almost 10 percent in the same period, leading to an
increase of almost 7 percent in the trade deficit. On the fiscal side, higher fuel and food prices
helped to increase revenues from import and consumption taxes, but the increase in subsidy
spending from US$235.4 million in 2007 to US$455.5 in 2008 more than offset the revenue gains
negatively impacting the fiscal deficit.

The impact of high fuel and food prices is even larger among the poor. Poor households tend
to dedicate a much larger fraction of their income to the purchase of food and fuel products.
According to a recent Bank study, a household in the lowest quintile spends on average 58.7
percent of income in food while a typical household in the highest quintile spends 34.3 percent. In
fact, the 2008 rise in food prices was associated with a significant increase in poverty rates even
though the country had positive per capita GDP growth that year. After decreasing for almost a
decade, the urban poverty rate increased 8 percentage points between 2006 and 2008, while the
rural poverty rate increased by more 13 percentage points.

In contrast to the 2008 episode, the Government now has tools that allow for a timely and
targeted response. El Salvador policy responses to the 2008 food and fuel price episode were
mainly related to an increase in generalized subsidies. Since then, the Government has
significantly improved the targeting of existing electricity, water, and gas subsidies. In addition,
the Government has expanded its conditional cash transfer program (Comunidades Solidarias) to
the poorest rural municipalities and to vulnerable urban households. The aforementioned
instruments could be expanded in order to provide a temporary and targeted relief to the most
vulnerable segments of the population, with lower fiscal impacts.

Looking forward, the Government should also consider policy options to improve and
expand supply. First, enhancing market information and competition can be critical to ensure
market efficiency, therefore preventing price increases not justified by fundamentals. In this
context, improving the regulatory framework and fostering competition both in production and
distribution of food and fuel products would be steps in the right direction. Second, supply chain
management and better infrastructure can reduce losses and distribution costs (known to be a
significant share of the final price paid by consumers). Similarly, programs for removing barriers
to agricultural production can contribute to an expansion in the food supply.

20.     Despite the deterioration of the fiscal situation during the crisis, projections
suggest a sustainable medium-term fiscal outlook. El Salvador’s fiscal balance improved in
2010. Public spending increased 3.3 percent reaching 21.8 percent of the GDP, while tax
revenues increased almost 10.4 percent in the same period reaching 13.3 percent of GDP. The
overall non financial public sector deficit ended 2010 at 4.2 percent of GDP, well below the
4.8 percent targeted by the IMF agreement. Fiscal financing conditions have also improved in
2010 as the Government received multilateral budgetary support and project loans. Roll-over
                                                                                                                                                                                                         15
risks associated with short-term bill (Letes) maturities were reduced due to the decline in
outstanding Letes from over US$ 430.5 million in December 2009 to US$190.9 million in
December 2010. Additionally, the Government has successfully issued US$653.5 million in
30 year bonds with 7.625 percent coupons used to pre-finance 2011 obligations. In line with
the IMF program, fiscal projections indicate that net tax revenues will continue to increase
gradually reaching 15.6 percent of GDP by 2013, while total public expenditures are sustained
around 21.5 percent of GDP. This would bring down the overall deficit to 2 percent of GDP.
In turn, the fiscal program would be consistent with an initial increase in the public sector
debt to GDP ratio to 51.5 in 2011 before entering in a declining path to reach 47.1 percent in
2015.

21.     Consultation and consensus building among the key stakeholders regarding the
Government’s fiscal program will be critical. On the expenditure side, the authorities have
committed to reducing poorly targeted subsidies on liquefied gas and electricity, while
maintaining outlays on goods and services broadly constant in real terms, and reallocating
resources towards target social spending. On the revenue side, the pickup in economic activity
and the continued effect of the 2009 tax changes are expected to help lift revenues in the short
run. Nevertheless, the Government strategy envisions implementing a number of tax
measures, such as administration measures aimed at improving the tax collection system,
strengthening tax recovery instruments, auditing and control of large taxpayers, and fighting
tax evasion. Improvements in tax administration are expected to generate an additional 0.4
percent of GDP in tax revenues until 2012 and a total of 1 percent by 2015. In addition, the
authorities contemplate new tax measures that are going to be implemented as part of a Fiscal
Pact formulated in consultation with key stakeholders. Contemplated measures will help to
simplify the tax system, bring it more in line with neighboring countries, reduce its
regressivity and safeguard the revenue target in case downside risks were to materialize. The
measures under consideration are consistent with the ongoing IMF supported program and
related technical assistance activities. Funes is launching a process of consensus building on
the Pact with private sector and civil society in the new Social and Economic Council. Bank
staff expects the contemplated measures to be proposed to Congress around mid-2011.

22.      A debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that the medium-term public debt
position is sustainable, but sensitive to an economic slowdown and to lack of fiscal
consolidation. The DSA in Annex 4 indicates that the current level of public debt in
combination with the fiscal program in the Government’s medium term macroeconomic
framework is sustainable. However, the analysis points out two main sources of uncertainty
regarding the baseline underlying assumptions: (i) the speed of economic recovery after the
crisis, and (ii) the progress in implementing the fiscal consolidation. The debt path remain
sustainable under a number of deviations from the baseline scenario including higher real
interest rates and temporary shock in the primary balance and in economic growth, such as
those potentially generated by temporary increases in international commodity prices.
Nevertheless, a significantly slower GDP growth rate (consistent with a negative shock of
more than 1 percentage point per year over the whole forecasting period) or absence of fiscal
consolidation would result in unsustainable debt dynamics. The results of the DSA stress the
need for implementing the tax and spending measure currently under consideration by the
Government as well as for considering further adjustments should actual growth rates in the
economy resemble those in the simulated low growth scenario.

23.    On the whole, and notwithstanding the economic risks to the near-term outlook,
El Salvador’s macroeconomic policies are deemed adequate for development policy
lending. Fiscal policy remains prudent and consistent with the medium-term sustainability, as
also confirmed by the second review of the IMF SBA approved on March 31, 2011. In
addition, the dollarization regime is expected to remain strong during the term of this project.

      III. THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

24.    After its inauguration in June 2009, the current administration prepared and
presented a comprehensive Development Plan for the period 2010-2014 (2010-2014 Plan
Quinquenal de Desarrollo). The plan presents the priorities, objectives and expected
outcomes for the five-year presidential term. It was developed under extensive consultation
with Government employees, intellectuals and academics, as well as the private sector. The
plan was approved by the Economic and Social Counsel4, a consultative group created and
coordinated by the Government, composed by entrepreneurs, academics, social movements
and Government representatives.

25.     The Government plan makes overcoming economic, social, and political
inequality a priority. The Government plan consists of ten pillars, linked to ten key
objectives and targeted outcomes for the 2010-2014 period. Table 3 presents the main
elements of the plan. This DPL operation will support actions consistent with two main
objectives of the Government plan: (i) expanding fiscal space by substantially increasing tax
revenues, increasing the efficiency and transparency in the use of such resources and reducing
the public debt, and (ii) reverting the rise in poverty rates observed in the last years and
expanding basic social services in rural and urban areas, especially to vulnerable segments of
the population and, in particular women.

     I. The Government program for increasing taxes, increasing transparency and efficiency
in the allocation of public resources and reducing public debt.

26.     Low levels of tax revenues have gradually become a binding constraint for
economic and social progress. El Salvador has been one of the Latin American countries
with the smallest tax burden, with most of tax revenues being collected through indirect and
regressive taxes value-added tax (VAT). The pressures for meeting society’s increasing
demand for better public and social services have been a major challenge for the authorities.

 The Economic and Social Counsel is a consultative group including private sector representatives, trade unions,
and civil society organizations created by the Government with the mandate of preparing and discussing
proposals to address strategic development challenges including a comprehensive fiscal reform. The group was
created with the purpose of building consensus and strengthening democratic institutions.

   27.    Fiscal reforms and economic growth increased Government revenues in the 2000-
   2008 period, but the spread of the global crisis and the slowdown in economic activity
   partially reversed these gains. Major revenue reforms have been implemented since 2000,
                                                          19
which contributed to raising the efficiency of tax collection, simplifying the tax system,
broadening the tax base, and strengthening tax administration. The reforms contributed to an
increase in tax revenues of 3.4 percentage points of GDP in seven years (from 10 percent of
GDP in 2000 to 13.4 percent in 2007). However, recent economic developments reduced
revenues back to 12.4 percent of GDP in 2009. The Government of El Salvador is committed
to restoring the pre-crisis positive trend in tax revenues, necessary for the implementation of
the Government five-year Plan (the plans projects that revenues will increase 3 percentage
points of GDP in the 2010-2015). For this, the Government has defined a strategy involving
new tax measures that build on progress already achieved in the previous decade. In
particular, the Tax Code introduced in 2000 and the series of major reforms implemented
during 2002–04: upgraded the auditing, control, and computational systems, changes to the
VAT, the income tax and specific taxes, the criminal code, and related regimes.

28.     The Government strategy for raising tax revenues relies on a combination of tax
administration and tax policy reforms. In order to maximize the gains from adjusting tax
rates the Government is focusing on addressing shortcomings in tax administration.
Differently from most countries, tax collection responsibilities in El Salvador are divided
between three agencies: Internal Revenue Agency (DGII), the Customs Agency (DGA), and
the Ministry of Finance’s Treasury Office (DGT). The Government strategy involves
strengthening and modernizing each individual agency while gradually increasing the
historically low levels of coordination and integration among agencies. The idea is to
consolidate the agencies under a single vice-ministry of revenues. This strategy’s main goals
are to increase efficiency in tax collection and to reduce tax avoidance and evasion. Tax
policy measures are expected to be implemented in stages. The first stage was accomplished
with the 2009 tax reform and sought to provide a relief to the revenue strain imposed by the
crisis.

29.      Supported by donors, the Government has been working on strengthening
DGII’s institutional capacity. Following the diagnostics prepared by the IMF and USAID,
authorities have been implementing a broad set of activities for addressing the identified
weakness. Activities include: (i) organization and human resources restructuring, (supported
by USAID technical assistance and by the PFSS DPL); (ii) redesign of relevant DGII’s
strategies and procedures (supported by the IMF SBA, and the World Bank technical
assistance loan); (iii) support to tax payer’s services (supported by World Bank technical
assistance loan); and (iv) strengthening of DGII’s fiscalization and control mechanisms
(supported by the World Bank technical assistance loan and by this DPL). The strategy for
strengthening fiscalization and control includes the creation of an investigation unit and a
separated unit responsible for the selecting the cases to be investigated and possibly audit.
This unit was responsible for implementing an improved system of case selection and
management that follows international best practices. In addition to implementing and
managing the system, the unit of case selection is responsible for identifying stop-filers and
initiate investigations through a stop-filers call centers. Unsolved cases are then directed to
investigation unit and, in case of nonpayment, result in the suspension of the respective tax
identification numbers.

30.    The Government is also implementing actions to support DGA by strengthening
its auditing and control functions. The areas covered by these actions include: (i) the
redesign of relevant DGA’s strategies, norms and procedures (supported by the IMF SBA and
                                              20
the World Bank technical assistance loan); (ii) the development of a new customs
management system, including the acquisition of software and equipment to improve physical
controls over imported and exported goods and merchandise (supported by World Bank
technical assistance loan, IADB loan and the PFSS DPL); and (iii) the strengthening of
DGA’s fiscalization and control mechanisms (supported by the World Bank technical
assistance loan and by this DPL). DGA’s strategy for improving border control includes the
development of an advanced risk management system and the implementation of non-evasive
monitoring equipments in strategic custom points. The DGA’s border control system was first
supported by the PFSS DPL, but the action was waived following the Government’s decision
of implementing a more sophisticate system than the one initially supported. This improved
border control strategy is currently under implementation with the World Bank and IADB’s
support. DGA’s fiscalization mechanisms and auditing procedures were also strengthened by
developing and implementing an improved system for section and control of auditing
according to international best practices.

31.     The Government’s support to the DGT is based on actions to improve the agency
efficiency in tax collection and strengthening its tax recovery capacities. In particular, the
Government improved the efficiency of tax collection by expanding its electronic and online
payment system. DGT has been working on unified collection process under a single platform
for electronic payment (P@GOES). Initially designed to handle tax payment to DGII,
P@GOES has been recently expanded to incorporate contribution from three additional
Government agencies, Ministerio de Salud Pública y Asistencia Social; Ministerio de
Agricultura y Ganadería; and Fondo Social para la Vivienda. The system also expects to
incorporate payments handled by DGA in the near future. Electronic payments reduce
administration cost and the time required for updating and sharing information on payment
flows. In addition, the Government is implementing new reforms that strengthen the DGT’s
instruments for tax recovery; including the extension of the period for administrative claims
of late payments and the withholding of late payments from wage earner and Government
service providers.

32.     In addition, the Government has been working on improving the coordination
and integration of the three tax agencies. The coordination process has been heavily
supported by the donor community and is part of the World Bank, IMF, IADB and USAID
programs. The initiative started with the establishment of a cooperation agreement between
DGII and DGA to cross-check tax collection information, which was supported by the PFSS
DPL. The coordination process was also strengthened with the development of joint DGA and
DGII auditing as a way of further improving fiscalization (supported by the IMF SBA). The
integration and consolidation of different tax modalities into P@GOES also signals progress
towards integration. It represents an intermediary step for the creation of a single, unified
revenues account. Finally the Government is working on the coordination and full integration
of the agencies’ tax information and registration systems (action supported the second
operation in this DPL series). In parallel, the Government has been working with the support
of IADB in the design and creation of the Vice-ministry of revenues.

33.      The Government strategy includes other tax measures. The Government’s efforts
started in 2009 with the preparation of a fiscal reform including the creation of new taxes on
the registry of vehicles, the expansion of ad-valorem taxes on alcoholic and carbonated
beverages and tobacco, the extension of taxes on interest income to banks licensed abroad,
                                             21
and the creation of tax on interest income of individuals for interest income higher than
US$25,000. The reform approved by Congress on December 17, 2009 and effective on
January 4, 2010 is expected to generate an additional 0.8 percent of GDP in revenues. The
Government is currently discussing a second, more comprehensive set of measures which will
be formulated in consultation with key stakeholders. Authorities are considering tax measures
to simplify the tax system, decrease its regressivity, bring it closer to the systems of
neighboring countries, and safeguard the revenue target if downside risks were to materialize.
Contemplated measures include the creation of a single-tax system for micro and small
enterprises and a simplified retention system for wage earners. These reforms are expected to
increase efficiency by reducing tax collection cost and expand the tax base by reducing costs
and facilitating tax payment.

34.     In parallel to raising revenues, the Government is improving the efficiency and
transparency in the allocation of public resources. One area of focus is rationalization and
targeting of Government subsidies. According to the Bank’s 2010 Public Expenditure Review
(PER), subsidies tend to be ill targeted and in some cases regressive (LPG and Water).
Supported by recent World Bank (PFSS DPL and SSGER DPL) and IADB operations, the
Government has successfully reduced and improved the targeting of electricity, water, LPG
and transport subsidies. However, recent pressures emerging from a sharp increase in oil
prices led the Government to reconsider part of the reduction in transport subsidy in order to
mitigate the impact on gas retail prices. In line with the IMF recommendation, the
Government should assess the fiscal impacts of the measure and adjust resources allocation to
compensate for the extra expenses and avoid adverse impacts on fiscal aggregates.

35.     Strengthening public financial management (PFM) and planning are key areas in
the Government program. A recent assessment of the current situation in El Salvador,
undertaken jointly by the Bank and IADB, determined that the country’s PFM system already
possesses a number of strengths. In addition, the country’s integrated financial management
system (SAFI), conceived not only as a technological platform but as a set of rules, processes,
and skills, has contributed to fiscal discipline. Supported by the PFSS DPL, the Government
has expanded SAFI’s coverage to 95 percent of the public expenditure. The Government
intends to further strengthen PFM by creating of a single treasury payment account, which
would significantly improve liquidity management and control. An intermediary step for the
implementation of the single account is the full monitoring and management of balance and
flows to the different Government agencies. The DGT has developed a system to track
movements in the bank accounts of different Government agencies. It currently monitors 83
Central Government and decentralized institution accounting for 100 percent Government
accounts. Finally, another key element in the Government’s plan is to move towards a
medium-term and results-based budget (RBB) framework for allocating resources. This
approach emphasizes a “bottom-up” preparation of strategic plans and ensuing investment
programs, consistent with the “top-down” fiscal framework. Supported by the PFSS DPL, the
Government piloted the RBB framework on health and agriculture projects as part of the 2011
budget process and expects to expand the RBB framework to two additional agencies as part
of the 2012 budget process. Ministry of Education, Environment and Public Works are among
the main agencies considered for this exercise.

36.   Beyond improving expenditure management and controls, the Government’s
plan recognizes the importance of increasing efficiency and transparency of
                                              22
procurement processes. Supported by the Government PFSS DPL, the Government has
implemented an e-procurement platform (COMPRASAL) to publish public procurement
information. The use of COMPRASAL by central Government agencies has increased
transparency as well as the credibility of public procurement. This is particularly important
since this is an area commonly perceived as vulnerable to mismanagement and corruption. In
order to further strengthen El Salvador’s procurement system the Ministry of Finance has
been working on a 2011-2015 procurement strategy that combines legal and regulatory
reforms, training and capacity building activities, and efforts to improve and expand the
public procurement dissemination tool. A key element of the reforms is the enablement of
Framework Agreements, which are recognized internationally as a very strong tool to increase
efficiency, transparency and governance in the procurement of common use goods and
services. Another element of the strategy is the implementation of COMPRASALII, which
introduces new modules as well as improving the current functionality.

37.      The transparency and accountability agenda is critical in view of existing
negative perceptions and mistrust among some stakeholders. In fact, the Government plan
incorporates a comprehensive and structured response to the issue. The current administration
transparency strategy started with the design and launching of an effective Fiscal
Transparency Portal (supported by the PFSS DPL). The Portal facilitates access to public
finance and budgetary execution information by the general public and enables customized
queries from citizens. In addition, the Government has a functioning Citizen Observatory of
Public Works composed by representatives from the private sector and the National Chapter
of Transparency International. The Observatory is a joint initiative from public and private
institutions with the purpose of monitoring and evaluating public works activities, accessing
potential risks associated with misused of public resources and corruption. Finally a new
Access to Public Information Law has been approved. The Law, designed according to
international best practices, regulates and enforces the information released by all
Government agencies and private entities that operate with the public sector. The Government
expects to start the implementation of the Access to Public Information Law in the beginning
of 2012 by: (i) establishing an independent Transparency and Public Information overseen
agency, and (ii) electing its governing board.

38.     In order to minimize the risk and costs associated with the higher levels of public
debt, the Government is taking actions to strengthen debt management. For example, the
Government is implementing a plan for building technical and analytical capacity within the
department of Public Debt Management. The acquired capacity will help the unit to
formulation of medium and long term strategies for debt management. Following a recent
review of the potential sources of risk in El Salvador public debt, the Government has
successfully improved the public debt profile by converting the outstanding debt with
multilateral institutions to dollar-denominated debt and fixed interest rates. In addition, the
Government has substituted almost 60 percent short-term debt (LETES) by longer term
instruments such as Eurobonds and loans from multilateral institutions. Finally, the
Government has implemented through the Government’s multisectorial investment bank
(BMI) an initiative to transform the municipal debt profile using longer term, lower rates
instruments.

   II. Reverting the rise in poverty and expanding basic social services to vulnerable
segments of the population.

39.     Promoting social development and inclusion is a key objective of the current
administration. In fact, social programs are expected to be the primary destination of
Government resources under the Government plan. The Government plan seeks to revert the
increase in poverty rates that followed the recent economic downturn. It dedicates special
attention to the protection and social inclusion of the most vulnerable segments of the
population. Vulnerable segments include women, elderly individuals and children in poor
rural and urban areas. These groups tend to be particularly exposed to poverty, health and
nutrition problems, poor or no access to public services, organized crime and violence.

40.     The Government strategy to protect vulnerable households has been focused on
expanding effective and well-targeted safety net programs. The Comunidades Solidarias
program (former Redes Solidarias) is the Government’s main tool for implementing social
protection interventions. The Program was developed and implemented in partnership with
the World Bank. There is currently a wide consensus that the program is fulfilling its main
objectives of supporting the consumption of poor households and increasing their children’s
access to basic health, nutrition and education services. Indeed, an independent evaluation
found that the program is among the best in the region. Moreover, the expansion of Red
Solidaria in rural areas has been accompanied by significant increases in the availability of
public health and education services, thereby facilitating access to these services. Supported
by the PFSS DPL, the program reached full coverage of the 100 poorest rural municipalities
in the country. Assisted by the SSGER DPL, the Government has prepared the operational
framework for implementing the urban version of the program. The Comunidades Solidarias
Urbanas (co–financed by the IADB) incorporates most of the features of the original
program, but it also includes programs to address challenges that are more prevalent in urban
communities. For example, in areas more exposed to crime and violence, Comunidades
Solidarias Urbanas includes training and temporary income programs for young individuals
at risk. In parallel to social protection initiatives, the Government seeks to further protect
children and young individuals in communities at risk by extending the school period and
implementing cultural activities in the extra time. Finally, taking advantage of the targeting
mechanisms developed for Comunidades Solidarias program, the Government has developed
and implemented a new program of monetary transfers to poor elderly individuals with no
additional source of income. The program has already been implemented in the 32 poorest
rural municipalities of the country.

41.    Government actions to improve the protection of vulnerable groups, particularly
women, go beyond the implementation of safety net programs. The Government is
stepping up efforts to promote gender equality. El Salvador usually scores relatively high
among developing countries in terms of rights for women. The Salvadoran legislation
provides for equality in the exercise of civil and political rights. Similarly, the Family Code in
El Salvador does not discriminate against women and the Family Code explicitly states that
spouses have equal rights and duties. In practice, however, women represent a vulnerable
group especially in low income households. Early marriage is quite frequent among girls. A
2004 United Nations report estimated that 16 percent of girls between 15 and 19 years of age
were married, divorced or widowed. In addition, domestic violence against women is still
seen as socially acceptable by a large proportion of the population and few victims bring
                                               24
complaints. In face of these challenges, the Government has prepared a new national policy
for women protection and gender balance promotion. In addition, in order to improve gender
balance in public policies and in the allocation of public resources the Government is
developing a methodology for introducing the gender perspective in the Budget formulation
process.

                 IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM
LINK TO CPS

42.     The proposed operation is rooted in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The
proposed DPL series was identified in the 2009 CPS (Report No. 50642 discussed by the
Bank’s Board on November 24, 2009) as an instrument for providing continued support to the
policy areas covered by the PFSS DPL and the SSGER DPL, such as fiscal reform; public
sector management; and improving protection vulnerable populations. The operation is fully
consistent with the CPS guiding principal of supporting the Government’s efforts to mitigate
the fiscal impact of the crisis while addressing longer-term development challenges. It directly
contributes to two of the three key objectives proposed by the document: strengthening
fundamentals for economic recovery by addressing macro and institutional vulnerabilities and
strengthening delivery of social services (Table 4 presents the CPS objectives and areas of
support and identifies the ones addressed by this operation). In addition, the proposed DPL
series directly contributes to a number of CPS expected outcomes, including: (i) tax
legislation aimed at closing tax loopholes (ii) strengthened tax administration systems; (iii)
improvements in the ratings in PEFA indicator #12: “Multi-year perspective in fiscal
planning, expenditure policy and budgeting”; (iv) regulations to enhance public access to
fiscal information have been issued; and (v) percentage of public sector procurement
transactions recorded in COMPRASAL has been increased to at least 80 percent.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

43.     The operation has been prepared with extensive consultation with the IMF and
IADB. The purpose of these consultations was three-fold. First, the meetings intended to
promote knowledge sharing and inform participants about the latest analytical work
developed by each institution, especially in the areas of tax management, tax policy and
public expenditure. Second, the meetings provided an opportunity for coordinating efforts and
avoiding overlaps in actions supported by the different institutions. Finally, the meetings
helped to fine tune messages and recommendations provided by the different institutions. In
addition to these consultations, the team has met with USAID representatives in El Salvador
to learn about their technical assistance activities with the Ministry of Finance. Donors’
cooperation and coordination activities have been particularly relevant in supporting the
Government’s fiscal and public financial management agenda. Section III describes a few
cases in which donors supported complementary actions towards the same goal as, for
example, in the case of DGII’s strengthening and modernization efforts.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

44.     The proposed DPL series builds on other Bank operations. The PFSS DPL (FY09,
US$450 million, 2 tranches) focused on helping El Salvador strengthen medium-term fiscal
sustainability, supporting good governance and transparency in the use of public resources,
and maintaining steady improvements in social protection and education. This operation was
followed by the SSGER DPL (FY10, US$100 million) which supported the Government’s
immediate measures in the Anti-Crisis Plan to protect the poor. It also supported the process
of economic recovery through the design of initiatives and institutional strengthening in the
social sectors. In parallel to the SSGER DPL, the World Bank prepared two technical
assistance loans to El Salvador. The Income Support and Employability Project (FY10,
US$50 million) and the Fiscal Management and Public Sector Performance Technical
Assistance loan (FY10, US$20 million). Annex 6 presents a brief summary of each of these
operations.

45.      The reform agenda supported by this operation has direct links to these other
operations. In particular, the reform agenda for creating fiscal space for social investment
builds on the fiscal and public financial management actions supported by the PFSS DPL. In
addition, many of the actions supported in the first and second operations of the proposed
DPL series will be implemented with the support of the Fiscal Management and Public Sector
Performance Technical Assistance loan. The reform agenda for investing in the protection and
social inclusion of vulnerable groups builds on social protection actions supported by the
PFSS DPL and by the SSGER DPL. Finally, the implementation of some of the social actions
is also supported by the Income Support and Employability Project.

LESSONS LEARNED

46.     As reflected in the 2005-2008 CAS Completion Report, consensus-building efforts
are critical to the success of a program. Consultation and consensus-building activities are
essential to ensure successful approval and implementation of the program in a politically
polarized environment. The process followed in the preparation of this DPL builds on the
successful experience of the PFSS DPL and SSGER DPL, which were discussed and agreed
                                            26
with the main political parties, as approval of loans with a sovereign guarantee requires a two-
thirds congressional majority.

47.     Another important lesson drawn from the previous operation is that analytical
work is an extremely important tool for project preparation. Analytical work helps to
identify gaps in specific sectors, inform stakeholders, build consensus around important
development issues, and prepare the groundwork for future engagement in areas of mutual
interest. Experience in El Salvador has shown that the Government greatly values the range of
global expertise the Bank can bring to complex development issues. In particular, the
comprehensive PER concluded in 2010 provided great support to the proposed DPL series.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

48.    The design of the proposed operation benefited from the findings and
recommendations of several recent analytical pieces. Table 5 lists the analytical pieces that

and the policy actions supported by this DPL.

needed social spending and to increase the protection and social inclusion of vulnerable
groups. The operation reflects the Government’s request for continuity in the support of
strategic areas previous addressed by Public Finance and Social Sector and Sustained Social
Gains for Economic Recovery Program DPLs. The operation is fully consistent with the CPS
strategic principles and objectives. A series of two single tranche operations is an appropriate
instrument in view of El Salvador’s economic context and political cycle. While it provides
incentives for carrying out the expected actions and triggers to the second operation, the series
is flexible enough changes in the Government strategy as long as these changes are still
consistent to the agreed development objective.

50.     The proposed operation is designed to support the implementation of the
Government’s medium-term development plan as part of the Bank’s multi-year
engagement with El Salvador. The primary development objectives of this DPL series are to
support the Government’s efforts to implement a sustainable medium-term fiscal framework,
while creating fiscal space for needed social spending and for the protection and social
inclusion of vulnerable segments of the population. The Government has been taking actions
to increase tax revenues, improve efficiency and transparency in the allocation of public
resources and to plan and invest on interventions that target the protection and social inclusion
of vulnerable groups. The proposed operation supports selective and critical actions in these
areas. By supporting fiscal sustainability and efficiency, policy actions contribute to the
macroeconomic stability and lay the foundation for El Salvador’s economic growth and
poverty alleviation. In addition, actions to protect vulnerable groups will help to improve
standards of living among the poorest segment of the population, further contribute to poverty
alleviation.

51.     The DPL series is designed around two pillars covering four areas connected to
key priorities in the Government’s development plan. The first pillar, creating fiscal space
for needed social spending comprises three main policy areas: (i) improving efficiency in tax
collection and expanding the tax base; (ii) increasing tax revenues; and (iii) promoting
efficiency, transparency and accountability in the allocation of public resources. This first
pillar is directly linked with the Government’s five-year development plan objective of
increasing taxes, increasing transparency and efficiency in the allocation of public resources
and reducing public debt. The second pillar, protecting and socially including vulnerable
groups, is linked to the policy area: protecting vulnerable groups, such as woman, elderly
individuals and children in poor regions. This policy area is linked with the Government’s
five-year development plan objective of reverting the rise in poverty and expanding basic
social services to vulnerable segments of the population. While the Government program in
these pillars is wide-ranging, this operation supports a reduced set of critical policy actions
chosen based on relevance, timing for implementation and on coordination with other donors’
activities.

52.     Table 6 summarizes the policy areas and actions supported by Public Finance
and Social Progress DPL series. Annex 2 presents the complete policy matrix, including
actions and the expected outcomes of the operation. All prior actions to the first loan are
expected to be implemented by April 2011. Triggers for the second operation are intended to
be implemented by April 2012. Finally, the combined outcomes of the two operations will be
measured by the result indicators that will be presented on the last column of the policy
matrix.

       Pillar 1: Creating fiscal space for needed social spending

53.     Low levels of tax revenues, increasing pressures from public services delivery and
social aid, and the adverse effects of recent external shocks have contributed to
tightened fiscal conditions, limiting the sustainable financing needed for the social
investments foreseen by the Government’s development plan. As previously discussed
(paragraph 39), overcoming economic, social, and political inequality by investing in social
sectors and programs for protection and inclusion vulnerable groups is a Governmental
priority. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes the fiscal challenges faced by the country
and that increasing overall spending as a way to finance the Government program is not a
viable option. Instead, the Government needs to address these challenges in order to guarantee
sustainable social outcomes. The Government strategy to address fiscal constrains involves
increasing tax revenues and increasing the efficiency and transparency in the overall
allocation of public resources. This operation supports key steps of the strategy.

54.     Low levels of tax revenues are linked to low tax incidence, narrow tax base, and
weakness and inefficiencies in tax administration. The 2010 El Salvador PER identifies
high levels of tax avoidance and evasion (linked to high levels of informality) and, as a result,
a narrow tax base, as important obstacles to revenues collection. The PER indicates many
difficulties in the monitoring of tax compliance and implementing investigations of possible
tax evasion and tax avoidance. The auditing and procedures to enforce tax verifications has
been weak due to a lack of auditing skills combined with lack of coordination between the tax
agencies. In addition, the existence of different identification numbers for the payment limits
cross-verification and control by the tax administration. These findings are also consistent
with other studies and diagnostics.

55.     The areas and prior actions supported by this DPL series represent important
steps toward addressing those issues. Supported actions for improving efficiency in tax
collection and expanding the tax base include the expansion of El Salvador electronic
payment platform (P@GOES) (prior action to the first DPL) and simplification of tax
schemes for wage earners and small and micro enterprises (trigger for the second loan). Both
actions help to increase efficiency in tax collection by reducing tax collection costs and efforts
and they are expected to help expand the tax base by reducing the cost and effort to pay taxes.
The electronic payment platform, managed by DGT, was created in 2006 for VAT and
income tax payments to DGII. In December 2009, the system was expanded to handle
payments and contributions to three additional Government agencies: Ministry of Health and
Social Assistance, Ministry of Agriculture, and the Housing Social Fund. In addition to
reducing tax collection costs, a centralized electronic payment platform helps to improve the
coordination and information sharing across Government agencies. The process of
simplification of tax schemes is expected to start in 2011 with the enactment of new executive
                                               32
decree aimed at creating a simplified schedule for income tax payments from wage earners
that significantly reduces tax returns; and a new legislation aimed at creating a single-tax
regime for small and micro enterprises, which will help to promote tax registration among
these enterprises.

56.     This DPL series supports relevant actions to increase tax revenues. The operation
focuses on actions that strengthen capacities to fight tax evasion, improve tax recovery, and
reform tax legislation. Prior actions supported by the first DPL include the design and
implementation of modern systems5 for selection of tax auditing cases in both DGII and a
control and risk management system DGA, following international best practices. The
systems, implemented in the first half of 2010, automatically select cases to be audited or
investigated taking as base a measure of tax default risk. The system also automatically
assigns cases to the auditors/inspectors that shall carry out the investigation in secure and
transparent way, properly balance the work load and limit the room for irregular auditing.
Finally, the system allows for the recording and monitoring of each stage of the case until its
conclusion. The system has facilitated coordination between DGA and DGII fiscalization
activities and the developing of joint-audits.

57.     Another prior action for the first DPL consistent with this objective is the
implementation of a new internal process to monitor and penalize “stop filers”. On the
tax compliance side, tax authorities are checking that those who regularly make their
statements continue doing so. Those who fail to do so are called "stop filers”. Best practices
suggest that tax authorities should react immediately to the omission with systems that
automatically detect those who fall into a default situation and generate phone calls, letters,
and information support for control activities. The stop filers control process in El Salvador is
complex, because the statements are processed primarily by the Treasury Department and
then the information is transferred to the Directorate General of Internal Revenue, which can
lead to delays in detecting omissions. The new system, implemented in July, 2010, provides
for the exchange of information online between DGT and DGII to improve detection times of
omissions, automation of sending letters to stop filers, and, following the case, application of
appropriate penalties for those who fail to comply.

58.     A third prior action, still in line with the goal of increase tax revenues, consists of
strengthening DGT tools for recovering late tax payments. Regulatory changes
implemented through Legislative Decree No. 233 dated December 16, 2009, published in the
Diario Oficial, Tome 385, No. 239 of December 21, 2009, extended the period for processing
administrative claims of late tax payments from up to 10 to up to 100 days, significantly
increasing the chances of recovery of payments before the case is sent to the district attorney’s
office. Regulatory changes also granted DGT the ability to withhold a certain percentage of
the earnings of wage earners and Government service providers which are in arrears with tax
payments.

59.   The Government is committed with continuing efforts for increasing tax
revenues. Expected triggers for the second DPL include the complete integration of DGA and

5
  The new systems are based on algorithms that validate the information declared by the tax payer by crossing it
to additional endogenous and exogenous sources of information. Once selected the case remains stored in a
management modulus which allows for the management, record, and notification of all tasks involved in the tax
auditing process.
                                                      33
DGII taxpayer’s registry and information systems as a milestone in the process of
coordination between the tax agencies. Triggers also include the enactment of a
comprehensive fiscal reform, formulated in consultation with key stakeholder in the society,
which will help to decrease tax system regressivity, realigning it with the systems of
neighboring countries. Tax administration measures are expected to generate an additional 0.4
percent of GDP in tax revenues until 2012, contributing to the overall goal of raising tax
revenues from a baseline of 13.3 percent of GDP (average revenues in the 3 years prior to the
crisis) to 14.8 in 2012.

60.    Increasing efficiency and transparency in public spending has become a key
action in an environment where fiscal pressures prevent further increases in total
expenditures. In this context, reallocating resources to priority uses and insuring that they are
well spent are critical tools for generating additional resources to finance social spending. In
line with this goal, this DPL series supports key actions for promoting efficiency of public
spending. The operation recognizes the Government efforts to improve liquidity management
by moving towards a single treasury payment account. A prior action to the first DPL
supports the implementation of the electronic platform that allows for the daily monitoring
and control of bank accounts balances of 83 Government agencies, i.e. 100 percent of the
balances of central Government and decentralized institutions. The system significantly
increases efficiency in cash flow management.

61.     Building on the program supported by the PFSS DPL, the Government is
committed to continue improving efficiency and transparency of the procurement
process. In fact, the triggers for the second DPL include the approval and implementation of a
reform enabling the use of Framework Agreements in procurement processes. The
Framework Agreements’ goal is to simplify procurement processes for the procurement of
common use goods, while improving efficiency and fostering competition in Government
purchases. A second trigger consists of the expansion of the public procurement dissemination
tool (COMPRASAL) to incorporate all central Government business opportunities and results
(actions supported by the second DPL). Finally, this operation also builds on the PFSS DPL
by supporting as a trigger to the second operation the expansion of the RBB framework. The
framework has contributed to improving the targeting and planning of public spending in
projects on health and agriculture. The Government intends to expand the framework to
include two additional Government agencies during the preparation of the 2012 budget.

62.     This operation further supports the Government’s efforts to increase
transparency of public spending and public sector accountability, deemed critical in
view of existing negative perceptions and mistrust among other stakeholders. A prior
action of the first operation is the creation of a functioning Citizen Observatory of Public
Works composed by representatives from the private sector and the National Chapter of
Transparency International. The Observatory, created through a cooperation agreement
between the Government, private sector and think-tanks at the end of 2009, is a reaction to the
relative bad performance of public investment in the country. Public works, and in particular
those related to reconstruction activities after the Hurricane Ida, were characterize by low
levels of execution, significant delays, and several private renegotiations between the
Government and service providers. The Observatory seeks to increase the transparency and
efficiency in public investment management by increasing the collaboration and the exchange
of information amongst citizens, entrepreneurs and state. This DPL series also supports the
                                               34
approval and implementation of a new Transparency and Access to Public Information Law.
The Law, approved in March of 2011, regulates the release of information on public sector
policies and resource allocation. Following international best practices, the Law determines
the creation of an independent body for monitoring and enforcing the information release. The
creation of a functional overseeing body is a trigger for the second DPL. Combined, these
actions are expected to have a positive impact on both actual and perceived levels of
Government transparency.

       Pillar 2: Protection and including of vulnerable segments of the population

63.      Despite the significant social progress achieved in the last decade, El Salvador
still lags behind the region with respect to social expenditures. El Salvador has increased
levels of social spending in the latest years, but still ranks below comparable countries.
Spending in social sectors represented almost 12 percent of the GDP in 2009, much below the
average for Latin America (17 percent). Health expenditures by the central Government (the
Ministry of Health and National Hospitals) accounted for 1.5 percent of GDP compared to 5.6
in Panama, 5 percent in Costa Rica, and 3.5 percent in Honduras, while public spending on
education in El Salvador (2.8 percent) also ranks below countries with lower per capita
income like Nicaragua (4.7 percent) and Honduras (7.6 percent).

64.     The recent external shocks significantly increased the social and poverty gaps in
the country, especially in vulnerable segments of the population. Poverty rates decreased
significantly between early 1990s and the mid 2000s, but this tendency was reverted by the
food crisis of 2008 and the global crisis in 2009. Poverty reached 40 percent 2008 and 38
percent in 2009 while the average for Latin America was 33.2 percent. Women, children and
elderly individuals are the most affected. Official numbers suggest there are 1.1 million
women living below the poverty in 2008, representing six in ten women in rural areas (while
the overall ration including men and women in rural areas is 4.7 in 10). Other vulnerable
groups include individuals below 14 years old and above 70. In 2008, six in ten children were
considered poor and two of those were consider extremely poor with or no access to
nutritionally adequate daily meals. Poor children represent half children in urban areas and
two-thirds of children in rural areas. These are children face a much higher risk of getting
involved in criminal and violent activities. Finally, more than half of elderly individuals
(above 70 years old) are considered poor.

65.     These operations support a few important Government initiatives designed to
protect and socially include these vulnerable groups. The full implementation of the
Government strategy requires financing resources that will be generated through the fiscal
reforms. For this reason, this DPL supports planning and designing activities that will
contribute to advancing the Government’s social agenda, while the second DPL will focus on
the implementation of targeted programs. A prior action to the first DPL consists of
strengthening the regulations on women protection. In line with the new national policy for
protection of women for the 2010-2014 period, Congress has approved a new law to fight
discrimination against women, promoted gender equality (Decree No. 645 dated March 7,
2011), and enacted a new law to protect women from violence (Decree No. 520 dated
November 25, 2010). The first decree promotes gender equality on political participation and
defines priority areas for Government intervention and for public resources allocation that
will contribute to women’s welfare. The second decree protects women by strengthening the
                                             35
prevention and punishment of crimes against women. Triggers for the second operation
include steps for the implementation of the gender equality law. In particular, the second
operation supports piloting a methodology for gender perspective in the budget formulation
process in at least three Government programs. While these actions are expected to generate
significant outcomes only in the medium term, the Government expects to produce a few
intermediary outputs in the term of the project. In particular, in line with the National Policy
for Women, the Government will create consulting committees for monitoring progress in the
implementation of gender equity policies. In parallel, the Government will create windows for
informing individuals about women’s rights.

66.     The first DPL series also supports actions to protect poor elderly individuals. A
prior action to the first DPL consists on designing and implementing a cash transfer system to
elderly individuals in the 32 poorest municipalities. The transfer system consist of monthly
payments of US$50 to individuals above 70 years old that are not eligible to any other transfer
or pension benefit. The program follows the targeting mechanism of the Comunidades
Solidarias Rurales program, which has been broadly recognized as effective. The program
was implemented in December 2009 in the 32 municipalities with extremely severe poverty
rates and is expected to expand to the remaining 68 municipalities with extremely high
poverty rates. The program is expected to greatly improve standards of living among targeted
beneficiaries (Annex 6 presents the poverty and social impact assessment of the program).

67.     The second DPL in the series is expected to support the implementation and
expansion of key social programs. Triggers for the second operation also include the full
implementation of Comunidades Solidarias Urbanas in five poor urban municipalities
according to the program’s implementation schedule and the piloting of the Ministry of
Education full-school day period program in 22 primary schools. The Comunidades
Solidarias Urbanas combines different social interventions targeting specific vulnerable
groups and desired outcomes, including CCT programs linked to school attendance,
expansion of pre-schools, expansion of health services focused on women and children,
temporary income and training program to young individuals and improvements in local
infrastructure. The implementation of the program will be combined with the development of
a single registry for beneficiaries of social programs that will help to continuously improve
the targeting and monitoring of the results of the respective programs. Finally, the full-school
day period program consists on extending the time spent in school by incorporating a series of
cultural, sports, and scientific activities. The purpose of the program is two-fold: maintain
children involved in productive activities reducing their expose to criminal activities in their
communities and strengthen children’ cognitive and non cognitive skill set.

68.     This operation is being designed to take into account good practice principles on
conditionality. These principles include country ownership through close cooperation and
technical assistance, close coordination with other development partners (especially with the
IADB, the IMF and USAID), alignment of the operation with the Government’s reform
timetable, and selection of critical structural reforms that will yield medium and long term
benefits to the country.




                                              36
                        Box 3: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
• The operation is closely aligned with the Government’s Program and has been prepared in consultation with
different segments of the Government and civil society.
• The operation has been developed in parallel to two technical assistance operations one supporting Public
Financial Management and a second on addressing quality in Public Education. In addition, the operation start
being prepared a period after the dissemination of the El Salvador PER. Many of the policy actions supported
build on the recommendation from this analytical piece.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
• The operation’s policy matrix is being developed in close cooperation with the Government and in consultation
with key development partners such as IADB, IMF and USAID.
• Donors involved in budget support operation frequently meet to coordinate their support closely.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
• The timing of this operation is aligned with the Government’s reform timetable and their financing needs.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
• Prior actions were chosen from an agreed accountability framework and focused on critical actions for
achieving the objectives of the Government program.

                                VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

69.     The actions for strengthening the country’s fiscal position supported by the
proposed operation are expected to have a positive overall distributional impact. The
latest PER indicates that high public debt has adversely impacted the poor by reducing fiscal
space for priority social spending and investment programs. In addition, the effects of
macroeconomic volatility, in particular those generated by recent rise in commodity prices
and the global financial crisis, have been disproportionally high among the poor. Since the
expected outcomes from the public finance actions supported by this DPL series include a
more stable and resilient macro environment, reduced debt burden, increased fiscal space for
productive and poverty-alleviating expenditures, the broad distributional impacts are expected
to be pro-poor. In addition, actions to increase transparency, monitoring and accountability of
public spending are likely to increase citizens awareness about Government actions and favor
good public policies.

70.     The actions for increasing tax revenues supported by this operation are not
expected to have adverse distributional impacts. The tax administration actions supported
here will help to boost revenues by improving collection efficiency and enforcement,
particularly among large tax payers. These actions should have no significant distributional
impact. Regarding the tax measures envisaged in the second loan, authorities have expressed
that decreasing the regressivity of the El Salvador tax system is a key objective of the tax
measures and considerations. Measures such changes in income, dividends and capital gains
taxes are likely to be progressive. Nevertheless, if as result of consultation and negotiation
with different segments of society, the final set of policy measures includes small raises in


                                                       37
indirect taxes, the Government is prepared to implement compensatory transfers that
neutralize the impacts of the tax changes to the poor.

71.     Distributional and poverty reducing effects are expected to be positive and
significant for actions targeting the protection of vulnerable segments of the population.
Gasparini et al. (2007)6 show that elderly individuals in El Salvador have less access to
adequate housing and basic infrastructure and health services. Introducing a well targeted
system of transfers to the elderly poor in the 32 poorest municipalities is expected to improve
the standards of living for this group, reducing overall poverty rates and inequality. The
Poverty and Social Impact Assessment of the program (Annex 6) suggests that more than 50
percent of the program’s budget is directed to the lowest four deciles of the income
distribution. It is also estimated that the share of the program’s budget decreases steadily per
income decile reaching 3 percent in the 10th decile. The assessment also suggests that the
program would lose much of its positive distributional effects if expanded to all municipalities
without the use of additional targeting mechanisms. While it is harder to quantify the direct
distributional impacts of actions to support gender balance in the allocation public resource
the team anticipate this are either positive or neutral depending on the social programs chosen
for piloting.

72.    Finally, the implementation of Communidades Solidarias Urbanas is expected to
have poverty reducing effects, but the magnitude of the distributional effects will depend
on tuning the targeting of each program. As indicated in the report “Informe de la
evaluación de la focalización de Red Solidaria” by IFPRI, the program Comunidades
Solidarias Rurales is very well targeted and therefore progressive. As the program expands to
urban areas, it is likely that it will become less progressive. The urban and rural areas
contribute the same for the national poverty rate of 48 percent, but the incidence of poverty is
twice as large in rural areas. Therefore, targeting transfers in urban areas is expected to be
considerably more challenging then targeting in rural areas. For this reason, the Government
is working on building a single registry for beneficiaries of social programs. In addition to
keeping track of beneficiaries, the system will allow for crossing of individual and program
characteristics and help to monitor and adjust targeting performance. The system will help
ensure that the targeting methods employed by Comunidades Solidarias Urbanas are effective
and minimize errors of inclusion and exclusion.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

73.     The actions supported under the proposed DPL are not likely to have significant
effects on the country’s environment, forests, and other natural resources. In particular,
actions aimed at improving public expenditure management and fiscal transparency, or at
expanding social protection and education are not likely to have a significant effect on the
environment either directly or indirectly. The operation does not support or foresee fiscal
actions that will significantly affect the amount of financing resources available to the
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN). However, it is possible that an
improvement fiscal transparency contributes to citizen’s awareness of environmental policies.

74.      Moreover, since the late 1990s El Salvador has made significant progress in
establishing a solid legal and institutional infrastructure for environmental protection.
As discussed in the FY06 Country Environmental Analysis, El Salvador has a sound –albeit
still incomplete– framework for developing effective environmental policies. This framework
comprises a general environmental law and complementary laws that address specific
environmental concerns, particularly in forestry, protected areas, and mining, including
associated regulations and technical standards. The Country Environmental Analysis provided
recommendations to improve the country’s environmental management capacities which are
being considered, and implemented as feasible. For example, the MARN has recently
upgraded the environmental licensing standard and reduced the approval period, and is
looking into the possibility of expanding the use of Strategic Environmental Analysis. In
addition, supported by the El Salvador CAT-DDO (February 2011), the MARN is currently
implementing a National Program for Risk Reduction. Measures included in the Plan are
aimed at reducing environmental risks and vulnerability to natural disasters.

CONSULTATIONS

75.     The Government’s program benefited from a broad consultation process with
key stakeholder of the Government society. The process of elaboration of the
Government’s Development Plan 2010-2014 included the active participation of a large
number of public servants, the extensive consultation with intellectuals and academics, the
inputs of independent consultants and the carful study of public policies of internal and
international organization during the last decade. In addition, the Government implemented an
intensive process of discussions and revision of the document with the private sector and civil
society with respect to the strategic development policies. The strategies and priorities for the
country have also been submitted to Economic and Social Counsel and approved by its
members. The results of these discussions are a substantive part of the final Government plan.

76.     Consultation and consensus building activities have played a key role in
implementing the Government program. The current administration has been
implementing intensive consultation with the opposition and the public at large, which has
been essential for congress approval of the proposed. This is impressive in view of the
polarized political environment in the country. As part of these consultation activities,
President Funes is launching a process of consensus building with private sector and civil
society in the new Social and Economic Council on a Fiscal Pact that will help implement the
Government medium term fiscal framework.

77.     Finally, the Government has consulted closely with other political and civil
society actors during the preparation of this DPL. Taking into account El Salvador’s
political context and the potential risk associated with the approval of the loan or of key
policies supported by the operation, the Bank has also conducted substantial consultation
process with key stakeholders. In addition, discussions have been held with a wide range of
civil society organizations including think tanks, private sector representatives, and other
groups. Finally, the proposed operations and its implications for El Salvador’s fiscal stability
and continued socio-economic development continue to be discussed in order to obtain
support from the public at large.


                                               39
IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

78.    The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the implementation of the program
supported by the DPL series as well as for coordinating actions among the concerned
line agencies, including, in particular, the Central Bank, the Technical Secretariat of the
Presidency (for aspects concerning the implementation of social programs), the Ministry of
Education (for aspects concerning the education sector) and the Ministry of Health (for
aspects concerning the health sector). Together with the Ministry of Finance, these institutions
will collect the necessary data to assess implementation progress and report it to the Bank,
taking into account both process advances and service statistics, survey and other data that
might be used to assess the achievement of the program’s end outcomes.

79.     The Government, in coordination with the Bank, will prepare reviews of the
implementation of actions proposed for the next operation on the series. These reviews
will be aimed at identifying areas of strength and weakness, and possible assistance needed to
achieve the planned medium-term outcomes. They will also assess possible risks and agree on
measures to address them.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

80.    El Salvador’s fiduciary environment is adequate for DPLs. As part of the
Government’s overall long-term focus on public sector modernization, significant
improvements in the performance of budget and procurement management institutions have
been made over the past one and a half decade. In May 2009, a PEFA assessment was
completed with financing of the European Commission and with participation of the World
Bank. The overall finding indicates that the general PFM environment is solid, with a good
performance in most of the dimensions covered by the PEFA methodology, and the
Government has completed successfully the PFM reform initiated ten years before. However,
the report indicates that there are some shortcomings that affect the general efficiency of the
system and recommends a second generation of reforms for further strengthening of the
following areas: (i) the linkage between policy planning and budgeting, and (ii) the auditing
and external control mechanisms and credibility. In connection with this, the Bank is engaged
in public financial management dialogue with the Government to follow up on
recommendations made through the Country Financial Accountability Assessment and
Country Procurement Assessment Report. The Bank support initiated with the PFSS DPL has
been continued by the Fiscal Management and Public Sector Performance Technical
Assistance loan and by the proposed policy loan.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

81.     The proposed loan will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy loans. The untied finances will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases.
Once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the loan will
be deposited by IBRD in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank
at the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador at the request of the Borrower. The Borrower will
ensure that upon the deposit of the loan into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in
the Borrower’s budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The
                                               40
Borrower will report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account
and credited to the budget management system. The legal agreement will include a clause for
the provision upon the Bank’s request, of a written Confirmation of the described transaction
that the amount of the loan has been credited to an account that is available to finance
budgeted expenditures. If the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined
in the Development Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to, promptly upon
notice from IBRD, refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to IBRD. Amounts
refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration of this loan
will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.

82.     The Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador is the financial agent of the
Government. The latest IMF Safeguards Assessment performed in 2010 note that the Central
Reserve Bank has made progress in implementing the recommendations of the 2009
assessment in the areas of internal control and legal structure. The authorities have
incorporated the recommendations of the 2009 assessment on the legal framework in the
financial supervision and regulation law awaiting congressional approval. The assessment’s
main recommendation is the adoption of an international financial reporting framework. It is
worth noticing that the Central Bank publishes its Annual Financial Statements with an audit
opinion provided by the Banking System Oversight Office (Superintendencia del Sistema
Financiero) as required by regulations. The opinion provided was clean for the last two years.
Additionally, it has its Financial Statement audited by a private firm for tracking compliance
with IFRS. Based on a review of external audit reports, nothing came to the attention of the
Bank that would indicate that the banking control environment into which the loan proceeds
will flow is other than adequate.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

83.    The program supported by this proposed series of DPLs is subject to three main
risks as follows: (i) political risk; (ii) macroeconomic risk; and (iii) natural disaster risk.

84.     The principal risk to the proposed DPL derives from the polarized political
climate in El Salvador which could impede the approval of reforms and multilateral
loans by Congress. While FMLN’s victory in both Presidential and Congressional elections,
after 20 years in the opposition, and the smooth handover of political power represent a
milestone in the country’s democratic development; the political environment in country
remains highly polarized. In addition, FMLN does not hold the required majority and lack of
political support in Congress could jeopardize the approval of new legislations and or even
the approval of the loan. This risk is being mitigated by the consultation process followed by
authorities on policy reform. The Government program has been discussed with key
stakeholders such as the private sector and civil society.

85.     On the macroeconomic front, the risk derives from the global financial crisis and
more specifically from a deep and prolonged global deceleration or a worsening of the
global economy in the context of high food and oil prices. The global crisis has had a
significant impact on El Salvador’s economy and, in particular in the fiscal accounts. These
factors have already been taken into account in the design of the program and in the
projections developed for the medium-term. However, our stress analysis indicate that a
prolong slowdown in economic growth or lack of fiscal consolidation can compromise public
                                              41
sector sustainability and create difficulties for implementing the intended program. This risk
is mitigated by the design of the reform program and by recent steps taken by the authorities
to enhance crisis preparedness. A critical component of the effort to mitigate macroeconomic
risks is related to the authority’s efforts for fiscal restraint.

86.     The operation is also subject to risks deriving from natural disasters. As with
other Central American countries, El Salvador is highly vulnerable to multiple natural
disasters risks –floods, hurricanes and earthquakes. A major climatic or seismic disaster
would pose a significant threat to economic growth and fiscal stability and can also delay the
Government’s program. Supported by the Bank, the Government is focusing on strengthening
its disaster management systems and on building a strong safety net intended to help the
population’s most vulnerable segments better withstand these recurring shocks. In particular,
the Bank has recently prepared a CAT-DDO operation that will provide financing resources in
case of emergency. Nonetheless, occurrence of a major natural disaster during the
implementation of the DPL series program would likely imply a reassessment of the country’s
development priorities (at least temporarily). Should such an event occur, the ongoing
engagement through the DPL would also enable the Bank to support the Government in
revising its strategy as needed to harmonize between short-term imperatives and medium- to
longer term socio-economic development goals.

                  IMF RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK (February 2011)

1.     The IMF’s El Salvador team led by Mario Garza (Mission Chief) has met on
various occasions with the World Bank’s El Salvador team led by Carlos Felipe
Jaramillo (Country Director) to address macro critical structural reforms and to coordinate
the two teams’ work for 2011.

2.     The teams have agreed that El Salvador’s main macroeconomic challenges are
achieving a durable fiscal consolidation, including by increasing revenues as a percent of
GDP, and improving the investment climate to boost the growth performance of the
economy. Reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio to pre-crisis levels is a key priority,
especially in view of the high sensitivity of the debt trajectory to negative output shocks.

3.     Based on this shared assessment, the teams have identified five structural reform
areas as macro critical, in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation and
sustained growth.

           Subsidy reform: Reduce the need for budgetary transfers to pay for subsidies on
            electricity and liquefied gas (LPG), in conjunction with maintaining subsidies to the
            most vulnerable users. At present, electricity and LPG subsidies are poorly targeted,
            and are estimated to represent a drain on Government resources equal to 1.4 percent of
            GDP in 2009.7 Reform of energy subsidies would provide fiscal space to accelerate
            spending on infrastructure, security, and social programs, including education.

           Tax reform: Boost tax revenue by at least 1½ percent of GDP. Such a reform would
            establish a sustainable resource base for financing needed infrastructure, security, and
            social outlays while ensuring that fiscal deficits decline and the public debt-to-GDP
            ratio is put on a durable downward path.

           Public financial management reform: Implement reforms to address shortcomings
            in El Salvador’s budget process, including: (i) a requirement of super majorities in
            Congress for approval of long-term financing; and (ii) the absence of a multi-year
            framework. These weaknesses reduce the authorities’ ability to execute the investment
            budget, with negative consequences for long-term growth.

           Financial sector reform: Strengthen the regulatory framework by: (i) addressing
            deficiencies in the bank resolution framework; (ii) issuing norms to enhance
            supervision; and (iii) improving the legal framework for El Salvador’s capital markets.

           Investment climate reform: Improve the growth performance of the economy.
            Domestic and foreign investment in El Salvador remains low both in nominal terms
            and as compared with regional peers. Relative weaknesses in areas such as security,
            education, and innovation likely impact negatively on investment and growth.

4.     The teams agreed to support the authorities’ work in these areas with the
following division of labor:


7
     Water usage and transportation subsidies were reformed in 2009. 
                                                         58
    Tax Reform: The authorities are working toward a fiscal pact that would be
     implemented no later than 2012 and would include a tax reform aimed at boosting
     revenues by at least 1½ percent of GDP, a goal that has been incorporated as a
     structural benchmark in the current IMF program. The Fund is providing technical
     assistance on the design of revenue measures that would underpin the increase,
     including the possible increase in tax rates. The World Bank has been also supporting
     the reform as a prior action in the Public Finance and Social Progress DPL.

    Public financial management reform: An IMF technical assistance mission visited
     San Salvador in February 2011 to advise on strengthening the institutional capacity of
     domestic revenue and customs administration, and another mission is planned for
     April to follow up on a medium-term expenditure framework. The World Bank is
     planning technical assistance focused on strengthening tax collection agencies,
     modernizing public financial management and enhancing public sector transparency.
     The operation is backed by a loan that is awaiting congressional approval. These areas
     are also supported by policy triggers in the Public Finance and Social Progress DPL.

    Financial sector reform: The 2010 update to El Salvador’s Financial Sector Stability
     Assessment (FSSA) conducted by the World Bank and IMF found the financial
     system had withstood the global financial crisis and was well-capitalized and liquid.
     At the same time, the FSSA noted several vulnerabilities and opportunities for
     structural reforms. Some of these elements, including congressional passage of the
     financial supervision and regulation law, passage of an investment funds law, and
     approval of norms supporting risk-based supervision, are incorporated as structural
     benchmarks in the current IMF program. The authorities are also receiving IMF
     technical assistance on ways to implement the central bank’s authority to undertake
     limited LOLR functions, and on risk-based supervision, both in line with FSSA
     recommendations. The World Bank is currently working with the El Salvador on a
     financial crisis prepared program consisting on the diagnostic and recommendation on
     how to improve Government agencies’ responses to financial emergencies.

    Investment climate reform: To spur growth and investment during the remainder of
     their term, the authorities plan to undertake fiscal reforms to create space for priority
     expenditures, assume a more active role in promoting exports, and foster “public
     private partnerships” to promote investment in infrastructure, including in the energy
     and transportation sectors. In addition to its support to the fiscal reforms, the World
     Bank is developing a corporate governance country assessment under the Reports on
     the Observance of Standards and Codes program that will contribute to the investment
     climate reform agenda.

5.   The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:

    The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro critical
     structural reform areas. Timing: as needed.

    The World Bank team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro
     critical structural reform areas. Timing: as needed.

             ANNEX 4: EL SALVADOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

6.      El Salvador is characterized by a relatively small Government, with Non-Financial
Public Sector (NFPS) spending averaging 20 percent a year. It is also characterized by
relatively low tax revenue collections, amounting to 13.1 percent of GDP in 2008. Total
spending has been generally stable, since the budget is relatively rigid, with little room for
expenditure reassignments. While this combination contributed to relatively stable levels of
public debt (at around 40 percent of GDP) during the prosperous period that led up to the
global financial crisis, the slowdown in economic activity and the drop in tax revenues to 12.4
percent of GDP in 2009 had a significant impact on the fiscal accounts.

7.     At the end of 2009, the total public sector debt increased to almost 50 percent of GDP
(from 41.2 percent in 2008 and 39.1 in 2007). This result, partly driven by the crisis, raises
concerns about fiscal sustainability and its implications for macroeconomic stability.
Continued growth in public debt would lead to an increase in debt service in the future. This
expense must be financed through tax increases, spending cuts, or additional debt. As the debt
increases, so do concerns about the Government’s ability to repay its commitments. The
higher the risk, the higher the returns demanded by the market, increasing interest rates at
which the Government is able to borrow, further increasing debt service, and reducing the
already constrained fiscal space.

8.     Table 1 present the stock of the long-term debt of the Non Financial Public Sector as
of December 2009. It indicates that El Salvador’s long-term NFPS debt is mainly (i) external
debt (70.3 percent of total debt); (ii) with private creditors (65.0 percent of total debt); (iii)
US$ denominated (90 percent of total debt); (iv) with interest rates between 3 and 8 percent
(70 percent of total debt); and (v) with maturities above 10 years (69 percent of total debt).

9.     The Government is committed to macroeconomic stability and has agreed with the
IMF on a new program that aims to reduce the debt burden significantly by 2015 through
increases in revenue and reductions in spending. We develop a public debt sustainability
analysis for El Salvador, where we build a baseline scenario based on macroeconomic
assumptions consistent with the medium-term macroeconomic framework envisioned in the
Standby Agreement8 (see Table 2).




8
  Although our baseline scenario is equivalent to that of the Government and the IMF, the numbers presented
here might be different from the ones officially reported. This relates to differences in the definition of certain
indicators. For example, we study the behavior of the NFPS, while the IMF focuses in a broader definition of
debt. In addition, we take as a base net tax revenues, while the Government reports gross tax revenues.

10.     Under the baseline assumptions, the upward trend in the total public debt ratio that
started in 2008 is projected to be reversed in 2011. Public debt is expected to reach 51.5
                                             61
percent of GDP in 2010 as a result of the gradual recovery in output and in tax revenues.
However, a slow but steady downward trend for the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to begin in
2011 in response to economic growth and to advances in the fiscal reform agenda planned by
the Government. This result also assumes a mild declining trend in public expenditures as a
share of GDP. By 2015, the debt ratio is projected to fall to 47.1 percent, compensating only
part of the debt effects of the crisis. Interest payments associated with the debt will remain
steady, and are expected to be 5.3 percent in 2015.

11.     In the absence of a crisis scenario, the external position of El Salvador remains
sustainable. External debt to GDP ratio reached a peak in 2009 at 46.1 percent with a slow
decreasing path afterwards. It is expected to ease back to 41.4 percent by 2015, as the fiscal
position and GDP growth improve. The higher level of indebtedness in 2009 mainly reflects a
much higher fiscal deficit as well as the need to cover financing needs amid weaker FDI
inflows than in 2007-08.

12.     While the baseline projections indicate a sustainable debt path, there are two main
sources of uncertainty regarding the baseline underlying assumptions: (a) the speed of
economic recovery after the crisis, and (b) the progress in implementing the fiscal reform
program. The baseline scenario is built on the assumption of economic recovery during 2010
and 2011 and sustained growth thereafter. However, slower than anticipated global growth,
particularly in the US, could also delay recovery in El Salvador. In addition, the baseline
scenario depends on the Government’s ability to implement the necessary reforms9 to increase
revenues from 17.2 percent to more than 19 percent of GDP. These reforms go beyond the
adjustments previously implemented by the country and could suffer delays given the
sensitivity of some of the measures.

13.     Motivated by these and other potential challenges, the external and public debt
sustainability analysis is also performed under alternative scenarios. The main scenarios are as
follows: (i) historical scenario is based on the assumption that key macroeconomic variables,
stay at their historical averages for 2000–09, (ii) higher real interest rates, (iii) lower GDP

  The Government is considering introducing a comprehensive set of reforms on tax administration, expansion of
the tax base and the tax structure.
                                                                               62
growth, (iv) lower primary balance for the public debt analysis and higher non-interest current
account deficit for the external debt, (v) no policy changes10, (vi) a combination of lower GDP
growth, higher interest rates and lower primary balances or higher current account deficit, and
finally (vii) a 10 percent of GDP increase in contingent liabilities in 2011. As GDP growth
and primary balance are considered key sources of risk for the public debt, we explore the
impact of both temporarily and permanent shocks. Unless specified, all other individual
shocks are considered permanent one-half standard deviation shocks implemented in 2011-
2015. Variables that are not shocked remain at their baseline values.

14.     Based on the public debt analysis of the different scenarios, El Salvador is most
vulnerable to unchanged policy (Table 3). This shock could push the public debt ratio to 54.0
percent in 2011 and would increase continuously during the whole period reaching 61.9
percent in 2015. A large shock to real GDP (1.6 pp per year) would also increase the debt
ratio over all the projected period reaching 55.7 in 2015.The analysis also indicates that the
public debt ratio is sensitive to a 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities, which

10
   The 2010 primary balance is replicate throughout the whole 2010-2015 period for the public debt
sustainability analysis.
                                                                       63
would lead to a jump in the public debt ratio to about 61.3 percent in 2012. Although debt to
GDP would start falling after 2012, this ratio would still be greater than 56 percent in 2015.
The other individual shocks would also raise debt above the baseline scenario, although the
deterioration would be less evident.

15.     A stochastic public debt sustainability analysis completes the assessment of the risks
of the Government’s fiscal strategy. The scenario and confidence intervals for the public debt
ratios correspond to varying degrees of uncertainty for four key macroeconomic variables: (a)
domestic interest rates; (b) growth rate; (c) exchange rate; and, (d) foreign interest rate.
Assuming an average primary surplus of 0.3 percentage points of GDP during 2010–15, there
is a 97.5 percent probability that the public-debt-to-GDP ratio will remain between 42 and 65
percent. Under an alternative scenario, where the primary balance shifts to a deficit of 1
percent annually over the projection period, the 97.5 percent confidence interval for the
public-debt-to-GDP ratio would become 48 to 70 percent. Once again, this result highlights
the importance of improving fiscal discipline for public debt dynamics in El Salvador.

16.     The debt sustainability analysis of the external debt suggests that El Salvador is very
sensitive to a more difficult external environment, resulting in a higher current account deficit
(Table 3). External debt to GDP ratio would increase over the whole projected period
reaching 47.2 percent in 2015. If key variables were to stabilize at their ten year historical
average, external debt to GDP ratio would reach 49.1 percent in 2015. A combined shock to
the GDP, interest rates and the current account balance would also lead to a continuous
increase in the external debt to GDP ratio during 2010-2015 reaching 46.1 in 2015. The
analysis suggests that the external debt is less vulnerable to a scenario based on higher interest
rates. This would decrease external debt to 44.8 in 2011, remaining at about 0.2 percentage
point higher than under the baseline and reaching 42 percent in 2015.

17.     Based on the above analysis, El Salvador’s public and external debt is assessed to be
overall sustainable. Under alternative scenarios, however, public debt stock sensitivity to
sustaining fiscal discipline and strong economic growth is non-negligible. The Government
should continue efforts to strengthen the fiscal policy framework and the growth prospects of
the economy. In sum, the implementation of the baseline scenario (IMF program) is possible,
but it requires a strong commitment from the Government. Fiscal adjustments will call for
measures to increase revenue, reduce/reassign expenditures, and improve debt management.
In particular, broadening the tax base, enhancing revenue collection, improving tax
administration are important steps to ensure that tax revenue increase from 13.2 of GDP in
2010 to 16.4 percent of GDP in 2015 as predicted by the program.

      ANNEX 5: PREVIOUS WORLD BANK OPERATIONS IN EL SALVADOR

Public Finance and Social Sector DPL

18.    The Public Finance and Social Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL) (loan No.
7635-SV) of USD450 million was approved by the World Bank board on January 22, 2009.
The operation’s loan agreement was signed on January 29, 2009 and became effective on
February 25, 2009. The loan was disbursed in two tranches of USD 200,000,000 and USD
248,875,000 respectively. The Bank has disbursed the second tranche on October 27, 2010,
upon completion of five conditions and the partial wavering of the other two conditions.

19.     The DPL was designed to assist the Government in addressing fiscal and public
finance management related issues and support continued institutional and social sector
reforms. The main objectives of this operation were to: (i) help El Salvador strengthen
medium-term fiscal sustainability; (ii) support good governance and transparency in the use of
public resources; and (iii) maintain steady improvements in social protection and education.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Public Finance and Social Sector DPL supports
actions aimed at: (i) expanding fiscal space for priority spending and improve targeting of
public spending; (ii) improving public expenditure management and fiscal transparency; and
(iii) expanding social protection programs, enhancing the quality of primary education and
expanding access to secondary education.

20.      The first tranche of the DPL was disbursed following the completion of seven actions:
(i) the implementation of tax administration measures to fight tax evasion and raise revenues
through: (a) the creation of a functional criminal investigation unit within the DGII, (b) the
establishment of a cooperation agreement between DGII and DGA to cross-check tax
collection information, and (c) the creation of a functional internal affairs unit, organized
within the DGII; (ii) the approval of a plan to gradually eliminate the electricity subsidy for
firms and its initial implementation by cutting the said subsidy by 40 percent; (iii) the
expansion of the integrated financial management system to at least 24 entities of the central
Government, 59 decentralized public institutions and 2 public companies; (iv) the
implementation of the public procurement dissemination module MODDIV of COMPRASAL
in at least 172 Government agencies and municipalities; (v) the expansion of the program Red
Solidaria became to 77 of the poorest municipalities; (vi) the Ministry of Education, has: (a)
developed and implemented an education quality monitoring system using standardized
learning assessment for primary education students and (b) developed a strategy to address
deficiencies in non-performing schools, including a monitoring system for teachers, a peer
collaboration program, enhanced distribution of education material, and a training program
for teachers; and finally (vii) the borrower has: (a) eliminated tuition and graduation fees in
regular public schools, and (b) created 20,000 education grants to pay for alternative
secondary education under the EDUCAME program.

21.     The second tranche of the DPL was disbursed following the completion of five of
seven actions and partial completion of the remaining two: (i) raise in tax revenues by: (a)
implementing a new tax on vehicles; (b) introducing of an ad-valorem tax on alcoholic
beverages; and (c) installing and operating of x-ray machines and weight controllers in the
customs posts of Acajutla, San Bartolo and Comalapa Airport; (ii) complete elimination of the
Electricity Subsidy for Firms; (iii) improve budgetary management through: (a) the
introduction of a medium-term budget framework, and (b) the piloting of a results-based
                                             65
budgeting methodology in at least two central Government agencies; (iv) issue regulations to
enable and promote public access to fiscal information and redesign and launch an effective
Fiscal Transparency Portal; (v) further expansion of Red Solidaria to poorest 100
municipalities. (vi) MINED, has: (a) implemented a strategy to address nonperforming
schools deficiencies in all schools with average grades of 5 points or less in the PAESITA
Test; and (b) undertaken a special mid-term test for targeted non-performing schools to assess
progress and improvements; and, (vii) After December 2008 the borrower has: (a) increased
the number of education grants (cupos) under the EDÚCAME program by 10,000; and (b)
increased by 200 the number of operating classrooms of up to 40 students (secciones) for
secondary education in public schools.

Sustaining Social Gains for Economic Recovery DPL

22.     The Sustaining Social Gains for Economic Recovery DPL (Loan No. 7806-SV) is
designed as a single tranche operation, of USD 100 million to support the Government’s Anti-
Crisis Plan and elaboration of its medium-term development agenda, and will serve as a
bridge between the ongoing DPL and a possible programmatic DPL series in FY 11 and
FY12. The DPL is constructed around three pillars, drawn from the most important elements
of the Government’s general program and its Anti-Crisis Plan in particular, that will protect
the social gains made in the past decade and reinforce the framework for economic recovery.

23.     These three pillars are: (i) protecting fiscal space for social expenditures, by (a)
reforming the system of untargeted subsidies, (b) protecting critical non-personnel recurrent
expenditures in the social sectors and critical investments in the health sector; (ii) protecting
income and consumption of the vulnerable population, by (a) expanding the School Feeding
program to urban pre-schools and basic schools, (b) ensuring access to health services for the
poor, and (c) protecting the income of the poor; and, (iii) strengthening the institutional
capacity for policy formulation and implementation in the social sectors for economic
recovery, by (a) strengthening the institutional capacity and policy-making in the Ministry of
Education, (b) strengthening the institutional capacity and policy-making in the Ministry of
Health, and (c) strengthening the institutional capacity for policy planning in social
protection.

24.     Almost all of the outcomes have been met, a month before the closing of the DPL. Of
the 9 prior actions identified during preparation of the DPL, two policy actions were short on
progress. The first is that 80 percent of individuals in the poorest municipalities are formally
registered and receiving prevention and promotion services through the Model of Integrated
Health Care Services. The other is the elaboration of a new curriculum for the teaching of
science and technology in upper secondary school. The Government noted that there had been
progress in primary education, which became an immediate priority during the DPLs
implementation and that steps had been made toward the elaboration of the new curriculum
for secondary schooling. The Government added that it was waiting for budget to continue
with these improvements.

25.     On the other actions, the Government was able to (i) reduce public transport subsidy
from US$84 million in 2008 to US$41.4 million by October 2010, achieving the 38 percent
reduction that was agreed; (ii) maintain non-personnel recurrent expenditure in the education
sector; (iii) maintain non-personnel recurrent expenditures in the health sector; (iv) benefit
1,318,679 students across the country with the school feeding program, (v) increase hospital
                                             66
discharges by 12 percent from 2008; (vi) have the Programa de Apoyo Temporal de Ingreso
(PATI) to operate in 11 municipalities; and, (vii) pilot Comunidades Solidarias in two
municipalities.

Fiscal Management and Public Sector Performance Technical Assistance Project

26.     The Fiscal Management and Sector Performance Technical Assistance Project (Project
ID: P095314) responds to the Government’s request to support one of the pillars of the Anti-
Crisis Plan (PAC), and to address medium-term challenges in public sector development and
fiscal management. It is supported by a US$20,000,000 TAL to be implemented over a five
year period, from 2010 to 2014. The Fixed-Spread Loan (FSL) has a repayment schedule
linked to commitments and with all the conversion options. It is payable in 30 years,
including a 5-year grace period with a level repayment schedule.

27.     The project development objective is to strengthen the institutional capacity of specific
Government processes and agencies to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of revenue
and expenditure management, and enhance accountability and transparency in the public
sector. The project is structured around four main components, each with a set of
subcomponents:

       Component 1: Strengthening of tax collection agencies that will help the Minstry of
       Finance (MoF) implement a short-term tax collection package and strengthen their
       institutional capacity in tax administration.
              I.a: Strengthen the coordination among the two tax collection agencies, the
                 Internal revenue Agency (DGII) and the Customs Agency (DGA), and the
                 Treasury Office (DGT) to improve information sharing practices and
                 increase common control procedures for better tax compliance.
              I.b: Strengthen DGII’s institutional capacity through (a) the redesign of
                 relevant DGII’s strategies, norms and procedures; (b) improving and
                 upgrading information systems to enhance data cross-reference procedures;
                 (c) improving auditing processes and procedures; and (d) support of human
                 resource management and tax-payers services.
              I.c: Support the DGA by strengthening its auditing and control functions
                 though the redesign of relevant DGA’s strategies, norms, and procedures.

       Component 2: Modernization of public expenditure and financial management that
       will help the MoF to review and further modernize existing budget and financial
       management systems, including the public procurement system.
             II.a: Provide technical assistance, and acquire software and equipment for the
                development of norms and procedures to formulate, modify, execute,
                monitor, and evaluate the national budget with a multi-annual and
                performance-based management approach.
             II.b: Design and implement of a single treasury account and electronic
                payments, through, inter alia, the following activities: (a) the design and
                implementation of automated and online procedures; (b) the development o f
                cash-management procedures; and (c) the promotion of institutional
                agreements between the MoF and commercial banks to execute electronic
                and automated transactions.
                                               67
                II.c: Strengthen and upgrade SAFI’s processes and procedures, through, inter
                 alia, the following activities: (a) the redesign and upgrade o f SIRH to allow
                 its inter-operability with SAFI; (b) the acquisition o f software and
                 equipment; (c) the implementation o f mechanisms to facilitate the
                 production o f accounting, financial, and economic reports according to
                 international standards; and (d) the provision of training to relevant
                 Governmental agencies personnel on public financial management.

       Component 3: Enhancing and piloting information management and public sector
       transparency initiatives, which will support Government efforts to modernize its
       institutional framework;
              III.a: Supporting the implementation of a new statistical information system
                 and institutional framework.
              III.b: Strengthening the National Monitoring and Evaluation system and
                 introducing Performance-based Budgeting.
              III.c: Support implementation of the Freedom of Public Information
                 legislation.
              III.d: Undertake a pilot program supporting transparency at the Ministry of
                 Public Works.

       Component 4: Project coordination and strengthening of the MoF, which will provide
       support to the MoF to adequately coordinate and monitor the project implementation.

28.      The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
public sector in El Salvador to facilitate a timely and solid economic recovery, and create
favorable conditions to successfully implement national development programs. The proposed
project will also contribute to enhancing public confidence and credibility of public sector
institutions.

Income Support and Employability Project

29.     The Income Support and Employability Project (Project ID P117440) is a Specific
Investment Loan (SIL) of US$50,000,000. The Fixed-Spread Loan has a final maturity of 30
years, including a grace period of five years. The proposed Project is the World Bank’s
response to the Government request to help implement a short-term intervention to mitigate
the impact of the crisis on the urban vulnerable poor while expanding services that enhance
their employability in an articulated social protection system.

30.   The project development objectives are to build on the capacity of the Government to
implement an innovative income support program that is well articulated with medium term
employability strategies for the vulnerable and poor in urban areas. The project has three main
components, each with a set of subcomponents:

       Component I: Support the Design and Implementation of the Temporary Income
       Support Program (Programa de Apoyo Temporal a1 Ingreso, PATI) by (a) financing
       Transfers of the Temporary Income Support Program (PATI); (b) training delivery for
       PATI participants; (c) strengthening the Social Investment Fund for Local
       Development (FISDL); and (d) strengthening the municipalities.
                                              68
       Component II: Strengthening of labor intermediation, information, and occupational
       training systems, by: (a) strengthening the labor Intermediation System; (b)
       strengthening Labor Information Systems and Statistics; and (c) strengthening the
       Occupational Training System.
       Component III: Support the design and development of the Universal Social
       Protection System (SPSU) by: (a) improving the Technical Secretariat of the
       Presidency’s (STP) institutional capacity; and (b) designing and implementing key
       tools for the development of social protection policy design.

31.     The STP is responsible for the strategic direction and the coordination of El Salvador’s
Universal Social Protection System, through the Government’s Inter-Sectoral Committee of
the Universal Social Protection System (CISPSU), which STP chairs. The STP led the
development of the concept for this Project and would be responsible for coordinating
monitoring and evaluation of Project’s progress. In accordance with their Government
functions, three different agencies would be responsible for the specific outcomes under each
of the three project components. Under Component 1, all participating municipalities,
INSAFORP and FISDL would collect information on the component’s progress and results-
based outputs. MTPS and other related agencies would be the primary entities responsible for
collecting and monitoring information and results generated under Component 2. Finally, the
STP would be responsible for tracking progress of Component 3.

32.      The performance of the project will be monitored by a set of indicators which include:
(i) the percentage of the households in targeted settlements that are covered by PATI, as well
as the percentage of females and youth among PATI participants; (ii) increase in the number
of individuals enrolled in RNE, including the number of employment offices established, the
increase in 18-25 year olds enrolled in RNE, and increase in the percentage of enrolled
population without complete secondary education; and (iii) verification that the regulation for
the SPSU Inter-Institutional Coordination has been approved by the Ministerial-level SPSU
Inter-Sectorial Committee, including percentage of frameworks that define institutional
coordination guidelines approved and implemented, percentage of Comunidades Solidarias
participants registered in the Unified Registration System, and percentage of Comunidades
Solidarias programs which incorporated their programmatic offer into the Social Information
System of the SPSU.

             ANNEX 6: POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Prior Action: The Government has implemented a transfer system to elderly individuals
in the 32 poorest municipalities.

33.    We estimate that the transfer system, which transfers $50 per month for every citizen
ageing 70 or above, who does not receive a pension and lives in the 32 poorest municipalities
of the country, is progressive. However, if the program were to be expanded to the whole
country without a targeting mechanism (e.g., means testing or proxy-means testing), the
program would rapidly become regressive.

34.     As indicated in Figure 2a, while targeted to the 32 poorest municipalities, the total
budget of the program going for each of the first 4 deciles of the income distribution is
approximately constant at between $8 and $9 million dollars per decile. Beginning, in the fifth
decile it decreases steadily from $7 million to approximately $2 million in the tenth decile of
the distribution. Figure 2, shows that as a percentage of the total budget, the 4 first deciles
will receive more than 50 percent of the budget, and the share decreases steadily until the
tenth decile which receives about 3 percent of the budget.

35.     Figure 2a also shows how a national program would be regressive. The total amount
per decile would increase from approximately $15 million for the first decile to more than $18
million in the seventh decile of the distribution. Because the share of older citizens receiving
a pension increases substantially from the eighth decile on, the amount going to the eighth,
ninth and tenth deciles decreases to $14, $14.7 and $9 million respectively. Likewise, as
shown in Figure 2b, as a percentage of the total budget, the shares would increase from 10 to
12 percent between the first and the seventh decile, and then decrease rapidly to 6 percent for
the tenth decile. This is a direct result of the fact that life expectancy decreases with income,
therefore there are more senior citizens ageing above 70 in the upper deciles of the income
distribution.

36.    Therefore, before expanding the program from the 32 poorest municipalities to the
country as whole, the Government should explore employing targeting methods that have
been proved effective in programs.

Future Action: The social protection program “Comunidades Solidarias Urbanas” is
operational in 5 poor urban municipalities and its beneficiaries have been incorporated
to the single registry.

37.     As indicated the report “INFORME DE LA EVALUACIÓN DE LA FOCALIZACIÓN
DE RED SOLIDARIA” by IFPRI, the program Comunidades Solidarias Rurales is very well
targeted and therefore progressive. As the program expands to urban area, it is likely that it
will become less progressive. As shown in Figure 3, the urban and rural areas contribute the
same for the national poverty rate of 48 percent; the incidence of poverty is twice as large in
rural areas. Therefore, targeting transfers in urban areas is expected to be considerably more
challenging then targeting in rural areas. The Government should monitor and evaluate the
targeting performance of Comunidades Solidarias Urbanas closely to ensure that the targeting
methods employed are effective and minimize errors of inclusion and exclusion.
