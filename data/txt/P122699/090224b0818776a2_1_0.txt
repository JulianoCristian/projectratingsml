                         The proposed DPL series supports the Government objective of promoting social development and inclusion, while maintaining a sustainable medium term fiscal
                         framework. In particular, the operation supports the Government's efforts aimed at: (i) Creating fiscal space for needed social expenditure by supporting actions to
                         increase tax revenues and to improve efficiency and transparency in the allocation of public resources. The actions cover a number of strategic areas supported by the
                         CPS such as expanding fiscal space, implementing results based budgeting, and enhancing access to information and fiscal transparency. (ii) Protecting and including
                         vulnerable segments of the population by allocating additional public resources towards social programs targeting vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, and
                         children in poor areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The El Salvador Public Finance and Social Progress DPL was approved by the Executive Board of the World Bank on June 2, 2011. The operation is the first of the series of two
                         programmatic DPLs. The project has made significant progress toward achieving its objectives and target outcomes. Achievement under the revenue front has surpassed the target
                         outcomes thanks to significant tax and customs administration efforts. However, the fiscal deficit remains high, reaching 3.6% of GDP for 2012. On the expenditure side, the Treasury
                         has enhanced control over government expenditures while transparency over public resources management has been significantly improved with the publication of the results and
                         conditions for all public contracts. Regarding the gender indicators, committees for monitoring progress with respect to gender equity were created covering the 14 regions and
                         windows for information on women’s right are operational, covering the entire country. Lastly, cash transfer programs for elderly individuals cover more than the number of
                         municipalities targeted at project inception, including the poorest departments in the country
