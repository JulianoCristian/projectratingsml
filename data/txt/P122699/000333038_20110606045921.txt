                                                SUMMARY OF DISCUSSIONS

                                               Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                                               June 2, 2011


       The Executive Directors approved the Public Finance and Social Progress Development
Policy Loan (DPL) to the Republic of El Salvador in the amount of US$100 million on the
payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (R2011-0112).

        Directors expressed support for the DPL and acknowledged its focus on creating fiscal
space for social expenditures and enhancing the protection and inclusion of vulnerable groups.
They noted that the Bank’s support is critical following the 2009 crisis that hit El Salvador’s
economy and set back the social progress achieved in previous years. Looking ahead and noting
uncertainties for growth and deficits, Directors highlighted the importance of tax system reforms.
Directors welcomed the consultative and participatory manner in which the program was prepared.
Finally, aid coordination and continued consultations and consensus building to facilitate the
implementation of the program was also encouraged.
