                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The proposed DPL series supports the Government objective of promoting social development and inclusion, while maintaining a sustainable medium term fiscal
                         framework. In particular, the operation supports the Government's efforts aimed at: (i) Creating fiscal space for needed social expenditure by supporting actions to
                         increase tax revenues and to improve efficiency and transparency in the allocation of public resources. The actions cover a number of strategic areas supported by the
                         CPS such as expanding fiscal space, implementing results based budgeting, and enhancing access to information and fiscal transparency. (ii) Protecting and including
                         vulnerable segments of the population by allocating additional public resources towards social programs targeting vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, and
                         children in poor areas.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The El Salvador Public Finance and Social Progress DPL was approved by the Executive Board of the World Bank on June 2, 2011. The operation is the first in a series of two
                         programmatic DPLs. During the initial stage, the project continues to make progress toward achieving its objectives and target outcomes. For example, tax revenues increased by 0.9
                         percentage points of GDP with respect to baseline values, partially due to the tax administration reforms supported by the operation. On the expenditure side, the volume of
                         Government transactions supervised by the treasury (DGT) doubled with respect to baseline values. Regarding the gender indicators, the Government implemented windows for
                         information on women's rights in 11 of the 14 target regions and created 156 committees for monitoring progress with respect to gender equity in 12 of the 14 regions. Finally, the
                         program of cash transfers for elderly individuals, supported by the DPL, currently reaches the 53 poorest municipalities in the country.
