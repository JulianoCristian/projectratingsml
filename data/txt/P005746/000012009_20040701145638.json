Lessons are as follows. The project's\n            significant implementation delay was, by and large, caused\n            by insufficient preparation time, and inadequate capacity\n            building and training prior to project implementation. This\n            reinforces the need to assess local capacities and provide\n            training as needed, particularly in procurement, financial\n            management, and reporting requirements. In addition, the\n            inadequacy of project monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            indicators, as a management tool for both the Borrower and\n            Bank, suggests the development of relevant operational\n            M&E indicators at the early stages, i.e., project\n            design. While project sustainability is highly likely, the\n            decentralized implementation process was difficult; instead\n            a strong interagency coordination would have further\n            benefited success. Finally, lessons reinforce the benefits\n            of a simple, clear project design, particularly so in the\n            absence of a strong capacity by the implementing agency. And\n            a simple project design would have also reduced the need for\n            additional consulting funds to properly supervise all\n            aspects of the project."}, "docdt": "2004-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
