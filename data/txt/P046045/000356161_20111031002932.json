the\n            Borrower's performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory.

For development effectiveness reasons, both\n            technical and economic/financial, there is a strong need for\n            international river basin water management developments to\n            be formulated and implemented in a joint and integrated\n            manner within and between all of the riparian countries.\n            Specific attention is needed to improve the\n            management/administration of the procurement contracts. Use\n            of such instruments is envisaged to avoid the delays and\n            cost overruns and tackle the procedural/contractual problems\n            encountered during project."}, "docdt": "2011-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
