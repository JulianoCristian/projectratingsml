                         1. Sustaining and increasing agriculture (and livestock) and increasing fisheries production in the Syr Darya basin; and 2. Securing the existence of Northern
                         Aral Sea and improving the ecological/environmental conditions in the delta area and around the sea leading to improved human and animal health and
                         biodiversity.

                         Aral Sea (NAS) water levels increased from a low 38m to the desired design level of 42m. The water surface increased to 3,300 km2 in 2009 compared to 2,400 km2 in 2001. In 2010
                         NAS approached the Aralsk harbor by 35 km compared to 75 km in 2001. Water losses into the desert sinks were reduced from 5 billion m3 in 2003 to less than 1 billion m3 in 2009.
                         Rice planted area increased from 58,500 ha in 2001 to 73,300 ha in 2009. Cattle growing increased from 185 thousand heads in 2001 to 260 thousand heads in 2009. Fish catches
                         from the region increased from 52 tons in 2004 to 2,650 tons in 2009. The increased freshwater inflow has more than halved the salinity levels in NAS to less than 10 gram/liter by
                         August 2010 compared to 2001. Flora and fauna has improved. People reported better health and wellbeing after the micro-climate around the water body has improved.

                         However, there are pending works under the Aklak-Structure contract that need to be completed as soon as possible. Also there is a need for building on the project success by
                         starting its second phase (SYNAS-2) as soon as possible.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         There are pending works under the Aklak-Structure contract that need to be completed as soon as possible. Also there is a need for building on the project success by starting its
                         second phase (SYNAS-2) soon. The client and Bank teams will closely follow up to address these two aspects.
