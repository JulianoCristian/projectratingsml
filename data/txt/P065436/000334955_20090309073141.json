Road\n            Development Program Project in Uganda were as follows:\n            overall outcome of the project was rated as satisfactory;\n            risk to development outcome was moderated; and the\n            performance of the Bank and the Borrower was rated\n            moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned include: 1) Uganda\n            National Roads Authority (UNRA) took long to implement. It\n            would have been advisable to set intermediate triggers in\n            the APL to help accelerate the creation of UNRA. The policy\n            and institutional reforms to transform the ministry's\n            road agency (RAFU) to an autonomous road authority (UNRA)\n            have taken much more time than the anticipated three and\n            half years at project appraisal. While the time needed for\n            the societal decision making process to create UNRA clearly\n            has been underestimated, it also seems that, having created\n            Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU), was a disincentive to\n            rapidly move towards the more comprehensive and autonomous\n            UNRA; 2) future technical assistance (TAs) should have clear\n            objectives of building local capacity with measurable\n            outputs in a specified time. When RAFU was created in 1998,\n            its head and other key staff were expatriate staff appointed\n            under the project funded TA program. The involvement of the\n            TAs was slowly phased out as the capability of national\n            professionals was developed to manage the activities of the\n            sector. In 2004 a Ugandan national professional with a good\n            performance record was appointed as the Director of RAFU,\n            thus replacing an expatriate staff and this has proven to be\n            effective. However, the skill transfer to local staff was\n            not very effective and took a long time; and 3) the\n            application of lime stabilized sub-base needs to be\n            carefully reviewed. For the first phase of the APL\n            instrument, independent consultant was engaged to review the\n            performance of mechanical modification of the sub-base on\n            contract C005 as proposed by the contractor and accepted by\n            the engineer. This was a fairly new area for the\n            implementing agency and, as such, they needed some\n            re-assurance. Based on the consultant's findings and\n            recommendations, this technology was successfully adopted\n            for construction of the sub-base on contract C007 where the\n            designed lime stabilization could not work as the lime\n            meeting the specifications could not react properly with\n            natural gravel available in the project area."}, "docdt": "2009-01-16T00:00:00Z"}
