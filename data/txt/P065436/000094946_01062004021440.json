sector planning, design, and\n            program management capability, as well as road safety\n            management. There are six project components: 1) The first\n            component will support the upgrading of National roads to\n            paved (Bitumen) standard and strengthening of paved roads.\n            It involves: Karuma-Pakwach-Arua Road, Section\n            Karuma-Olwyio-Pakwach, as well as Katunguru-Kasese-Fort\n            Portal, Equator, and Kilembe Roads. 2) The second component\n            will finance road safety improvement and audit study action\n            plan. Phase I of the Action Plan to be implemented under the\n            Phase II project will involve civil works to improve\n            accident blackspots on major corridors, and consulting\n            services concerning the design and construction supervision\n            of such works. 3) The third component will support the\n            preparation of a national transport master plan and\n            transport master plan for Greater Kampala. 4) The fourth\n            component will finance pilot project for demonstration use\n            of innovative technologies for construction of low volume\n            traffic roads. 5) The fifth component will support\n            feasibility study and design of a national road agency\n            building. 6) The sixth component will finance consulting\n            services for the supervision of civil works."}, "docdt": "2001-06-07T00:00:00Z"}
