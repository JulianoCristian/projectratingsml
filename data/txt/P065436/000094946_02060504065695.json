Development Program Project -\n            Phase 2 - will improve access to rural, and economically\n            productive areas, by removing transport services constraints\n            on Uganda's road network. This will necessarily involve\n            land acquisition, therefore this resettlement action plan\n            (RAP) aims to ensure that displaced people benefit from the\n            project, minimizing social disruption, so as to improve\n            their livelihoods, and, restore their income. The RAP is\n            based on the country's 1995 Constitution, and legal\n            framework, the Land, and Land Acquisition Acts (1998 and\n            1965), and, on the Bank's operational guidelines\n            regarding resettlement. Compensation standards for assets\n            lost will be at replacement costs, its valuation applicable\n            to land tenure types. Grievance mechanisms will be available\n            for disputes over land acquisition, and resettlement issues.\n            Access to training, employment, and credit opportunities\n            will be made available to displaced people, through\n            vocational training for either new employment, or incentives\n            via credit for small business expansion as appropriate.\n            Construction allowances, will be provided, as will\n            infrastructure services (e.g., water supply), and social\n            services (e.g., schools, health facilities). Implementation\n            of the resettlement process will be monitored and evaluated\n            during project preparation."}, "docdt": "2001-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
