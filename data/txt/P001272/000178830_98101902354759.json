fishermen by increasing marketed fish production;\n            post-harvest losses would be reduced and fish quality\n            improved by providing storage and preservation facilities.\n            Improved fishing craft and gear would enable fishermen to\n            increase fish catches and production. The proposed pilot\n            Fish Farming Development Center would also contribute to\n            increasing marketed fish production. If successful, the\n            Center would be the nucleus of a second phase expansion for\n            the development of outgrower fish ponds. The project would\n            also include funds for research, training, and studies. The\n            majority of the prospective Project beneficiaries currently\n            earn the equivalent of about US$80 per capita per year. At\n            full development, beneficiaries' annual per capita\n            incomes could be expected to have increased by about 50%.\n            The principal risk the Project would face is that the ice\n            plants and refrigerated stores would not be managed\n            efficiently. This risk will be mitigated if the cooperatives\n            receive the support and confidence of most of the fishermen\n            in the areas they are serving. The cooperatives'\n            ability to provide improved services would be a significant\n            motivating factor."}, "docdt": "1980-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
