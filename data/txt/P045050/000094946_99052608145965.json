      to ensure good quality primary education (five years) for\n            all primary-age children, especially those from\n            disadvantaged groups. There are three project components.\n            The first expands access to primary education by opening new\n            schools, constructing additional classrooms, and repairing\n            existing classrooms; positioning para-professionals in\n            schools to meet increased enrollment; and strengthening\n            child development centers and selectively establishing early\n            childhood education centers in villages. The second\n            component increases retention and improves learning\n            achievement by promoting community awareness and mobilizing\n            community involvement; establishing school management\n            committees for each school; constructing toilets and\n            drinking water facilities; developing instructional material\n            for students; instituting continuous in-service training for\n            and on-site professional support to teachers; and developing\n            targeted interventions for special focus groups. The third\n            component improves state and district capacity to manage\n            primary education by establishing project offices, and block\n            and cluster resource centers; strengthening the state\n            educational research and training institute responsible for\n            curriculum development and teacher training."}, "docdt": "1999-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
