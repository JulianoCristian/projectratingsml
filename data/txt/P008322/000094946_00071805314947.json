"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall outcome of the project is\n            rated as highly satisfactory. The impressive improvement on\n            the financial performance of the telecommunications company\n            (BTC) along with the government's renewed commitment to\n            continued development of the telecommunications sector\n            indicate that the benefits of the project are highly\n            sustainable. Overall, World Bank and Borrower performances\n            were adjudged satisfactory. A key lesson learned is the\n            overall positive effect the Bank can have on sector\n            development when the Bank is involved in all aspects of\n            reform; the Bank's involvement in strengthening BTC\n            gave it credibility in the sector, which permitted the Bank\n            to pursue additional sectoral reforms including BTC's\n            privatization. The project also showed how strong synergy\n            among a country's development partners is key to\n            helping borrowers and governments achieve reform objectives\n            through a coordinated and consultative approach. The Bank\n            succeeded in persuading the Bulgarian authorities to conform\n            to the agreed tariff formula mainly due to effective\n            coordination. The project's reform agenda was very\n            ambitious and government changes delayed important actions.\n            Targets for achieving broader reform objectives should be\n            set with realistic timetables, taking into account political\n            risks and implementation challenges, and these objectives\n            should be adequately described in the project documents.\n            Lastly, the project should have developed monitorable\n            indicators for evaluating technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2000-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
