MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSMRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE BULGARIAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMlPANY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA
EQR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Introduction
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC) with the guarantee of the Republic of Bulgaria for
US$30 million equivalent to help finance a project for the development of telecommunications. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years including four years
of grace.
13ackround
2.    The Government of Bulgaria (GOB) is implementing a radical and comprehensive reform program
whose primary aim is to reduce the large macroeconomic imbalances and to transform the economy from
a centrally-planned system to a market-based one. Such a reform program is being implemented under
extremely difficult economic conditions which include loss of access to foreign commercial bank lending
(including short-term trade credits). The economy is experiencing massive external shocks, brought on
by the collapse of Bulgaria's traditioral export markets. As part of the reform program, the Government
has removed all price controls (except on energy and transport) and opened the economy to external
competition, which quickly established a set of market-based relative prices. In accordance with recently
enacted legislation, agricultural land is being returned to private owners. Also, GOB has largely
completed a process of demonopolization in industry, transport and domestic trade. In addition, a two-
tier banking system has been created and energy prices are being increased periodically. GOB's reform
program is supported by the Bank (through a SAL), by the IMF (through a Stand-By Agreement) and by
the European Community through balance of payments support. The successive governments (since the
1989 revolution) including the present one, which came to power in December 1992, have pursued the
reforn  program through concrete actions.  GOB's primary focus now is to continue prudent
macroeconomic policies, moving ahead with enterprise restructuring and privatization, implementation
of land reform and financial sector reform.
3.    Telecommunications play a critical role in the transition towards a market economy, since many
of the targeted reforms, e.g., improving industrial/enterprise performance, restructuring the banking
sector, promoting exports to Western markets, will need a reliable and wide range of telecommunication
services. However, despite Bulgaria having the highest penetration of telephones in the eastern European
countries (29 telephones per 100 population in 1990), the waiting list for telephones is more than
600,000. The infrastructure is mostly antiquated, resulting in poor reliability and quality of service with
call success rates of less than 25% in all parts of the network. Existing policies of low tariffs and heavy
taxation of corporate income, coupled with the subsidization of tne postal activities, have suppressed
sector revenues available for network extension and modernizaion. Low tariffs have also contributed
to building up US$17 million debt over the years to foreign telecommunication administrations. in
addition, the Committee of Posts and Telecommunications (CPT), the agency responsible for the
teleconununications sector, performs at the same time the functions of owner and of regulator of the
operating entities, which give rise to conflicts of interest. Recognizing the need to address these issues
urgently, and to proviWe a more reliable and wider range of telecommunication services to underpin the
transition to a market economy, GOB has accorded high priority to reforming the telecommunication
sector and has requested the Bank's assistance.
Instutional Setting
4.    The post and telecommunications sector currently comprises three principal public organizations-
the Committee for Posts and Telecommunications (CPT), the Bulgarian Post Company (BPC) and



-2 -
Bulgarian Telecommunications Company (BTC). Before 1991, CPT was also the national operator. In
1991, an interim company, Bulgarian Posts and Telecrmmunications Company was formed out of the
relevant parts of CPT to take operational responsibility for postal and telecommunications services. At
the end of 1992, this interim company was split into BPC and BTC. The President of CPT is appointed
by the Council of Ministers. CPT is responsible for developing and implementing posts and
telecommunications policy, and for issuing regulatory directives in its domain. CPT also holds the
delegated responsibility for the shareholder functions of BPC and BTC. BPC's services include the
collection, sorting and delivery of domestic and international mail, including both letters and parcels by
air and sea, as well as press distribution, issuance and sale of stamps, also for specialized philately
magazines, and counter services. BTC's services include domestic and international telephony, including
fixed telephone network and leased lines, telex, telegraphy, radio and television transmission.
S.    BTC, the borrower of the proposed Bank Loan is a joirnt stock company under the Bulgarian
Commercial Code of 1990. In accordance with the requirements of the Bulgarian Commercial Code, a
seven-member Board of D rectors has been established for BTC. Four of the Board members, including
tie President, are senice managers of BTC. There are three outside directors: one from CPT; one from
the staff of the Council of Ministers; and one from the Ministry of Finance. The organizational structure
of BTC comprises eight divisions, each of which is headed by a Vice President. The eight divisions are:
(i) .qtrategic Planning; (ii) Network Development and Implementation; (iii) Local Services; (iv) Trunk and
International Services; (v) Human Resources; (vi) Marketing and Business Development; (vii) Finance;
and (viii) Information Technology. In addition, corporate services functions, comprising departments for
legal services, Internal Audit, Office of the President and Special Communications, report directly to the
President. Moreover, a Change Management Team, also reporting directly to the President, has been
established to facilitate effective implementation of the split between posts and telecommunications and
the corporate development of BTC. The President and the eight vice presidents, who collectively form
the Executive Board, have all been appointed.
Rationale for B!k Involvement
6.    The (Green Cover) Telecommunications Sector Report prepared by the Bank and agreed with
GOB, provided the basis for project preparation, which was carried out in close cooperation with EIB
and ERBD. EIB, EBRD and the Ban: were involved in defining a least-cost investment program (1993-
2006) for the sector and jointly agreed with the Bulgarian authorities the time slice (1993-1997) of such
investments to be financed under the project. The financial contributions of each of the cofinanciers were
agreed to in a coordinated fashion. In parallel, the Bank took the lead role in delineating the measures
(studies, Governmental decisions to separate policy making/regulation from operations, etc) to improve
the policy environment. The studies are being financed by EC-PHARE. FIB and EBRD have finalized
their respective financial contributions based on the agreements to implement the reconmmenoations of the
studies and to adopt certain (interim) sector performance criteria. The Bulgarian authorities and the
coflnanciers are very keen about the Bank's involvement in the Project.
7.    The Bank's involvement in the proposed Project wili ensure the implementation of sectoral and
institonal reforms in a timely manner. In addition, the proposed Bank loan will permit the completion
of the financing plan for the sector's least-cost investment program at a time when Bulgaria has no access
to private commercial credits. This, in turn, would enhance the revenue generating capacity of BTC,
which should enable BTC to undertake further development on its own in the medium-term. The Bank's
involvement in the proposed Project will also pave the way for a larger private involvement in the sector,
initially in high-value-added services and specialized areas e.g., mobile telecommunications, and later on,
possibly in the fixed telecommunications network itself.



-3 -
Project Obiectives
8.    The objective of the proposed Project is to support the rapid development of the
telecommunications sector along the lines of a strategy adopted by GOB, which calls for policy and
institutional reforms and for implementing a medium-term investment program which reflects economic
priorities.
Proiect DZeserigdon
9.    The proposed Project comprises: (a) implementation of a Digital Overlay Network (DON) of BTC
for the period 1993-1997, including digitali2ation of the trunk routes and renewal/expansion of the
network; (b) design and implementation of a computer-based Operational Support System/Management
Information System (MIS) for BTC; and (c) technical assistance for a Corporate Development Program
of BTC, including establishment of management functions, i.e. accounting, auditing, financial
management, planning, etc.
Proiect Costs and Financing
10.   The total cost of the Project is estimated at about US$301 million equivalent (Leva 11 billion)
including physical and price contingencies of about US$46 million and taxes and duties of about US$16
million but excluding interest during construction (IDC) of about US$38 million. The total financing
requirements are about US$340 million equivalent (Leva 12.5 billion) including MC. The total foreign
exchange requirements are US$207 million equivalent including foreign exchange IDC of US$38 million
equivalent. The foreign exchange costs will be financed by EIB, EBRD and the Bank under parallel
cofinancing arrangements and by BTC. EIB will finance switching equipment (US$75 million
equivalent), EBRD will finance transmission equipment (US$39 million equivalent), the Bank will fmance
microwave links and MIS (US$30 million equivalent) and BTC will finance part of microwave links, local
network rehabilitation and IDC (US$63 million equivalent). BTC would also finance 100% of the local
costs (US$132 miilion equivalent). The financial projections indicate that BTC will be able to generate
these funds. Retroactive financing of US$3 million equivalent is included under the 3ank's financing to
meet the eligible expenditures for the microwave links, recruitment of auditors and MIS design
consultants. Each cofinancier will also finance the related erection and commissioning costs.
11.   The proposed Bank Loan amounting to US$30 million will be made to BTC, with GOB's
guarantee. The proposed Bank Loan will carry the Bank's standard variable interest rate and will be for
a seventeen (17) year period including a four year grace period. BTC will bear the interest rate and
exchange rate risk, and pay to GOB a guarantee fee equal to one-tenth of the Bank's interest rate on the
outstanding balance. A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amo,unts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bulgaria are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report is being
distributed separately.
Environmental Aspect
12.   The project components are not expected to raise significant environmental issues since most
development can be accommodated at existing sites. The satellite earth station would be accommodated
within the existing Intersputnik earth station near Sofia. Installation of fibre optic cables is relatively
straightforward mainly requiring laying of the cables in trenches along existing road and rail corridors.
The project does not have any measurable adverse enviromnental impact and is a Category C for the
purposes of Environmental Assessment. Nevertheless, during project supervision, the Bank will ensure
that the physical components of the project are being implemented in an environmentally prudent maMer.
In fact, the proposed Project is expected to have significant environmental benefits, as more efficient use



- 4. -
of telecommunications will substitute for personal transportation  and  correspondingly  reduce
environmental pollution and promote energy conservation.
Poec   Irneentation and Monitoring
13.   The project would be implemented by BTC. Tlhe impImentation capabilities of BTC are iimited,
particularly in view of the large investments under the project an. virtually no major investnents
undertaken by CPT/BTC in the recent past.  In recognition of its limited capabilities, BTC has:
(a) recruited NEPOSTEL (the consulting, aram of PT1  Netherlands) to prepare all the tender documents
for DON, including for the Bank-financed Microwave component; (b) designed all bids for contracting
on a supply and install (turnmey) basis, (c) completed the evaluation of the tenders for EIB and EBRD
financed contracts with significant help from NEPOST'EL; and (d) contTacted NEPOSTEL to assist with
the evaluation of Bank-financed contracts and negotiations with contractors. In addition, BTC has agreed
to recruit consultants to assist in implementation of the DON component, for which the terms of reference
bave been agreed with the Bank. EIB will finance such implementation consultancy. As regards MIS,
BTC would recruit consultants to design, assist in procurement, and slupervise implementation. These
implementation arrangements will enable BTC to complete the project as planned. BTC will furnish
Quarterly Progress Reports showing the status of physical implementation of the project.
ALfreements Reached
14.   During negotiations, GOB agreed: (a) to take all necessary measures in consultation with the Bank
to establish, by December 31, 1993, a functional policy and regulatory framework for the
telecommunications sector acceptable to the 3sank; and (b) together with BTC: (i) to implement, no later
than January 1, 1994, a new telecommunications tariff policy satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) to limit BTC's
postal subsidies to BPC during 1993 to 25% of BTC's operating profit or US$15.5 million equivalent,
whichever is lower; (iii) beginning with January 1, 1994, not to subsidize BPC out of BTC's revenues;
(iv) until a new tariff policy is adopted, to increase BTt's tariffs quarterly to maintain such tariffs at 30%
in real terms above the levels prevailing on May 1, 1992. During negotiations, BTC agreed to: (a) take
all necessary measures to: (i) maintain a minimum debt-service cover ratio of 2.0 from 1993; (ii) to
generate funds from internal sources equivalenit to not less than 25% of investments in 1993 and 40%
thereafter; and (iii) maintain its current ratio above 1.0 from 1994 onwards; (b) (i) submit to the Bank,
beginning with 1993, its draft five-year rolling business plan before October 31 of each year and final
business plan approved by GOB before December 31 of each year; (ii) review with the Bank all
investments including all joint ventures; and (iii) implement before December 31, 1995 its Corporate
Development Program in accordance with an action plan satisfactory to the Bank; and (c) have the special
account, statement of expenditures, and financial accounts audited by internationally reputable auditors
and submit accounts together with the audit reports to the Bank within six months after the end of the
fiscal year starting with 1993 accounts.  The following are set as conditions of effectiveness of the
pro~soed Loan: (a) CPT has issued an operator license satisfactory to the Bank to BTC;
(b) telecommunication tariffs have been increased by 30% in real terms over the levels prevailing as of
May 1, 1992; and (c) the EIB and EBRD loans have become effective.
Project Benefits
15.   Intemal Economic Rate of Retum  (IERR). The IERR of the proposed Project is estimated at
about 33%, based on measurable costs and benefits. The IERR of the proposed Project is typical of
returns under telecommunications projects and is significantly above the opportunity cost of capital in
Bulgaria. This is because: (a) the tariffs for telecommunications services are higher than the cost of
providing these services; and (b) investments in telecommunications have a relatively short gestation
period i.e. parts of the addition to the network will start generating revenues before the whole project is
completed. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project is sensitive to delays in project implementation
(which can be minimized) as well as to decline in traffic (which are not flly under the control of BTC).



- 5 -
Nevertheless, even under the most unfavorable case, i.e. a two-year delay in project implementation, the
ERR of the proposed Project would be above 21 %.
16.    Other Benefits. The rapid development of the telecommunications sector supported by the
proposed Project will provide the necessary basis for a quicker transition to a market economy. In
addition, modernizing the telecommunications network will provide the necessary infrastructure for
private sector to offer high value-added services, thus contributing to the creation of employment and
wealth. The establishment of the digital infrastructure (optical fibre, microwave systems) will enable
Bulgaria to participate in several regional telecommunications systems. Participatior in such regional
systems will generate additional revenuess from transit traffic. Furthermore, implumentation of the
proposed Project will result in significant revenies for the Government from corporate taxes,
contributions to the National Communications System Fund, and turnover taxes. Financial projections
indicate that the total resources accruing to the Govermnent through the year 2000 is about Leva 49.4
billion (US$1.2 billion)+ Further, the proposed Project could be a model for restructuring other sectors
and companies ir. Bulgaria.
Risks
17.   One of the risks that could affect the proposed Project is the limited project implementation
capability of the Bulgarians. To address this risk, implementation of the physical components of the
proposed Project will be mainly through single-point responsibility contracts (supply and erect, turnkey,
etc.) and BTC will be assisted by experienced project implementation consultants. The institutional and
policy reform would also be assisted by consultants and raonitored closely by the Bank. The risk that
the sectoral and tariff reforms would not be carried out is minimal since the Bulgarian Government has
participated fully in the formulation of the reform program, as evidenced by the agreements finalized with
EB, EBRD and the Bank.
Sustainability
18.   High returns on investments in telecommunications development in Bulgaria, which is a function
of pent up and growing demand, and as a result of relatively high tariffs compared to costs will stimulate
private sector interest and involvement in the sector. This would be aided by improvements in the
telecomnnunications policy framework which will include transparent regulation. In addition to providing
the necessary resources for tne establishment of a modern telecommunications network, the proposed
Project would support the corporate development of BTC, which should enable the company to improve
its operational and financial efficiency and establish a track record of high quality of service and
strengthened financial position. Such strengthened financial position could allow BTC in future years to
mobilize resources directly, i.e., without Government guarantee, through borrowings in domestic and
foreign capital markets for its fiuture capital expansion needs.
19.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
