The Board approved the loan on June 5,\n            1975 and loan documents were signed on June 30, 1975. During\n            the course of various discussions aimed at achieving loan\n            effectiveness, it became apparent that a dispute over water\n            rights had developed between the Republic of Bosnia\n            Herzegovina and the Republic of Montenegro. The project was\n            to be implemented in Bosnia Herzegovina, and Montenegro was\n            not willing to give its approval to ratification of the\n            guarantee agreement. The Bank later learned that the\n            inter-republic disputes arose from a proposal by Montenegro\n            to divert the waters of the Tara river into the Adriatic Sea\n            via the Moraca river for the purpose of another project. The\n            project was canceled on February 29, 1976 after the Bank was\n            informed by the Government that the unanimous agreement of\n            all republics needed to pass the effective legislation would\n            not be forthcoming."}, "docdt": "1993-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
