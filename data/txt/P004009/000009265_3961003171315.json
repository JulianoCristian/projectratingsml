workers and 800,000 farmers will be trained, with about 30\n            percent of trainees being women); (b) supporting studies and\n            field investigations (i) to develop appropriate\n            farmer-responsive technology, including a program of\n            investigation into pest/natural enemy interactions in\n            different eco-systems; (ii) an occupational health study,\n
