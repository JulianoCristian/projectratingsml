The components\n            include: a) a promotion campaign targeting renewable energy\n            for agricultural productive purposes, and, training to\n            technicians, agricultural extension experts, and energy\n            system vendors, will be provided. Technical specifications\n            and certification procedures will be introduced for\n            farm-based energy equipment, and market studies will focus\n            on the potential for agricultural applications; b)\n            installation of solar and wind-powered water pumping\n            systems, and solar-powered refrigerated milk storage tanks,\n            for participating farmers as demonstration units; c)\n            technical assistance, which will be provided by renewable\n            energy-trained agricultural extension experts, to advise\n            farmers on the new energy operation procedures; d) a pilot\n            program will test innovative vendor financing mechanisms for\n            farm-based energy systems in four states; and, e) project\n            management will be implemented and coordinated by FIRCO."}, "docdt": "1999-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
