Lessons learned from the\n            project: In order to ensure the optimal impact of\n            interventions, it was essential that the principal project\n            implementing agency was related to the agriculture sector in\n            order that it could promote productive uses of the energy.\n            In order to ensure the optimal impact of interventions, it\n            became clear during implementation that it was essential to\n            consider the livelihood consequences that will occur through\n            provision of renewable energy and to integrate this into all\n            components, including through investing in improving\n            productive processes. It is important to ensure that\n            dissemination is considered carefully in project design.\n            Subprojects must be supported by co-financing from\n            beneficiaries. For renewable energy investments to have a\n            high impact and broad replication, an effective financing\n            scheme is very important and this will most likely have to\n            involve subsidized financing. Close monitoring and tracking\n            of technical assistance and its results through innovative\n            use of the internet and GIS can help greatly to evaluate the\n            success of activities and to modify and optimize them."}, "docdt": "2007-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
