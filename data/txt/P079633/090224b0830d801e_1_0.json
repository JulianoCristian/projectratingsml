The global\n            economic and financial crisis has contributed to a\n            significant economic slowdown in Benin, and a widening of\n            the fiscal and current account deficits. Despite progress in\n            improving access to basic services, achieving the Millennium\n            Development Goals (MDGs) remains a significant challenge.\n            Benin is on track to meet the MDGs for access to potable\n            water in rural areas, eradicating hunger, and reduced\n            HIV/AIDS prevalence. The International Development\n            Association (IDA) Country Assistance Strategies have\n            supported Benin\u2019s efforts to implement core priorities\n            established in its poverty reduction strategies. In June\n            2010, the IMF approved a three-year Extended Credit Facility\n            (ECF) arrangement for Benin, and called for urgent action to\n            reduce the fiscal deficit, restore macroeconomic stability,\n            and make progress on economic reforms. Benin is one of the\n            heavily indebted countries that have graduated from the\n            Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, receiving 100\n            percent cancellation of eligible debt under the Multilateral\n            Debt Relief Initiative. Under the ongoing Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS), the Bank has relied on a combination of\n            development policy and investment operations in order to\n            encourage a coherent approach to supporting structural\n            reforms. The government\u2019s Growth Strategy for Poverty\n            Reduction (2011-2015), is to make Benin an emerging economy\n            by 2025."}, "docdt": "2012-05-31T05:07:05Z"}
