Delivery Project for Benin were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            despite many competing needs in the energy sector, projects\n            should remain selective in their objectives and simple in\n            their design. The combination of power sector reforms,\n            transmission/distribution investments, and biomass energy\n            activities reflected an overly ambitious and diffuse\n            approach that could have benefited from further reflection\n            on sector priorities and risks. Expectations for private\n            sector participation need to be realistic and necessary\n            preconditions should be clearly identified and achievable.\n            It is important to note that the privatization of a state\n            owned electricity utility, such as SBEE (Societe Beninoise\n            d'Energie Electrique - Benin Distribution Power\n            Utility), should therefore be based on its specific\n            condition rather than on a structural liberalization or\n            privatization program. Project objectives and targets should\n            account for endogenous and exogenous risks potentially\n            impacting outcomes and recognize inherent interdependency in\n            the value chain. Institutional development is a\n            transaction-intensive and time-consuming process and such\n            activities should be advanced as much as possible during\n            project preparation while being given sufficient priority in\n            project design and implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
