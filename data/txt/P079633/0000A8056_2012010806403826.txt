                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives are to: (a) accelerate, in a commercially viable manner, the use of electricity for economic growth and social services and thus
                         improve the quality of life in un-served and underserved areas (peri-urban and rural); (b) improve governance and ensure the financial sustainability of the
                         sector, through the involvement of the private sector in partnership with the public sector; (c) reduce deforestation and increase access and diversify choice to
                         renewable and cleaner fuels to the household and SME sectors; and (d) promote regional cooperation while protecting the environment in a sustainable manner.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project restructuring is delayed by the clearance of the Resettlement Policy Framework . The restructuring will (i) extend the closing date of the project and its additional financing
                         from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012, (ii) transfer contracts that will likely extend beyond 2012 to the Increased Access to Modern Energy Project, the project follow-on
                         project with similar objectives and activities, and (iii) reallocate credit proceeds. Project Outcomes and its Development Objectives will not be affected. The project scope will remain
                         unchanged and safeguards requirements will not be impacted.
