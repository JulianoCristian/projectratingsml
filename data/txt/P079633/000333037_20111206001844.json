The\n            component giving rise to involuntary settlement is the\n            establishment of a right-of-way in the corridor where a high\n            voltage line is being built. People with dwellings in the\n            corridor have to be displaced; villages will lose property\n            rights on lands crossed by the line; crops cannot be grown\n            on sites where lattice towers, substations, and\n            access/service roads will be built; and people will lose\n            their livelihood from trees that will have to be felled\n            because of construction. The transmission line route will\n            avoid villages or large concentrations of human habitations.\n            As a result, existing on existing buildings are confined to\n            dispersed housing clusters remote from population centers,\n            and a route will be modified to avoid dislocating ten\n            families. Each family displaced will be compensated\n            according to the nature and surface area of their dwelling,\n            and to the elements of their holdings inventoried. Each\n            village having lands crossed by the corridor will be\n            compensated for land loss due to an easement, for income\n            loss related to trees used as an economic resource, for land\n            acquired from them to build substations, and for farm income\n            loss. Owners of huts or houses will be paid the replacement\n            cost of another dwelling , and in some villages the\n            acquisition cost of the plot itself is also included. For\n            those families who had not invested in the upkeep of their\n            property or who got an early start on rebuilding when\n            hearing of the project and now find themselves in\n            difficulties as a consequence, they are also eligible to\n            receive compensation: the implementing agency (the\n            bi-national electricity board, CEB) will grant a lump-sum\n            compensation to be used for a community project to each\n            community losing property rights on sections of their\n            property; CEB will pay an indemnity equal to the cost of\n            preparing the soil of replacement farmland to compensate\n            farmers for land loss-farmers will be allowed to harvest\n            prior to works and refrain from planting new crops within\n            the project-affected area; CEB will acquire land for\n            substation construction at market prices; and CEB will pay\n            compensation to fruit tree  and timber stand owners and\n            beneficiaries based on replacement cost or market prices."}, "docdt": "2011-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
