The project's implementation\n            progress has been rated marginally satisfactory with the key\n            investment components foreseen under the project, which\n            account for 58 percent of the project's financing,\n            accomplished: the northern Togo - northern Benin\n            transmission line is complete and fully operational barring\n            a few minor technical issues that are being addressed by the\n            contractor. The rehabilitation and expansion measures, which\n            were to enhance electricity supply in Cotonou and Porto\n            Novo, are also complete. Under all other components,\n            important milestones have also been achieved. In June 2010,\n            72 percent of the financing of the ESDP was disbursed, while\n            for the ESDP's additional financing 9 percent were\n            disbursed. This leaves SDR 8.6million and 3.8 million to be\n            disbursed over the extended period of the project."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
