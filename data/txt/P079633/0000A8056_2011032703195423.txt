                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives are to: (a) accelerate, in a commercially viable manner, the use of electricity for economic growth and social services and thus
                         improve the quality of life in un-served and underserved areas (peri-urban and rural); (b) improve governance and ensure the financial sustainability of the
                         sector, through the involvement of the private sector in partnership with the public sector; (c) reduce deforestation and increase access and diversify choice to
                         renewable and cleaner fuels to the household and SME sectors; and (d) promote regional cooperation while protecting the environment in a sustainable manner.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A project restructuring is underway to reallocate proceeds in order to meet cost overrun and additional works. An updated implementation schedule will be submitted as part of the
                         restructuring paper.The restructuring will not affect the Project Outcomes and its Development Objectives. The project scope and outcomes will remain unchanged and safeguards
                         requirements will not be impacted.
