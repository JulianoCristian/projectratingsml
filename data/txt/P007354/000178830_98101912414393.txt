I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. The Economic Setting
1.01      Honduras, with a population of 3 million and per capita income of
$450 in 1977, is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. The
long-term rate of growth of the economy has been slower than that of the
other Central American countries. During 1950-75 real GDP increased at an
average annual rate of 3.7%, which was only slightly above the 2.7% rate of
population growth.
1.02      The industrial sector is less well developed in Honduras than in
the other Central American countries. In 1977 industry accounted for about
17% of GDP and provided employment for about 10% of the labor force. The
development of industry was based initially on the processing of local raw
materials, particularly agricultural and forestry inputs, and these activities
still account for about 65% of manufacturing value added, with 6 firms
contributing about 25% of the total.
1.03      The country's natural resource base is limited and the economy is
still based predominantly on agriculture and forestry, which contribute
about one-third of GDP and four-fifths of exports and provide two-thirds of
employment. The country's extensive pine forests, which are the largest in
Central America, are one of its most important resources but their exploita-
tion has been limited and inefficient in the past, and they have been depleted
by widespread burning of forests as part of the traditional system of shifting
agriculture and because of poor conservation practices.
1.04      Forested lands account for 7.4 million ha.  (about two-thirds of
the total area of Honduras), of which 3.2 million ha. are broad-leaved,
2.0 million ha. are coniferous, and 2.2 million ha. are denuded. Broad-leaved
forests (mostly mixed tropical hardwoods) are generally located in areas
with difficult access, whose exploitation is often not commercially viable
(i.e., low per ha. volume of commercially used species). Pine forests are
better known, have better commercial possibilities, and the production of
sawn pine wood is by far the most important forest industry activity. However,
present production methods have been inefficient: only about 70% of usable
harvested wood reaches the mills because of inefficient harvesting and
difficulty in transport; and at the mills, wasteful production techniques
result in an output of sawn wood amounting to only one-third of wood inputs.
In order to protect forest lands, to control their exploitation, and to
provide for a systematic and rational development of the forestry sector,
in 1974 the government adopted a Forest Law which created the Corporacion
Hondurena de Desarrollo Forestal (COHDEFOR) to carry out the government's
new forestry policy.
1.05      Economic development has been hampered by the rugged terrain
and by inadequacies in infrastructure, although significant progress has



been made in recent years towards creating a basic transportation network
and expanding power generating capacity. Progress has also been made in
diversifying exports, as coffee, lumber and beef have increased in impor-
tance. However, with bananas still accounting for 40% of exports and
heavy dependence on other agricultural exports, Honduras remains vulner-
able to the vagaries of weather, as demonstrated by the dramatic economic
impact of hurricane Fifi in 1974-75, which led to a 5% drop in per capita
income and a major reduction in export revenues.
1.06      Since 1972 government development efforts have increased sub-
stantially and several measures have been taken which are already showing
positive results and are expected to lay the basis for an improved economic
outlook. Public investment has increased, particularly in infrastructure,
agrarian reform is being pursued actively, and increased investment is being
directed towards the productive sectors, including agriculture, forestry,
tourism and industry. Important institutional developments have also taken
place with the establishment of COHDEFOR and the Corporacion Nacional de
Inversiones (CONADI), the national industrial investment bank which is
helping to promote, finance and implement large industrial investments.
1.07      While economic growth accelerated to 6.6% p.a. in 1976 and 7.9%
in 1977, the balance of payments had a current account deficit of US$121
million in 1977, i.e., somewhat above the US$109 million recorded in
1976, mainly due to the suspension of coffee sales in the second quarter.
The outlook for 1978 is for a higher deficit than in 1977, owing principally
to a decline in coffee prices and increased imports as a result of a higher
level of economic activity and of foreign equipment required by new public
investment programs. Prospects are favorable for a continuation of economic
expansion (real GDP growth rates averaging 6% p.a. are projected for 1978-83),
provided adequate financing is available for the country's ambitious
development program involving public and private investment.
B. The Structure of Industry
Industrial Growth
1.08      During the 1960s import-based industries including some new indus-
tries producing detergents, cosmetics, metal products and plastics developed
at a faster rate than the local input-based industries. However, this trend
did not continue into the 1970s and traditional consumer goods industries,
such as food products, beverages, tobacco, footwear and apparel, and inter-
mediate goods such as lumber and cardboard boxes, are still predominant. The
production of heavy intermediate and capital goods remains minimal given the
size of the market (Table 1.1).

1.09      During the 1960s industrial value added grew by only 3.8% per year,
at approximately the same rate as the economy was growing. Slow growth
was due to the small size of the domestic market, infrastructure problems
and the inability of domestic firms to take full advantage of the oppor-
tunities offered by the creation of the Central American Common Market
(CACM) in 1961. CACM intra-regional trade, the bulk of which was in
manufactured products, increased rapidly from US$30 million in 1960 to
US$252 million in 1968. While the volume of Honduran exports to the CACM
grew from US$8 million to US$30 million over this period, its share of
intra-regional trade dropped from 27% to 12%. The withdrawal of Honduras
from the CACM, following hostilities with El Salvador in 1969, led to some
disruption of trade within the region. Subsequently, Honduras signed bila-
teral agreements with each of the CACM countries except El Salvador, providing
for partial restoration of free trade along CACM lines but offering certain
advantages to Honduras, which was permitted to charge tariffs on some manu-
factured goods from CACM countries.
1.10      Industrial growth accelerated significantly during 1970-76, with
industrial value added increasing at an average annual rate of 7%. Faster
growth was facilitated initially by the reduction in competition from imports
when Honduras left the CACM and was later aided by the renewed granting of
industrial investment incentives, which triggered a process of modernization
and expansion of industrial capacity. The industrial growth rate during
this period would have been slightly higher but for the effects on the Atlantic
coast region of the 1974 hurricane, which caused wind and water damage to



- 4 -
industrial facilities, local raw material shortages, disruptions to trans-
portation and lower demand for industrial goods from the affected population.
Although industrial value added grew by only 2.6% in 1975, the sector re-
covered rapidly thereafter, and industrial value added increased by 11.8% in
1976 and 11.5% in 1977.
Size and Distribution of Enterprises
1.11      In Honduras most industrial enterprises are relatively small.  The
1975 industrial census lists 847 firms with more than 5 employees (i.e. the
factory sector), which together contributed US$150 million equivalent, or 83%,
of total manufacturing value added and employed 36,733 workers. Artisan and
very small enterprises (employing less than 5 workers) contributed a further
US$25 million to manufacturing value added but gave employment to some 40,000
workers, a large proportion of whom work in family concerns. Of the 847 firms
with 5 or more employees, 56% had less than 20 employees and more than 90%
had less than 100; almost two-thirds were family owned and only 20% were in-
corporated. Most of these firms were located in the country's two largest
cities, Tegucigalpa (32%) and San Pedro Sula (39%), and the other enterprises
(mostly smaller ones) in several medium-sized towns.
1.12      Much of the industrial investment in the 1960s and 1970s has led
to a significant modernization of productive capacity and the establishment
of larger and more efficient factories. As a result, the contribution to
manufacturing value added by firms with less than five employees fell from
42% to 16% between 1960 and 1975, with a corresponding increase in the share
of production by the country's larger enterprises. These trends have been
accompanied by significant rises in labor productivity in sectors such as
food, beverages and tobacco; and textiles and clothing, where a six-fold
increase in value added has been achieved with only a doubling of the work
force. The trend towards larger factories and higher productivity is partly
a consequence of diversification into more capital-intensive products and
processes and the growth of export-oriented industries such as meat packing,
sugar, and textiles which have to be quite large in order to be competitive.
However, the average capital intensity of the Honduran factory sector (capital
per worker ratio of US$7,500 equivalent in 1975) is quite low by Latin
American standards.
1.13      Out of the 847 firms in the factory sector, about 10% (those with
more than 100 employees) accounted for 53% of factory output and 52% of
factory employment. An additional 30% of firms provided 40% of output and
35% of employment. The remaining 60% accounted for just 7% of output but
contributed 13% of employment. Most firms in this latter group have fixed
assets of less than US$100,000 and a work force of less than 20. The pro-
posed loan contains special features to ensure that these firms would derive
substantial benefits under the project.

Employment and Wages
1.14      Triggered by the rapid rise in investment, during 1960-70 employ-
ment in firms with five or more employees increased at a relatively high
average annual rate of 6.2% and total employment in such firms increased from
14,900 in 1960 to 36,733 in 1975. However, employment in firms with less than
5 workers grew much more slowly, at an average annual rate of 2.3% p.a. As a
result, the overall rate of growth of employment in manufacturing averaged
only 3.8% annually, i.e. barely above the 3% p.a. rate of growth of the
country's population during that period.  Within factory employment, the sub-
sectors which contributed most to employment creation were food processing
(24.6% of new jobs), wood industries (13.4%), metal products (10.0%), textiles
(9.1%), tobacco (8.8%), non-metallic minerals (6.3%) and apparel (6.2%).
These percentages generally reflect the relative importance of these subsectors
in manufacturing value added. As indicated in Table 1.2, the subsectoral
composition of employment in factories showed some shifts in the 1960s but did
not change very substantially in the 1970s.

1.15      Compared to the other CACM countries, the labor force in Honduras
is less skilled, partly because the adult literacy rate is only 53% and
vocational training systems are not highly developed. On the other hand,
labor costs, including wages and social charges, are lower in Honduras than
in Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua (Table 1.3). These relatively low
labor costs, coupled with political stability and comparatively good
management-labor relations, help to keep Honduras reasonably competitive in
the CACM context.

1.16      With IDA assistance (Cr. 777-HO), the government is presently
taking steps to upgrade workers' skills in the agriculture and forestry
sectors. One of the beneficiaries of the IDA credit is the post-secondary
National School of Forestry (ENF), whose facilities will be both improved
and expanded. Many graduates of ENF are employed by COHDEFOR, and, as a
result of the expansion of ENF's training activities, COHDEFOR would be
provided with most of the technicians it needs to carry out its forestry
development program. Formal technical training in the manufacturing
sector is carried out by the post-secondary National Institute for Voca-
tional Training (INFOP), while some informal training is provided by
several secondary vocational schools. The Bank has been instrumental in
assisting Honduras to develop its vocational training system through INFOP.
Under the First Educational Project (Loan 954/Cr.452-HO), two vocational
training centers were built and equipped in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula.
As a result, INFOP's annual output has increased from 333 graduates in 1973
to 7,075 in 1976. Of the total of 18,241 graduates, 5,946 (33%) have received
industrial training, in such areas as electrical installations, welding,
bricklaying, carpentry, graphic arts, printing, garment making, shoe making,
tailoring, butchering, mechanics, machinery maintenance, and refrigeration.
Industrial Investment
1.17      During 1965-70 investment in industrial fixed assets by firms
employing five or more workers grew by about 7% per year in real terms, i.e.
more than 50% faster than the real factory output growth of 4.3% p.a. During
1971, and particularly 1972, the rate of investment declined, partly as a
result of the removal or reduction of investment incentives by Honduras
following its withdrawal from the CACM. These incentives were partially
restored after Honduras signed bilateral treaties with Guatemala, Nicaragua
and Costa Rica in 1972-73, leading to an increase in investor confidence
and the implementation of a number of projects which had been postponed.
In 1973 new investment increased by 32% in real terms over the depressed
level of 1972. This higher level of investment in fixed assets in factories,



- 7 -
averaging about US$26 million 1/ annually (data for individual years can vary
considerably due to the impact of individual large projects) was maintained
during 1974 and 1975, despite the disruption in output and losses in plant and
equipment of US$9.2 million caused by hurricane Fifi. During 1973-75 important
new investments were made in four new sugar mills and in petroleum refining,
and significant modernization and capacity expansion took place in meat pack-
ing, beverages, textiles, sawmills, and plastics.
1.18      Preliminary estimates show that the pace of industrial investment
increased further in 1976 and 1977 to reach about US$24 million 1/ in the
latter year. Nevertheless, over the period 1970-77 the real industrial in-
vestment growth rate averaged about 5% p.a. and did not fully keep pace with
the real industrial output growth rate of almost 7% p.a. Since part of the
investment was for modernization and replacement of existing plants, the
growth rate of productive capacity lagged far behind increases in industrial
production, with the result that capacity utilization is estimated to have
increased from about 50% in 1968 to some 77% in 1977. 2/
1.19      Direct foreign investment has not yet played a very important role
in Honduras' industrial development, despite the availability of significant
investment incentives and the virtual absence of restrictions on private for-
eign investment in the sector before 1974. In general, foreign companies
interested in establishing manufacturing facilities in Central America have
tended to locate in the economically more developed countries of the region.
Also, as part of the government's effort to begin a systematic development
of the forestry sector (para. 1.04), tighter regulations have been imposed on
foreign investments in the forestry and wood products sector. As a result,
some foreign investors have been required to divest themselves of their owner-
ship in enterprises involved in the export of lumber and resin production and
to limit ownership to not more than 49% in enterprises involved in large-scale
pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing.
Industrial Imports and Exports
1.20      With its relatively small industrial base and small domestic market,
Honduras has to import a wide range of manufactured products for which local
production would not be economical. In 1960 approximately 41% of domestic
demand for manufactures was met by imports, divided almost equally between
consumer goods (33.6%), intermediate goods (32.6%) and capital goods (33.8%).
While the overall proportion of manufactured goods imported did not change
significantly between 1960 and 1970, Honduras was successful in substituting
imports of some consumer goods by local production, with the result that con-
sumer goods imports dropped to 27% of total manufactured imports by 1970.

1.21      Manufactured exports grew at 28% p.a. between 1960 and 1970, and at
24% p.a. during 1970 to 1976 to reach US$111.3 million equivalent in the latter
year. In constant 1966 lempiras these rates of growth are equivalent to 13.6%
and 2.3%, respectively. Primarily as a result of increased exports of pro-
cessed foods and lumber to North American and European markets, exports grew
somewhat faster than manufacturing output, and manufactured exports' share in
total output increased from 10.1% in 1960 to 16.8% in 1976. Manufactured
exports also increased as a proportion of total merchandise exports from 18%
in 1960 to about 23% in 1976.
1.22      The composition of Honduran manufactured exports has changed markedly
since 1960, when intermediate goods made up 72.4% of total manufactured exports,
with lumber and lumber products representing 67.5% of the total. Despite
considerable expansion of lumber exports in the late sixties and early seven-
ties, by 1976 lumber exports represented only 28% of total manufactured exports,
and intermediate goods only 44.8% of the total. The major increases in manu-
factured exports occurred in consumer goods, of which food products (particu-
larly meat and sugar) represented the most important category followed by
textiles, apparel and furniture. Since 1970 Honduras has also been quite
successful in increasing exports of light engineering goods produced by metal
industries.



- 9 -
1.23      The proportion of Honduran manufactured exports going to other CACM
countries remained approximately constant, at about 25%, during the 1960s.
However, following its withdrawal from the CACM in 1969, the proportion of
Honduran manufactured exports going to the CACM averaged less than 5% between
1970 and 1974. Honduras was successful in maintaining export momentum during
this period by substantially increasing trade with Europe. Since 1974 exports
to the CACM region have been increasing 28% annually on average and reached
an estimated 33% of total manufactured exports in 1976.
C. Industrial Policy
Industrial Incentives
1.24      By far the most important policies affecting the manufacturing
sector since 1960 have been those determined by the Honduran participation
in the CACM. The main policy instruments have been the Central American
Agreements on Fiscal Incentives to Industrial Development (CAAFIID) and the
establishment of the Common External Tariff (CET). Both of these instruments
were designed to support a strategy of regional import substitution within the
CACM. Under the CAAFIID agreement, which superseded industrial incentive
legislation enacted separately by the CACM countries shortly before 1960,
qualifying industrial firms were granted exemptions for up to 10 years from
income taxes and from tariffs on imported equipment and raw materials and
other inputs.
1.25      Maximum benefits were provided to Group A companies that produce
industrial inputs and capital goods as well as mainly consumer goods indus-
tries that use raw materials and intermediate products, at least 50% of which
are of Central American origin. Lesser benefits were provided to Group B
companies producing high domestic value added products but depending to a
significant extent on imported inputs. Group C industries, which receive the
lowest benefits comprising a 3-year exemption from tariffs on imported equip-
ment and raw materials, were those not qualifying as Group A or B but judged
to be economically desirable in view of their domestic value added, balance
of payments and employment impacts. Various modifications have been made to
the incentive package during the 1960s and 1970s but the basic characteristics
remain the same. After its withdrawal from the CACM in 1970 Honduras reduced
or cancelled some of the investment incentives, but they were largely restored
after Honduras signed bilateral agreements with all CACM countries except El
Salvador.
1.26      The effect of the incentives program in encouraging industrial
investment has been important overall, although it has been costly in terms
of revenue foregone and it is likely that much investment would have taken
place with lesser incentives. By 1975 some 261 of the 847 firms with more
than five employees had benefited from the incentives program. These firms
accounted for 62% of value added in factory production, 67% of book value



- 10 -
of fixed assets, and 57% of factory employment. The cost of the incentives in
lost fiscal revenues has been substantial, amounting to 15% of total 1975 tax
revenues. While these problems are recognized in Honduras, pending a revision
of the regional system the authorities have been reluctant to take action
because of strong competition for investment by the other CACM member countries.
1.27      In the context of a more outward-looking industrial strategy, a
revision of industrial investment incentives to reduce excessive protection
in some branches has been under consideration for some time at the CACM level.
While there appears to be support from most countries for making the incen-
tives less generous and more selective and for placing increased emphasis on
exports outside the region rather than concentrating solely on regional import
substitution, to date specific details of the revision have not been agreed
upon. The Bank has recently undertaken a study of industrial development
policies in the CACM. The ongoing dialogue on the question of industrial
incentives will be continued in the context of discussing the mission's report
with the CACM member countries. Under the project, the subproject review
process would pay particular attention to the economic justification of in-
vestments contemplated, regardless of the incentives they might receive.
Tariff Policy and Protection
1.28      Tariff policy in Honduras is closely related to liberalization of
intra-regional trade and the establishment of the CET for imports from coun-
tries outside the CACM. The CET followed the basic structure of national
tariffs in the region, which provide high protection rates for consumer goods
and their components and generally lower rates for inputs not available with-
in the region and for intermediate and capital goods. While Honduras has
generally followed the CACM model for the CET, as part of the bilateral agree-
ments signed after 1973, it is permitted to charge moderate tariffs on some
imports from other CACM countries.
1.29      Although nominal tariffs for industrial inputs vary substantially
between products, with subsector averages ranging from 10% to 150%, most sub-
sectors are below the 35% level. The average nominal protection rate of 22%
(weighted by the gross value of domestic production with subsectors) in
Honduras is quite low in comparison with Costa Rica (43%), and somewhat less
than those of the other CACM countries. Effective protection rates are some-
what higher, particularly for those subsectors with high nominal rates of
protection (i.e. luxury items, processed agricultural products, seafood, wood
products, clothing, textiles, soaps and detergents). However, most of these
same subsectors are responsible for much of the increase in manufactured
exports (para. 1.22), thus indicating that available effective protection has
not been utilized in many instances. Consequently, with few exceptions
Honduras' tariff structure has not encouraged production of goods on an
uneconomic scale and at prices which are substantially above international
levels. The bulk of industry is therefore still based on the processing of
local inputs, some of which are exported in the world market, and competition
within the region and the restricted purchasing power in the domestic market
have largely prevented industry from taking undue advantage of protection
levels.



- 11 -
Export Promotion
1.30      Export incentives in Honduras are more limited and less generous
than in some of the CACM countries: they comprise a drawback scheme and a
guarantee bond scheme. Both of these mechanisms enable the exporter to obtain
relief from paying taxes and duties on imported inputs used in the manufacture
of products exported outside the CACM area. The drawback scheme provides a
mechanism for obtaining a refund of taxes paid, while under the guarantee
bond scheme the exporter does not pay the taxes on imported inputs but deposits
securities with the government for the amount of such taxes until the finished
products are exported.
1.31      All CACM countries have established export promotion agencies, but
only Costa Rica offers tax credit certificates to exporters equivalent to
10-15% of the FOB value of the exports. The Honduran Government is presently
attempting to establish a more systematic approach to export promotion; it is
studying a draft law which would create the Centro Nacional de Promocion de
Exportaciones (CENAPEX) as the government agency responsible for export pro-
motion, particularly of non-traditional exports. CENAPEX would, among other
things, be responsible for (i) reviewing the need for and proposing new export
incentives; (ii) establishing qualitative and quantitative export targets;
(iii) proposing mechanisms for export financing; (iv) creating a system of
commercial attaches stationed in foreign countries; (v) promoting export
projects; and (vi) carrying out studies of international markets.
Industrial Development Strategy and Outlook
1.32      The National Planning Council (CONSUPLANE), in consultation with
the Ministry of Economy and the Industrial Research Department of the Central
Bank, has recently prepared an Economic Development Plan for 1979-83. This
plan, which aims at maintaining a fairly high rate of economic expansion
coupled with an improved balance of payments performance and a better distri-
bution of economic benefits among the poorer sections of the population,
envisages continuing heavy public investment in infrastructure and in the
social sectors while giving more emphasis to rapid-yielding investment proj-
ects in the productive sectors. Industry has been assigned a leading role
in achieving rapid growth of value added, exports and employment.
1.33      The primary targets established in the 1979-83 Economic Development
Plan for industry are: (i) achievement of an average real growth in indus-
trial value added of 9% p.a. whereby industry would increase its contribution
to GDP from 17% in 1977 to 19% in 1983; (ii) manufactured exports growing
by 15% p.a. in current US dollars with the proportion of domestic value
added in exports progressively increasing; and (iii) more rapid development
of labor-intensive small- and medium-sized enterprises. To achieve these
targets the plan envisages: (i) a more selective import-substitution strategy
focusing on efficient industries in the intermediate goods and metal working
fields; (ii) increased promotion of exports outside the CACM; (iii) promotion
of industries in which Honduras has a comparative advantage, in particular
those which use raw materials from forestry and agriculture; and (iv) provid-
ing increased credit and technical assistance to small- and medium-sized in-
dustry (SMI). The latter two objectives would receive special emphasis under
the proposed loan.



- 12 -
1.34      Responsibility for the development of the forestry sector lies
with COHDEFOR, which, in addition to protecting national forest lands from
uncontrolled exploitation and restoring national forest resources, will
also plan, stimulate and finance the growth of an efficient primary and
secondary wood products industry, and help improve the living standards
of the impoverished rural population, about one-third of which lives
on the fringe of the forest lands. To accomplish this mandate COHDEFOR was
given broad authority to manage the use of both public and private forest
lands, to control timber sales and exports, and to engage in the financing
of forest industry (para. 2.07). In support of the plan, CONADI is
providing promotional, financial and managerial assistance to important
projects with high domestic value added or involving industrialization
of local resources, including projects in food processing, textiles and
apparel, wood and paper products, and metal working and mineral products.
1.35      Given the disappointing results of past SMI lending through the
Banco Nacional de Fomento--BANAFOM (para. 2.03), and in recognition of the
importance of stimulating small- and medium-size industries' growth, the govern-
ment has upgraded its Centro de Desarrollo Industrial (CDI), which has been
providing technical assistance largely to artisans, in order to enable CDI to
provide such services to small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMIs) in the
future. A law to promote the development of small-scale and artisan industry
was enacted in 1978, which has clarified the definition of the sector, extended
to small enterprises the benefits of the industrial incentive legislation, and
confirmed the government's intention to provide financial and technical assis-
tance to the sector.
1.36      The Honduran industrial development targets, while ambitious,
appear achievable. The strong performance of the economy and of the indus-
trial sector in the past two years augur well for the future and have helped
create a positive climate for investment. The project pipelines of COHDEFOR,
CONADI and the commercial banks are already extensive and continue to grow.
The more outward-looking philosophy developing within the CACM is also an
encouraging sign. The proposed project is designed to help in the achievement
of these industrial growth targets by assisting Honduras to strengthen its
institutional capability to prepare, select and finance efficient industrial
investment projects with particular emphasis on meeting the term financing
needs and technical assistance requirements of SMI and of priority projects
in the wood industry.
II. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A. The Banking System
2.01      The banking system in Honduras is comprised of the central bank
(Banco Central de Honduras--BCH), 13 commercial banks, 3 development banks
(CONADI, BANAFOM, and Banco Municipal Autonomo--BMA), and 6 specialized credit



- 13 -
institutions (mostly mortgage banks). Of these entities, all except BANAFOM,
BMA and the specialized credit institutions are involved at present in channel-
ling funds to industry.
2.02      BCH was established in 1950 as the government's central bank and
fiscal agent, with responsibility for formulating and implementing monetary
policy and for supervising the banking system. The BCH is generally regarded
both within and outside Honduras as a professional, well-managed and adequately
staffed organization. In recent years BCH has taken an active role in economic
development, policy formulation, planning and financing. 1/ It is operating a
guarantee fund for small-scale industrial lending and an export fund for finan-
cing non-traditional exports and has assumed responsibility for administering
IDA's First (Cr. 179-HO) and Second (Cr. 434-HO) Livestock and Agricultural
Credit (Cr. 628-HO) Projects. Under the proposed project, BCH would expand
its developmental role in the industrial sector (paras. 3.03-3.05).
2.03      BANAFOM, with assets of L 326 million as of December 31, 1977,
is the largest bank in Honduras and until recently it was virtually the
country's only source of industrial term credit to SMI. Founded in 1950
mainly as an agricultural bank, it became involved in industrial financing
and in operating agricultural marketing and storage facilities as part of
its agricultural price stabilization activity. By 1975 BANAFOM had acquired
an industrial portfolio of L 12.6 million (out of a total portfolio of
about L 131.9 million), mostly of medium- and small-size loans, of which about
one-third were in arrears. Most of the small loans had been guaranteed by
BCH's small industry guarantee fund (of which BANAFOM had received guarantees
amounting to L 18 million or 89% of total guarantees granted). The rather
small size of such loans, as well as the poor repayment record of loans
guaranteed by the fund (42% of outstanding loans were in default) and the
relatively high costs of administration associated with small loans, dis-
couraged other banks from utilizing the fund. In early 1977 the BCH, on
behalf of the government and along with BANAFOM's new management, undertook
a review of the range of BANAFOM's activities and capabilities as a result
of which it was decided that BANAFUM should focus its resources on its
expanded agricultural development responsibilities and phase out of other
activity. Thus, BNF's industrial lending activities ceased in July 1977 and
a phase-out was begun of all agricultural marketing and storage functions.
2.04      Commercial banks.  The 13 commercial banks (3 of which are foreign
owned) form the core of Honduras' financial system. As of December 31, 1977,
they held almost three-quarters of the financial system's assets (excluding
the BCH) of L 1.5 billion and accounted for 80% (L 204 million) of total new
industrial credits. In the past three years industrial credits, on average,
accounted for 22% of the commercial banking system's outstanding total loan
1/   Along with the Ministers of Finance, Economy, and Natural Resources
and Agriculture, the President of the Central Bank serves on the
National Economic Council, which formulates economic policy,
establishes programs and promulgates decrees affecting economic and
social development.

portfolio. Commercial banks are engaged mainly in short-term lending
activities. In 1976-77 loans for less than one year accounted for 72%
of resources loaned while longer term loans with maturities of three years
and over accounted for only 8.7% of the total (Table 2.1). A major cause
for emphasis upon short-term lending has been the structure of interest
rates which, especially since late 1977, made it unattractive for commercial
banks to seek long-term domestic funds (para. 2.10).

2.05      Several large banks, of which the largest and most important are
the Banco de Atlantida (ATLANTIDA) and Banco Capitalizadora Hondurena
(BANCAHSA), have traditionally dominated commercial banking activity. How-
ever, in recent years, reflecting BCH's efforts to increase competition in
commercial banking, important changes have occurred which helped restructure
the banking system by giving it a broader base, an enlarged clientele, and an
improved geographic spread. As a result, the number of commercial banks has
increased by 40% (three specialized credit institutions became commercial
banks in 1971 and 1976, and a new commercial bank was established in 1974),
the system is channeling an ever-increasing amount of resources into produc-
tive sectors (agriculture and industry), and the smaller banks have grown at
a faster rate than the larger ones. These changes within the banking system,
even in a short period, are quite significant. Thus, between 1975-77, while
ATLANTIDA's industrial lending overall had increased substantially, its share
of the market declined from 28.6% to 24.9% of total industrial lending. Two
other large banks, BANCAHSA and Banco Financiera Hondurena, also experienced
a share of market decline (from 19.6% to 15.9%) during the same period, as did
the three banks with foreign ownership, whose industrial lending share fell



- 15 -
from 17.2% to 12.0%. 1/ Seven smaller banks are rapidly growing in importance
and have increased their share of new industrial lending from 13.5% in 1975
to 20.5% in 1977 (Annex 5, Table 1). With high competitive pressure and rela-
tively low lending limits, 2/ the commercial banks have actively sought lend-
ing opportunities to SMI. As a result, about one-third of the industrial
firms receiving loans during July 1976-July 1977 had total assets below
L 100,000, and one-third of the funds went for industrial loans of under
L 100,000 (Annex 5, Tables 2, 3).
2.06      CONADI.  In 1974 the government took a significant step forward in
providing long-term resources for industrial investment through the creation
of CONADI to fill a gap in industrial equity and term financing, promote and
help develop a capital market, and expand public and mixed Honduran ownership
of larger scale enterprises. To accomplish these objectives, CONADI was given
a corporate charter with authority to engage in: (i) buying, negotiating and
investing in stock and acting as a broker on account of others or on its own
account; (ii) establishing investment funds for Honduran securities; (iii) pro-
moting or participating in industrial underwritings; (iv) endorsing or guaran-
teeing credits granted to industrial corporations; and (v) granting long- and
short-term credits for fixed and working capital financing. In order to
ensure that CONADI's operations are directed toward larger scale projects with
substantial economic impact, CONADI's investments and credits in any enterprise
must be for projects with a total cost in excess of US$375,000 equivalent.
CONADI's portfolio of L 99 million as at December 31, 1977 included both loans
of L 71 million and equity investments of L 28 million. The loan portfolio
was made up of L 42 million, in long-term mortgage loans for tourism projects,
and L 28 million in loans to industrial enterprises. CONADI's guarantee oper-
ations have grown even more rapidly than its direct lending and amounted
to L 82 million at year-end 1977.
2.07      COHJDEFOR.  The forestry sector is also receiving significant finan-
cial assistance from the banking system (L 12.9 million in new loans in 1977).
Although it is not part of the banking system, an increasing share of finan-
cing to the sector is being provided by CORDEFOR, which has been authorized
to finance forest operations, primary and finished wood products industries
and to provide working capital and medium-term credits to sawmills, resination
plants, and importers and exporters of wood products. Its loans to the sector
1/   The importance of the larger banks, particularly of two of the three
foreign owned banks, is underestimated since they also provide a sub-
stantial amount of guarantees for dollar financing of industrial clients
by foreign banks.
2/   Commercial banks are not permitted to have loans outstanding to a single
enterprise greater than 20% of their equity. Thus the maximum size loan
for the smaller 50% of the commercial banks is a relatively low US$500,000-
US$750,000 equivalent.



- 16 -
as of December 31, 1977, totalled L 22.8 million. COHDEFOR is presently
lending mainly to finance inventories, other short-term needs, and exports.
However, since 1975 it has expanded its financing activities to include term
lending to finance fixed assets as well as equity participation in a variety
of industrial ventures. Under the proposed loan it would substantially
increase these activities (para. 3.28).
2.08      The Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) is
another institution which, although not part of the Honduran banking system,
has been active in financing Honduran industry. CABEI was founded in 1961
as the bank for economic integration of the Central American region, with
headquarters in Tegucigalpa. Since its inception, it has made 67 loans
totaling L 61.9 million to the manufacturing sector in Honduras, for projects
with a total cost of L 166.6 million. Its most recent projects in Honduras
have been relatively large in size (e.g., a L 6.8 million loan through CONADI
to refinance and capitalize a food processing company) and closely linked to
CACM export trade objectives.
B. Monetary Policy
2.09      Objectives.  Monetary policy in Honduras has traditionally focused
on three principal objectives: (i) maintaining the stability of the lempira
within a system of free-currency convertibility, (ii) seeking to achieve equi-
librium in the balance of payments, and (iii) keeping the domestic inflation
rate at about the same level as the USA, Honduras' principal trading partner.
These objectives have been achieved in part by modifying legal reserve
requirements on deposits, regulating the percentage of commercial bank lending
for a particular purpose, limiting discount and rediscount facilities mainly
to agricultural crop and export financing, and levying surcharges on imports
of non-essential items. Interest rate adjustments have played only a small
role in monetary policies. Partly as a result of these government policies,
the historical rate of inflation in Honduras, as measured by the consumer
price index, has been low compared to many other Latin American countries,
and the US dollar-lempira exchange rate has remained at 2:1 for the past two
decades. Inflation averaged 2.7% a year between 1966-73 and accelerated to
13% in 1974 before declining to 8% in 1975 and 5% in 1976. Inflation rose
somewhat in 1977 to 8.6%, and the inflation rate is expected to remain at that
level for the next three years.
2.10      Interest rates and reserve requirements.  In the past decade interest
rates have been modified infrequently. The maximum interest rates on produc-
tive loans, 1/ which were constant between 1967 and 1971, were raised substan-
tially from 8% to 11% in two adjustments (in 1972 and 1974) and have remained
1/   Loans to expand or improve output of agriculture and industry, which must
constitute not less than 70% of commercial banks' lending, while lending
for commerce and trade or consumption may not be more than 30%.



- 17 -
at that level. Interest rates on loans for consumption or commerce, on the
other hand, have been increasingly restricted since 1967 as the free market
rate was replaced by the current 13% maximum interest rate (Table 2.2). In
the face of a 66% increase in banking liquidity between 1975 and mid-1977,
the BCH raised legal reserve requirements on all bank deposits, from 25% to
30%, thereby increasing the cost of resource mobilization by the banking
system but also reducing incentives to raise longer term funds. 1/
2.11      So as not to further restrict term lending, in early 1978 the monetary
authorities implemented an experimental program under which interest rates for
productive long-term loans (three years and over) would not be subject to
restrictions except that the interest rates charged on such loans should bear
a reasonable relationship to the cost of resource mobilization. This cost
would likely be about 10.4% to 11.3% under the existing reserve requirements,
and 9.8% to 10.8% should the BCH decide to return to the historic 25% reserve
level. Given the uncertainty involved in predicting costs of resource
mobilization and reserve requirements over the implementation period of the
project, the range of interest rates for the minimum (10%) portion of the
project to be financed by the financial intermediaries (para. 3.16) could
vary from 12.5% to 14.5%. Under the most likely combination of interest
charges (i.e., 12% for the Bank's portion and 14.5% for the intermediary's
10% portion) the interest cost to the final borrower would average 12.25%
and would be significantly positive in real terms (para. 2.09).
1/   Thus, an 8% 12-month certificate of deposit now costs the banking system
10.2%, yielding a highly inadequate 0.8% spread given the maximum
11% interest rate on medium-term productive loans.

C. Mobilization of Resources
2.12      Deposits.  The government's policy of setting interest rates for
time and savings deposits to yield savers positive returns on average, toge-
ther with an effective resource mobilization effort by the commercial and
housing banks, has succeeded in mobilizing subtantial, mainly short-term
resources. Total deposits in the banking system increased from L 309 million
to L 712 million in 1972-77 (almost a 20% nominal annual rate of growth). A
substantial part of this high growth was due to the increased time deposits
(mainly three months to one year) captured by the commercial banking system,
which rose from L 183 million to L 404 million in 1972-77.
2.13      The rate of mobilization of medium- and long-term foreign resources
by the banking system also increased, from L 49 million to L 189 million in



- 19 -
1972-77--an annual growth rate of 30%. About 40% of this amount represents
obligations of the commercial banks, 10% CONADI and the balance (50%) BANAFOM
debt. Short-term foreign borrowing is strictly limited to the short-term
financing of exports of coffee, cotton, tobacco and other major agricultural
or seafood products. With previous authorization of the BCH, banks may obtain
long-term resources abroad, charging interest rates of at least 2% above the
cost to the bank. The possibility of direct medium- and long-term foreign
resource mobilization by industrialists also exists. However, this has been
limited in practice because it has been difficult to contract loans of over
3 years for any but the largest Honduran industries.
2.14      Internally generated resources of the banking system have been
declining in importance as a source of funds as deposits have expanded.
Capital and reserves of the banking system amounted to L 141.8 million (32.8%
of total resources) in 1972 and L 227.6 milion (15.1%) in 1976. However,
commercial banks and other financial institutions are providing an important
part of CONADI's capital, since, in addition to the government's capital con-
tribution of L 10.2 million, CONADI receives contributions from each bank and
insurance company in an amount equal to 10% of their capital and reserves,
adjusted annually for changes in their capital position. These contributors
receive preferred 6% shares in CONADI, amounting to L 8.6 million as of
December 31, 1977. As quasi-equity, CONADI also has received L 9.2 million
from industrial enterprises, which, under the industrial incentive programs,
give an annual amount equal to 10% of total import duties or income taxes
exempted by the government. Contributing industries receive non-negotiable
6% interest-bearing certificates repayable by CONADI in 20 years with 3 years
of grace.
2.15      Rediscounts.  The BCH's several rediscounting facilities are playing
increasingly important roles in providing the seasonal liquidity needed to
finance inventories of export commodities such as sugar, coffee and tobacco
crops and seafood products as well as to meet some of the more urgent short-
term needs for productive financing of agriculture and, to a lesser degree,
industry. The BCH's general rediscount facility was established by law to
rediscount short-term commercial bank loans for productive purposes and to
meet short-term liquidity requirements, while the special rediscount facilities
are linked to short-term financing of basic commodities. Rediscounts outstand-
ing to the banking system rose from L 35.8 million in 1972 to L 117.2 million
in 1976. BCH's rediscount rates range from 5-6% for short-term loans for
productive purposes to 7-8% for short-term loans to commerce, 8-9% for longer
term loans for housing, and 10% for liquidity purposes (i.e., to enable banks
to meet current commitments). Rediscount rates have largely been stable, and
few rediscounts have been granted in the past two years for other than agri-
culture and export financing. In the past BCH has relied on the ad hoc estab-
lishment of special rediscount facilities and on quantitative restrictions on
these or on the general rediscount facility to channel credit in accordance
with the overall objectives of development and monetary policy. A major objec-
tive of the proposed industrial credit project is to create a facility within
BCH that would provide long-term resources to finance economically sound
industrial projects (para. 3.08).



- 20 -
D. The Financing of Industry
2.16      About one-fifth of total credit from the banking system to the
private sector is being channeled to manufacturing, whose share rose from
L 82.7 million (18.4% of the total) to L 202.6 million (20.6% of total) during
1972-77. This was in line with the overall trend in which limited changes in
the sectoral distribution favored industry while the volume of credit was
undergoing a sizable expansion (26% per annum). Loans to agriculture and
livestock, rising from L 107 million to L 251 million, remained at about 25%
of the total during 1972-77. Lending for construction and real estate rose
from L 87.2 million to L 170.5 million but decreased in relative importance
from 19.4% to 17.3%, and lending for commerce and consumption rose from L 96.8
million to L 212.1 million and remained constant at 21.5%.
2.17      Internally generated resources have traditionally been the major
source of funds for the financing of industry. Until 1971, equity, undis-
tributed profits, and depreciation reserves provided over two-thirds of
industrial resources while loans and credits accounted for less than one-third
of financing requirements. This is reflected in the average total debt 1/ to
equity (D/E) ratio for industry, which was a very low 0.48:1 in 1971 (Table
2.3). In recent years, however, principally because of the high 26% annual
average growth in lending to the industrial sector through the banking system,
the D/E ratio of industrial firms began to rise sharply and in 1975 the
overall D/E ratio for industry was 0.75:1.

liabilities for mortgages, etc.

were for medium- and long-term obligations. There is also clear evidence
(Table 2.4) that the larger Honduran industrial firms (assets over L 750,000)
have had greater access to long-term credit than smaller firms, whose ratios
of long-term to total obligations averaged only about 14%.

SOURCE: Central Bank of Honduras
2.19      With about 50% of the industrial borrowers from commercial banks in
1977 having total assets of less than L 500,000 (Annex 5, Table 2), the banking
system appears to have been seeking SMI clients. This is not surprising given
the overall small size of industrial enterprise and the competitive nature of
commercial banking in Honduras. As indicated above, however, SMI is getting
a smaller proportion of the highly rationed longer term resources, mainly
because lending to small-scale enterprises is costly, since the loan amount
is usually small and the cost of appraisal and supervision relatively high.
Consequently, commercial banks have tended to consider the current spread
on term loans to be insufficient for lending to small enterprises as increased
costs are involved. The proposed project would involve an upward revision of
interest rates and an increased spread, which would not only help mobilize
private savings from the banking system, but encourage financial inter-
mediaries to develop the capability to appraise and supervise projects and to
lend to small enterprises.
E. The Demand for Industrial Investment
2.20      Substantial indications exist that the demand for industrial invest-
ment should grow at a high rate and that, providing the required financing is
forthcoming, the 9% annual growth rate targeted in the 1979-83 Industrial
Development Plan can be achieved. Banks are finding it increasingly difficult
to meet even the demand for short- and medium-term financing. Also, in the



- 23 -
absence of long-term resources, industrialists have been compelled to seek
direct foreign loans to obtain longer terms, which, however, is only feasible
for the largest firms. The existing project pipelines of major development
institutions are an additional indication of demand. At present CONADI has a
pipeline of 11 projects, and COHDEFOR of 17 projects, whose total investment
requirements over the next three years are about US$80 million equivalent.
Also, major commercial banks estimate that a number of important projects,
which have been deferred because of the lack of long-term financing, would be
put forward again once long-term funding becomes available.
2.21      To achieve the projected 9% annual growth rate over the 1979-83
period would require an estimated average industrial investment of about
US$65 million per year, 1/ of which 70% would be allocated for fixed assets
purchasing and 30% for working capital financing. Based upon recent trends
in industrial financing (para. 2.17), on average about 50% of incremental
industrial investment will be financed by lenders; thus, about US$33 million
would be required each year. The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million would,
over the 1979-83 disbursement period of the loan, finance about 8% of the
funds required, i.e. most of the growth of investment during that period. The
remainder of the investment requirements would be met largely as they have been
in the past: through medium- and long-term direct foreign loans; by medium-
and long-term loans from CONADI and COHDEFOR; and by renewal of short- and
medium-term loans made by commercial banks.
2.22      Major constraints to achieving a high and sustained level of indus-
trial investment are likely to be the lack of long-term funds, the need to
replace BANAFOM as a source of financing to small-scale enterprises, and the
lack of a capability among financial intermediaries to identify, prepare, and
appraise industrial projects. The proposed project would place major emphasis
on reducing all of these constraints.
III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Institutional Structure
Background
3.01      The proposed project would represent the Bank's first direct support
for the development of the industrial sector in Honduras. For a number of
years the Bank carried out preparatory work with a view to channeling resources
for industrial financing in the Central American countries through CABEI; how-
ever, mainly because of legal problems in connection with the provision of
guarantees, the Bank has not been able to finalize a regional industrial lending
1/   Estimated by applying a 2.5 ICOR to the projected 9% incremental growth
of the manufacturing sector.



- 24 -
project involving CABEI. Moreover, during the 1970s Honduras and the other
CACM countries became increasingly concerned with providing financial support
to SMI, while CABEI concentrated primarily on large, regional projects, and
most countries either established new or strengthened existing national insti-
tutions capable of providing industrial finance. Accordingly, the Bank began
working with the individual CACM countries to prepare projects designed to
strengthen their developing national institutions and tackle the specific
industrial sector problems and needs in each country. The proposed project
was prepared by the BCH with the assistance of Bank preparation missions in
October 1977 and February 1978. It was appraised in May 1978.
Project Objectives
3.02      The project is designed to support the government industrial strategy
outlined in paras. 1.32-1.33 and to assist the government in meeting its prin-
cipal objectives for developing the industrial sector, which include promoting
and helping to sustain rapid and efficient growth of industrial output, exports
and employment. The project would assist the government to achieve these
objectives by:
-(i) establishing an effective system to provide term financing for
financially sound and economically efficient investment projects
of mainly small and medium-sized industrial firms;
(ii) helping COHDEFOR to finance priority investments designed to
upgrade efficiency and increase output in the primary and
secondary wood industry sectors;
(iii) assisting industrialists to improve the quality and thorough-
ness of their investment planning;
(iv) encouraging commercial banks to increase term lending to SMI,
based on sound project appraisal techniques; and
(v) building an effective service of technical assistance to the
smaller industrial enterprises through CTI.
Institutional Structure
3.03      A new government fund, the National Industrial Development Fund
(FONDEI), has been established by BCH to carry out the project.  A Comite
Ejecutivo (Executive Committee) would be responsible for the fund's administra-
tion and operation. FONDEI will operate as a second-tier financial institu-
tion, providing part of the financing for term loans made by financial inter-
mediaries to help finance investment projects of industrial firms. Although
all commercial banks, together with CONADI and COHDEFOR, will be eligible to
participate as FONDEI's financial intermediaries, no more than about two-thirds
of the 13 potentially eligible commercial banks are expected to participate in
the project. COHDEFOR will establish a separately staffed unit for long-term
lending, and adopt lending and investment policies satisfactory to the Bank.
All other intermediaries would be required to enter into less stringent



- 25 -
participation agreements with FONDEI (para. 3.25). All intermediaries would
assume the full credit risk on subloans and would service their debt to FONDEI
in accordance with fixed amortization schedules. Technical assistance would
be provided by CDI or by consultants, which would help small- and medium-sized
enterprises with project preparation and technical assistance (para. 3.34).
B. The National Industrial Development Fund (FONDEI)
Establishment, Management and Staffing
3.04      FONDEI has been established by BCH resolution as a permanent insti-
tution, with its own staffing, financial resources and separate accounting.
FONDEI will be headed by a director responsible for managing its day-to-day
operations who will report to a three-member Executive Committee established
by BCH and which has overall responsibility for establishing FONDEI's operating
policies, presenting budgets to BCH's Board, preparing staffing plans, approv-
ing FONDEI loans and overseeing its activities. The resolution creating
FONDEI spells out the broad objectives and scope of FONDEI's activities,
specifies its initial resources and the sources from which it is authorized
to secure additional resources in the future, and defines the composition
of the Executive Committee.
3.05      BCH has prepared an organization chart and staffing plan for FONDEI
(Annex 1). FONDEI will be headed by a director responsible for managing the
operations of the fund. The BCH is responsible for appointing the director
and providing FONDEI with supporting technical staff and logistics facilities
adequate for carrying out the project, and expects to transfer most of the neces-
sary professional staff from its Industrial Studies Department. FONDEI's
director will be supported by three sections for: Analysis, comprising
4 economists/financial analysts; Engineering, comprising 3 experienced indus-
trial engineers; and Administration, initially having one professional staff
member. BCH has already selected a qualified director for FONDEI. Prior to
effectiveness, BCH would appoint the full-time professional staff necessary to
commence the project (including at least one industrial engineer).
3.06      Subloan administration, disbursement and repayment, record keeping
and financial accounting would be handled for FONDEI by the BCH's Credit and
Securities Department, which handles such work for other BCH funds (including
IDA's agricultural and livestock development credits). The organization and
staffing arrangements as presently proposed appear adequate to enable FONDEI
to successfully carry out the project during the first two to three years.
As the volume of operations grows, BCH would augment FONDEI's staff as required
to implement the project.
Operating Policies and Procedures
3.07      Operating reRulations and nature of projects financed.  The policies
and regulations that will govern FONDEI's financing operations are set forth
in a statement of operating policies prepared by BCH (Annex 2). It specifies,



- 26 -
among other things, (i) FONDEI's objectives in financing industrial investment
projects; (ii) the types of projects that FONDEI would finance; (iii) the
terms and limits of financing; (iv) criteria for project approval; and (v) the
responsibilities of intermediaries receiving financing from FONDEI. The
policy statement forms a satisfactory basis for FONDEI's channeling of Bank
funds for productive sector lending 1/ under the proposed project. FONDEI's
Executive Committee has adopted a policy statement satisfactory to the Bank.
Any subsequent modification of the policy statement would require Bank approval.
3.08      FONDEI would finance the purchase of fixed assets and the corre-
sponding permanent working capital, the installation of industrial equipment
and services, the construction of industrial buildings, and the preparation
of preinvestment studies and technical assistance services associated with
such investment. Projects eligible for financing would have to entail the
creation, expansion or modernization of the productive capacity of enterprises
involved in manufacturing, agro-industry, forestry and wood processing, tourism,
fishing and fish product industries, or in providing mechanical or specialized
transport services closely related to industry. In its allocation of scarce
resources, FONDEI would primarily finance projects which increase the utiliza-
tion of local natural resources, generate export revenues or efficiently sub-
stitute imports.
3.09      Terms and limits of financing.  FONDEI's primary focus would be on
financing investment projects of small- and medium-sized industrial firms and
priority projects in the primary and secondary wood industry. Small indus-
trial enterprises would be defined as existing firms having total assets,
excluding land and buildings, of less than US$100,000 equivalent as of
December 31, 1977, or new firms that will be established with total assets not
exceeding that amount. This definition corresponds approximately to firms with
up to 25 employees, and includes most firms which have had limited or no
access to credit from the banking system. Although no upper size limit is
proposed for total assets of eligible firms, FONDEI's maximum financing for
any one investment subproject and enterprise would be limited to US$750,000
for general industry and US$1.5 million for wood industry subprojects financed
by COHDEFOR, to avoid excessive concentration of FONDEI financing in a few firms.
For the same reason, FONDEI would not approve financing for companies which it
judges to have reasonable access to alternative local or foreign sources of
financing on adequate terms.
1/   The Bank recently appraised a possible US$20 million tourism development
loan to the Government of Honduras, of which US$16 million would be for
a tourism credit program to help finance hotels and related tourism
facilities. These tourism credits would be channeled through a separate
FONDEI account to be used by participating commercial banks and CONADI.
Appropriate additions for tourism lending will be incorporated into
FONDEI's policy statement, once agreement is reached between the government
and the Bank regarding the tourism project.



- 27 -
3.10      To ensure that a significant part of project resources benefit
small industrial enterprises, FONDEI would: (i) allocate at least US$2.5
million of the proposed loan for small-scale enterprise lending; (ii) provide
a differentiated spread to cover the higher costs of small-scale lending
(para. 3.14); and (iii) coordinate with CDI, the government technical assis-
tance agency, to ensure that small-scale projects are well prepared for
submission to the participating financial intermediaries (para. 3.34); and
BCH would make available for small-scale industry (SSI) financing a significant
portion of its US$5 million contribution to FONDEI (para. 3.21).
3.11      FONDEI would establish appropriate maturities for each subloan on
the basis of cash flow projections for subprojects. In the case of forestry
subprojects, which may involve reforestation components, FONDEI's maximum
subloan term would be 17 years, but for general industrial loans the limit
would be 15 years. For all types of subloans the maximum grace period would
be 3 years. Normally FONDEI would not approve subloans to firms able to repay
their debt in less than 3 years, since banks would be expected to finance such
subloans from their ordinary resources.
3.12      Within the above terms and limits of financing, FONDEI would parti-
cipate jointly with the financial intermediary and the final borrower in
financing a specific subproject. FONDEI would finance up to 65% of the cost
of fixed assets and associated permanent working capital of new industrial
subprojects, up to 75% for forestry subprojects, and up to 80% in the case of
subprojects involving the expansion and modernization of industrial enterprises,
provided that the financial position and prospects of the recipient company
would permit a higher proportion of debt financing. Since the majority of SMI
subprojects are likely to be expansions, and most small- and medium-sized firms
have rather low D/E ratios because of their limited access to term credit in
the past, FONDEI is likely to be asked to finance on average about 70% of
total subproject costs. The financial intermediary would finance at least 10%
of subproject costs and each subborrower the balance.
3.13      Interest rates.  Subloans financed by FONDEI would be denominated
in lempiras. Interest rates charged by commercial banks and other financial
intermediaries on industrial loans made out of their own resources are subject
to maximum limits established from time to time by the BCH. For subloans
financed with FONDEI resources, the BCH is proposing to establish an interest
rate of 12%, which is about in line with existing lending rates for medium-
and long-term loans (although lending rates for over 3 years are freely nego-
tiable, in practice medium- and long-term loans to industry are made at
12-13%). Since the average inflation rate was about 8% in 1977 and is not
expected to exceed anticipated international levels of 7-8% in the next
3-4 years, the proposed interest rate is expected to be significantly positive
in real terms, at least during the disbursement period of the project
(para. 2.11).
3.14      The cost of FONDEI financing to the financial intermediary would
vary depending on the asset size of the borrowing enterprise. For COEDEFOR
projects and general industrial lending intermediaries would pay 9% for
FONDEI resources, allowing a spread of 3 percentage points to the intermediary.



- 28 -
However, on loans to small enterprises with fixed assets excluding land and
buildings of less than US$40,000 equivalent or of between US$40,000 and
US$100,000 equivalent, intermediaries would pay only 7% and 8%, respectively,
allowing higher margins of 5 percentage points and 4 percentage points to the
intermediaries. These higher margins are intended to encourage participating
banks to assume the relatively higher costs and risks associated with lending
to small industry (para. 4.02).
3.15      FONDEI expects to charge an average interest rate of about 8.75% on
its resources, allowing an adequate margin over its borrowing to cover adminis-
trative and other costs. The above interest rates and spreads would be
reviewed not later than April 1, 1980 and from time to time thereafter, and
could be modified, by agreement between the Bank and BCH, as necessary to
reflect changing market conditions and inflationary trends.
3.16      While financial intermediaries would be required to lend their
minimum 10% contribution for the same terms and with the same grace period
as the financing extended by FONDEI, they would not be bound by the interest
rate specified for FONDEI subloans. However, they would be subject to the
regulations issued by the BCH governing interest rates on long-term industrial
loans.
Subproject Appraisal and Supervision
3.17      Financial intermediaries, in cooperation with subborrowers, would be
responsible for preparing subproject appraisals. FONDEI would review these
appraisals and approve financing for those subprojects it judges to be tech-
nically sound, financially viable and economically efficient. To ensure
uniform quality and content in subproject appraisals FONDEI plans to issue
general appraisal guidelines specifying the key items to be covered in
appraisals and offering standard definitions and methodologies for financial
calculations. While more standardized appraisal reports would tend to evolve
in the long term, initially each intermediary, working within the general
guidelines, could develop an appropriate system taking into consideration its
internal operational requirements and loan analysis procedures. The financial
intermediaries participating in the IDA-financed agricultural credit programs
(para. 2.02) have been successful in adopting their operations to the Bank's
project appraisal and supervision requirements, and it 4S reasonable to anti-
cipate that, given appropriate guidelines, they would also perform well under
the proposed loan.
3.18      Subproject financing.  Subprojects financed by FONDEI would vary
considerably in complexity and size, ranging from wood industry subprojects
requiring total investments of several million dollars, through medium-size
industrial subprojects typically involving investments of several hundred
thousand dollars to small industry subprojects in the up to US$50,000 equiv-
alent range. Thus, in line with the general appraisal guidelines, the depth
and sophistication of subproject appraisal and review would be varied to fit
the size and nature of subprojects. For instance, intermediaries would only
be required to submit simpler and less detailed appraisals of small industry
subprojects focusing on the viability of the enterprise and its investment



- 29 -
plan which CDI (para 3.35) or a consultant could help the small enterprise to
prepare. For the same reason, FONDEI would use a rapid review procedure for
small industry subprojects which would focus on checking that all necessary
information for justifying the project has been provided, that the subproject
is eligible for financing and that the proposed subloan terms are appropriate.
All larger subprojects would be subject to a more detailed review of their
technical, financial, marketing and economic aspects. Intermediaries would be
expected to include in all appraisals calculations of certain key economic
indicators (e.g., employment, domestic value added, net foreign exchange
earnings and savings impacts). In the case of subloans above FONDEI's
US$250,000 "free limit" (para. 4.03), the internal economic rate of return
(ERR) would be calculated.
3.19      To prepare the technical staffs of FONDEI, COHDEFOR, the commercial
banks and CDI for their future project preparation and/or appraisal respon-
sibilities, a brief and well focused training in industrial project planning
and evaluation and in economic analysis would be desirable. BCH is in the
process of arranging a 2-3 week project evaluation course in Honduras in early
1979. Initiation of the program would be a condition for effectiveness of the
proposed loan.
3.20      Financial intermediaries would be responsible for making periodic
supervision vists to firms receiving FONDEI subloans and for maintaining
records adequate to indicate the progress of subproject implementation and
to compare operating results with appraisal forecasts. The intermediaries'
supervision and reporting responsibilities would be clearly specified in the
participation agreements which intermediaries would sign with FONDEI. The
performance of intermediaries in subproject supervision would be monitored
by FONDEI staff on the basis of periodic reports which the intermediaries
would be required to submit and through spot visits to industrial beneficiaries.
COHDEFOR and CONADI both have the capability to supervise the comparatively
large subprojects they are likely to submit to FONDEI for financing. Commer-
cial banks, however, which have done little long-term lending in the past,
are less experienced in formal subproject supervision and will need assistance
from FONDEI initially in organizing these activities. Draft appraisal guide-
lines and supervision procedures for FONDEI and the participating financial
intermediaries are satisfactory. Final approval of these guidelines by
FONDEI's Executive Committee would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.21      FONDEI's resources would comprise the proposed loan of US$15 million,
together with a contribution of US$5 million equivalent to FONDEI's capital to
be made available by BCH. Approximately US$700,000 of this contribution would
be used to cover initial financial and operating costs. The balance would be
available for a revolving fund type arrangement to advance disbursements
against Bank-approved subprojects while waiting to receive disbursements from
the Bank and to finance part of the local currency component of approved
subprojects. BCH has agreed that out of the US$5 million equivalent government
contribution, sufficient funds would be made available for complementary
financing of the small-scale industry subloans.



- 30 -
3.22      Based on analyses of the investment requirements of recently financed
SMI projects in Honduras, the average foreign exchange content of the mix of
subprojects that FONDEI would finance has been estimated at 53%, which would
be financed entirely by the proposed loan. Overall, FONDEI expects to finance
an average of about 70% of total investment cost. Since the financial inter-
mediaries would have to finance at least 10% of investment costs, project
sponsors would have to finance on average about 20% (at least 10% in the case
of expansion or modernization of existing projects and at least 25% in the
case of new projects). On this basis Table 3.1 shows the projected financing
plan for the project.

costs.
3.23      FONDEI is expected to commit its total resources in about three
years, i.e. an average of US$6.4 million equivalent per year (Annex 5,
Table 5). A best estimate of the types of subprojects that FONDEI would be
likely to finance has been prepared based on the present project pipelines
of the financial intermediaries and on the expected specific orientation of
FONDEI's operations. About 40% each of FONDEI's financing is expected to
support primary and secondary wood industry projects promoted by COHDEFOR and
medium-sized industry subprojects. The remainder is expected to go to small
industry subprojects. At the subsectoral level, the mix might be roughly as
shown in Annex 5, Table 11.
Projected Financial Results
3.24      FONDEI's projected financial results for 1979-83 are shown in
Annex 5, Tables 5 to 7. During 1979 and 1980, its first two years of oper-
ation, FONDEI's portfolio of disbursed loans would average only L 1.4 million



- 31 -
and L 6.7 million, respectively, and it would incur operating losses of about
L 315,000 in 1979 and L 220,000 in 1980. To the degree that it would not be
able to cover its administrative costs and reimburse the government for costs
(commitment fee) under the proposed loan out of the spread between its average
borrowing and lending costs, payments would be made out of FONDEI's paid-in
capital. Starting in 1981, with a loan portfolio averaging L 16.4 million,
FONDEI would earn a small profit. By 1983, when the Bank loan is expected to
be fully disbursed, FONDEI would have an outstanding loan portfolio averaging
about L 37.2 million, yielding a net financial spread of L 934,000, or 2.8% on
average loan amounts outstanding. With administrative costs rising gradually
to about L 220,000 in 1983 (equivalent to about 0.6% of average total assets),
FONDEI's net operating profit would be about L 700,000 in that year, equal to
a return of about 7% on paid-in capital and accumulated retained earnings.
Considering the expected rate of inflation (para. 2.09), FONDEI should be able
to meet its policy objective of maintaining at least the real value of its
capital, despite a comparatively low D/E ratio of about 2.9:1.
C. Potential Intermediary Institutions
3.25      Although, in principle, COHDEFOR, CONADI and all commercial banks
would be eligible for FONDEI financing, participation in the project would
be limited to those institutions which could meet the requirements established
under the participation agreements. These would provide that the participants
would: (i) maintain or contract staff capable of performing satisfactory
project appraisals; (ii) supervise projects to ensure that resources had been
used for the purpose intended and that projects were progressing on schedule;
(iii) adhere to terms of lending and repayment of loans; (iv) ensure that
procurement and disbursement provisions were met; (v) maintain adequate
records on Bank-financed projects; and (vi) provide FONDEI and the Bank with
such information as they would reasonably request. As a condition for loan
effectiveness, the Bank would need to receive satisfactory agreements between
BCH and CORDEFOR and at least three other intermediaries.
3.26      Commercial banks.  Based upon their sharply expanding industrial
credit activity in the recent past (para. 2.16), commercial banks are expected
to be active in seeking new lending opportunities and to account for about 88%
of total projects financed through FONDEI.  However, they would use only about
48% of total FONDEI resources, given their relatively greater emphasis upon
smaller industrial credits (Annex 5, Table 9). Because of the small amount of
term lending by commercial banks in the past, commercial banks participating
in the project would need to take steps necessary to train existing, or to
hire new professional staff, as needed, to carry out project evaluation and
supervision tasks in conformity with FONDEI's requirements. Commercial banks,
in general, tend to employ financial analysts and economists superior to the
average available in Honduras (including many trained abroad or at INCAE's MBA
program). Thus, with appropriate training (para. 3.19), commercial bank loan
officers can be expected to adopt satisfactory project evaluation procedures
and economic appraisal techniques.



- 32 -
3.27      COHDEFOR.  With substantial assistance from FAO and CIDA, COHDEFOR's
management has largely succeeded in establishing a sound organization, which
includes an export marketing operation (modeled after the Canadian Government's
pine export sales agency), which in 1977 sold about US$50 million in pine and
strengthened its market position in the USA and Europe. COHDEFOR has also
established a forest department of about 700 foresters engaged in reforestation,
forest inventory and fire fighting activities covering about 1.5 million ha,
and a protection division to monitor wood cutting activity and assist sawmills
to upgrade the quality of their operations.
3.28      COHDEFOR's investment strategy for the wood sector involves substan-
tial investments which could total US$75 million by 1983 and which would
involve three main areas:
(i)  The Olancho project, a large-scale, multi-stage program which
would put a major forest area under intensive production and
reforestation, is currently being designed. The project would
have a total investment cost of US$150-200 million in 1978-85;
(ii)  The Comayaqua forest area development program, which would
involve the promotion of a wide variety of private and mixed
public/private projects to: (a) increase regional lumber
output 50% by 1981 through more efficient use of the degraded
forest and better milling practices; (b) reduce costs of lumber
production and transportation and improve quality of lumber
products; and (c) introduce three resource centers into forest
regions to upgrade existing logging operations and reduce trans-
portation costs, while providing sharply expanded rural employ-
ment opportunities in reforestation and forest fire protection
and expanded resin production through rural cooperatives. Total
investment in plant and facilities during 1979-82 is estimated
at US$15-20 million; and
(iii)  Expansion of the secondary wood industry sector, utilizing mainly
the increased output from the Comayaqua region. An effort would
be made to attract local and foreign participation in the produc-
tion of millwork, furniture, boxes, plywood, and other wood
industry enterprises, which could involve a total investment of
US$15-20 million during 1979-82.
3.29      The proposed project would assist CORDEFOR to meet part of the finan-
cing needs to carry out (ii) and (iii) above. To this end, US$6 million equiv-
alent of the proposed loan would be allocated for COHDEFOR's use for a period
of 18 months. Because COHDEFOR would serve as a financial intermediary for a
major component of FONDEI's resources, CORDEFOR would establish a Forestry
Industries Financing Fund (Fund) within COHDEFOR and create a Wood Industry
Project Unit within its Lending Division that would be staffed adequately to
assume responsibility for industrial project promotion, evaluation, and super-
vision in coordination with COHDEFOR's Production and Forestry Departments.
The Project Unit would initially be staffed with a unit chief, two financial
analysts, and an engineer who would assist in project analysis and coordinate
and direct supervision activity. As far as necessary, COHDEFOR would provide



- 33 -
training in project evaluation and appraisal techniques to Project Unit staff.
The Project Unit would share credit analysis, accounting and portfolio control
functions with another unit responsible for short-term credit operations
(Annex 3, Organization Chart).
3.30      To ensure that (i) COHDEFOR subprojects submitted to FONDEI for
financing would promote the long-term growth and modernization of the primary
and secondary wood products and related service industries, 1/ and (ii) these
objectives would be implemented in a financially, technically and economically
sound way, COHDEFOR's Board would adopt a Statement of Operating Policy for
the Fund (for a draft see Annex 4), defining standards for project lending,
appraisal, loan approval and supervision activity as well as procurement,
disbursement and accounting procedures of the Project Unit.  To ensure that
the government's policy of fostering mixed public/private enterprise in
strategic wood industry projects is implemented, only private or mixed public/
private wood sector projects (not less than 30% private) could be financed by
the Fund. As conditions for disbursement, (i) the Project Unit and the Fund
would be established by COHDEFOR's Board, and (ii) COHDEFOR's Board would
approve an Operating Policy Statement satisfactory to the Bank.
3.31      Although CORDEFOR is not a part of the banking system (para. 2.07),
it was allowed to establish within the BCH an account mainly to finance the
wood inventory and marketing requirements of sawmills, and exporters and
importers of wood products. To facilitate COHDEFOR's lending operations
through FONDEI, COHDEFOR will open another BCH account which will be utilized
to channel FONDEI funds to COHDEFOR under the proposed project.
3.32      CONADI is expected to account for about 13% of total industrial
financing under the FONDEI project, with an average project size of approxi-
mately L 1 million (Annex 5, Table 9). CONADI's management is dynamic.
Partly because it is comprised of former commercial bankers, financial analysts,
and business consultants, CONADI's professional staff of about 25 persons
engaged in banking and investment operations includes a well-qualified project
analysis group that currently undertakes industrial project evaluation tasks.
Thus it is anticipated that with some brief orientation in economic appraisal
methodology (para. 3.18) CONADI could meet the Bank's project appraisal
requirements for DFCs. With respect to project supervision, CONADI supervises
its client companies in detail and often places its management representative
on their boards.
3.33      CONADI has a backlog equal to about US$15-20 million in relatively
large industrial projects; however, CONADI and other financial intermediaries
(except COHDEFOR) would each be limited to US$2.5 million in Bank funds, in
order to ensure that FONDEI resources are reasonably distributed and geographic-
ally dispersed (para. 4.01).

and forest equipment repairs.

3.34      CDI.  To ensure that resources made available to SSIs support well-
prepared projects and that the errors of past SSI lending through BANAFOM are
not repeated, the government in its 1979-83 development plan recognized the
need to provide technical assistance as well as credit to SSIs. To achieve
this objective, CDI, the government's existing technical assistance agency,
which has been used mainly for artisan training and handicraft promotion and
sales, has been transformed by law into an autonomous institution. Under
this law, enacted in October 1978, CDI would furnish a comprehensive range of
extension and promotional services including technical assistance to SSI. To
provide CDI with the funds necessary to carry out its new mandate, the annual
budget for CDI has been substantially increased, and the portion allocated for
assistance to small and medium industry has been increased from L 469,000 in
1978 to L 873,000 in 1979, which is ample to accomplish the desired expansion
into project promotion, preparation and technical assistance to SSI.
3.35      In fulfillment of its new and broader technical assistance mandate,
CDI would establish mechanisms and procedures to assist small-scale enterprises,
against a flat fee of not more than the equivalent of 2% of the subloan
requested, to participate in the industrial credit project. CDI would help
enterprises which were referred to it by participating financial intermediaries
or attracted by CDI's own promotion activity to prepare projects for possible
financing by providing technical assistance to the potential subborrower,
which may often only consist of helping to obtain the data necessary for ade-
quate review by financial intermediaries. Project implementation could involve
technical assistance and continued CDI guidance and supervision (for a nominal
fee--see above) needed to meet the overall needs of the project. To ensure
coordination between CDI and financial intermediaries, FONDEI and a commercial
bank representative would assist CDI in preparing project loan applications that
would meet overall requirements set by the program. Participating financial
intermediaries would not be bound to use CDI to advise potential subborrowers;
they could, for example, recommend that potential subborrowers use private
consulting firms or their own staff for limited assistance, It is anticipated
that during the first year under its augmented budget CDI would, in addition
to its existing functions, assist approximately 50 small-scale firms in pre-
paration of their applications and project appraisals and provide follow-up
technical assistance. As CDI gains experience it is expected to provide
assistance to between 100-200 firms per year.
3.36      In the past, CDI's productivity, as measured in terms of number of
artisans and SSI assisted and project evaluations completed, was rather low.
Consequently, an important objective of the project would be to upgrade
the capability of CDI's staff. CDI would therefore need to: (i) recruit,
by early 1979, an experienced industrial economist and engineer; (ii) ensure
participation of its staff in the project appraisal course to be arranged
by the BCH; and (iii) obtain, during 1979-80, consultant expertise to assist
CDI in preparing a long-range training program for its staff and to help the
director and senior staff to improve procedures for preparing departmental
budgets and programs, operating plans, manuals and guidelines. UNDP has
tentatively agreed to provide approximately two man-years of assistance to CDI
during 1979-80 to accomplish these tasks. UNIDO is expected to be the execu-
ting agency. During loan negotiations the Bank reached an understanding on:



- 35 -
(i) CDI's staffing plans and budget for 1979-80, (ii) the timing and nature of
UNDP technical assistance, (iii) CDI's policy with regard to levying charges
for its services, and (iv) CDI's assistance to SSI under the proposed project.
The 1979 budget of CDI has already been approved. Prior to loan effectiveness
CDI's arrangements for technical assistance would be finalized.
IV. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. General Description
4.01      Amounts and terms.  The proposed loan of US$15 million would be
made to the Government of Honduras at the Bank's prevailing interest rate
(presently 7.00%) and standard commitment fee of 3/4 of 1% p.a. The government
would transfer the proceeds of the loan through BCH to FONDEI, to be channeled
to industrial borrowers through financial intermediaries that meet FONDEI's
conditions for participation (para. 3.25). The foreign exchange risk on the
proposed Bank loan (primarily the cross currency exchange risk, since the
lempira is expected to maintain its parity with the US dollar) would be borne
by BCH. For this FONDEI would pay the BCH an annual fee of 0.5% on the balance
of outstanding subloans. Subject to review no later than 18 months after loan
signing: (i) US$6 million of the loan would be reserved for CORDEFOR's use,
(ii) US$2.5 million would be reserved for lending to small-scale enterprises,
and (iii) no single financial intermediary (except COHDEFOR) could commit more
than US$2.5 million in Bank resources. Loans to small enterprises (with
assets below US$100,000) would be exempt from the latter limitation.
4.02      To enable commitment of forest industry subloans which would require
final maturities of up to 17 years, the loan would be repaid over 20 years
including 5 years of grace (the Bank's maximum loan term for Honduras).
Other industrial projects would carry final maturities of up to 15 years.
Subloans would be denominated in lempiras. Loan repayments would be made in
accordance with a fixed amortization schedule, enabling FONDEI to avoid the
administrative complexity of dealing with component schedules for many small
loans. Any surplus of repayments from subloans over repayments due to the
Bank that would result from the use of the fixed amortization schedule would
be used by FONDEI for further subproject lending in accordance with its Policy
Statement. To capitalize FONDEI, BCH would make available: (i) US$2.5
million equivalent in capital prior to loan effectiveness and (ii) another
US$2.5 million not later than one year after loan effectiveness; and the
operating profits accruing to FONDEI would be integrated into its capital
structure. Subloans made with FONDEI resources would carry maximum interest
rates of 12%. 1/ At present and expected rates of inflation, this interest
rate would be significantly positive in real terms. Participating financial
intermediaries would be given financial spreads designed to encourage indus-
trial credits to smaller enterprises with 5% for loans for firms with fixed
1/   Intermediaries would be allowed to charge somewhat less by reducing their
spread on Bank funds.



- 36 -
assets under US$40,000 equivalent, 4% for fixed assets between US$40,000
and US$100,000, and 3% for medium-size firms above that level. Interest rates
and spreads (paras. 3.13 and 3.15) could be modified by agreement between the
Bank and BCH.
4.03      Maximum size of subloan and free limit.  FONDEI's maximum subloan
for any one investment project or any one enterprise would be US$750,000,
except in the case of COHDEFOR-financed projects for which the limit would be
US$1.5 million. All subproject appraisals submitted by the financial inter-
mediaries would be reviewed by FONDEI. The first ten subloans to small
industry would be submitted to the Bank for review and comment 1/. All subloans
above US$250,000 (the "free limit") would require Bank approval, and an ERR
calculation would be prepared generally by FONDEI staff for all projects
above the free limit using standard Bank guidelines for DFCs. This procedure
is expected to result in review by the Bank of a representative sample of some
30-40 subloans covering about two-thirds of the loan amount. In addition,
selected subloans below the free limit level would be reviewed on a post-
approval basis by field supervision missions.
4.04      Procurement.  The loan funds would finance the foreign exchange
costs of imported and locally procured equipment, materials and services,
including the foreign exchange component of construction contracts. Consult-
ing services for preinvestment studies or technical assistance services used
in conjunction with subprojects would be open to international recruitment.
The financial intermediaries and FONDEI would satisfy themselves that
procurement items were suitable for the respective investment projects and
reasonably priced, and that the beneficiaries had canvassed the main sources
of supply and were purchasing from the most advantageous source. Whenever
justified, items would be procured on the basis of several quotations, in
accordance with standard practice for IDF-type projects. Since it may be
difficult or relatively costly to obtain quotations from several suppliers
in the case of small orders, the solicitation of offers would be expected
mostly for larger procurement contracts.
4.05      Commitment and disbursement.  The final date for the submission of
subloan proposals would be December 31, 1981, and the closing date for
disbursements December 31, 1983 (Annex 5, Table 10). For subloans for small
industry subprojects to borrowers with fixed assets of US$100,000 and under
(excluding land and buildings) the Bank would reimburse FONDEI for 75% of
FONDEI's total financing of individual subprojects representing their average
foreign exchange content. 2/ Disbursement for small industry subprojects
would be on the basis of a certificate of expenditure submitted by FONDEI,
1/   This would enable the Bank to check initially that appraisals of small
industry subprojects are appropriate in depth and focus without delaying
the approval process.
2/   The foreign exchange content of subprojects is expected to be 54% of
total subproject cost, assuming that FONDEI finances an average 70% of
subproject costs (see para. 3.22). The foreign exchange content would
represent about 77% of FONDEI's financing.



- 37 -
which would retain the supporting documentation in Honduras for inspection
during Bank supervision missions. For medium-sized industry subprojects and
COHDEFOR subprojects full documentation would be required, and the Bank would
disburse for (i) 100% of documented foreign expenditures for directly imported
machinery, equipment, raw material inventories and services; (ii) the CIF cost
of foreign equipment purchased off-the-shelf or 70% of local expenditures for
such goods where the CIF price cannot be ascertained; (iii) a standard percent-
age of 35% representing the average foreign exchange content of investments in
industrial buildings and related civil works; and (iv) in the case of forestry
subprojects a standard percentage of 20% representing the foreign exchange
content of wood and wood product inventories. Since the two-tier system,
involving FONDEI, the financial intermediaries (including COHDEFOR), and CDI
(for SSI lending), requires a longer time for processing of subprojects
than is usual for IDF-type loans, disbursements would be made for expenditures
incurred up to 180 days prior to the receipt of Bank subloan requests, in
lieu of the normal 90 days limit.
4.06      Accounts and auditing.  FONDEI would establish and maintain separate
accounts for FONDEI as a whole, including the operations under the industrial
credit project. Currently, the account of BCH and its special funds and trust
accounts (including IDA's agricultural credits) are prepared by BCH's account-
ing department and reviewed and audited by the BCH Internal Auditor and the
External Auditor appointed by the President of the Republic. COHDEFOR would
also establish and maintain separate accounts for its Forest Industries
Financing Fund. FONDEI and COHDEFOR would maintain separate accounts which
would be audited annually by the BCH External Auditor or independent auditors,
respectively, satisfactory to the Bank, and the audited reports, of a content
and in a format satisfactory to the Bank, would be submitted to the Bank not
later than four months after the close of each fiscal year.
B. Project Benefits and Risks
4.07      As indicated in Annex 5, Table 11, subprojects financed would have
a significant economic impact. The bulk of financing is expected to go to
those subsectors which depend mainly on domestic raw materials and which are
the main exporting subsectors (e.g. lumber and wood products, food products,
textiles and garments, and chemicals). Given the relatively high labor
intensity of the wood, construction materials and metal products industries,
which would receive an estimated 60% of sublending, the total investment
assisted by the project is expected to result in the creation of about 4,000
new jobs at a relatively low investment cost of US$6,800 per job in 1978
prices.  The wood industry component of the project would account for almost
2,450 of the expected 4,000 new jobs at a lower average cost of US$5,300 per
job, due mainly to emphasis that would be placed upon financing of labor-
intensive medium- and small-scale primary and secondary wood product projects
which would also include several highly labor-intensive reforestation, forest
management and resin production projects. Wood industry projects would largely
benefit families living in the small rural towns and villages within the highly
depressed Comayaqua forest region. Overall, about 25% of the jobs created



- 38 -
would be at an average cost per job roughly equal to the UPP capital/labor
threshold for Honduras. An additional 48% of jobs created would have costs
ranging up to 60% over the UPP target. Only 18% of the new jobs would in-
volve costs substantially over the threshold level.
4.08      The proposed loan would contribute to filling a major gap in term
financing of industrial projects in Honduras and is expected to help finance,
through FONDEI, about 165 subprojects with a total cost of US$28 million
equivalent. Total financing under the industrial credit project, including
the Bank loan, the contributions of BCH, and the mandatory financing by
participating institutions, would provide about 8% of the new credits required
by industry over the expected loan disbursement period (1979-83) and thus
contribute significantly to the 9% p.a. expected industrial sector growth.
4.09      The project would have important institution building benefits.
It would help strengthen BCH's developmental role in particular by estab-
lishing a system for the analysis and evaluation of industrial projects
and for providing term financing for the investment needs of such projects.
In addition, it would strengthen COHDEFOR's capability to promote, appraise
and finance projects in forest industries, and would provide CDI with the
technical assistance it requires in order to meet the increasing demand of
small enterprises for its services.
4.10      Indirect benefits resulting from the project are hard to measure.
Primary wood industry projects, for example, would normally include in their
investment plans such features as adequate basic housing for forest industry
workers and their families, water, electricity, medical services and education
facilities as part of the industrial infrastructure. Local small farmers
would also benefit from new forest access roads and transportation to market
centers. Also, it is anticipated that the impact of the program will be
geographically dispersed, with agroindustrial subprojects focused mainly along
the north coast, forestry subprojects in the mountainous central area, and
other manufacturing subprojects located mainly in the cities of San Pedro
Sula and Tegucigalpa.
4.11      The project would establish a system which would substantially
improve the capacity of participating financial intermediaries to base their
lending activities upon detailed project preparation and evaluation. Moreover,
introducing economic appraisal into the project appraisal cycle through FONDEI
would strengthen the monetary and economic development authorities' appre-
ciation for the links between industrial policy formulation and industrial
development. Based upon its expected main focus on wood industry and
agroindustrial and export-oriented subprojects, the proposed project would
assist the government in its efforts to increase non-traditional exports, the
value added content in its traditional exportable raw materials, and selected
substitution of imports.
4.12      By creating a specialized project unit within COHDEFOR, the proposed
project would have the complementary effect of building institutional capability
for sharply expanded wood industry project promotion, preparation, evaluation
and financing. As a result of the project there would be increased prospects



- 39 -
for identifying, promoting and financing mixed private/public sector forest
industry projects combining industrial activity with ecologically sound and
socially important programs of forest management.
4.13      The proposed project, as conceived, does not involve any unusual
risks. However, because the institutional arrangements established under
the project would be both new and untried, some initial delays in subloan
processing among both the financial intermediaries (including COHDEFOR and
CONADI) and FONDEI may occur. To minimize delays in project implementation,
Bank supervision of and assistance to the project would be more intensive
during the first year.

prises 1/ and industry-related service undertakings, especially
those that make greater use of natural resources, generate
foreign exchange, or stimulate efficient import substitution;
(b) To make loans through financial intermediaries to finance the
creation, expansion and improvement of the productive capacity
of small- and medium-sized businesses;
(c) To ensure that smaller-scale businesses have access to long-
term credit and to the technical assistance required for the
efficient utilization of natural resources;
(d) To stimulate the financial intermediaries to help borrowers
improve the technical and financial quality of project pre-
paration, and to improve their own methodology for project
appraisal;
(e) To use an appropriate system for the socio-economic appraisal

(f) To devise appropriate systems for supervising the use of
FONDEI resources.
2.        FONDEI may use the Fund to carry out the following operations:
(a) To discount medium- and long-term loans made by lending institu-
tions for the purchase of fixed assets, the corresponding
permanent working capital, the installation of industrial equip-
ment and services, the construction of buildings, the prepara-
tion of pre-investment and feasibility studies, and for tech-
nical assistance related to the projects being financed;
(b) Payment of all costs and charges relating to FONDEI's
operations; and
(c) Other financial transactions relating to the Fund's objectives.
1/   Subject to terms and conditions which will be established by agreement

ANNEX 2
- 43 -
3.        The maximum amount of each loan authorized by FONDEI to expand
or set up manufacturing, agro-industrial and fisheries undertakings shall be
L 1.5 million. For forests and lumber projects, the limit shall be L 3 mil-
lion. The financing of subprojects exceeding these limits may be approved by
FONDEI only when these are top priority projects.
4.        All subloans shall be expressed in Lempiras.  To cover possible
exchange risks, FONDEI shall pay BCH a fee of one-half percent per year on the
outstanding balance of the loan granted by FONDEI.
5.        The following criteria shall be borne in mind in the selection of
projects to be financed:
-    The economic and financial rates of return;
-    The use of labor;
-    The increase or savings in foreign exchange;
-    The probability of increasing the percentage of value added;
-    The use of Honduran raw materials, goods and services; and
-    Other economic factors, according to the nature of the project.
6.        FONDEI shall periodically examine the projects financed in order to
ascertain that small-scale businesses are receiving a proper share of the
Fund s resources and whether technical assistance, if required, is adequate;
it shall likewise adjust the structure of the rediscounting rates and other
conditions affecting the participation of the financial intermediaries, to
ensure that the Fund's resources are being used for purposes referred to in
Section 1, and that all interested intermediaries have access to the said
resources.
7.        The Fund shall operate indefinitely and shall be financed to carry
out the purposes for which it has been created (paragraphs 1 and 2). It shall
retain sufficient staff to carry out the regular activities of project design,
promotion, appraisal and supervision, including the necessary administrative
and accounting functions. Its principal resources for achieving its industrial
objectives shall consist of an initial capital of L 10 million, contributed by
BCH, and the funds allocated to it by the Government of Honduras from loans
contracted with national and international organizations, its own earnings,
and any other resources which it might obtain.
8.        FONDEI shall provide financing up to a limit of L 5 million per
institution through commercial banks and CONADI, on condition that such
institutions develop proper facilities for appraising and supervising long-term
loans, and that they also meet such other requirements as FONDEI may determine.
Among the participants shall be the Honduran Corporation for Forestry Development
(CORDEFOR), which will receive an allocation of L 12 million through a separate
account at the Banco Central de Honduras. Eligible wood sector enterprises
would need to have at least 30% private ownership.



ANNEX 2
- 44 --
9.        Within the limits laid down (paragraph 3) FONDEI may, in the
case of (i) new projects, finance up to 65% of the value of the fixed assets
and permanent working capital; the financial intermediaries shall provide not
less than 10% of the project funds from their own resources, and the borrower
shall contribute the balance of the total cost, as required to complete the
financing of the sub-project; (ii) for the expansion and modernization of
existing enterprises, finance up to 80%; and (iii) for forestry projects,
up to 75%. FONDEI may authorize percentages different from those above in
cases involving small-sized firms with a sound financial structure.
10.       The terms and other conditions on which FONDEI provides financing
shall depend on the characteristics of the investment. The intermediary
institutions shall provide financing on the same conditions as FONDEI. Loans
may be granted for a maximum period of 17 years for forestry loans, and
15 years for industrial loans, which may include a grace period of up to
3 years.
11.       The interest payable by borrowers and financial intermediaries
shall be established by FONDEI. The interest rates must cover FONDEI's
financial and operating costs, and enable its capital to be preserved and
increased.
12.       The Fund may make loans for the execution of pre-investment and
feasibility studies when these are related to projects eligible for assistance.
These loans shall be granted on such conditions as the Trustee may in each
case determine. If the pre-investment or feasibility study leads to the
relevant project being carried out, the loan for the said study shall be
consolidated with that granted for implementation of the project.
13.       Financing provided by the Fund to lending institutions and other
participants (financial intermediaries) are subject to the following basic
requirements:
(a) They may only be granted to financial intermediaries
operating in accordance with the laws of Honduras.
(b) The financial intermediary must ensure that the
borrower will have access to sufficient funds to
finance its working capital needs.
(c) The financial intermediary shall help potential
borrowers to prepare, in an acceptable form, a
study of the market and of technical and financial
factors, for its appraisal.
(d) In the case of loans to small businesses requiring
help with project preparation, the financial inter-
mediaries shall request the Industrial Development
Center (CDI) or other qualified advisors to provide
the necessary technical assistance, against a fee
of not more than 2% of the amount of the loan.



ANNEX 2
- 45 -
(e) The financial intermediaries shall punctually repay
their loans from FONDEI even though they may not have
been reimbursed by their borrowers. They shall immediately
pay to FONDEI any sums received in advance.
14.       The Fund shall not finance projects which can call on alternative
sources of financing on acceptable terms for the project.
15.       FONDEI's accounts shall be audited by the External Auditor of BCH
or by qualified independent auditors.

HONDURAN FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
(COHDEFOR)
TEGUCIGALPA, D.C., HONDURAS, C.A.
ANNEX D
FORESTRY INDUSTRIES FINANCING FUND
STATEMENT ON OPERATIONAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
I.        PURPOSE
The Forestry Industries Financing Fund (hereinafter called the
Forestry Fund) is a financial development institution operating as an admin-
istrative fund within the Honduran Forestry Development Corporation (COHDEFOR),
whose principal objective is to accelerate the economic growth-rate of the
forestry products industry, to which end it will promote and finance specific
projects for the development of forestry products, industries processing
wood and resins and related services. The Forestry Fund will therefore
follow a judicious policy of promoting, financing and assistirg productive
enterprises consistent with national development plans. The Forestry Fund
will undertake its activities on the basis of sound criteria and practices in
the investment field and within the framework of its charter, regulations and
the present statement of policies and procedures. The administration of the
Fund will be carried out by a Project Unit, adequately staffed for this
purpose.
II.       FUNCTIONS
The Forestry Fund shall perform the following functions and
activities:
(i) Promote the establishment of a primary forestry products
induscry and of a secondary wood products industry, in
order to enhance the value added and expand domestic pro-
duction and exports of forestry products and of wood.
(ii) Grant medium- and long-term loans to individuals and
private and mixed companies for the expansion of produc-
tion in the sectors to which paragraph (i) above refers.
(iii) To these ends and with the agreement of the Board of
Directors of COHDEFOR, it may obtain loans and, with the
approval of the Central Bank of Honduras, issue bonds.



ANNEX 4
-48 -
III.      GENERAL FINANCING GUIDELINES
1.   In the performance of its activities the Forestry Fund,
on a basis of sound financing practices, shall display
reasonable prudence in relation to the risks involved
in financing operations and seek to diversify its financing
activities in both geographical and subsectoral terms.
2.   The Forestry Fund shall consider all proposals on their
financial and economic merits and select those that promise
an acceptable return and promote the economic development
of the Republic of Honduras.
3.   The Forestry Fund shall attach due weight to the economic
aspects of the projects it finances. When the amount of a
loan exceeds the equivalent of L 200,000, a detailed
appraisal will be made of the economic aspects of the
project. To this end, a system of analysis permitting the
internal calculation of rates of economic return and other

of each borrower, the Forestry Fund shall inspect the installations and opera-
tions of each borrower at least once each year and, in the case of enterprises
experiencing difficulties, as frequently as necessary. Such inspections shall
comprise an evaluation of the guarantees furnished by each borrower, in order
to ensure that they maintain adequate insurance with responsible insurance
companies based on sound commercial practices.
6.   If necessary, according to the status of each enterprise, the
