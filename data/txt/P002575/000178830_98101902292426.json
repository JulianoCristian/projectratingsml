and improvement of Port Sudan to increase\n            its physical capacity, operational productivity and\n            management capability, to relieve congestion and increase\n            throughput. It includes mechanization of cargo handling and\n            movement, improvement of layout and working surface,\n            improvement of bulk, container and roll on/roll off\n            facilities and management assistance and training. It is\n            designed to expand the capacity of Port Sudan up to a point\n            where the physical capacity of the site is almost reached;\n            further expansion in port capacity for the long-run needs is\n            planned at a different site 40 kilometers to the south at\n            Suakin. The major risk is that project implementation would\n            disrupt traffic excessively and that SPC's operational\n            efficiency would not respond adequately to the project.\n            These factors have been taken into account in the planning\n            and phasing of the project and its associated technical\n            assistance and training programs."}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
