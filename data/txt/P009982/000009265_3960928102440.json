Components include : 1) over 3,000\n            circuit km of high voltage transmission lines; 2) 2,500 MVA\n            of substation capacity; 3) several control centers; 4) a\n            communication system; and 5) compensatory afforestation.\n            The project will strengthen NHPC's organization and\n            help develop the newly formed National Power Transmission\n            Corporation (NPTC).  The technical risks associated with the\n            first time use of 765 kV lines and the use of 400kV lines at\n            high altitudes are being managed by employing suitable consultants."}, "docdt": "1990-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
