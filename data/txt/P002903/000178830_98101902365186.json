It would finance\n            feasibility and detailed engineering studies for the\n            rehabilitation and expansion of the water supply and\n            sanitation facilities of these seven towns, a tariff study,\n            a manpower training study, technical assistance, and\n            provision of water meters, vehicles and staff houses. The\n            main risk facing the project involves the Government's\n            ability to develop an appropriate policy framework for the\n            water supply sector. As the studies to be financed under the\n            proposed project would provide the analysis needed to review\n            the relevant policy issues, it is felt that this risk would\n            be satisfactorily addressed."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
