The main\n            project components include: (a) expansion of agricultural\n            extension and social services; (b) expansion of livestock\n            health and production services, including honey production;\n            (c) provision of credit for agricultural investment and\n            inputs, including investment to expand the services and\n            outreach of ACB; (d) construction of rural water supply\n            systems and irrigation works; (e) provision of project\n            management and engineering services; (f) provision of\n            housing facilities for the permanent staff of the\n            Agricultural Research Service (ARS); (g) extension of the\n            bilharzia control program; and (h) completion of feasibility\n            studies and preparation of final designs for the\n            agricultural development of the Wadi Jawf area."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
