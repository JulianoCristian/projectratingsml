REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR FOR A
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed credit
to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for the equivalent of US$14.0 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a Second Education Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        An economic report entitled "The Economic Development of Madagascar:
Main Issues" (Report No. 167a-MAG) was distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors on July 15, 1974. An economic updating mission visited Madagascar in
October/ November 1975 and, following further discussions with the Government
in August 1976, its report is being finalized. A summary of the mission's
findings is set out below. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        With a GNP per capita estimated at US$180 in 1975, Madagascar
is one of the poorest countries in the world. It is predominantly an agri-
cultural country and 85 percent of its 8.8 million people live in rural
areas with an average per capita income near US$100 per annum. Although
the country is sparsely populated (an average of 15 inhabitants per square
kilometer), there is great pressure on cultivable land in some regions.
Owing mainly to different ecological conditions, the highlands are more
advanced than the coastal areas, and the south is particularly poor with a
harsh, arid climate and infertile soils. The east coast is rich agricultur-
ally, but crops are frequently devastated by cyclones. In many areas the
standard of living is close to subsistence level; nutrition is deficient and
child mortality is high. Internal migration is common and has accelerated as
improved roads have provided access to new areas. However, poor roads remain
a major constraint to development; only one third of the main highways are
passable in all weather in a country where production centers may be as far as
800 km from main points of consumption. Many areas are cut off from the
rest of the country for-several months each year.
4.        The structure of land holdings does not give rise to large in-
equalities in income or wealth, but in a number of instances traditional
share cropping practices are resented. Rice, the staple food, accounts for
about one third of agricultural production and is mostly consumed on the
farm. The major cash crops include coffee, sugar and cloves; there is a
1/   Substantially identical to Part I of the President's Report on a
Fourth Highways Project, dated June 2, 1976.

wide variety of other crops. Animal husbandry is also important, with a
national herd estimated at 8 to 10 million head. Fishing, too, now makes
an important contribution to national income.
5.        Madagascar has passed through a period of fundamental political
change over the past four years. A referendum held in December 1975 approved
a new constitution and confirmed President Ratsiraka as Head of State and
President of the Supreme Revolutionary Council. The basic political program
of the present Government has been outlined in the Charter of the Socialist
Revolution published in September 1975. Major institutional and policy
changes aim at:
(i) Decentralization: greater local responsibility for development
is to be encouraged by giving the provincial administrations
considerably increased authority; furthermore, the comprehen-
sive reorganization of the system of local government based
on the fokonolona, begun in 1973, is to be consolidated.
(ii) Land reform: the few large estates left unexploited are to
be broken up and sharecroppers would receive the land
they actually work.
(iii) Rural development: high priority is to be given to increasing
incomes and services in the poorest areas.
(iv) Basic education: all children of school age are to be gradually
enrolled in a new five-year primary education program with a
curriculum which is to be made more relevant to local circum-
stances.
(v) Greater national participation in commerce and industry: the
commercial banks, insurance companies and a number of other
key businesses in foreign hands have been nationalized and
Government may become a majority shareholder in all major
enterprises.
6.        The Charter makes the reform of local government a central feature
of the new development strategy. The fokonolona system, which is an original
adaptation of the traditional village council, aims at enabling citizens
to participate actively in improving local conditions. The fokonolona are
engaging in cooperative activities such as the marketing of crops, the re-
tailing of essential commodities and the channeling of credit. They have
begun to collect levies on marketed produce and to use the proceeds to
finance schools and other services. During the last two years, fokonolona
have been established throughout the country - about 10,000 in all - and
some have begun development activities such as the construction of roads,
communal buildings and small irrigation works, in addition to marketing
activities.

7.        Between 1966 and 1971 GDP in real terms rose by about five percent
per annum, while the investment rate was close to 15 percent. Following the
change in Government in 1972, a comprehensive reappraisal of economic pol-
icies was undertaken. Over the past four years major institutional changes
accompanied by the rapid malagasization of the economy has inevitably given
rise to initial management problems. These, combined with the recession in
the world economy, have had an adverse impact on overall economic performance.
Real GDP now stands at the level reached in 1971, after a drop in 1972 and
1973 in construction and services, and a marked recovery in 1974 when GDP
rose by over 6 percent mainly owing to an excellent harvest. Since 1971
gross fixed capital formation has declined and in 1974 amounted to only 11
percent of GDP. Preliminary estimates for 1975 indicate little or no growth.
8.        Agricultural output grew by about 10 percent between 1970 and 1974,
mainly on account of commercial crops, including fruit and forestry products.
The expansion of coffee and cotton production in particular has been encourag-
ing. Coffee, the main export crop, now accounts for nearly one third of
total export earnings; it is grown almost entirely by smallholders. Cotton
production has doubled since 1970. On the other hand, livestock production
has suffered as a result of a decline in cattle numbers between 1970-74,
mainly due to drought and an increase in the incidence of disease. This,
combined with expanding domestic consumption, has caused a serious drop in
the exports of meat and meat products.
9.        The expansion of rice production is one of the Government's major
tasks. Rice is largely grown for on-farm consumption; less than 15 percent
enters commercial channels. Nevertheless, over the last decade rice produc-
tion had grown by only 2 percent per year, which was insufficient to keep
up with population growth. The urban population has increased by about
5 percent annually, and its demand for rice has led the country to be a net
importer of rice since 1971. To stimulate production, in 1973/74 the Govern-
ment doubled the producer price of paddy. The impact of this measure could
not be accurately ascertained since, although production increased substan-
tially in 1974, weather conditions were unusually favorable in that year.
Indications are, however, that in this very poor country, price incentives
have to be accompanied by related measures covering marketing, roads, exten-
sion, inputs, equipment and credit.
10.       Since independence in 1960, manufacturing has made steady progress,
raising its contribution to GDP from about 5 percent to 12 percent. Output
is mostly processed agricultural products and consumer goods for domestic
use. As manufacturing has expanded, imports of non-food consumer goods have
declined as a percentage of total merchandise imports from 42 percent in
1960 to 19 percent in 1974, while imports of intermediate and capital goods,
and raw materials, have increased. The Government considers that there is
still some scope for further import substitution, but for long term growth
Madagascar will need to develop export industries. In particular there is
potential for the further processing of domestic agricultural products.
Production has not been too much affected by recent political changes; al-
though value added in manufacturing stagnated in 1972 and 1973, it grew by
9 percent in 1974, mainly on account of textile, sugar and dairy industries.



- 4 -
11.       Political uncertainties over the past three years have resulted
in a sharp downturn in foreign private investment. At the same time the
Malagasy themselves have been hesitant to invest in manufacturing. A sub-
stantial number of potentially viable investment projects have been iden-
tified, and the Government's immediate concern is to find suitable private
partners with the necessary expertise. The investment code is currently
being revised to provide standard sets of conditions for most investors.
In the case of major investors, special agreements may be negotiated.
12.       As part of the policy of malagasization, the use of foreign tech-
nical assistance has been greatly reduced. In 1970 there were some 1,500
foreign experts employed by the Government; by 1974 the number had fallen to
about 600. Pressure is being exerted on private firms to localize their
staff. The departure of numerous foreign managers has been accompanied
by an expansion in the demand for nationals with commercial, entrepreneurial
and managerial skills. This transitional period will no doubt be accompanied
by management problems, and it is likely that the Government will have to
rely to a greater extent than now on foreign consultants and technical
assistants in a non-executive capacity.
13.       Recent developments in public finance have reflected the relative
conservatism of the various governments which exercised power over the last
four years. Current government revenue amounts to about 14 percent of GDP
while current expenditure declined somewhat in real terms mainly on account
of lower purchases of goods and services by the Government.    The current
budgetary surplus increased from about FMG 4.6 billion (US$18 million) in
1972 to FMG 6.8 billion (US$30 million) in 1975, and financed about one
third of capital expenditures during this period. The Government's capacity
to implement investment projects has not been as high as its expectations;
actual expenditure has increased little since 1972 and has fallen short
of budgetary allocations.
14.       It was only in 1974 that the Government reversed its traditional
position of being a net depositor with the banking system. The Treasury
then borrowed about FMG 10 billion (US$45 million) to finance emergency
imports of rice. In 1974, money supply increased by about 18 percent and
consumer prices went up by 22 percent. Since then money supply and consumer
prices have been relatively stable.
15.       The Government is aware that it needs a more aggressive develop-
ment strategy. The 1976 budget provides for an investment budget nearly
double actual expenditures in 1975. It remains to be seen, however, if
its administration will be geared to such higher levels. Current expendi-
ture is also estimated to increase by 22 percent, partly to upgrade the
minimum wages of junior employees (up to 40 percent for the lowest paid).
One of the major items of the budget is education, which accounts for 25
percent of current expenditure. On the other hand, expenditures for police
and military related activities are very low. Current revenue is estimated



-5-
to grow by 17 percent, to be achieved by some increases in customs duties and
the improved collection of direct taxes. As the current surplus would
disappear, special contributions are to be levied on the crop stabilization
funds and public enterprises to finance part of the capital budget. In the
foreseeable future, budget surpluses are estimated to be lower in real terms
than in the early 1970s. If the Government is to increase its investment, it
will have to make greater efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources
and to rely to a somewhat greater extent than at present on external capital
inflows.
16.       In July, 1973 Madagascar withdrew from the Franc Zone.    An autono-
mous Central Bank was established and exchange control imposed on all external
transactions. Imports of non-essential commodities were curbed by licensing
and by an increase in import taxes. In 1973 the balance of payments' current
account showed a small deficit of about US$11 million. But in 1974 the
exceptionally high rice imports and the increased cost of oil products,
accompanied by generally worsening terms of trade, led to a current account
deficit of approximately US$53 million. While export prices rose by only 16
percent between 1973 and 1974, import prices jumped by 45 percent. In 1975,
international reserves dropped by US$15 million to US$35 million, the equi-
valent of only five weeks of merchandise imports.
17.       It is not expected that capital requirements will substantially
increase over the 1975-80 period. GDP is projected to grow at the relatively
slow rate of 4 percent per annum, while the resource gap would remain close
to one percent of GDY. Historically, Madagascar has experienced a very
low import elasticity but it is considered likely that with the increase in
the investment rate, imports of goods and services will grow by 5 percent
annually. At the same time, the terms of trade are not expected to improve
over the adverse position obtaining in 1974. The current account deficit
would increase in current prices from an estimated US$50 million in 1975 to
about US$82 million in 1980. After modest allowances for capital grants and
private direct investment, net disbursements of external assistance should
increase from US$40 million in 1975 to US$50 million in 1980, which is vir-
tually no growth after allowance for international inflation. This would
call for commitments of about US$80 million annually in the late 1970s.
18.       On the basis of the capital inflow described above, the debt
service ratio would remain at about 4 percent during the remainder of the
1970s. Beyond 1980, however, capital requirements may increase if the
economy recovers the impetus it had in the late 1960s. At the same time,
some decline in the grant element of external assistance is projected and
the debt service ratio would reach 7.5 percent in 1985. For a long time
to come, however, external aid agencies should, in view of the poverty of
the country, be prepared to continue providing assistance on concessionary
terms. In view of the lack of local capital resources, they should also be
prepared to finance a high proportion of total project cost, including a part
of local costs.



-6-
19.       Official development assistance to Madagascar averaged about US$56
million per annum in the 1970-74 period, half of which were technical assis-
tance grants. Gross official flows from DAC countries slightly increased
from US$32 million to US$38 million, with France's share declining from 77
percent to 60 percent. Disbursement on long and medium term loans more
than doubled to US$23 million. In 1974 external aid commitments totaled
approximately US$56 million, some 30 percent below the 1973 level. Half of
these commitments were for Bank loans and IDA credits. New major sources
of external finance are the European Development Fund and China; in 1975
the latter committed US$57 million to be disbursed over the next ten years.
As a result of concessionary terms under which most external assistance was
granted and of the 1972 agreement cancelling about 43 percent (US$27 million)
of the debt owed to France, Madagascar's current level of indebtedness is
low. External public debt disbursed and outstanding at the end of 1974 was
US$133 million, of which the Bank's share was 8 percent and IDA's was 30
percent. Service payments on this debt amounted to US$9.5 million in 1974
(or about 3.4 percent of export earnings), of which payments to the Bank
Group represented 11 percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MADAGASCAR
20.       Madagascar has received ten IDA credits totaling US$111.2 million
and five Bank loans totaling US$32.6 million. IFC has made no investment so
far but has under active consideration a proposed investment in the expansion
of a textile company. About 70 percent of Bank Group lending has been for
transport, 27 percent for agriculture and the balance for education. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of August 31,
1976 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. The priority given to
transport investment recognizes that improvement in communications is a pre--
condition for Madagascar's development. Four projects were for the construc-
tion of all-weather links between the island's different regions, one was for
improvements to Madagascar's main port of Tamatave and one for the moderniza-
tion of the railway line between Tamatave and the capital, Tananarive. Bank
Group lending for agriculture consists of two livestock development projects,
two irrigation projects and a forestry project. The First Education Project
was satisfactorily completed in February 1974; it has helped to expand tech-
nical education and teacher training in Tananarive.
21.       Problems have arisen in the course of execution of several projects.
Although, as far as construction works are concerned, physical implementation
is generally satisfactory, substantial cost overruns have occurred which
necessitated major reductions in the scope of several projects and, in the
case of the Tamatave Port and Third Highway Projects, led to supplemental IDA
financing. In addition, in 1975, project execution was affected by political
events which led to a slowdown in the decision making process. The Government
having consolidated its position, notable improvements have recently been made,
though some projects, particularly the Village Livestock and Rural Development
Project, are still facing serious difficulties (see Annex II.C).



- 7 -
22.       In our future lending to Madagascar, we intend to continue
focusing primarily on infrastructure development, agriculture and educa-
tion. Priority will be given to the highway sector, where we will increas-
ingly emphasize the construction of feeder roads and road maintenance
activities. The Government is also preparing a hydroelectric power project
and has asked the Bank Group to assist in identifying sources of financing.
23.       Gradually, we expect to shift our lending from infrastructure to
agriculture. However, the absence of a comprehensive agricultural strategy
has slowed down the preparation of specific projects and in the immediate
future we will, therefore, concentrate on the implementation of ongoing
projects, particularly of the Village Livestock and Rural Development Project
and of the Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Project. We have also
agreed to assist the Government in identifying and preparing second phase
projects for the development of the Morondava and Alaotra areas, which may
lead to Bank Group financing.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
The Issues
24.       Although Madagascar achieved independence in 1960, the education
and training system has not yet adapted itself to the needs of the country.
A reform of the system has now begun. In the past, the goal at each level of
instruction was to prepare the students for the next higher level. This was
especially the case in the primary schools, where studies were over-literary,
with an emphasis on French, the language of instruction in secondary schools.
Primary education in turn has influenced secondary education, where most
enrollments have been in literary rather than scientific courses. Greater
attention will in future be given to instruction in Malagasy, the national
language, and to practical subjects and scientific studies which relate more
closely to the pupils' own environment.
25.       Educational administration could be improved by decentraliza-
tion. In the past the location in Tananarive of all the decision-making
mechanisms has led to delays and has caused villagers to regard the schools
as alien institutions.
26.       Although only about 50 percent of primary school age children were
attending school in 1974 and the pupil:teacher ratio in public primary schools
was excessively high (74:1), the Government spent 25 percent of its budget on
education. Despite the evident need for more teachers, the teacher training
colleges were far from fully enrolled because the Government did not have the
funds to employ the graduates. A very high proportion of expenditures goes to
pay teachers' salaries, and primary schools lack the simplest materials such
as books and pencils, while secondary schools lack equipment.



- 8 -
27.       For these reasons and because of a rigid examination system, the
repetition and dropout rates are high: on average less than three out of
five primary school pupils are promoted to the next class at the end of the
year.
28.       It is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in
meeting manpower needs because of the lack of adequate statistics. There
is no doubt, however, that the problem of "educated unemployed" is becoming
increasingly serious: some 50,000 lower secondary leavers, of whom about
15,000 had a lower secondary school certificate, were reportedly unemployed
by the end of 1975. Furthermore, even on conservative estimates of secondary
enrollment growth over the period from 1973 to 1985, about 170,000 young
people will leave school with at least a lower secondary education, while the
estimated number of jobs to be created requiring such levels of education is
projected at only 85,000.
Government Plans for the Sector
29.       Government educational policy and plans calling for a radical change
in the content and delivery system are contained in the National Develop-
ment Plan 1974-1977 and in the Charter of the Malagasy Socialist Revolution
of October 1975. The Plan stressed the "democratization" and "malagasization"
of education and envisaged: (i) enrollment of all children aged 6-14 in
schools by 1987; (ii) the reform of primary education by changing the course
into a basic education course given in Malagasy and lasting five years;
(iii) greater involvement of village associations (fokonolona) in building
primary schools and paying primary teachers' salaries; (iv) use of National
Servicemen as teachers; and (v) a greater emphasis on scientific and technical
education. The Charter endorsed the Plan, but considered universal basic
education should be achieved much sooner by the enrollment of an additional
million children in primary schools within three years. It also stressed
the need to decentralize educational control and to provide for a technical
lycee, and ultimately a university center, in each province.
30.       A new basic education curriculum was worked out in 1975, withi
Malagasy as the language of instruction and with emphasis on practical work
and productive activities. Plans are in hand for in-service courses for
existing teachers and a crash 3-month training course for lower secondary
school graduates, who would then fulfill their National Service obligations
by teaching in primary schools for at least two years. The Government
intends to train 9,000 National Service teachers annually; 3,000 at a time.
However, the existing teacher training facilities have a capacity of only
about 1,200 for each 3-month course, for a total annual output of 3,600 and
the use of secondary school facilities as proposed by the Government is likely
to encounter opposition from parents and pupils. The Government has recently
prepared a broad outline of its decentralization proposals and is now preparing
detailed plans for implementation.
31.       The Government's plans to change the delivery system by the use of
National Servicemen as teachers should be given strong support. Since these
teachers will be paid only one third of the salaries of regular teachers,



- 9 -
their use will help lessen the financial burden mentioned above of attempting
to achieve universal basic education for the six through eleven age group with
a reasonable pupil:teacher ratio of 45:1. It is estimated this would be
possible by 1985 by devoting about 28 percent of the recurrent budget to
education, provided some 25,000 National Servicemen were used as teachers and
that new regular teachers were recruited among successful National Servicemen.
Since these teachers would have only limited training, they would be employed
at two thirds of existing teachers' salaries. These projections envisage
devoting 50 percent of educational expenditures to primary education, as at
present. In view of financial constraints and the present overabundance
of secondary school leavers, it would be advisable to control secondary school
expansion so that 55 percent of the education budget could be devoted to
primary education. In this way, universal basic education could be achieved
while keeping the total education budget down to 25 percent of the national
budget.
32.       The efforts to make basic education more relevant to local con-
ditions and employment opportunities by the use of the national language, the
employment as far as possible of teachers from the same locality as the
school, the involvement of village associations in school construction and to
some extent in school control are also steps in the right direction. They
represent the new philosophy of development from the bottom up rather than
from the top down. An essential element in this process is the decentraliza-
tion of educational control from Tananarive to the regions, as envisaged in the
Charter.
33.       To help improve scientific and technical education and to provide
more adequate equipment in secondary schools, the Government proposes to build
a Teaching Materials Production Center in Tananarive. This Center would also
assist Regional Education Centers in each provincial capital outside Tananarive
in the production of prototype materials for use in primary schools. These
developments are designed to improve educational quality and should be comple-
mented by increasing the frequency of inspectorate visits to schools and by
the provision of other fundamental teaching aids such as books.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Objectives
34.       The proposed project would assist the Government to decentralize
educational control and to improve the quality of basic education. The
project's emphasis is on institution building and quality improvement rather
than expansion, though by training National Servicemen as teachers the pro-
posed project will provide for an increase in primary education enrollments.
A Staff Project Report entitled "Second Education Project in Madagascar" (No.
1174a-MAG) dated October 19, 1976 is being circulated separately. A Credit
and Project Summary is provided as Annex III of this report.



- 10 -
35.       Specifically, the proposed project would include:
(a) the provision of buildings, furniture and equipment
for the following institutions:
i) five Regional Education Centers, together with vehicles for
the school inspectorate; and
ii) one National Teaching Materials Production Center;
(b) textbook development;
(c) technical assistance for:
i) the National Teaching Materials Production Center
in its initial operating stages;
ii) the statistical section of the Ministry of Education;
iii) project evaluation; and
(d) pre-investment studies for future projects.
36.       The proposed project was identified by an IDA mission which visited
Madagascar in March/April 1974 to review educational development plans and
priorities. The project was prepared by the Government with assistance
from UNESCO, and the project was appraised by IDA missions in December 1975
and June 1976. Negotiations were held in Washington from September 15 to
September 17, 1976. The Malagasy delegation was led by Mr. Henri Raharijaona,
Madagascar's Ambassador to France.
Five Regional Education Centers
37.       The Ministry of Education is represented in each of the regional
capitals by a Regional Education Service, dealing mainly with primary educa-
tion and handling such matters as accounts, audio-visual education, bur-
saries, counselling, and enforcement of education regulations. As a part
of its decentralization plans, the Government intends to upgrade these Ser-
vices into Regional Education Centers (Centres Academiques Provinciaux), which
would in addition assume responsibility for other levels and types of education
in the Regions (Section 3.02, draft Development Credit Agreement). The main
advantages which are expected from this decentralization include: (i) a more
rapid and relevant response to regional needs, and (ii) better coordination at
the local level with other services such as health and agriculture. The
definition of the functions and responsibilities of the Regional Education
Centers in a Decree by the Ministry of Education would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section 5.01(a), draft Development
Credit Agreement).
38.       In a country of Madagascar's size and diversity, this decentraliza-
tion of educational administration is essential to carry out the programs for
expansion of basic education through community efforts, to plan for the



- 11 -
training and deployment of the National Servicemen and to provide them with
adequate professional support and advice. The Government has recently com-
pleted a broad outline of its plans for educational decentralization, and
has agreed, within one year of signing the Development Credit Agreement,
to provide detailed implementation proposals to the Association, including
information on the autonomy of its provincial services and future teacher
appointments (Section 4.03, draft Development Credit Agreement).
39.       The project would provide accommodation for a Regional Education
Center in each regional capital outside Tananarive - i.e., in Diego Suarez,
Fianarantsoa, Majunga, Tamatave and Tulear. Each Center would also provide
120 places for training lower secondary school certificate holders as teachers
in fulfillment of their National Service obligations; 60 percent of the Center
facilities would be for teacher training and 40 percent for administration.
The training would last three months and be given by educational counsellors/
inspectors who have already been given special instruction in the aims and
methods of the reform at seminars held in Tananarive. In-service courses for
existing teachers would be given during school vacations. A workshop would be
included in the facilities where training would be given in making simple
primary school teaching aids from locally available materials.
40.       There are 95 sub-prefectures responsible for day-to-day school
supervision and inspection. They are administered by school districts under
the direction of the Regional Education Services. The sub-prefectures have
inadequate transportation facilities and the project would supply one vehicle
for each of them in order to increase the number of school visits. An
improvement in the inspectorate back-up services to the schools would rein-
force the implementation of the educational reform, and help the National
Service teachers, who would have had only 3 months of training.
National Teaching Materials Production Center
41.       The great majority of the 126 public secondary schools in Madagascar
lack the equipment necessary to teach scientific and practical subjects.
Imported equipment is expensive and often oversophisticated. Based on costs
of imported equipment, it is estimated that to equip the schools reasonably
would cost about US$5 million equivalent, and annual equipment replacement
costs would be US$500,000. By producing equipment locally as far as possible,
these costs could be reduced by up to 50 percent. The proposed project would
build in Tananarive a National Teaching Materials Production Center, including
an adequate machine shop, electrical shop and fitting facilities to enable a
wide range of scientific equipment to be manufactured. The Center would be
designed so that, after experience is gained, it could be expanded to meet the
needs of all the secondary schools, including private schools. The Center
would provide facilities for training teachers in the use of the equipment and
new accommodation for the Curriculum Research and Development Bureau of the
Ministry of Education. It would also design primary school equipment and make
prototypes with instruction sheets for distribution to the Regional Education
Centers. The National Teaching Materials Production Center was legally
established in September 1976.



- 12 -
42.       The Government has agreed that the Center will be adequately
staffed and provided with sufficient funds for the purchase of materials
and general operations (Section 3.03, draft Development Credit Agreement).
Technical assistance in the setting up and during the initial operations of
the Center is essential and the proposed project would include finance for
a 6-man technical assistance team. It may not be necessary to seek all of
these experts abroad as some of Madagascar's light engineering industries
already employ suitably experienced persons who could fill the required
positions. The Government has agreed that qualified experts will be employed
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association (Section 3.06, draft
Development Credit Agreement). The appointment of the production/industrial
engineer and the design expert of the technical assistance team would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section 5.01 (b), draft
Development Credit Agreement). Fellowships to train Malagasy staff abroad
would also be provided under the proposed project.
Textbook Development
43.       With regard to teaching aids, primary schools in tadagascar are
even more poorly equipped than secondary schools: most of them lack books,
pencils and paper. A new basic education curriculum has been developed
and is presently being adapted into syllabus material, student and teacher
guides, which will be given a more permanent textbook form after an experi-
mental period. The project would supply part of the paper needed for this
work and would help the institutions with textbook development and distribu-
tion by providing adequate premises for the Curriculum Research and Devel-
opment Bureau and transport to the schools: over the period of the project
some four million student guides and textbooks would be produced in Malagasy
for the main subject areas of Malagasy, mathematics, environmental studies
and practical work. The texts would be written by qualified staff under the
supervision of the Curriculum Research and Development Bureau and printed
by the educational books section of the National Press, which has excel-
lent printing and book production equipment. The printed material would be
delivered to schools by educational counsellors/inspectors, who would also
instruct the teachers in its use.
Educational Statistics, Planning and Evaluation
44.       Educational planning in Madagascar suffers from an inadequate
base, both in regard to educational statistics and to information on the
numbers, types and locations of school buildings. The project would provide
technical assistance to help rationalize the system within the framework of
the Government's decentralization plans. It would also provide funds for the
ongoing evaluation of the project and for visits by government staff concerned
with the project to other countries whose experience would be relevant to the
Madagascar situation. The Government has confirmed that proposals for the
evaluation studies regarding the administration and management of the education
sector at the provincial level, school curricula and the Government's teacher
training program for the National Servicemen will be prepared and sent to the
Association for review within 12 months of signing the Development Credit
Agreement (Section 3.07, draft Development Credit Agreement).

Project Cost and Financing
45.       The total estimated cost of the proposed project is US$17.5 million
equivalent, excluding taxes estimated at US$1.8 million, with a foreign ex-
change component of US$9.1 million. The proposed IDA credit of US$14 million
would finance 80 percent of the total project cost net of taxes and would
cover the entire foreign exchange cost and US$4.9 million of local expenditures.
The Government would finance the remaining project cost. A summary cost table
and the proposed financing plan are as follows:

Project Implementation
46.       A project implementation unit has been set up in the Ministry of
Public Works. At full strength, it would comprise a director, a construc-
tion coordinator and an education liaison officer, and adequate supporting
staff (Section 3.04, draft Development Credit Agreement). The director,
construction coordinator and education liaison officer have already been
appointed. Madagascar-based architectural consultants have been appointed.
Sketch designs for the Regional Eduction Centers have been reviewed by the



- 14 -
Association. The consultants are preparing final designs and will also be
responsible for the supervision of construction. Sketch design for the
National Teaching Materials Production Center will be prepared after the
recruitment of technical assistance personnel for the planning and operation
of the center.
Procurement and Disbursements
47.       Contracts for civil works, furniture, equipment and materials,
including paper, costing more than US$50,000 equivalent would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding. Contracts costing less
than US$50,000 equivalent would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding procedures, which have been reviewed by the Association and are
considered satisfactory. The aggregate amount of these contracts is not
expected to exceed US$500,000 equivalent and the Association's review of
tender evaluation documents in respect of such contracts prior to award would
not be necessary. Items would be grouped under arrangements satisfactory to
the Association so as to encourage competition and bulk procurement. Where
international competitive bidding procedures are used, qualified domestic
civil works contractors would be allowed a margin of preference of 7-1/2
percent over the tender prices of competitors, and domestic manufacturers of
furniture and equipment would be allowed a preference of 15 percent, or the
existing rate of customs duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of
competing suppliers.
48.       Disbursements would be made on the basis of (a) 65 percent of total
expenditures for civil works; (b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for
directly imported furniture, instructional equipment, vehicles and materials;
100 percent of ex-factory cost of these items when locally manufactured; or 80
percent of local expenditures when otherwise procured locally; (c) 100 percent
of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local expenditures for technical
assistance, fellowships and project evaluation; (d) 80 percent of total
administrative and operational expenditures; and (e) 80 percent of total
expenditures for architectural engineering consultants' services. Disburse-
ments would be fully documented, except disbursements for (d). These would be
against certificates of expenditures, documentation for which would not be
submitted for review, but would be retained by the borrower and be available
for inspection by the Association during the course of project supervision.
49.       Retroactive reimbursement of a sum not exceeding US$200,000 equiva-
lent for expenditures approved by the Association and incurred after March 1,
1976 is recommended for: (i) the services of consultant architects for the
preparation of sketch plans for the project institutions; (ii) Project Unit
expenditures; and (iii) technical assistance for the National Teaching Mate-
rials Production Center (Schedule 1, paragraph 4, draft Development Credit
Agreement).

Benefits and Risks
50.       Fundamental changes must be made in the content of education and
its delivery if the educational and training system of Madagascar is to meet
the needs of mass participation in development. The emphasis of the proposed
project is on helping implement these changes. Educational quality and
relevance at the primary level would be provided by training facilities for
National Service teachers, whose employment would enable the excessive number
of pupils per teacher to be reduced, and by assisting inspectorate visits to
schools and the production of new curricula and textbooks. Secondary edu-
cation would be improved by encouraging the local production of equipment and
by training teachers in its use. The local administration of education would
be assisted by the provision of decentralized facilities. The proposed
project would train some 1,800 National Service teachers a year, or 20 percent
of the total number required; it would provide a textbook and student guide in
each main study area for about one million primary pupils and about half the
estimated equipment needs of secondary schools in Madagascar.
51.       The principal risks relate to an incomplete definition of the
Government's plans for educational decentralization and to its lack of expe-
rience in managing a teaching materials production center. There is a risk
that the teaching facilities in the regional education centers may, for
instance, be used for administrative purposes, and that the materials pro-
duction center would function inefficiently. Attempts have been made to
minimize these risks by requesting the Government to furnish detailed pro-
posals for the implementation of the decentralization plans (see para. 38
above) and by providing technical assistance for the production center. In
addition all items will be monitored closely.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of Madagascar and the Association, the Recommendation of the Com-
mittee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed
credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
53.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the usual pat-
tern of agreements on education projects. Special conditions of the project
are listed in Section III of Annex IV of this Report. The definition of the
functions and responsibilities of the Regional Education Centers in an Arrete
of the Ministry of Education (Section 5.01 (a), draft Development Credit
Agreement), as well as the appointment of the production/industrial engineer



- 16 -
and the design expert of the technical assistance team for the National
Teaching Materials Production Center (Section 5.01 (b), draft Development
Credit Agreement)are additional conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
credit.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 200-MAG - Tamatave Port Project; US$9.6 million credit of June 19,
1970; Date of Effectiveness: November 27, 1970; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977; US$1.8 million supplementary credit
of July 30, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: December 15,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project originally consisted of port extension, purchase of
cargo handling equipment, construction of a tanker terminal, and provision
of consultancy services for engineering and supervision, and technical assis-
tance. The project encountered severe cost overruns, which in 1973 led to a
supplementary IDA credit. All physical components of the project have been
completed with the exception of the tanker terminal which was considered no
longer justified because of substantial increases in costs. The Government
accordingly decided to delete this item from the project and asked the Asso-
ciation to use the available balance of the credit to finance the provision
of additional cargo handling equipment and technical assistance. A recommen-
dation to that effect was circulated to the Executive Directors on October 8,
1976 (IDA/R76-78). Organizationally, the Port Authority is still weak, and
operating results continue to show losses. Measures will have to be taken
by the Government to improve the present situation, and the Association is
following this matter closely.
Credit No. 322-MAG - Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Project;
US$15.3 million credit of June 30, 1972; Date of
Effectiveness: April 30, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
The project as appraised consisted of the rehabilitation and
extension of existing irrigation systems and aimed at increasing the pro-
duction of rice, the establishment of a large state farm for tobacco,
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the solutions taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

groundnuts and forage, and one for irrigated cotton with forage, as well
as the construction and extension of villages, roads, schools and health
facilities. Since the date of the Credit Agreement, the costs of imple-
menting the original project have tripled, while agricultural production
forecasts have decreased substantially. The increase in costs is primarily
due to worldwide inflation and to calculation of original cost estimates for
the construction of the major civil works on the basis of preliminary engi-
neering, then a common practice. Detailed engineering studies indicated
that the cost of civil works was more than four times original estimates.
Plans for agricultural development were modified significantly to take
account of field trial experience.
In October 1975 the Government and the Association agreed to a
number of changes in the project to reflect new factors concerning the
agricultural development potential in the project area and high cost over-
runs, particularly on the contract for the major civil works. This will
allow the completion of most of the major civil works, and initial agricul-
tural development over about one half of the area originally projected.
The Executive Directors were informed of the changes through a Memorandum
from the President, dated December 24, 1975 (Ref. TDA/SecM75-305).
Credit No. 351-MAG - Third Highways Project; US$15 million credit and US$15
Loan No. 876-MAG      million loan of January 17, 1973; Date of Effectiveness:
April 17, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977; US$5.6
million supplementary credit of September 24, 1975; Date
of Effectiveness: February 15, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The major components of the project are construction works on
about 350 km of primary roads in the central part of the country and con-
sulting services for detailed engineering of a further 200 km of primary
roads. Considerable project cost increases have been experienced as a
result of price escalation and currency realignments but physical progress
and quality of construction works under the project are generally satisfac-
tory. To help the Government in meeting part of the cost overruns, the
Association approved in September 1975 a supplemental credit of US$5.6
million. At that time, it was agreed to delete one of the roads (RN1
between Arivonimamo and Analavory) from the project and to include financing
for its construction in the Fourth Highway Project.
Credit No. 488-MAG - Railway Project: US$6.0 million credit of June 27,
1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 26, 1974;
Closing Date: July 31, 1978
The project is assisting in financing part of the Malagasy Rail-
ways 1973-75 investment program, services of consultants to improve the
railways' management and operations, and technical assistance to strengthen
the planning cell of the Ministry of Transport. Procurement has been de-
layed about a year, and the closing date has been extended correspondingly.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 5 pages
Because of cost overruns the Association is financing only 4 of 20 passenger
coaches originally included in the project, and 35 of 50 freight wagons. The
Caisse Centrale of France is financing a further 11 coaches. Phase I of the
management consultants' study (by SOFRERAIL of France) has been satisfactorily
completed. The railways are currently incurring financial losses, and the
Government is considering the increase of tariffs. Technical assistance to
the Ministry of Transport began in 1975 with the arrival of an international
team of experts, including a Bank staff member on secondment, and is due to
end early in 1977.
Credit No. 506-MAG - Village Livestock and Rural Development Project:
US$9.6 million credit of August 21, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: June 17, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
The four-year project will assist traditional livestock in about
2,000 villages and provide rural infrastructure. In Majunga province,
FAFIFAMA, a parastatal agency, will develop livestock extension services,
improve pasture on about 10,000 ha, construct about 300 water points,
improve and maintain rural roads, construct village schools, and provide
mobile health units. Pilot community development, beef share fattening,
and pig programs are provided in the middle west. Technical assistance,
training and future project preparation are included. By its very nature
this is a complex project and difficult to implement. It involves comple-
mentary activities in several sectors, in large, sparsely-populated areas
with exceptionally poor communications. FAFIFAMA is a new organization,
with no staff with significant project or administrative experience. Two
Government pilot programs (OMBY and ODEMO) related to the project face
managerial and financial difficulties.
Project implementation is seriously delayed and major legal and
organizational problems must be resolved before the project can progress.
Pasture, water and road development have not yet begun, but efforts to improve
veterinary services are encouraging. In March 1976 the Government decided to
merge FAFIFAMA with OVOMA, a beef fattening company operating in Majunga, and
enacted fundamental changes in the statutes of FAFIFAMA which could seriously
endanger the project's chances of success. The impact of these changes is
being reviewed with Government, with a view to arriving at a mutually agreeable
solution. In addition, policies towards the livestock sector, particularly in
respect of cattle marketing and pricing of meat and live cattle are a cause of
concern and will also be reviewed with Government.
Credit No. 525-MAG - Forestry Project; US$6.75 million loan and US$6.75
Loan No. 1065-MAG     million credit both of December 23, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: July 8, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists in the planting of 35,000 ha of pine plantations
as part of an overall planting program of 96,000 ha, which will eventually
supply a pulp mill to provide pulp for export. While the planting program is



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 5 pages
progressing according to the schedule, the project faces some technical
problems, and cost estimates are likely to be exceeded because of inflation,
a reorganization of the project which entails more building and infrastructure
than originally estimated, and the need for more intensive soil preparation
than foreseen at appraisal. It is still too early for an accurate estimate
of the cost increases.
Credit No. 641-MAG - Fourth Highways Project; US$22.0 million credit of
June 23, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: August 19, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The credit became effective on August 19, 1976. The project assists
the Government in the construction of two major roads with a view to reducing
transport costs and providing access to areas with a high agricultural potential.
It also includes training and strengthening of the country's road maintenance
organization. Implementation has begun satisfactorily.

Procurement
Arrangements:     Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment
would be awarded on the basis of international com-
petitive bidding, except for furniture and equipment
contracts costing less than US$50,000 equivalent,
which would be awarded on the basis of local compe-
titive bidding procedures, which have been reviewed
by the Association and are satisfactory. The aggre-
gate amount of these contracts is not expected to
exceed US$500,000 equivalent and the Association's
review of tender evaluation documents in respect of
such contracts prior to award would not be neces-
sary. Where international competitive bidding
procedures are used (i) qualified domestic civil
works contractors would be allowed a margin of
preference of 7-1/2 percent over the tender prices
of competitors; and (ii) domestic manufacturers of
furniture and equipment would be allowed a prefer-
ence of 15 percent, or the existing rate of customs
duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of
competing suppliers.
Consultant
Services:         The project will provide for about 20 man-years of
architectural and engineering services. Consultants
have been appointed.
