sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. Following are some of\n            the lessons learned: Government ownership and continued\n            political commitment are critical for the successful\n            implementation of major policy reforms. Using existing\n            administrative agencies (as opposed to a separate Project\n            Implementation Unit), ensures smooth project implementation\n            and long-term sustainability, provided the choice of\n            agencies is accompanied by commensurate capacity-building,\n            and an effective coordination mechanism. Full upfront\n            commitment of key local agencies is paramount for effective\n            decentralized education management and implementation.\n            Establishing an effective monitoring and data collection\n            system at project start is vital to the successful\n            monitoring and evaluation of project achievements and\n            outcomes. The disruption to project implementation caused by\n            the succession of four Ministers and five Secretaries, apart\n            from staff changes at lower levels, during the life of the\n            project highlighted the importance of keeping key\n            decision-makers at their posts as long as possible.\n            Recruitment from the outset of qualified staff for key\n            positions is paramount for ensuring strong and consistent\n            project implementation progress."}, "docdt": "2006-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
