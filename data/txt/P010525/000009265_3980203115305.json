There are nine\n            components: 1) curriculum development, which prepares a\n            strategy implementing a sequential and cyclical curriculum\n            in all subjects for grades 1-9, improves curriculum\n            management, and trains teachers; 2) textbooks/educational\n            publications, which improve textbook content and physical\n            condition, allow re-use and a multiple textbook option,\n            increase private sector printing, and continue private\n            sector delivery; 3) school facilities rationalization, which\n            increases equitable and cost-effective allocation of\n            educational facilities and libraries; 4) quality inputs,\n            which supply educational materials and equipment matching\n            the curriculum for elementary and junior high schools; 5)\n            libraries (component), which provides books, shelves,\n            resource materials, furniture, and trained staff in library\n            management; 6) education management and planning, which\n            upgrades planning capacity and develops national,\n            provincial, and institutional plans, strengthens quality\n            assurance and financing mechanisms, and defines policies and\n            lines of authorities; 7) education financing, which\n            implements a formula to improve resource allocation, trains\n            staff, and allocates management tools and equipment; 8)\n            impact analysis studies; and 9) project coordination."}, "docdt": "1997-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
