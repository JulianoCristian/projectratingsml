The performance of the Societe Beninoise\n            d'Electricite et d'Eau has not been improved. The\n            lessons drawn from this project include: 1) A performance\n            contract may be an adequate instrument for promoting\n            management autonomy. Experience has shown time that\n            governments have great difficulty refraining from\n            interfering in the management of their utilities. Political\n            changes may bring about increased interference, as a new\n            government is often keen on replacing mangers of public\n            enterprises. 2) A well functioning billing system is the\n            backbone of an electricity distribution company. 3)\n            Coordination and consultation with donors is vital to the\n            success of a jointly financed project and for the\n            achievement of project's objectives. 4) Regional\n            cooperation, including pooling arrangements, and common\n            norms and standards, can help reduce cost to utilities and\n            improve system reliability."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
