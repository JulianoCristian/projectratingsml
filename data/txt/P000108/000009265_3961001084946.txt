MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNAMIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A POWER REHABILITATION AND EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Benin for an equivalent of US$15
million on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance
improvements and investment requirements of the power system and
strengthening of Socidtd Bdninoise d'Electricite et d'Eau (SBEE). The
project would be cofinanced by France's Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE).
2.        Background.  Public electricity supply in Benin is the
responsibility of SBEE. SBEE operates generation, transmission and
distribution facilities at 6 centers throughout the country. Its major
market is in the southern *Atlantiqueg region, particularly Cotonou, where
about 34,000 customers are served. The energy distributed by SBEE in the
southern region is bought from the Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB),
the Togo/Benin joint power generation and transmission company (para. 3).
Besides its distribution facilities, SBEE has a diesel plant in downtown
Cotonou with about 26 MVA available on a standby basis. Inland, SBEE's
effective plant capacity totals about 19 MVA, composed of isolated diesel
units. The inland market serves about 23,000 domestic customers, whose
consumption accounts for less than 20S of total national consumption.
SEEK's headquarters are located in Cotonou. Total staff is about 1,100,
including 60 management personnel. Overall financial performance has been
satisfactory over the past few years, but significant further improvement
is expected, particularly in system operations and consumer administration.
3.        In 1968, the States of Togo and Benin concluded a treaty
creating CEB. It has been operational since 1971 and its role has been
largely that of wholesale supplier of electricity, purchased from the Volta
River Authority (VRA) in Ghana, for sale to the national power utilities of
Benin and Togo which, in turn, distribute it to retail consumers. CEB's
system consists of a 161 kV transmission line from Ghana's Akosombo
hydroelectric plant. Since late 1987, CEB also has had the Nangbeto
hydroelectric scheme (60 KW, 150 GWh), which was partly financed by IDA.
Nangbeto is the first of two, possibly three, sites which could eventually
be developed to harness the hydroelectric potential of the Mono river.
4.        Project Description.  The proposed project consists of: (a) the
detailed engineering, rehabilitation and extension of the Cotonou, Porto
Novo and Abomey/Bohicon distribution systems, including civil works and
equipment (poles, cables, transformers, meters, etc.); and (b) a program of
institutional strengthening for SBEE, with appropriate technical assistance
and training, based on the findings of a diagnostic study financed under
PPF P-560-BEN. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$36.5
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$31.2 million
(85Z). The breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procuremenk and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group cperations in the Republic
of Benin are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.



-2-
S.        Pro1ect Implementation.  SBEE would be responsible for
Lmplementing the project. SBEE has a good record as an executing agency
and we are satisfied that agreed arrangements will ensure effective project
Implementation. It should also be noted that SBEE is implementing an
Jrterim emergency program for Cotonou, recently launched under the Second
Water Project (Credit 1721-BEN) and PPF P-560-BEN.
6.        Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project is a logical follow-up
to IDA's past involvement in the sector. Its main purposes are to: (a)
strengthen all facets of SBEE's management and operations through internal
reorganization, technical assistance and training programs; (b) improve the
external environment for SBEE so that it operates as an autonomous entity
without undue government interference; and (c) rehabilitate and expand
SEEK's plant, particularly the distribution systems in the Cotonou, Porto
Novo and Abomey/Bohicon areas. This would improve reliability, reduce
losses, generate additional sales and thus contribute to maintaining and
improving SBEE's finances. It would also enable SBEE to generate
sufficient internal resources to cover at least the local costs of its
investment program.
7.        Project Design and Lessons learned.  The project builds on work
done under the earlier Engineering & Technical Assistance (1189-BEN/1190-
TO) and Nangbeto (1507-BEN/1508-TO) Projects. Studies under these projects
indicated a need to strengthen SBEE and to rehabilitate and extend
Cotonou's distribution system, conslusions which were subsequently re-
confirmed under the UNDP Energy Assessment Report, issued in June 1985.
Preparatory work by SBEE extended over a two-year period and was financed
by a PPF and CCCE. IDA maintains parallel programs in power in Benin and
Togo and this project is similar to one which became effective in Togo
(Credit 2171-TO), earlier this fiscal year. Conditionality is similar in
these two operations as befits their regional perspective.   Lessons
learned from previous IDA involvement have led to setting clear criteria
for the respective roles of Government and the entity concerned. In line
with OED's findings and recommendations, the project also emphasizes the
neid for both short- and longer-run institution building, close cooperation
with the implementing entity and a flexible training program and technical
assistance. All parties involved are fully committed to this project and
have already taken key decisions.
8.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the
power sector in Bonin and Togo dates back to 1978 when IDA acted as
executing agency for a UhDP-financed power development study. This study
identified the Nangbeto Project as the least-cost source of power supply to
be implemented as a regional project by both Bonin and Togo and to be owned
by CEB, with the Bank acting as Chef de file f .r donor coordination. IDA
is still the lead donor in the sector in both countries and its continued
involvement at the national level provides the means of reinforcing not
only the power sector, but also the SAL process in Benin, with emphasis on
efficient public investment, parastatal reform and financial stabilization.
Finally, further IDA support for the power sectors of BEnin and Togo is a
key element in the strategy of promoting regional cooperation among the
electric utilities in West Africa.

9.        Aireed Actions.  Dxring negotiations, agreement was reached ont
(a) annual consultation on SBEE's investment plans (b) adequate autonomy
and performance criteria for SBEE to be reflected in an agreed performance
contract; (c) revision of SBEE's statutes and tlmetable for the
Implementation of the recommendations of the diagnostic study; and td)
annual budgets of government departments and public entities to include
sufficient provision to cover the.r cost for electricity consumption, ane
future bills to be paid within three months of presentation; concerning
private customers, SBEE to ensure that their credit will not exceed three
months. Conditions of Credit effectiveness would be: (i) signature of the
performance contract between GOB and SBEE; (ii) finalization of the
relending agreement between GOB and SBZEg (iii) effectiveness of CCCE's
Loan; and (iv) establishment of a Project Management Unit. Execution of
SBEE's 'Statut du Personnel would be a condition of disbursement of the
training component.
10.       Environmental Aspects and Program Objective Categories.  The
project does not raise any significant environmental issue as confirmed by
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EZA) prepared by the design engineers.
Agreement on the action plan for measures resulting from the EIA was
reached at negotiations.  The project is not designed specifically within
IDA's antipoverty strategy but it does contribute by generating employment
and income opportunities and supports the creation of small businesses,
including outside the capital area, by making power available in previously
uneerviced areas. Moreover, power tariffs are designed to provide a
minimal "life line* supply for low income families. Finally, it addresses
public sector development through strengthening of public agencies and
emphasizes commercial operations.
11.       Prolect Benefits.  The project would help streamline SBZE,
improve its operational efficiency, as well as restore and strengthen its
distribution capability. Expected benefits would include a more reliable
distribution system providing improved infrastructure for industrial
development, and greater access to power by the country's population. The
rate of return of the project is 202.
12.       Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the proposed
pro3ject. The main risk would be the Government's and/or SBEE's
unwillingness to make the proposed institutional changes; given the
Government's and SBEE's commitment to strengthening the power sector, and
more generally to the SAL program of institutional strengthening, this risk
is considered minimal.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve it.
