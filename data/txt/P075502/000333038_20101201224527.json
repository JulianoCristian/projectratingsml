Some lessons learned included: the\n            performance based, disbursement oriented project design for\n            Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) production closure proved to be\n            very well designed and successful. This approach enabled\n            PRODUVEN (Productos Halogenados de Venezuela, C.A). to\n            flexibly arrange for its own implementation procedures,\n            which at the end were less costly and more efficient. An\n            integrated approach for capacity building ensures that\n            conversion to non- Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS)\n            technologies is sustainable and prevents a recurrence of ODS\n            use over the long term. Training on the control of illegally\n            trades ODS should cover all the relevant institutions, for\n            this reason, the project provided training to officers from\n            the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, as well as customs\n            staff. Customs were also equipped to accurately detect\n            imports of ODS. As to complementary actions, a public\n            information campaign, a study of the market effects of the\n            phase-out, information management systems, and control\n            systems, also contributed towards achieving the targets\n            sustainably. In addition, by establishing a well managed and\n            enforced ODS Import Licensing System, Government of\n            Venezuela (GoV) was able to set import quotas according to\n            the ODS phase-out targets. These levels of imports, coupled\n            with the industrial conversion, proved the need to\n            collaborate amongst sectors (i.e., industry and commerce) to\n            ensure compliance and sustainability. An institutional\n            analysis should have taken place before the implementation\n            of this program to have information on the existing\n            weaknesses and incorporate into the project design specific\n            mechanisms to tackle with these issues."}, "docdt": "2010-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
