1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design


1.       The objective of the Venezuela's Ozone Depleting Substances Phase-out Project
was to enable, by the end of 2006, the phase-out of CFC production in Venezuela,
through a compensation program for profit losses, accompanied by the enforcing of
institutional and legal mechanisms. The Project financed the phase-out of Venezuela's
production of CFC-11 and CFC-12, in the context of country's commitments under the
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The total amount of
CFCs phased-out was 4,400 metric tons.

2.     In 2004, the MLF ExCom approved a total amount of US $16.5 million for the
CFC production sector alone, of which US $450,000 was allocated to FONDOIN for the
implementation of technical assistance activities associated with the production sector
closure. Additional US $500,000 were allocated for the implementation of a chiller
replacement program under the UNIDO-Venezuela National CFC Phase-out Plan to be
implemented by the World Bank.

3.     Two Grant Agreements were signed under this Project: (i) one between the Bank
and PRODUVEN, for the enterprise compensation of US$16.05 million; and (ii) another
between the Bank and FONDOIN for the Chillers replacement program and the
Technical assistance component, for a total amount of US$0.95 million. Disbursements
under the Grant Agreements were subject to the final approval of fund tranches by the
MLF Executive Committee.

4.      The financing for the UNIDO's program was approved in tranches and based on
the priority given to the agreed activities. By the closing of the Project, the MLF
Executive Committee had not approved the financing for the chillers program, therefore,
it was not implemented by the Bank. When the project closed, the main component
related to the Phase-out plan was fully completed, representing 97% of the financing
approved for the Bank. Additional limitation for the implementation of the chillers
programs is further explained sin Section 1.4.

5.    The sections below describe the country context at appraisal and the objectives,
components, and main outcomes of this operation.


1.1 Context at Appraisal

6.     The Montreal Protocol (MP) on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was
adopted in 1987, as an international treaty to eliminate the production and consumption
of ozone-depleting chemicals including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, carbon
tetrachloride (CTC), methyl chloroform (TCA), and methyl bromide (MeBr). Scientific
theory and evidence suggest that these compounds, once emitted to the atmosphere,
could significantly deplete the stratospheric ozone layer that shields the planet from

                                                                                     1
damaging ultraviolet radiation. Under this treaty, developed countries must have phased-
out ODS by the year 2000 (2005 for TCA and MeBr). Developing countries, also known
as Article 5 countries in the context of the protocol, benefit from a 10-year grace period.
Table 1 below shows the phase out schedule for Article 5 countries.

7.     The Republic of Venezuela ratified the Montreal Protocol on February 6, 1989,
and the London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments in 2003, 1997, 2001
and 2006 respectively. Venezuela has been classified as a country operating under
Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Protocol and as such is eligible for financial support from
the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol (hereafter the
"Fund" or `MLF'), to cover the incremental costs of meeting Protocol requirements. As
can be seen in the table below, under the Montreal Protocol, Venezuela was to reduce
consumption of CFCs by 50% in 2005, and completely cease consumption by 2010.

8.     These groups represent the different types or categories of consumed ODS. Since
Venezuela´s annual calculated level of consumption of controlled substances listed in
Annex A of the Montreal Protocol was less than 0.3 Kg, per capita, it fell under
paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol, and therefore qualified for financial and
technical assistance, including transfer of technologies, through the financial mechanism
of the Protocol, in order to permit compliance with the control measures of the Protocol.

 ODS Phase out Institutional Structure and Project Background

  9.     In Venezuela, FONDOIN ("Fundación Fondo Venezolano de Reconversión
  Industrial y Tecnológica") was established as the National Ozone Unit (NOU) and has
  since been responsible for implementing the Montreal Protocol. Venezuela was one of
  the first countries to start implementation of the Protocol. In 1992 at its 6th meeting, the
  EXCOM approved the preparation of Venezuela's Country Program (CP), where the
  country strategy to implement the Montreal Protocol was initially set out. Under such
  program, which was oriented to early phase out of ODS consumption at the large
  companies, the Bank had completed a number of operations in the foam, chiller and
  refrigeration sectors in Venezuela. In 1992, the 7th EXCOM approved a grant amount of
  US$ 1,261,678 to implement the conversion of a CFC­12 polystyrene foam production

                                                                                                   3
 facility to the use of hydrocarbons as blowing agent at Plasticos Molanca. Later, the
 Bank implemented two small grants for chiller retrofits at Clinica Atlas (US$ 115,000)
 and Instituto de Prevencion Social del Medico (US$ 69,000). These operations were
 later followed by two Bank-assisted operations in the Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC)
 sub sector: a) Fabrica de Aparatos de Aire Acondicionado S.A. (FAACA); and b) Aire
 Acondicionado Integral S.A. (AAISA) for grant amounts of US$ 3,100,000 and US$
 4,420,000, respectively. In these latter projects, in addition to retooling of the fabrication
 line, the grants covered related training, technical assistance and licensing fees for
 transfer of technical data and design specifications.

 10. In addition, prior 2004, Venezuela implemented at least 35 projects before 2004,
 through grants to the companies undertaking the industrial conversion process needed to
 eliminate CFC consumption. These projects were broken down as follows: 3 were
 bilateral with the United Stated Environmental Protection Agency, 10 with UNDP as the
 implementing agency and 22 with UNIDO.

 11. The importance of this project relies on the fact that the country was able to come
 to a total closure of CFC production sector and consumption, as part of the National
 Phase-out Strategy. The National Phase-out Strategy is country specific, this means that
 each country which will qualify for this type of assistance will have a unique framework
 in face of ODS phase-out. This approach ensures that the country is fully engaged in the
 final stages of ODS elimination and that its special circumstances which impact phase-
 out are fully addressed. In addition, the Strategy would provide flexibility in how
 governments phase out ODS, thereby allowing countries to decide how funding should
 be allocated while developing and strengthening their institutional capacities. This
 flexibility opens up possibilities for introducing innovative projects and conversion
 technologies. Finally, the Third, the Strategy would be comprehensive and absolute and
 would aim to address all remaining ODS consumption in a given country.


ODS Production and Consumption

12.    At the time of project appraisal, Venezuela produced an average of 2000 MT of
CFC-11 and CFC-12 annually at PRODUVEN's facility, which was consumed
domestically by the foam and refrigeration sectors. The table below shows CFC-11& 12
production and consumption data, for the period 1995-2004:

  Table 2: CFC-11 & 12 production and consumption figures in metric tons, 1995 - 2004

                                                                                             4
13. With regards to CFC consumption, refrigeration servicing (mobile air
conditioning, domestic, industrial, and commercial refrigeration, as well as chillers)
represented almost 80% of the country's total CFC annual consumption at the time of
project preparation. With support from MLF, Venezuela had begun to phase out
remaining ODS consumption in 1994 under its National Country Program for Phase-out
of Ozone Depleting Substances. With this program, most of the consumption would be
addressed.

14. Prior to the implementation of this project, PRODUVEN was the only CFC
producing company in Venezuela, and one of the three facilities doing so in the
Americas. PRODUVEN has also produced HCFC-22 (CFC alternative chemical). This
project compensated PRODUVEN for the closure of their CFC production facility by
the end of 2006. The plant, located in Moron-Coro in the state of Carabobo, first started
commercial production in 1976. It was originally established as a joint venture between
Pequiven (then IVP, of Venezuela) and Atofina (then Elf Atochem, of France). In 2002,
Atofina sold its interest to GRUPO QUIMICO ENVIORTECH S.A. of Venezuela and
PRODUVEN became a fully owned Venezuelan company.

15.     The production of CFCs by PRODUVEN remained as the most important goal to
attain by the time the project was being prepared, since local production would keep
Venezuela's internal consumption supplied at relatively favorable prices, supported by
the GoV, World Bank and MLF efforts to reduce CFC consumption at local industries.
Moreover, PRODUVEN's capacity to export would affect the regional strategies for CFC
phase-out supported by the Bank and other MLF implementing agencies.

Rationale for Bank support

16.     The Bank had the experience and resources to respond to the GoV's requests for
assistance by combining policy advice, investment financing and financing of technical
assistance (TA). The Bank is recognized for its comparative advantage in ODS
production closure projects, including its ability to leverage the financing, its access to
leading technical expertise and because it was the first implementing agency to develop,
design and submit projects addressing ODS supply through a performance-based,
country-driven approach under the MLF.

1.2 Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as Approved)

17. The objective of the Project, as originally approved was to enable early phase-out
of CFC production in Venezuela (by the end of 2006), through a compensation program
for profit losses, accompanied by enforcing institutional and legal mechanisms. The
objective would be achieved through a cost-effective and efficient manner, without
harming industrial and economic growth or consumer interests in affected sectors.
Policies, incentives, technical assistance and awareness raising measures were used to
support and promote the phase-out of CFC production.

18. The project was approved by the Regional Vice President for Latin America, as
recommended by the Country Director. The project documentation did not require a
                                                                                         5
Project Appraisal Document (PAD), but a Memorandum of Director (MOD), which in
line with OP/BP 10.21 on Investment Operations financed by the MLF, intended to
simplify procedures for this type of grant operation, mostly consisting of a disbursement
schedule against performance of objectives.

19. The key indicators established for this project were mainly related to the
production levels attained by PRODUVEN as mandated by the following agreed CFC
production phase-out schedule:


                Calendar year              Production ceilings: maximum production allowed
                of production              per year (total CFCs in metric tons)

and Reasons/Justification

20.   The main original project objective, consisting of achieving early phase-out of
CFC production was not revised, and implementation was successful.


1.3 Main Beneficiaries, Original and Revised

21.     The main beneficiary of this grant was the global population, as the negative
effect over the stratospheric ozone layer was reduced. Global benefits resulted from the
elimination of ODS, as depletion of stratospheric ozone could lead to significant
increases in UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Increased ultraviolet radiation
could in turn lead to adverse human and animal health effects, as well as ecosystem
impacts. The ozone layer protects the biosphere from this type of radiation.

22.     The direct beneficiaries of this grant were (i) Venezuelan enterprise PRODUVEN
(94.5% of the resources); and (ii) FONDOIN as recipient of a technical assistance grant
to effect proper CFC production elimination (2.6% of funding),

1.4 Original Components (as Approved)

23.     The Project involved two main components as shown in the table below:

Table 3 ­ Project Components as originally approved
Component                        Indicative Costs (US Dollars)
Component 1:                                           16,050,000

                                                      17,000,000


24.   Two grant agreements were signed: i) Grant Agreement between the Bank and
FONDOIN for channeling the funds required for supporting the CFC production phase-
out component (USD 950,000); and ii) Grant Agreement between the Bank and
PRODUVEN, for USD 16,050,000, to make performance based disbursements, as the
ODS production closure progressed.




                                                                                      7
Component 1: CFC-11&12 Production Phase-Out (USD16,050,000)

25.     This component ensured that Venezuela's CFC production at PRODUVEN would
cease earlier than mandated by the Montreal Protocol, through a compensation program.
Additionally, this component ensured the GoV would have the capacity to monitor and
enforce the CFC production closure program in the long term. The agreed amount to be
phased-out under the Montreal Protocol was 4,400 tons.

26.     Prior to the implementation of this project, PRODUVEN was the only CFC
producing company in Venezuela, and one of the three facilities doing so in the Americas.
PRODUVEN has also produced HCFC-22 (CFC alternative chemical). This project
compensated PRODUVEN for the closure of their CFC production facility by the end of
2006. The plant, located in Moron-Coro in the state of Carabobo, first started commercial
production in 1976. It was originally established as a joint venture between Pequiven
(then IVP, of Venezuela) and Atofina (then Elf Atochem, of France). In 2002, Atofina
sold its interest to GRUPO QUIMICO ENVIORTECH S.A. of Venezuela and
PRODUVEN became a fully owned Venezuelan company.

27.      For this component, the Bank directly signed a Grant Agreement (GA) with
PRODUVEN, whereby a compensation of US$16.05 million was to be disbursed
according to compliance with pre-set production reduction levels. Funds were approved
by MLF on December 2004, at EXCOM's 44th meeting. As stated in the GA, funds were
to be payable directly to PRODUVEN in five annual tranches (2004-2008). This sub-
project grant package would compensate PRODUVEN for profit loss and for providing
labor compensation in case workers should be laid off due to CFC production closure.
PRODUVEN would gradually reduce production of CFCs, while keeping production of
HCFC-22. Remaining equipment not used for HCFC22 production would be dismantled
or destroyed by the end of 2006 (the date of completion of this component). Because
PRODUVEN was designed as a swing plant very little dismantlement was required for the
plant to function properly as an HCFC-22 unit.


ODS phase-out and disbursement plan

28.      The Project timetable below details the ending of CFC production in Venezuela
by the end of 2006. Funding was disbursed in installments in the exact amounts specified
in the table below (which are based on the performance-based agreement between the
MLF EXCOM and the GoV). The first payment was conditional upon effectiveness of the
Grant Agreement. Subsequent payments were made provided that the maximum
production ceilings had not been exceeded. The 2nd payment was also conditional upon
adoption of a satisfactory monitoring plan, and the 4th and 5th tranche were not paid until
approval or implementation of an equipment disposal plan satisfactory to the Bank.

Component 2: Technical Assistance for FONDOIN (US $ 450,000)


29.      This sub-component comprised activities related to CFC production phase-out,
including the design and implementation of policies and regulations, public awareness
campaigns, and proper auditing and enforcement of the CFC production closure program.
FONDOIN locally supervised the project's execution, together with the World Bank.
The responsibilities of FONDOIN included, inter-alia: (i) administration of payments to
individual consultants and firms for technical support in monitoring the CFC production
phase-out at PRODUVEN; (ii) management of the special account and of disbursements;
(iii) preparation of progress reports; and (iv) record keeping.

30.     Training activities involved GoV staff, including customs officers in the detection
of illegally traded ODS, and workshops for various participants in the Phase-out Plan,
with more intensive activities over the first two years of project implementation and some
additional training in the later years as relevant issues emerged. Provisions of training in
recovery and recycling of CFCs was also included.

31.     The project carried out two annual audits, comprising a financial audit for the
project account by an independent auditor and a performance (technical) audit of the
project itself to assess the country's compliance with the CFC phase-out commitments
under the Montreal Protocol.

32.      As a result of this component, FONDOIN accomplished the following:

      a) Proper contracting and monitoring of international audits, required to inform MLF
         of PRODUVEN's advancement with the CFC production phase-out program, and
         to trigger payments by the Bank according to the pre-set and agreed schedule.
         Audits verified production data logs, inventories of feed stocks and products
         (CFC & HCFC) at PRODUVEN.

                                                                                                       9
      b) Decree 4335 was enacted in 2006, setting limits for ODS production and imports
         starting 2007
      c) Customs received equipment and training to detect CFCs, and prevent illegal
         trading
      d) Public awareness materials were produced and published, including a video in
         2007, posters, brochures, and radio spots.


33.      Specifically, the following activities were completed under this component:

Chiller Replacement Program (USD 500,000)

34. This component involved setting up a national mechanism for the replacement of
chillers through the use of a revolving fund scheme. At its 42nd meeting in March of
2004, the EXCOM approved the National CFC Phase-Out Plan for Venezuela (NPP) to
be implemented by UNIDO, including the funding for the Chillers Replacement
Program. By the closing of the Project, the funding for this program has not been
approved by the MLF Executive Committee, therefore, it was not implemented by the
Project.

35. The Chiller Replacement Program would (a) characterize the criteria used by
chiller owners in the country in deciding to replace a chiller before the end of its
remaining lifetime (e.g., perceptions of regulatory pressure, financing constraints,
perceptions of electricity savings, performance and reliability, and environmental
effects); (b) develop a menu of financing options to test acceptability by various types of
chiller owners; (c) develop the incentive framework for chiller suppliers and installation
firms to provide integrated services and increase reliability and performance in terms of

                                                                                                   10
electricity savings; (d) provide financing to chiller owners to support the replacement of
units; (e) develop a monitoring and evaluation protocol; and (f) disseminate the
experience in Venezuela and elsewhere.

36. Due to internal market difficulties during the project implementation period, the
chiller replacement component could never get to a solid ground, due to the following
reasons:

         Restrains for foreign currency management during the project early phase made
         difficult for banks or other financial intermediaries to set up a revolving fund for
         acquiring imported chiller equipment for the project.
         In Venezuela there is no institution or program designed to promote and provide
         energy-saving equipment or monitor energy consumption in the medium to long
         term.
         Different to other MP grants received in the past, the chiller replacement
         component consisted of a revolving fund. This meant that final beneficiaries
         would not receive a grant, but a non-interest loan to partially fund a chiller
         equipment, which would be eventually paid out by the energy savings achieved.
         FONDOIN did not have experience in this type of projects.
         The main project component was performance based and was implemented and
         disbursed according to the agreed schedule in 2008.
         The USD 500,000 grant for this component was approved by MLF as part of the
         National ODS Phase-out Plan. Since this project was implemented by UNIDO,
         there was a lack of ownership and management maneuverability for the Bank staff
         in charge of implementing the project. Funds did not ever flow onto the Bank's
         account.


Revised Components

34.      The components were not revised over the implementation period.

1.6 Other Significant Changes

Not applicable.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Lessons learned were incorporated

35. Based on the Bank's experience in CFC production closure projects in China,
India and Argentina, the following lessons learned were incorporated into the design of
the project, contributing to its overall quality and success.

                                                                                          11
       With regards to the CFC Production Phase-out component, the most important
       lesson incorporated from other projects was that there was no need to dismantle
       the whole plant since PRODUVEN produced both CFC 11 & 12 as well as
       HCFC-22. The CFC reaction/purification equipment and related feedstock would
       be dismantled, while storage/handling equipment could be reconfigured to be
       used for HCFC-22 raw materials. Instruments, display meters, switches, storage
       tanks, etc, could be used elsewhere, as long as a record of such a disposal or
       transition was kept.

       To avoid past disagreements between the country and the MLF independent
       auditors' report on the remaining life of the plant, it was agreed beforehand that
       the compensation model would be based entirely on the parameters established by
       the MLF techno-economic audit.


Risks and Mitigation Measures

36.    The following matrix lists and assesses the risk of failure associated with non-
achievement of the project's stated objectives and how risk mitigation was addressed.

Table 6: Risks and Mitigation measures

                Risk                                         Mitigation

 a. Non compliance with the annual      The Bank monitored production on a quarterly basis to
 maximum production caps.               closely follow the annual production trend. As stated in
                                        the Agreement with the EXCOM, if the annual
                                        maximum cap was surpassed PRODUVEN would be
                                        penalized

 b. Lack of transparency in the labor   The Bank closely monitored the number of affected
 compensation package due to            workers due to CFC plant closure to ensure compliance
 PRODUVEN's         production     of   with the Venezuelan labor regulatory framework.

 c. Uncertainty on whether energy       FONDOIN carried out a study to assess different
 savings would allow chiller            economic incentives to ensure proper sustainability of
 replacements.                          the chiller replacement program.

 d.   Institutional changes   in        Two separate Grant Agreements were made: one with
 FONDOIN could hinder the               PRODUVEN for the phase-out plan and another with
 implementation of the phase-out        FONDOIN for TA activities

 and disbursements.



                                                                                              12
2.2 Implementation

37. The GoV has shown a strong commitment to adhere to its Montreal Protocol
phase out schedule. GoV started as early as in 1992 to implement ODS phase-out
projects involving industries, and information and public campaigns to raise public
awareness. Most important, GoV achieved an early compliance with the required ODS
production and consumption schedules.

38. Implementation of the CFC production closure project was satisfactory, without
any delays. The Project design for this main component has proved successful, and very
effective. Early CFC production closure was key to reduce the ODS availability in the
market, so that projects to eliminate ODS consumption could be better sustained. The
effect was to be felt not only in Venezuela, but in other Latin American countries long
dependent on PRODUVEN's CFC imports. The project was then instrumental to
achieve the ultimate Montreal Protocol goals in the region.

39. As per the Chiller replacement program, the Bank underestimated the difficulties
related to the lack of proper institutions at the local level to develop this type of
programs. Not only is it necessary to have experience and knowledge of energy savings,
but also the capacity to finance and collect repayments so that a revolving fund can work
effectively. Fortunately enough, the Bank was cautious and did not spend any resources
in the absence of a proper institutional arrangement. In any case, TA efforts were rightly
oriented to ensure that the main component could be successfully implemented. Since
the resources to implement the chiller replacement program were approved by MLF as
part of the National CFC Phase-out Program, to be implemented through by UNIDO,
one of the MP implementing agencies, it will be easy for FONDOIN to ensure that the
component be executed under a future ODS phase-out operation.

40.     Although not formalized through a Mid Term Review, FONDOIN requested
UNIDO to implement the chiller replacement component under the National ODS
project. This arrangement was acceptable to the Bank, considering the difficulties
encountered to its implementation, and taking into account that the main project
component to phase-out production at PRODUVEN, was already successfully completed.
Out of the USD17 million, 97.6% of the funds had already been disbursed. FONDOIN
was unable to coordinate specific actions with UNIDO to implement this component by
the closing of the project.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

41.    PRODUVEN was not allowed to exceed the allocated yearly production cap and
would be subject to monitoring of its production. The excess of production was to be
penalized pursuant to the Agreement between the GoV and the MLF Executive
Committee. To monitor and enforce the CFC production phase-out plan, PRODUVEN
was asked to adopt a monitoring plan and report quarterly CFC production figures and
raw material volumes to FONDOIN and the Bank.         The Plant was subject to annual

                                                                                       13
verification by independent auditors contracted by FONDOIN under terms of reference
approved by the Bank, and was subject to periodic visits from FONDOIN staff to check
production information and activities, including monitoring of operations on CFC and
HCFC-22 production. This assessment was also supervised by the Ministry of the
Environment. To facilitate this, PRODUVEN made available to inspection teams, details
of feed stocks such as CTC, AHF and chloroform use, as well as the tonnage of CFC11
and CFC12, and of HCFC-22 produced, checked in inventory stocks and through daily
logs of plant operations. Since feed stocks (CTC, chloroform and AHF) have to be
imported into Venezuela, FONDOIN accepted Customs Office documentation as part of
the paper trail. FONDOIN and the Bank monitored and supervised implementation of the
CFC production phase-out schedule.           Importers and distributors reported CFC
management to the GoV, any enterprise giving false information or delaying the
presentation of reports was sanctioned according to the country´s legal framework.
FONDOIN, on the other hand, submitted semi-annual progress reports outlining results
on the agreed performance indicators and on the status of subproject processing and
implementation. The results of the international audits were also made known to MLF, as
part of their implementation follow-up.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance


42.     The Project was rated as category C, however, an Environmental Assessment and
Management Plan (EMP) were developed to secure a careful management and good
practices for dismantling, removal and disposal of the reaction equipment and materials.
PRODUVEN was a swing plant, therefore it could only produce HCFC or CFC at a
single time. Since both chemicals required different feed stocks, the plant reactors needed
thorough purges before engaging in a different chemical production campaign. For this
reason, the EMP included a chemical residual management plan with detailed description
of institutional roles and responsibilities and procedures for the removal of the antimony
chlorofluoride catalyst from PRODUVEN's plant reactor.


43.    The annual verification audits confirmed that the equipment dismantling at
PRODUVEN took place according to the Equipment Disposal Plan (EDP), and hazardous
substances were managed through the application of adequate environmental practices to
avoid any exposure to the environment.

44.    The project did not trigger the Bank's social safeguard policies (Involuntary
Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples).

45.    Regarding fiduciary compliance, the project carried out procurement and financial
management according to the provisions of the Grant Agreements. Financial audit reports
were timely delivered and followed the procedures established in the terms of reference
approved by the Bank and all expenditures were reported as eligible.




                                                                                        14
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

46. The MPMF finances incremental operational and capital costs for sub-projects. In
the cases where anticipated sub-projects took place, equipment purchased was fully paid
for by each company (in some cases, firms contributed their own resources) to enable
ODS substitute technologies. The CFC production closure helped reduce the local
supply of ODS in the country. Sustainability of the project as a whole has been
guaranteed by establishing a Law for the Control of Ozone Depleting Substances (2007),
to limit imports of ODS and prevent new companies from coming into the market and
resuming the use of these substances. In any case, once CFC production was closed, the
licensing system and the import quotas generate a barrier to avoid ODS imports outside
the MP phase-out targets. Although the country has faced an unstable political period
and timelines for project implementation and institutional strengthening activities have
been postponed, activities have advanced and concluded.

47. FONDOIN has been strengthened enough to implement and monitor the MP
phase-out for the years to come, provided institutional strengthening funding from
MPMF is available. Once the country has complied with the complete phase-out of
CFCs in 2010, it is now committed to start a new phase for the elimination of HCFC
(Hydrocloro-fluorocarbons). The UNIDO supported implemented National CFC Phase-
out Project will ensure that final conversions to non-ODS technologies take place.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

48.    Venezuela's Reduction of ODS Project objectives were in line with (i)
Venezuela's obligations under the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments; (ii) the
Country Program; (iii) recommendations made by the Executive Committee's Sub-group
on the Production sector; (iv) data collected from producing and user enterprises; (v) the
independent techno-economic audit in the CFC production sector carried out by the MLF;
and (vi) field visits carried out by an international expert in CFC production and the
World Bank team.

49.    The table below summarizes the phase out schedule as per the Agreement
between the EXCOM and the GoV, and the actual production according to audit reports.
The CFC Production Phase-out Plan was consistent with the MLF principles and
guidelines for calculating incremental costs; the methodology adopted to calculate
complete phase-out costs was based on Venezuela's understanding of the draft guidelines
for production phase-out.




                                                                                       15

50.     The maximum annual allowable production was to decrease by 82% in 2004 from
the baseline figure of 5,341, and production would be limited to 41% of the baseline in
2005 and 2006. This would provide a stockpile for residual uses through 2010, both
domestically and in export to other Article 5 countries. The main reason to explain the
production level drop in PRODUVEN, as compared to the agreed levels, is the demand
reduction from industries already converted to non-ODS technologies. Also there was an
economic recession in 2004-2005, which caused demand and production to contract. By
2007 production was phased-out completely. This effectively aided Venezuela to comply
with its MP obligations three years earlier than mandated.

51. The Project was fully successful in supporting Venezuela to fully comply with the
Phase-out plan of ODS as established under the Montreal Protocol. While market forces
and government intervention have also determined this trend, the Project ensured that
the conversion to non-ODS technologies was sustainable and prevented a recurrence of
ODS use over the long term. Technical assistance to improve FONDOIN capacity
ensured adequate monitoring and detection of illegally traded ODS. A public
information campaign, a study of the market effects of the phase-out, information
management systems, and control systems contributed towards achieving the targets
sustainably. The performance-based approach used in the project, where PRODUVEN
would receive compensation according to internationally monitored phase-out of its
production, proved to be a cost-effective approach, not common under Montreal
Protocol projects. Besides, synchronizing demand and supply phase-out helped
effectively achieve the objectives set out in Venezuela's MP Country Program.




                                                                                       16
52. Although the component for the establishment of a national mechanism for
replacement of chillers through a revolving fund scheme was not implemented, this
failure cannot hinder the overall's Project success. The CFC production phase-out
component deployed USD16.45 million to eliminate about 2400 tons CFC per year. On
the other hand the USD0.5 million were to eliminate as much as 20 tons CFC per year.
The introduction of the component was to add capacity for implementing self
sustainable mechanisms as a revolving fund.


3.2 Achievement of Global Environment Objectives

53.     Project success is deemed Satisfactory, as the overall main project objective, to
early phase-out CFC production was properly achieved. Production of about 2400 tons of
CFC per year was completely closed. First, the fundamental objective of the project was
to accelerate compliance with the obligations of the GoV under the Montreal Protocol by
early phasing-out CFC production. PRODUVEN effectively ceased production of CFC-
11 and CFC-12 by the end of 2006, resulting in a strong positive impact in the global
supply market of CFCs. This was achieved through an efficient policy-based
management system, without unduly harming industrial and economic growth or
consumer interests. The project built institutional capacity to bring long-term benefits to
Venezuela.

54.    Among the actions that contributed to the decrease in the demand of CFCs, was
the agreement between the GoV and PRODUVEN to apply a price policy of CF 11 and
12. This policy allowed a smooth conversion of equipment to start using substitute
substances.


3.3 Efficiency

55.     Implementation of the CFC production closure project was satisfactory, with no
delays, therefore, the project was fully implemented within the agreed time table, in a
cost-effective manner. The main criterion that determines the level of eligible funding
for these projects is cost-effectiveness (CE). Projects' cost effectiveness must fall within
pre-established CE thresholds for the different sectors to be eligible. This means that all
approved MP projects are expected to comply with that pre-set indicator of efficiency.

56.      Although no cost-effectiveness thresholds were established by MLF for ODS
production closure projects, it may be said that the Project cost effectiveness is very high,
and well beyond the thresholds presented in Table 8 below. For example, the Project
initially contemplated a reduction of 3369 MT, with a cost of US$ 4,897/ton. The actual
reduction was 4702,6 MT, therefore the real cost was US$ 3,508.70/ton. The cost per ton
was reduced in 28%.

57.     The cost effectiveness is a measure of how efficient the project has been in
utilizing funds put at its disposal to meet its objectives. The most common method used

                                                                                          17
to calculate cost-effectiveness is to calculate the total incremental costs of a project,
excluding cost of safety where applicable, divided by the amount of its Ozone Depleting
Potential (ODP) to be phased out (More details in Annex 3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

58.      The project's objective was met through the following outcomes:

      a) PRODUVEN ceased completely CFC production by the end of 2006, which
         allowed Venezuela to fulfill its commitments to the Montreal Protocol ahead of
         schedule.
      b) The equipment used in the production of CFC-11&12 was totally dismantled,
         retrofitted, and disposed according to good environmental operating practices (the
         Environmental Management Plan and the Equipment Disposal Plan).
      c) Labor compensation for PRODUVEN staff was carried out according to
         Venezuelan law requirements.
      d) The GoV established production caps and bans for ODS imports and developed
         export/import control based on a license/quota system.
      e) The GoV developed technical capacity to monitor CFC import/export of illegal
         substances.
      f) A public awareness campaign was designed and implemented on the harmfulness
         of CFCs and other ODS increases.

4. Assessment of Risk to Global Environment Outcome

Rating: Low

59.    The risk to the global environmental outcome is minimal; project sustainability is
rated as likely. Venezuela has shown a strong commitment to adhering to its Montreal
Protocol obligations and should completely phase out ODS by 2010. The 2005 data show

                                                                                           18
that the country has been meeting its obligations and is well on its way to meeting the
2010 deadline. In addition, the GoV has raised public awareness of the need to protect the
ozone layer, and consumers are interested in purchasing non-ODS products. Proper
disposal and dismantling of CFC producing equipment was achieved as confirmed by
audit reports. Since PRODUVEN was designed as a "swing plant" several of the pumps,
heat exchangers, instruments and storage facilities are usable to produce HCFC-22.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

60.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     Throughout the project life, Bank staff worked closely with FONDOIN and
PRODUVEN to ensure proper identification, preparation, and implementation of the
project. The Bank provided valuable support to the GoV in the strategic policy design
and during its negotiations at the EXCOM meetings and hired highly specialized
consultants to support the GoV in key sectors. The Bank's Assistance Strategy for
Venezuela, was to engage in a dialogue with the government to help the country comply
with the Montreal Protocol. The Bank developed close working relationships with all
stakeholders, thereby enhancing its credibility and the acceptability of its technical
assistance (TA) advice.

62.    As per the Chiller replacement program, the Bank failed in the design of the
Project due to the following reasons: i) this small activity was placed at the level of a
component, it only represented 3% of the total cost and its contribution to the phase-out
Plan was marginal; and ii) the Bank underestimated the difficulties related to the lack of
proper institutions at the local level to develop this type of programs; not only is it
necessary to have experience and knowledge of energy savings, but also the capacity to
finance and collect repayments so that a revolving fund can work effectively.

(b) Bank's Quality of Supervision

63.    Rating: Satisfactory

64.    Supervision was adequate, as Bank staff worked closely with FONDOIN to
conduct periodic supervision missions during the project. The Bank supervised overall
implementation of the strategy and reported to the EXCOM on implementation progress.
Continual reports, including Progress Reports, were prepared and submitted to the Bank
and the MPMF Secretariat.

65.    Procurement proved satisfactory, as well as financial audits. With regard to
safeguard policies, the Bank team assessed the implementation of the Environmental
management Plan and the Equipment Disposal plan to secure that hazardous substances

                                                                                       19
were properly managed and not released to the environment. The verification reports
confirmed that good environmental practices were applied. The project did not trigger the
social safeguards.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

66.    Rating: Satisfactory

67.     The project helped Venezuela meet its ODS production and consumption
commitments under the Montreal Protocol. ODS production ceased completely by 2006,
three years in advance of MP targets. The Bank's proactive involvement to help the GoV
phase-out production was very important, so that initial delays could be surmounted and
implementation could advance fast while ensuring industrial and economic growth was
not unduly harmed and consumer interests were protected.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

68.    Rating: Satisfactory

69.    FONDOIN was responsible for developing Annual Operative Plans acceptable to
the Bank, detailing operating procedures and project targets, and setting up disbursement
schedules. FONDOIN implemented a monitoring and reporting system to track the
Phase-out Plan's execution, and verified CFC phase-out by PRODUVEN in an effective
way. The activities under the agreement with FONDOIN were developed appropriately
and successfully, completely adhered to the ODS phase-out schedule of the Montreal
Protocol. Hence its performance is assessed as satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Enterprise

70.    Rating: Satisfactory

71.     PRODUVEN's role as the implementing enterprise was done in a satisfactory
manner, as it effectively phased-out CFC production according to schedule.
PRODUVEN reported CFC production figures to FONDOIN, and was readily available
to periodic visits from FONDOIN staff and independent auditors for inspection.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

72.    Rating: Satisfactory

73.    The high level of collaboration and commitment by FONDOIN and PRODUVEN
for the implementation of the Project, allowed Venezuela to comply with the country
commitments under the Montreal Protocol.



                                                                                      20
74.     Proper contracting and monitoring of international audits was carried out to
inform MLF on PRODUVEN's advancement with the CFC production phase-out
program. Audits verified production data logs, inventories of feed stocks and products
(CFC & HCFC). Decree # 4335 was enacted by GoV in 2006, setting limits for ODS
production and imports starting 2007, also substantially contributing to overall Project
objective compliance.

75.     The destruction of CFC12&11 producing equipment by PRODUVEN prevented
reversing the process in the future. This included destruction of decanters, pumps,
activated carbon column, vapor line from carbon steel reactor, and a silica dryer. Other
equipment such as containers and an exchanger were converted to work with the HCFC
production process.

6. Lessons Learned

76.    The main lessons that can be drawn from this project are:

Sectoral Approach

77.    The performance based, disbursement oriented project design for CFC production
closure proved to be very well designed and successful. This approach enabled
PRODUVEN to flexibly arrange for its own implementation procedures, which at the end
were less costly and more efficient.

Institutional strengthening

78.     An integrated approach for capacity building ensures that conversion to non-ODS
technologies is sustainable and prevents a recurrence of ODS use over the long term.
Training on the control of illegally trades ODS should cover all the relevant institutions,
for this reason, the project provided training to officers from the Ministry of Commerce
and Industries , as well as customs staff. Customs were also equipped to accurately detect
imports of ODS.

79.    As to complementary actions, a public information campaign, a study of the
market effects of the phase-out, information management systems, and control systems,
also contributed towards achieving the targets sustainably.

Import Control

80.    In addition, by establishing a well managed and enforced ODS Import Licensing
System, GoV was able to set import quotas according to the ODS phase-out targets.
These levels of imports, coupled with the industrial conversion, proved the need to
collaborate amongst sectors (i.e., industry and commerce) to ensure compliance and
sustainability.




                                                                                        21
Chiller Replacement component

81.     An institutional analysis should have taken place before the implementation of
this program to have information on the existing weaknesses and incorporate into the
project design specific mechanisms to tackle with these issues.

Annex 3 . Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      Montreal Protocol projects do not apply an economic analysis. The criteria
applied was the Cost-Effectiveness Threshold (CER=Grant Amount (US$)/Kg ODP
eliminated) calculated for each sub-project funding proposal. The cost effectiveness of
this financial mechanism is a measure of how efficient it has been in utilizing funds put
at its disposal to meet its objectives. The most common method used to calculate cost-
effectiveness is to calculate the total incremental costs of a project, excluding cost of
safety where applicable, divided by the amount of its Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP)
to be phased out. Cost effectiveness is defined by the following formula:


C=       IC+ 10
         M [ODP]
where:

C = Cost-effectiveness
IC = Incremental capital costs (covered by the Fund)
10 = Net incremental operating costs (covered by the Fund)
M [ODPI = Amount of ODS to be phased out annually (weighted kg ODP)

2.    The following sector and subsector cost-effectiveness threshold values (measured
in US$/kg ODP) were applied to determine the maximum eligible OTF Grant 054980
(PRODUVEN) amounts for subprojects:

3.     Although no cost-effectiveness thresholds were established by MLF for ODS
production closure projects, it may be said that the project cost effectiveness is very high,
at USD0.16/k ODP, well beyond the thresholds presented in the table above.

The following comments were submitted by PRODUVEN:

1.      In table 2, the production of CFC 11 and 12 for 2000 should be rectified as 2,706
MT.

Comment has been addressed in Table 2.

 2.    Section 2.3 indicates that the technical audit (production verification) was carried
 out by FONDOIN and the Bank, we suggest to include the Ministry of the Environment
 and one of the control entities.

Addressed in section 2.3.

3.     Data in Table 4 is not consistent with data in Table 7, the maximum annual
production should be 4,400, 2,913 and 2,913 MT.

Addressed in Table 4


4.      In table 7, the following issues should be rectified:

        Actual production for 2005 indicates 2261 MT, it was actually 2451,4 MT,
        therefore, the total amount is 8892,4 MT.
        Rectified in Table 7. Page 20.

        Actual ODP production (CFC 11 and 12) should be the same as the produced MT
        multiplied by 1.

        Addressed in table 7.


5.     We suggest to clearly show the Project's efficiency according to the production
reduction compared to the maximum ODS allowed by the Montreal Protocol, it could be
added to Table 5 or in other section of the text. The amount allowed by MP was 13, 595
MT ODP, while the actual production was 8892,4 MT ODP, this represents a saving of
4702,6 MT or a reduction of 34.59%.

6.     Similarly, the document could indicate that the Project contemplated a reduction
of 3369 MT, with a cost of US$ 4,897 per ton. Given that the actual reduction was 4702,6
MT, the real cost was US$ 3,508.70. The cost per ton was reduced in 28%.

Comments in paragraphs 5 and 6 above have been addressed in section 3.3.
                                                                                        32
7.     Section 3.2 under the description of Component 1, it should be added that among
the actions that contributed to the decrease in the demand of CFCs, was the agreement
between the GoV and PRODUVEN to apply a price policy of CF 11 and 12. This policy
allowed a smooth conversion of equipment to start using substitute substances.
