The project's\n            public-private partnership approach was very innovative at\n            the time the project was designed. Although such\n            partnerships are now more common, they are not always\n            successfully implemented. Yet, the success of this operation\n            stems from: adhering to a supply-chain approach in\n            introducing new and diversified product-lines; implementing\n            a participatory approach with all beneficiaries in the\n            design, procurement, and implementation; emphasizing a total\n            quality control system; initiating the creation of a private\n            foundation endowed with the project's assets; and,\n            creating a valuable \"soft asset.\" Important\n            lessons were drawn from the application of these ideas: 1)\n            Accumulation of soft assets is critical for triggering\n            growth and private sector investment: this project provides\n            a notable exception, not only in the effectiveness of the\n            institutional learning that it triggered, but also in the\n            momentum generated for continued institutional innovation.\n            The project was able to double exports by successfully\n            investing in soft assets that changed the perception (both\n            internally and externally) of the Senegalese horticultural\n            sector, to that of a serious competitor/contender on the\n            horticultural export scene, thereby leveraging additional\n            outside private investment. 2) Business savvy international\n            technical assistance is an effective means of providing the\n            hands-on demonstration effects necessary to shift\n            institutional/business paradigms: demonstration effects were\n            provided not only for new crops and cropping systems but\n            also, and more importantly, they tested new marketing\n            methods and pricing protocols which allowed producers and\n            marketers to realize attractive profits. 3) A bottom-up,\n            versus top-down, inclusive approach is key for building\n            capacity and assuring sustainability: it led to substantial\n            institutional development, eventual buy-in for the design of\n            the innovative export infrastructure facilities, and\n            agreement over the creation of a Foundation representing the\n            interests of all actors. Further lessons address the\n            infrastructure investment process, and the shortness of the\n            standard four-five year credit implementation time frame,\n            suggesting it is too short to build sustainable\n            institutional capacity."}, "docdt": "2004-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
