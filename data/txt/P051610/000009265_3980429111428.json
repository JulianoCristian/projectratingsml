assists farmers in both traditional and non-traditional crop\n            production and export; supports producers to develop high\n            value-added crops; and strengthens farmers organizations.\n            Negative impacts on the vegetal cover, the soil, water, and\n            the affected population will lead to reduced land\n            productivity, water-related diseases--malaria and\n            bilharzia--droughts, salinization, water contamination from\n            misuse and over-use of fertilizers and pesticides, and soil\n            erosion. Traffic accidents, noise due to the increased load\n            of vehicles and airplanes transportation, gas emissions, and\n            effluents will also occur. Mitigation includes afforestation\n            efforts combined with irrigation development and an\n            information campaign for soil, water, and biomass\n            conservation. Hygiene education and community management and\n            awareness will be developed to ensure better water supply\n            and sanitation services, and to reduce disease. Preserving\n            traditional floral species, setting aside protected areas,\n            and introducing foreign species compatible with farm crops\n            will arrest deforestation. Fuel conservation will discourage\n            stripping trees. Extension services will educate farmers\n            about soil conditions and composting to mitigate soil\n            degradation. Installing a piezometer to control lowering\n            groundwater and measuring water quality, designing\n            activities to prevent floods, and regulating use will help\n            manage water resources."}, "docdt": "1997-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
