of a gas processing plant, and\n            the laying of gathering lines and injection lines. In Vuelta\n            Grande, all liquid hydrocarbons exist in gas form in the\n            reservoir and appropriate reservoir pressure must be\n            maintained in order to permit condensate production by\n            recycling dry gas into the reservoir. The project would also\n            provide studies of The Bolivian National Oil Company's\n            (YPFB) staff policies and organizational efficiency as well\n            as consultants services and training related to the\n            recycling process."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
