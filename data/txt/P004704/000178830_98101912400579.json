investment program for the years 1977-1981 and will enable\n            the Borrower to meet increasing demand for railway services\n            while further improving the railway's operating and\n            financial performance. The economy as a whole will benefit\n            from increased capacity to meet projected demand and through\n            savings in transport costs for commodities carried. The\n            project includes: (a) acquisition of thirty 1,800 hp diesel\n            locomotives; (b) manufacture of 79 passenger coaches and 103\n            freight cars; (c) rehabilitation of track and bridges; (d)\n            modernization of telecommunications and signalling systems;\n            and (e) improvement of workshop facilities. The Bank loan\n            will cover the foreign exchange cost of materials to be\n            procured for rolling stock manufacture; bridge and workshop\n            rehabilitation; procurement of monoblock concrete ties; and\n            telecommunications and signalling."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
