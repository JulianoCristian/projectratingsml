      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a neces sary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the Andhra Pradesh District
Poverty Initiatives Project (APDPIP) (Credit No. 33320-IN) approved April 11, 2000 and
effective August 7, 2000, and the Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Production Project
(APRPRP) (Credit No. 37320-IN, Credit No. 37321, Credit No. 46750) approved
February 20, 2003 and effective May 13, 2003.

The total project cost at appraisal of APDPIP was US$134.80 million. The Credit was
US$111.00 million. This was fully disbursed by the extended closing date of December
31, 2006. The total project cost at appraisal of APRPRP was US$266.19 million. The
Credit was S$150.00 million. This was followed by two rounds of additional financing, in
2007 of US$65.00 million, and in 2009 of US$100.00 million. All of this funding was
fully disbursed by the extended final closing date of September 30, 2011. The final total
project cost of APRPRP was US$472.43 million.

This report is based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion and Results Reports, the Project Appraisal Document, legal documents and
project files, the Impact Study and MIS database, the literature, and on discussions held
with Bank staff involved in the project. It is also based on an IEG assessment mission to
India that was conducted from October 25, 2014 to November 21, 2014. IEG held
meetings in New Delhi and conducted site visits to villages, mandals and districts in the
states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, both states recently formed from the division of
the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh. The mission expresses its appreciation for the time
and attention of the Borrower and all concerned parties, particularly the Society for the
Elimination of Rural Poverty Andhra Pradesh (SERP AP) and the Society for the
Elimination of Rural Poverty Telangana (SERP T). A list of persons met is given in
Annex C.

IEG selected these two projects for a field assessment in order to verify results, assess
sustainability, and draw lessons for future Bank support in the area of community
development in India and globally. The assessment will also provide input for an IEG
study on World Bank Group Support for the Rural Non-Farm Economy and an IEG study
on Financial Inclusion.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft report were sent to government
officials and agencies for their review and comment. No comments were received.

project cost was US$472.43 million.

Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives Project (APDPIP)
The objective of the Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives Project - the relevance
of which is rated High by this assessment -was to improve opportunities of the rural
poor to meet priority social and economic needs in six of the poorest districts. It set out to
do this by establishing and strengthening institutions of the rural poor – whereby the poor
are both members and leaders – and through which their social capital is strengthened.
Over time, as evidenced by activities evaluated under the second phase, this social capital
has helped to connect the poor to financial and economic knowledge and political capital,
thereby enabling the institutions of the poor to increase access to finance, markets,
services, infrastructure, knowledge, voice and political participation. The Relevance of
Project Design is rated Substantial. The designed components and processes were
consistent with the stated objectives and the logical framework. However, more could
have been done in the first phase to test and learn from alternate approaches in parallel,
prior to scaling up state-wide.

The achievement of the objective of improving opportunities of the rural poor to
meet priority social needs in six of the poorest districts is rated High. The project
helped to establish 171,618 women’s Self-Help Groups that enabled 2.3 million female
beneficiaries (twice the target) to participate in this rural livelihoods program. Studies
find that, as a result of the project, participants experienced an incremental increase in per
capita consumption of about US$16.8 per year, representing an 11 percentage point
increase over a control. Participants also experienced an estimated increase in per capita
intake of energy and protein and investment in non-financial assets at levels that were
significant as compared to a control. With regard to the assumption that social capital
could support greater political participation, and in turn, more meaningful representation
of women and the poor, the end-line impact assessment found that women participating
in SHGs were more likely both to contest and win local elections (CESS 2007).

The project also connected project participants to critical social entitlements. SHGs were
supported by representative federations of participating members – at the Village, Sub-
District, and District Level. This representation allowed women to leverage their voice to
                                            xii


gain access to priority social needs. With the assistance of the implementing agency,
these higher level federations of women were, for the first time, able to directly negotiate
with government authorities to gain access to pensions for members that had previously
been overlooked or where there had been significant leakage. In 2005-2006, the Village
Organizations distributed over US$2 million of old age and other pensions including
disability pensions to members of the SHGs. The federated arrangement helped to more
than triple the number of poor covered by life insurance. With implementing agency
support, and the service delivery channels established through the project, more than half
a million women purchased life insurance raising the percentage of coverage from 4
percent of the rural poor covered in 2003 to 15 percent in 2007. The arrangement also
helped members to gain access to the State’s Employment Guarantee Schemes. Focus
group discussion facilitated by IEG revealed that increasingly, over time, as women
gained confidence, they were using their collective power to confront child marriages,
domestic abuse, and child trafficking. The project had a strong focus on delivering
nutrition and education services for the poor. The project facilitated implementation of a
food security system. A community investment fund – targeted at the district level –
enabled the bulk purchase of food grains which in turn allowed for more affordable
access of these foodstuffs for some 550,000 participating households, on a credit basis.

The achievement of the objective of improving opportunities of the rural poor to
meet priority economic needs in six of the poorest districts is rated Substantial. The
project used two main vehicles to provide the rural poor with productive opportunities: a
Community Investment Fund and a Savings and Credit scheme and that included linkages
to banks. The investment fund, administered through the federated structure to finance
demand-driven investments, connected an estimated 1 million households to income
generating sub-projects. The project supported over 36,000 income generating activities.
An estimated two-thirds of CIF funds were used for agriculture and livestock and a
substantial amount of these funds were invested in dairy production. The remaining funds
were used for non-farm investments. A farm enterprise study conducted by the
implementing agency based on a random sample of 475 subprojects found that the
average rate of return for agriculture and livestock investments was between 40-174
percent. The average rate of return for dairying was 103 percent while agriculture was 44
percent. The end-line impact assessment found that average incomes from dairying rose
by 85 percent in real terms and that the average incomes from agriculture rose by 42
percent (CESS 2007). The Community Investment Fund was also used to connect rural
poor youth to employment opportunities. With the assistance of SERP, the project
established Livelihoods Advancement Business Schools which helped to train and
connect 11,883 youth to jobs in the textile, services and construction industries, mainly in
urban areas. The resulting average annual incomes for trained and employed youth is
reported to be US$1,000, with fifty percent of these earnings being remitted back to
families in the rural areas.

The second vehicle through which the project supported economic opportunities was
through a Groups Savings and Lending Scheme that included a target to link rural poor
women’s groups to formal banking systems, using the group savings and lending model
to demonstrate credit worthiness. As compared to a target of US$15 million, the project
supported total group savings of US$113 million. The project set out to link 45,000
groups to formal banking systems. As compared to the target, the project connected
                                           xiii


155,091 groups to formal banks. According to the impact assessment, participating
household asset income, excluding wage income, subsidy payments and other transfer
payments, increased from an average of US$220 to US$589 as a result of the contribution
made by livelihood opportunities accessed through these different sources of funding.

Efficiency is rated Substantial. Against a benchmark estimated in the project appraisal
document of 19 to 48 percent, the project achieved internal rates of return of 44 percent
for agricultural activities, 48 percent for livestock, and 103 percent for dairy. IEG
reviewed the enterprise models used to conduct the rate of return analysis and found them
to be generally sound. Consumption benefits were calculated for the project as a whole –
an external assessment found that applying a 0.9 discount factor, the net present value of
benefits from the project were about US$1.69 billion. Assuming the consumption
benefits lasted for only one year, the study calculated a benefit cost ratio of 1.5:1. The
costs of delivering services were moderate as compared to appraisal estimates, but these
costs are likely to be under-reported, although still under appraisal estimates. Missing
from the analysis is a calculation of the social welfare benefits – for the individual,
household and society as a whole.

Outcome is rated Satisfactory. The Relevance of Objectives and Design are rated High
and Substantial respectively. The project was based on the premise that, beginning some
fifteen years ago, the rural poor women of Andhra Pradesh required social capital
strengthening to enable them to access more productive social and economic
opportunities. The project was designed to mobilize this capacity. However an
opportunity was missed at the design stage to test and adapt different service delivery
models. Project design could have also been strengthened by integrating a more
considered long-term strategy for SERP and its staff. The project highly achieved its
objectives of improving opportunities for the rural poor to meet priority social needs and
substantially met its goal of enabling economic needs. Based on substantial average
internal rates of return for the agriculture and livestock activities, high consumption
benefits, but a lack of information on the wider societal benefits. Efficiency is rated
Substantial.

Bank and Borrower performance are rated Satisfactory. Preparation and appraisal by
the Bank was satisfactory. The appraisal team had a satisfactory range of expertise with a
spread of skills including finance and community banking, community development,
agriculture, engineering, economics, and social development. Attention was paid to
poverty and vulnerability at the District and Mandal level and participatory poverty
mapping was conducted at the village level in recognition of some of the limitations
associated with the state’s Below the Poverty Line method of collecting poverty-related
data. M&E was comprehensively designed, however the project could have benefitted
from more qualitative indices to support a more systematic understanding of behavior
change. For those groups that engaged in productive investments, more also could have
been learned about the technical outcomes associated with agriculture and dairy
investments. Supervision was satisfactory. The balance of expertise applied to the
supervision work was optimal. The IEG mission findings are that the supervision team
was thorough and flexible, encouraging adaptation and experimentation where it was
needed.

From the late 1990s, prior to the approval of the project, the state government had
redirected its approach to rural development to a more bottom-up, community-based,
approach with increased government line agency accountability. It was fully committed
to this project. The implementing agency, SERP, was found to be skilled, dedicated, and
highly innovative. It quickly adopted and implemented a program of participatory rural
development that involved over 2 million rural poor constituents. SERP adopted and
implemented new methods for participatory poverty mapping that gave somewhat
different results from the national poverty mapping method. All aspects of supervision
managed by the implementing agency were sound including safeguard compliance,
community procurement, and financial management.

Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project (APRPRP)
The second project, the Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project, became
effective three and a half years before the prior project closed, so there was considerable
overlap. This project took the previous project approach with modifications, while
scaling up nationally, reaching 11.3 million households through the establishment of 1
million Self-Help Groups. In the end, this was aided by two rounds of additional
financing. With now greater focus on reaching the poor, the objective was to enable the
poor, particularly the poorest of the poor, to improve their livelihoods and quality of life.

Relevance of the Objectives and Design are both rated High. The project was fully
consistent with the national and state strategy and vision for poverty reduction and the
Bank’s corporate goal of reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity. Project
design was appropriately focused on developing the architecture and building the
capacity of the federated model that had been supported under the first phase. The design
was in line with the vision that building institutions for the poor was a prerequisite for
encouraging and leveraging voice as a means to engender accountability for the delivery
of priority economic and social services. There were alternative options to women’s self-
help groups, for example a program of conditional cash transfer or a stronger government
safety net. However, neither would have enhanced women’s empowerment at scale with
sustainable potential.

On Efficacy, the project highly met its objectives of enabling the poor, particularly the
poorest of the poor, to improve their livelihoods and quality of life. The project continued
to invest in the formation of rural institutions comprised of and led by the poor. By
project end, 11.3 million women were participating in 1 million project supported Self-
Help Groups. Of these, 2.85 million were considered the poorest of the poor. According
to an impact assessment, based on a sample survey, 70 percent of participating
households were either poor or poorest of the poor.

Through the project supported Bank linkages program, the amount of financial capital
available to participants grew from US$404 million at project start to about US$7.9
billion by the project end. With greater access to capital, participants undertook
investments in agriculture, livestock, and non-farm activities that led to increased
incomes for the poor and poorest of the poor. An impact assessment commissioned by
the project found that the average annual income for the poorest participants increased by
US$107 over non-participants and US$263 for the poor. According to the evaluation, the
percentage of participating households that fell below the poverty line dropped from 29.8
                                            xv


percent at baseline to 17.5 percent by project close, compared to a control group of
households who barely moved, from a baseline of 29.8 percent to 27.5 percent by project
close.

The economic empowerment supported by this project gave voice to millions of rural
poor women. The impact assessment found that participation in community discussions
on drinking water, irrigation facilities, access to education, approach roads, and child
labor were higher for participants than non-participants (and with regard to child labor,
non-participants had no voice at all). Other studies have similarly found general
improvements over and above evolving societal trends with regard to women’s ability to
leave the home without permission, to disagree with their husband, and to participate in
village meetings. After controlling for initial propensity to participate, the impact
assessment found that project participants were 4 percent more likely to attend village
gram sabha meetings than nonparticipants as of project close.

Efficiency is rated High on the basis of a satisfactory Internal Rate of Return (IRR), a
high net present value, substantial unquantifiable benefits – especially social, and other
qualitative efficiency considerations.

On balance the Outcome is rated Highly Satisfactory.

Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank performance is rated Satisfactory, and Borrower performance is rated Highly
Satisfactory. The project thoroughly incorporated lessons from the past and based its
design on a substantial livelihoods assessment. Project design adequately assessed risks
with regard to difficult design issues that could have handicapped progress, including
land market issues, and helped to create an institutional arrangement that was able to
connect 2.85 million of the most vulnerable rural poor to assets and services. The project,
like its predecessor, targeted some of the most vulnerable persons in society, including
members of schedule tribes, backward castes, and the disabled. Project design was
dynamic in so far as it also reached out to unemployed youth, and was inclusive with
regard to treating non-participants in such critical areas as maternal and child health in
the villages in which it was working. While M&E could have included more qualitative
indicators to better understand behavior and to periodically assess the feasibility of
productive investments – the project, like its predecessor project, supported an impact
assessment. Supervision was thorough, flexible and creative and responsive to the needs
of the borrower. The Bank played an important role not only in enabling innovation but
in feeding in ideas from global and other state experience. The Bank also provided a
platform for the implementing agency to try new things that, in the absence of the project,
would have been more difficult within administrative constraints. The Government at
both the center and the state level was fully committed and provided strong policy and
implementation support to the project. The implementing agency, SERP, performed very
well, having demonstrated a high level of commitment and skill, creativity, and
endurance. SERP attracted and retained excellent staff with very good appreciation of
the needs of a participatory approach centered on self-help groups that were also targeted
at the poorest.
                                            xvi


There are four main lessons from the two projects:

      Support for the establishment of women’s self-help groups with linkages to
       bank finance and within a supportive policy and institutional environment
       can lead to enhanced confidence and capacity of women both collectively and
       individually. The evidence from Andhra Pradesh suggests that collective
       empowerment can support greater accountability for service delivery that, in turn,
       can positively affect the livelihoods of the poor.

      In the early phases of rural development projects that support large-scale
       community group formation as a means to leverage more equitable service
       delivery, including finance, there is a need to think long-term about the
       transition strategy for the chosen implementing agency. In the case of Andhra
       Pradesh, the implementing agency support became an essential pillar of the built
       system, undertaking roles and responsibilities for service delivery that overlapped
       with the line ministries. Without an effective transition strategy that integrates the
       philosophy, training and acquired skills into the broader administration, there is a
       risk that gains made under the project will be lost and efforts to reach the poorest
       of the poor may not be sustained.

      Reaching the poorest of the poor can prove difficult through group
       formation owing to rigid rules of attendance, set savings contributions, joint
       liability, and other group non-negotiables. Going forward, the strategy may
       need to be altered towards household or individual support, or differentiated
       models that consider the needs of the poorest of the poor, prior to group
       formation. This multi-stage approach is bound to incur additional costs. This
       implies trade-offs between depth and coverage and between short-term and long-
       term impact that should be accommodated in project design.

      The pursuit of a single group model, such as women’s self-help groups, to the
       exclusion of other approaches, limits the ability to learn from the user –
       about what works and why in different contexts – and to test alternatives in
       parallel rather than in sequence. Greater experimentation during the first phase,
       when the project was rolled out in the first six districts, could have laid the ground
       for more creative destruction, adaptation, and learning prior to scaling.

1. Background and Methodology
1.1    The origins of the Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiative Project (APDPIP),
and the later Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project (APRPRP), lie in India’s
women's savings-and-loan associations and the UNDP supported South Asia Poverty
Alleviation Program of 1996 which grew out of the 1993 Dhaka Declaration for the
Eradication of Poverty. These approaches were also based on experience elsewhere in
South Asia, including the Rural Support Programs in Pakistan and the Self-Help Affinity
Groups implemented in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu by the Non-
Governmental Organizations, MYRADA and PRADAN.

1.2     In India, during the decade prior to appraisal, there was an increasing concern
about the failure of antipoverty programs to reduce the number of rural poor. There were
a number of problems with these programs including poor targeting, weak management,
lack of complementarities, and wasteful subsidies. The state’s public spending on soci al
development was low and declining. Social indicators were weak and below the national
average. Some 30 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, and
malnutrition in children up to six years old was about 30 percent. Notwithstanding some
earlier experience in India with women's self-help groups and joint and several liability
lending, there was limited availability of credit partly due to the high cost and risks of
lending in rural areas to households with small borrowing needs and climatic variability.
Line agencies were weak with a limited capacity for providing support and services for
the poor. Agricultural productivity needed to be raised to enhance livelihoods. There had
been a Bank-funded economic restructuring project (Cr./Ln.49385/IN) but it had been
unable to achieve direct coverage of the more vulnerable households. The Government of
Andhra Pradesh recognized a need for improved policies, the development of more
effective institutions, and an approach that empowered poor rural communities,
particularly women. In 1999, the state embarked on a program based on a 2020 Vision
strategy. Central to the strategy was the development of women's Self-Help Groups that
would be linked to commercial banks to increase the flow of, and reduce the cost of,
credit. All line agencies were to adopt more responsive approaches to communities. The
first project, APDPIP, in selected districts, followed with overlap by the second project,
APRPRP, that eventually extended support to all districts, were key elements in the
overall program supporting group formation and bank linkages. For a diagram of the
relationships between the levels of community-based organizations and their main roles
and coverage under APRPRP see Annex B, Chart 1.

1.3     Methodology. The project performance assessment applied a mix-methods
approach that aimed to obtain beneficiary feedback at several administrative levels. The
evaluation conducted Focus Groups with fifteen randomly selected Self-Help Groups
(150 members) in eight randomly selected villages across four districts (Warangal,
Mahabubnagar, Guntur, and Chittoor). The districts were purposively selected based on
the presence of marginalized groups (scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward
castes) and in consideration of the time that the mission had to reach the selected groups.
A Village Level Protocol was implemented that included an individual interview of the
lowest level administrator, or the Sarpanch, at which point IEG introduced the mission
and the scope of the village level interviews. Following the focus groups, IEG conducted
                                            2


group interviews with leaders and members of each Village Organization and the relevant
Mandal Samakhya. To ascertain information about the relevance, effectiveness and
sustainability of the assets acquired through the village organizations, IEG conducted site
visits on a select number of economic enterprises including livestock and dairy,
Sustainable Rice Intensification (SRI), organic farming, land acquisition and conversion,
disability centers, and maternal health care centers. IEG also visited bank managers when
available.

1.4     Project level interviews were conducted both in Delhi within the National Rural
Livelihoods Mission and the Department of Economic Affairs and at the level of the
state, with the Directors and staff of the Society for the Elimination of Rural Poverty
Andhra Pradesh (SERP AP) and the Society for the Elimination of Rural Poverty
Telangana (SERP T). IEG conducted three full days of meetings with the Heads of the
SERP programs, including banking, livelihoods, disability, land acquisition, sustainable
agriculture, dairy, M&E, and other staff. SERP staff were also interviewed at the level of
the Mandal and the District.



2. Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives Project
Relevance of Objectives and Design
2.1     Objective. The objective of the project as stated in the PAD (p.2), effectively the
same as the Development Credit Agreement, was “to improve opportunities for the rural
poor to meet priority social and economic needs in the six poorest Districts of Andhra
Pradesh, namely Chitoor, Srikakulam, Adilabad, Vizianagaram, Mahabubnagar and
Anantapur.” The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) went on to say, “To achieve this
objective the project would: (a) help create self-managed grass-roots institutions; (b)
build the capacity of established local institutions, especially the Gram Sabha/Panchayats
and the government of Andhra Pradesh (AP) line departments, to operate in a more
inclusive manner in addressing the needs of the poor; (c) support investment in sub-
projects proposed by grass-roots institutions of the poor to accelerate their entry and
expand their involvement in social and economic activities; and, (d) improve access to
education for girls to reduce the incidence of child labor among the poor.”

2.2    Relevance of the Objective. The project was fully consistent with the Bank’s
2004 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the strategy relevant at the time of project
closing. A main pillar of this strategy was the empowerment of communities and
investment in people's capacity. Consistent with the strategy, six new Bank-funded
operations at state-level following similar approaches were at various stages of
preparation at the time of APDPIP effectiveness.

2.3    The project was also consistent with the Andhra Pradesh state government
poverty reduction strategy. In 1999 Andhra Pradesh was taking stock of key areas of
development and associated poverty indicators. Work was initiated on the state’s Vision
2020 and growth engines identified. The state government recognized poverty eradication
as a core element in the strategy. A number of “missions” were established at that time
                                             3


including a State Poverty Eradication Mission leading to an Action Plan. As a result of
this process, by 2003, a Poverty Eradication Action Plan was being consolidated with a
logical framework and there was a move to set the plan in motion through a project-based
approach. The strategy was built around the empowerment of women’s self-help groups,
first proposed by the AP state government in 1995. The stated intent was that the strategy
should be a true people’s plan implemented through participatory tools.

2.4    Relevance of the objective is rated High.

DESIGN AND RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.5    The project was designed with four components:

2.6      Component 1. Institutional and Human Capacity Building. (Appraisal Cost
US$19.01 million; Actual Cost US$30.21 million, including borrower additional
financing doubling the state’s contribution) This component was designed to: form and
strengthen Common Interest Groups (CIGs) and women’s Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and
the community based organizations that supported them as well as to strengthen the
capacity of the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), the Gram Sabhas and the Gram
Panchayats; (ii) to provide education, information, and communications; (iii) to enhance
the skills of the state government line departments and NGOs; (iv) to introduce a pilot
program of institutional capacity rating to support the planned linkages with banking
institutions.

2.7     Component 2. Community Investment Fund (CIF). (Appraisal Cost US$70.40
million; Actual Cost US$76.39 million) This component financed two types of sub-
projects: (i) those submitted for approval either by SHGs or CIGs including those
submitted jointly with Gram Sabhas/Panchayats and, (ii) those covering small
infrastructure sub-projects.

2.8     Component 3. Educational Support for Girl Child Laborers and School
Drop-outs. (Appraisal Cost US$28.13 million; Actual Cost US$30.44 million) This
component addressed two needs, to address the school drop-out rate and to reduce girl
child labor. It focused on: (i) the need for girls, financing campaigns to sensitize parents
about the importance of education for poverty reduction and child welfare; and, (ii)
establishment of up to 18 residential “bridge” schools for short and long-term remedial
courses from ages 7 to 14 and 6 regular secondary schools for girls.

2.9     Component 4. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and
Studies. (Appraisal Cost US$7.20 million, Actual Cost US$8.54 million). This
component funded the costs of incremental staff, consultants, technical assistance,
training, workshops, study tours, special studies, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and
the preparation of a follow-on project, vehicles, office equipment and incremental
operating costs.

Relevance of Design
2.10 Results Framework. The PAD (p.82) offered a simplified logical framework.
The two main project input categories were the capacity building investments and the
                                                             4


Community Investment Fund. The capacity building was expected to lead – through
linkages to banks, extension services, trained technicians, micro-planning capacity,
common interest group management capacity, and other outputs – to working capital for
productive activities, credit for consumption and livestock, fertilizer and other inputs.
These were expected to lead to higher factor productivity and incremental economic
activities which, in turn, would lead to higher incomes and living standards and improved
well-being. In parallel, the CIF was expected to result in improved drinking water supply
and road connections, improved seed production, health services, and other output
benefits. In turn these would lead to improved health, labor time saved fetching water,
time-saving from improved transport, improved access to services, and ultimately more
favorable prices due to the road connections which would support productivity and
contribute to higher incomes.

2.11 Relevance of the Component Design. The design, as revealed in the results
framework and the selected investment activities, was largely consistent with the
statement of objectives. In Component 1, the formation and the strengthening of the
Common Interest Groups (CIG) and Self-Help Groups (SHG) and the community based
organizations that supported them, was expected to lead to improved opportunities to
meet social and economic needs. The provision of education, information, and
communications, and the enhanced skills of the state government line departments and
NGOs, was expected to also enhance these opportunities. The introduction of a pilot
program of institutional capacity rating to support the planned linkages with banking
institutions was expected to lead to improved quality of support for the groups. In
Component 2, CIF investment funding was expected to improve priority services and
infrastructure that would support the bank linkages. In Component 3, girls’ education for
the disadvantaged was expected to add to the numbers of well educated women in poor
communities who would be expected, in due course, to play important roles in
community groups and higher level institutions.

2.12 However, there were some design weaknesses. First, the Results Framework
indicators were largely output oriented1. Second, in terms of its organizational structure,
linkages and processes, the project largely by-passed the Panchayati Raj Institutions
(PRI) which were considered weak at the time, although there was the provision of some
capacity building for them2. Third, the project design suggested ambivalence about
supporting the line agencies some of whom, as is discussed later, felt marginalized. This
was inevitable once the decision was made to implement the project through the
government run autonomous agency, the Society for the Elimination of Rural Poverty
(SERP). It was a calculated risk in taking away, for an accelerated learning period, some
line department activities in order to demonstrate better approaches linked to SHGs. The

1
 They included supporting the formation of common interest and self-help groups, providing information, education,
and communications support, providing the parallel capacity building for the Panchayati Raj institutions, sensitization
and capacity enhancement for the state government line departments and NGOs, and initiation of a pilot program to
develop institutional and capacity ratings as a first step towards the development of linkages with banking institutions.
2 It should be noted for background that the relationship between communities, state government, and the PRI
institutions was, at the time of project appraisal, different in different parts of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh state. The area
that now constitutes the post bifurcation Andhra Pradesh had been historically more feudalistic and less progressive in
terms of the roles of the PRIs relative to the Telangana area consequently the aim in those AP areas had been rather to
strengthen community capacity to negotiate with the PRIs.
                                                          5


learning and demonstration intent was understandable for short to medium term success.
However, there have probably been some opportunity costs in terms of stunted growth in
line agency capacity and skills. Fourth, while not an issue with the design per se since the
change happened later, it should be noted that the financial component, the CIF, while
originally designed as a grant mechanism, in fact evolved to a lending activity outside of
any formal financial institution – the model that the World Bank’s Agriculture and Rural
Development Department strategy supports. Fifth, at the design stage there was no formal
grievance mechanism, although later the options to take grievances to the Village
Organization evolved. Sixth, at the design stage there was to be support for the SHGs and
the CIGs, the former entirely women, the latter including some men’s participation, but
there is little offered in the PAD about what differences in approach were to be followed
given that women’s groups were more aimed at social empowerment and men’s activities
more at productivity. It is not clear in the design that there was a differentiated strategy
for groups involving men. This may have partly contributed to the poor performance of
CIGs in terms of sustainability.

2.13 While the limited direct PRI involvement anticipated in the design probably had
some sustainability costs in the medium to long term, it is difficult to see how giving
PRIs a major role in the delivery of the wider project support including livelihoods would
have, at that time, improved project performance given the PRIs’ limited capacity,
predominant focus on services, and political pressures. More recently, the later rural
livelihoods projects in Tamil Nadu and Bihar have tried to achieve greater convergence
with the PRI system.

2.14 Relevance of the Institutional Design. As formulated in the PAD (p 7), “The
management of the project at the state level would be vested in an independent Society
headed by the Chief Minister as the ex-officio Chairman of the General Body (GB). This
body would have a broad representation from all the key stakeholders who would
predominantly be non-officials. The management of SERP would be entrusted to an
Executive Committee (EC), of which an eminent non-governmental person would be
President and the State Project Director would be the Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
The President would also be the Deputy Chairman of the GB. The EC would consist of
about seven members, with two as ex-officio government officials and others drawn from
the GB representing leading agencies and individuals contributing to rural development,
community mobilization and poverty alleviation.”

2.15 The SERP institutional design decision was a key choice with advantages and
disadvantages. It set the design framework for both this project and the APRPRP. The
Design Alternatives Table in the Project Appraisal Document included the option of a
social fund with Panchayat Raj links3. It rejected this option owing to a concern about
long-term sustainability and the argument that “(the) autonomous agency required to
channel funds to community organizations by-passes existing institutions (line
department/PRIs) for some of the activities”. The PAD went on to say that the chosen
option was similar to this option of a social fund with strengthened relationships with
PRIs. This is puzzling because the chosen option of using a state-supported NGO such as

3
  The Project Alternatives table in the later APRPRP PAD has very similar language for the other options but excludes
this option.
                                                           6


SERP also by-passed line agencies and PRIs. This issue is discussed more fully later
under Quality at Entry.

2.16 On balance, IEG concludes that a hybrid design with some project districts or
mandals implemented through experienced NGOs, some mandals experimenting with
strengthened direct relationships to PRIs, and some mandals experimenting with
enhanced coordination and oversight with promising rural microfinance institutions,
along with other experiments, would have given wider and more creative learning while
leaving behind a broader stock of capacity and skills outside government. In the event,
there was later (2003/2004) a PRI Pilot that supported Gram Panchayats with CIF grant
funds and did mapping of needs and funding of PRI capacity building to support the pilot.

2.17 M&E Design. M&E was carefully and thoughtfully designed. There were three
main elements. First, a comprehensive MIS-type data system was established mainly
aimed at tracking and measuring inputs and outputs. Second, the same system monitored
changes in processes. Third, evaluation was to be carried out partly through an impact
study carried out by an independent agency (in the event contracted to CESS (the Center
for Economic and Social Studies) and partly through smaller internal studies to be carried
out either by SERP itself or contracted to other agencies. As implemented and as
discussed later, the impact study consisted of a 2001 baseline survey, a 2004 midterm and
a 2006 completion survey. There were monitoring units at both the state and district level
feeding data into the MIS. During implementation, there was the addition of monthly
videoconferencing between the state and district monitoring units.

2.18     On balance, relevance of design is rated Substantial.

Implementation
2.19 The project was implemented by the Society for the Elimination of Rural Poverty
(SERP). Initially, implementation was largely as designed but a number of additional
activities were added or changed as unmet needs were revealed and as some designed
activities were found to be sub-optimal. The project was not formally restructured.

2.20 The main changes during implementation demonstrate a willingness to learn and
adapt during implementation, including a focus on service integration, project efficiency
and sustainability over the long-term. Foremost amongst these changes was the decision
to wholly adopt the women’s self -help group model, moving away from the less
successful community interest group model, since the latter proved to be less resilient
than the former. The financing model was also adjusted. Originally conceived as a grant,
the Community Investment Fund was re-structured as a revolving loan fund for sub-
project investment administered through the federated model. An increased level of
responsibility was placed with the district and sub-district level groups (the Zilla and
Mandal Samakhya) who managed and on-lent funds to the Village Organizations who in
turn would lend to the Self-Help Groups (see Annex B, Chart 1 for the relationships
between CBOs 4). As noted by the MTR (2003), the project would have benefitted from

4
  Note that the numbers in that Chart refer to the second project, APRPRP, but the structure was the same for both
projects.
                                            7


better client communication (throughout all group levels) during this shift since
beneficiaries were confused about the eventual need to pay back what had previously
been a grant.

2.21 Several administrative and institutional changes were introduced over the course
of the project cycle. The changes included a decision to move the project’s district level
administrative offices into the AP’s District Rural Development Agencies to improve
coordination; the creation of Tribal Project Management Units in predominantly tribal
districts to better integrate and access the State’s Integrated Tribal Development Agency;
and the addition of an Area Coordinator to fill a noticeable service delivery gap between
the District and the Sub-District Level. The project also supported the gradual
development of Community Resource Persons at the Mandal (sub-district) level to
support capacity building within the federated approach. Resource persons were recruited
mainly from the more successful Self-Help Groups, Village Organizations and Mandal
Samakhya who had demonstrated leadership and had the trust of their peers. Initially
funded by SERP, these organizers would eventually be paid for their services by the
communities themselves.

2.22 The project holds lessons for the Bank’s reorganization: as noted by the internal
Quality Assurance Group of the World Bank in a review of the project design (1999), one
of the project’s strongest features was its attention to cross-sectoral coordination, while
recognizing the “heavy transaction focus” of this type of project. Many of the
implementation changes made were highly responsive to this review that also
recommended a more direct transfer of resources, away from the state, to communities.
As the project progressed, there was a continued recognition of the need to build capacity
at all levels so that eventually communities could wean themselves off SERP assistance

Safeguard Requirements and Compliance

2.23 At appraisal, two safeguards were considered applicable, Environmental
Management (OP 4.01) and Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). The project was rated
Environment Category B. An Environmental Management Framework was prepared for
the Community Investment Fund for sub-project screening. Guidelines for Impact
Assessment were prepared for the construction of the residential schools. Both featured in
the Project Operational Manual. On indigenous people, a Tribal Development Plan was
prepared. The project focused substantially on areas with tribal people and therefore was
designed partly around their special needs through the demand-driven approach.
Implementation of the plan was through the state Integrated Tribal Development Agency
and its village level representatives in the Tribal Development Agency offices who, in
any case, would have been major project players. No significant problems were reported
in the ICR and none were encountered during the field visits by IEG. The main mission
observation is that the agricultural activities supported were non-pesticide low external
input approaches that are generally positive in terms of environmental impact.

Fiduciary Management and Procurement

2.24 Fiduciary management was rated satisfactory during supervision. On procurement
there was a period of skills build-up in the early years. As noted above, the project
                                                        8


decentralized its funds flow mid-way through the project (FY 04-05) so that funds went
directly from the Zilla Samakhya to the Mandal Samakhya. Repayment problems
emerged when the Community Investment Fund shifted from a grant to a revolving loan
model which resulted in some loss of tracking of the original CIF corpus (since the
resources became part of the MS loan funds and were by project close recycled several
times over).

Achievement of the Objectives
2.25 The objective of the project was to improve opportunities for the rural poor to
meet priority social and economic needs in the six poorest districts of Andhra Pradesh.

2.26 The main evidence on outcomes and impacts is derived from the Management
Information System, external research undertakings such as Deininger and Liu, 2009; an
end-line impact assessment conducted by the Center for Economic and Social Studies, or
CESS (2007),5 mission interviews with SERP staff, CESS, members of a sample of 15
SHGs, group interviews with select associated Village Organizations, Mandal and Zilla
Samakhyas, and other relevant stakeholders (see Annex B, Table 1, for the main APDPIP
activities). To assess the achievements of this project, this review considers outcomes
and impacts under two separate headings: (i) the extent to which the project improved
opportunities to meet the priority social needs; and, (ii) the extent to which the project
improved opportunities to meet the priority economic needs.

Objective No. 1. The Extent to which the Project Improved Opportunities for the Rural
Poor to Meet Social Needs

2.27 The project set out to improve opportunities for the rural poor to meet both their
priority social and economic needs by helping to collectivize into self-managed rural
institutions, or Self-Help Groups. The rural institutions were organized at four levels:
within villages, a number of Self Help Groups consisting of 10-12 women were formed.
The Self-Help Groups would then represent themselves within a federated model at the
Village, Sub-District (Mandal Samakhya) and District level (Zilla Samakhya). Against a
target of supporting 930,000 women in 180 Mandals to form 75,000 groups, the project
helped 2.3 million women join 171,618 groups in 316 Mandals across the then state of
Andra Pradesh.

2.28 The quality of the group decision-making and leadership matters with regard to
the ability of the model to sufficiently meet members’ social and economic needs. The
CESS (2007) impact evaluation suggests that there was only a 6 percent membership
attrition rate from the groups that were recorded, but information is not available on the
number of Self-Help Groups that did not survive early rounds. Data provided by the end-
line assessment suggests that membership attrition was not aligned with welfare
differences. According to the end-line, there was only a modest difference between poor

5The CESS Impact Study 2007 was based on a random sample design covering three of the six districts, Srikakulam,
Anantapur, and Adilabad. It included 33 program mandals and 12 control mandals, 204 program villages and 60 control
villages covering a total of 2,640 households, 1,590 SHGs, 264 VOs, 48 MSs and 3 ZSs.
                                                 9


and non-poor attrition (30 percent of those leaving were poor, 31 percent poorest of poor
and 24 percent were non-poor). Group leadership also experienced some challenges, with
73 percent of SHGs deciding not to rotate their leadership in spite of the project
guidelines.




  Box 1: The Self-Help Group Counterfactuals.
 For the formation of self-help groups, the two most likely alternatives would have been:
 (i) to have formed and supported self-help groups, or some other forms of affinity
 groups, through a wider range of NGOs, each, under guidance, adopting somewhat
 different approaches; or, (ii) to have relied on the banking system to create its own self-
 help groups to enable bank linkages and savings and lending services. This had already
 been done on a smaller scale in India with support from the National Agriculture and
 Rural Development Bank (NABARD). While it is unlikely that either of these
 approaches would have reached the scale within the same timeframe as the project, from
 the first option there might have been some longer-term advantages for testing and
 learning. For the second option – a commercial bank financial services counterfactual –
 the banks could have, and in the absence of the project probably would have, attempted
 to reach their poverty lending targets by supporting the establishment of some savings-
 and-loan groups of their own. However, it is doubtful whether they would have achieved
 more than a third of what was achieved by the project. Moreover, this approach
 presumably would have had a narrow focus on SHGs as a channel for lending with no
 attention to complementary women's needs such as accessing government services and
 mutual social support. For most of the other project activities, the counterfactual would
 have been to increase support to the line agencies and to expect them to perform better
 and with greater coordination and poverty focus. Again, it is difficult to conceive of this
 reaching the same level of achievement in the timeframe and, in any case, without some
 form of affinity group formation to channel services through.



2.29 Priority social needs that were met as a result of participation in the groups,
include increased access to social services – such as pension, life insurance, funds for
girls’ education, and links to employment opportunities. Increasingly, over time, the
groups federated at the sub-district and district level gained confidence and the ability to
directly approach government agencies. In interviews conducted by IEG, women’s
groups at these higher levels attested that they were able to break through service delivery
barriers. Prior to the groups, only their husbands could approach these revenue officers,
and in so doing, many of the services also required a bribe. The system had lacked
transparency and accountability, and the women had lacked a voice. While data on the
level of social services that were provided through the program is less substantial in the
first phase than the second, a SERP survey recorded that in 2005-2006, the Village
Organizations distributed over US$2 million of old age and other (disability) pensions to
members of the SHGs. Interviews conducted for this evaluation revealed that in many
cases, rural poor and disabled persons were not receiving the pensions that were due, or
in other cases, they were receiving only a portion of what was due. Pension officers in the
                                            10


SERP team helped to facilitate access, while members of the groups helped to identify
and connect the rural poor to SERP in order to access these services.

2.30 Insurance. Another service provided was life insurance. The federated model
helped to target and deliver life insurance benefits to more than three times the number of
rural poor women by project close than had received it early on in the project cycle. By
project close, more than half a million women in the SHGs purchased life insurance
products, raising the percentage of coverage from 4 percent of the rural poor covered in
2003 to 15 percent in 2007.

2.31 Food Security. The project had a strong focus on delivering nutrition and
education services for the poor. The project facilitated implementation of a food security
system. The community investment fund – targeted at the district level – enabled the bulk
purchase of food grains which in turn allowed for more affordable access of these
foodstuffs for some 550,00 participating households, on a credit basis.

2.32 Education. The project also aimed to provide access to education for girls from
poor families. The project sought to achieve this by using the federated system and SERP
to identify school age girls that were out of school and by convincing their families about
the importance of education. This advocacy helped to place 209,543 previously out of
school girls into public schools. The project also sought to achieve this aim by building
rural bridge schools for girl child laborers. It constructed 24 bridge schools in which
21,468 girls from poor families were enrolled. These new residential schools for girls are
reported to have outperformed the public schools in educational achievement standards.
All of these project activities helped the state to implement its Full Enrollment Policy.

2.33 Increasingly, over time, as women gained confidence, focus group discussion
facilitated by IEG revealed that women were using their collective power to confront
child marriages, domestic abuse, and child trafficking, although there is limited data on
this.

2.34 Consumption. As a result of the project support, there is evidence that
consumption smoothing helped to reduce the vulnerability of the rural poor. Deininger
and Liu (2009b) found that, as a result of the project, participants experienced an
incremental increase in per capita consumption of about US$16.8 per year, representing
an 11 percentage point increase over a control. Participants also experienced an
estimated increase in per capita intake of energy and protein and investment in non-
financial assets at levels that were significant as compared to a control. There are reasons
to believe that the true project benefits may be higher than measured in this study since,
due to the timing of the surveys, any nutritional gains in the first three years were not
picked up.

2.35 Political Participation. With regard to the assumption that social capital could
support greater political participation, and in turn, more meaningful representation of
women and the poor, the end-line impact assessment found that women participating in
SHGs were more likely both to contest and win local elections (CESS 2007). The impact
study found that 2.3 percent of SHG women members contested panchayat elections and
1.3 percent won compared to 1.5 percent contesting among nonparticipants with 0.7
                                            11


percent winning, the latter probably included some who were well-off and influential and
who were not interested in joining an SHG. At village level, women contesting elections
rose from 13 percent in 2002 to 23 percent in 2006.

2.36 In sum, this assessment finds that the extent to which the project improved
opportunities for the rural poor to meet social needs is rated High.

Objective No. 2. The Extent to which the Project Improved Opportunities for the Rural
Poor to Meet Priority Economic Needs

2.37 The project utilized two main vehicles to enable the rural poor to meet their
priority economic needs: A Community Investment Fund and a Bank Linkages program.
Both of these programs were run through the aforementioned federated model of self-
help groups.

The Community Investment Fund

2.38 The Community Investment Fund. The CIF was intended to finance the
demand-driven individual and collective livelihood sub-projects for the benefit of the
poor. Targeting was carried out at the district level (the six districts targeted by the
project were selected on the basis of the percentage of lower income populations,
including percentage of scheduled tribe, scheduled caste, and backward caste). At the
village level, a participatory identification of the poor exercise was conducted that
attempted to improve on the state level Below the Poverty Line method. Funds were also
allocated at the mandal level on the basis of a poverty ranking system.

2.39 Subprojects were originally designed to be awarded on the basis of a plan
prepared for each individual investment at the time of subproject appraisal. During
project implementation this was changed to a business plan, or a “micro plan” approach
whereby each Self-Help Group was required to draw up in some detail an investment and
financing proposal. Funds were then awarded at village and mandal level on the basis of
the feasibility of the plans. CIF funds were awarded to the mandals against criteria that
included relative wealth rank, with poorer mandals receiving more funds to distribute to
their members. By project close, Deininger and Liu (2009) report that 62 percent of a
surveyed sample of SHGs (n=1085) had accessed CIF funds.

2.40 According to the Management Information System, approximately 1 million
households benefited from access to some 36,477 income generating sub-projects. An
estimated two-thirds of CIF funds were used for agriculture (30 percent) or livestock (40
percent) and a substantial amount of these funds were invested in dairy production. The
remaining funds were used for non-farm investments.

2.41 Agriculture. As noted, approximately two-thirds of CIF funds were used for
agriculture or livestock investments. Non-farm activities, such as the establishment of
local village shops, represented about 20 percent of the fund utilization. A farm enterprise
study conducted by the implementing agency found that, based on a random sample of
475 subprojects, that the average rate of return for agriculture and livestock investments
was between 40-174 percent. The average rate of return for agriculture was found to be
44 percent. The end-line impact assessment found that the average incomes for
                                             12


participants from agriculture rose by 42 percent compared to 3 percent for non-
participants (Derived by IEG from Table 2.5 CESS 2007). To aid CIF impact, training,
provision of market information, and some infrastructure was provided. There was
training for collective procurement and marketing in agricultural commodities and dairy.
Marketing was carried out through 695 marketing centers set up at the district (Zilla),
sub-district (Mandal) and village level. The project supported a system of food
procurement and marketing that spanned 15,000 self-help groups, 1,500 village
organizations and 150 Mandal Samakhyas. Savings through lower transaction costs were
estimated by SERP to be about US$48 per household.

2.42 Non-Pesticide Management Practices (NPM). The main cropping activity
supported by the CIF was a program of Non-Pesticide Management Practices (NPM)
including reduced or zero fertilizer application aimed at reducing the costs of cultivation.
By 2006-07 this covered 186,000 acres. According to a survey conducted by the
implementing agency, there was a 75 percent per acre increase in income arising from
cost savings of between US$40 and US$120 from NPM. While IEG was not able to
validate this finding, it notes recently conducted research in India on one of the main
cropping technologies – the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) – a system that was
used widely by the program. This research shows that SRI continues to have a low level
of adoption in India – approximately 2 percent of the state’s paddy area – and exhibits
high levels of dis-adoption when program support is withdrawn partly due to challenging
management problems (Reddy, D.N. and Venkatanarayana, M., 2013).

2.43 Dairy and Livestock Production. The dairy activity made considerable strides in
setting up milk processing capacity. According to project data, investment in livestock
assets increased from US$746 to US$2,001 over the project period. The average rate of
return for dairy was found by a SERP study to be 103 percent. Average incomes of
participants from livestock enterprises, mostly dairy, rose by 85 percent in real terms
compared to 53 percent for non-participants. (Derived by IEG from Table 2.5 CESS
2007). The asset value of draught animals per household was substantially higher in the
APDPIP areas than in the newly adopting (at the time of the survey) APRPRP areas.

2.44 Employment Support. The project supported rural youths of families of SHG
members in gaining skills for employment in partnership with private organizations. In
FY2005-2006 a total of 11,883 youths were offered jobs, many of them in urban areas.
The main training mechanism was through the establishment with project support of
Livelihoods Advancement Business Schools at District and Mandal levels. A SERP
managed survey found that the youths’ average annual earnings were US$1,000 and that
about half of this was being remitted back to their families in rural areas. This program
represented an annual income generated of about US$1 million per year.

2.45 Land. CIF funds also supported legal assistance and surveyors to resolve land
disputes affecting the poor. According to the CESS Impact Assessment (2007), 3 percent
either got land titles or land restituted to them with the support of para-legals and the Law
University.

Group Savings and Lending and Formal Bank Linkages
                                                       13


2.46 Groups Savings and Lending. The second vehicle through which the project
supported economic opportunities was through a Groups Savings and Lending Scheme
that included a target to link rural poor women’s groups to formal banking systems, using
the group savings and lending model to demonstrate credit worthiness. As compared to a
2005 target of US$15 million, the project supported total groups savings of US$113
million. This saving took place inside the group, and was achieved through the
application of rules that required a set saving and participation standard, internal lending
of this saving at between 12-25 percent, and bookkeeping assistance.

2.47 The Community Investment Fund. Mid-way through the project cycle, the
project shifted the Community Investment Fund from a grant mechanism to a revolving
loan fund. This shift was, in part, taken to provide the formal banking system with
information on group borrowing performance. (The shift to micro plans was also
intended to provide performance information). As a result of the CIF fund recycling, the
data shows that for every Rs.1.0 of total CIF invested, the CBOs had a revolved turnover
of those funds of Rs.12.3 through repayment and re-lending. As discussed in the
implementation section however, confusion about the shift of the CIF fund from a grant
to loan program triggered a wave of non-payments. According to the CESS Impact
Study, the repayment rate for CIF internal lending declined between 2004 and 2006 from
71 percent to 18 percent.

2.48 Banking Linkages. The shift helped to leverage a significant amount of funds
from the formal Banks. The project set out to link 45,000 groups to formal banking
systems. As compared to the target, the project connected 155,091 groups to formal
banks, over three times the target. By project close, access to funds from the Bank
Linkages program provided a significant additional source of finance for rural poor
households. In aggregate, total fund mobilization through all available sources (CIF,
Banking Linkages, and other government programs) was estimated to be between
US$900 million and US$1 billion. In relation to the total spent on the Community
Investment Fund, this represents a leveraging of about US$12 for every US$1 of CIF.
According to the impact study, 57 percent of total funds at the SHG household level were
derived from formal banking sources.6

2.49 The Deininger and Liu paper (2009) also provides evidence on impact. Deininger
and Liu (2009) find that there was an estimated increase in per capita intake of energy,
protein and investment in non-financial assets that amounted to, respectively, 10 percent
(210 calories per day); 16 percent (7 grams of protein); 23 percent (Rs 720) per
household for the non-financial assets. Deininger and Liu (2009) consider this to be a
large effect, especially for the poor. Differentiating households by initial poverty level,
they find, for the initially poor group of households, increased consumption and
nutritional intake of about 15 percent, and increased asset endowments as high as 26
percent.


6At the SHG level, the Impact Study found that the distribution of the source of borrowed or grant funds of member
households was as follows: Banks 57 percent; CIF 29 percent; District Rural Development Agency 3 percent;
SC/ST/BC Minorities Corporation less than 1 percent; Other Line Departments negligible; Matching Grants 3 percent;
MFIs negligible; Other sources including money lenders and family members, 7 percent.
                                                          14


2.50 The CESS impact assessment (2007) found that household incomes of
participants over non-participants rose about 20 percent in real terms over the three years
between the mid-term survey and the final survey7. This incremental income was mainly
used for consumption smoothing: only 7 percent of participating SHG households were
recorded (CESS 2007) to have made productive investments. This is in part due to the
fact that first stage bank linkages were intentionally set at low levels to test borrower
capacity and were applied to consumption.

2.51 In sum, this assessment finds that the extent to which the project improved
opportunities for the rural poor to meet priority economic needs is rated Substantial.

EFFICIENCY

2.52 It is difficult to define the boundaries of the project for economic analysis since it
was built partly on linking SHGs with other actors, including the already existing state
and national social support programs and the banks. Many of the benefit streams have
multiple origins with costs that lie outside the project frame.

2.53 IRR/ERR for the Investments made under the Community Investment Fund.
The ex ante PAD efficiency analysis for APDPIP was limited in scope, based on the
argument that it was not possible at appraisal to predict what investments would be
selected by groups. The PAD developed some enterprise models, mostly agriculture and
livestock, as illustrative examples. These resulted in a range of internal rates of return
from 19 percent to 48 percent over ten-year model periods. As an indicative overall
efficiency measure, the PAD carried out a breakeven analysis and, as is often the case
with a breakeven methodology, found that a modest household annual incremental
benefit of US$15 would be sufficient to achieve the opportunity cost of capital.

2.54 The ex post ICR efficiency analysis used a SERP enterprise IRR analysis done in
February 2007 of 475 subprojects for a range of representative, mostly farm level,
investments, as well as the CESS findings to conclude that the actual incremental income
benefits to households were larger than was projected in the Project Appraisal Document
(PAD). The range of actual average IRRs per subproject category in the 2007 analysis
were found to be from 40 percent to 174 percent. The IEG mission has reviewed a sample
of the models and found them to be generally satisfactory in terms of methodology
although showing signs of being somewhat standardized on costs and optimistic on some
cost and benefit assumptions.

2.55 Consumption Benefits (Food and Consumer Durables) derived from the
Project as a whole. Deininger and Liu (2009b), applying a 0.9 discount factor, found a
net present value of benefits from the project of about US $1.69 billion assuming that
future benefits would be maintained only at the current level. They note that, even
assuming the consumption benefits only lasted for one year there was still a benefit cost
ratio of 1.5:1. The calculation does not include “other costs”, such as government
expenditures from state level social welfare and economic programs. However, in this

                                             15


case, such additional costs would have to raise total costs substantially for the IRR to fall
as far as the opportunity cost of capital.

2.56 Administrative Efficiency. Based on the cost figures for project management in
the PAD (p.77) and the ICR (p. 33) and the number of households reached, operational
efficiency was better than projected at appraisal, mainly because coverage was greater for
a similar cost. At appraisal US$9.84 million was to be spent on 930,000 households
giving a management cost of 7.2 percent of total costs and a cost of US$10.6 per
household. At completion, US$8.54 million had been spent to reach 2.29 million
households giving a management cost of 5.7 percent of total cost at US$3.7 per
household. However, caution should be exercised here since other parts of Government
contributed to the costs of supporting the social and economic activities facilitated by this
program. Interviews with informed stakeholders suggest that the US$3.70 figure is too
low. However, interviews with SERP staff also revealed that a considerable amount of
time is spent on implementing other Government programs in addition to the project
under review so there are also either reduced costs of alternatively additional benefits to
be considered.

2.57 The analysis did not include a calculation of the social welfare benefits – for the
individual, household and society as a whole.

2.58 Based on: (i) the lack of an aggregate IRR analysis; but (ii) high IRRs for the
productive enterprises; (iii) the high consumption benefits found; (iv) the moderate, but
likely under-estimated delivery costs; and, (v) the difficulty of accounting for the social
benefits, efficiency is rated Substantial.

OUTCOME

2.59 The Relevance of Objectives and Design are rated High and Substantial
respectively. The project was based on the premise that, beginning some fifteen years
ago, the rural poor women of Andhra Pradesh required social capital strengthening to
enable them to access more productive social and economic opportunities. The project
was designed to mobilize this capacity, however an opportunity was missed in the design
stage to test and adapt different service delivery models. Project design could have also
been strengthened by integrating a more considered long-term strategy for SERP and its
staff. The project highly achieved its objectives of improving opportunities for the rural
poor to meet priority social needs and substantially achieved its objective of supporting
priority economic needs. Based on substantial average internal rates of return for the
agriculture and livestock activities, high consumption benefits, but limited information on
the wider social benefits including capacity building, group formation, and reaching the
poorest poor, Efficiency is rated Substantial.

2.60   Outcome is rated Satisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
2.61 The project was sustained up to the current year 2014 since the follow-on and
overlapping project, the APRPRP, took over the support in the selected districts,
                                                           16


continued it, and extended it horizontally to all districts in Andhra Pradesh up to 2011.
To avoid duplications and since the Risk to Development is so closely linked to the risk
in the follow-on project, this is covered more fully under APRPRP. Risk (for both
projects) is rated Moderate.

Bank Performance
2.62 Quality at Entry. The preparation and appraisal by the Bank was satisfactory.
The PAD (p.4) had noted that "(the project) would potentially cover the complete range
of social and productive sectors, but because of the nature of rural poverty it is likely to
focus particularly on natural resource management, agriculture and basic social and
economic infrastructure..” Appropriately for this early stage, the project was supposed to
be experimental, the PAD noting that, if successful, the project would act as a model for
extension into other poor districts of the state. There was some weakness in the coverage
in the PAD of the coordination with other programs and agencies, such as the State
Steering Committee relationships between the CIGs, VOs, MSs and PRIs and there was
little discussion about how the project activities would be coordinated with the line
agency activities.

2.63 In terms of skills, the appraisal team had a satisfactory range of expertise with a
spread of skills in finance and community banking, community development, agriculture,
engineering, economics, social development and other skills. Peer reviewers included a
micro-finance specialist and a community organization specialist.

2.64 The project partnered with a highly skilled implementing agency, however more
could have been done to think ahead about their status as a quasi-government agency
delivering critical services to the poor and the transition strategy. The World Bank
adequately assessed and laid the groundwork for a sound safeguards compliance system,
including supporting the preparation of a Tribal Development Plan. Gender was
mainstreamed into the project design.

2.65 To improve targeting, under APDPIP and into the early years of APRPRP, there
was support for an innovative Participatory Poverty Mapping (PPM) exercise done in
each village of the state over the period 2002 to 2004. Based on the PPM exercise,
Livelihoods Enhancement Action Plans were developed. This poverty mapping was an
intensive and costly exercise and there have not been sufficient resources to repeat it8.

2.66 M&E was comprehensively designed, including a management information
system that would track inputs and outputs and an Impact Evaluation that included a
baseline, midline and an end-line survey. While several research assessments were
conducted throughout the life of the project, the project could have benefitted from more
qualitative indices in the MIS system to support a more systematic understanding of how
the investment in social capital through group formation, savings, and lending was
attributably linked to more productive economic opportunities. For those groups that

8It was found that it tended to categorize fewer persons as poor than the national BPL (Below Poverty Line) exercise
which is repeated every few years, the original purpose of which was the identification of eligibility for the public food
distribution program.
                                            17


engaged in productive investments, more also could have been learned about the
technical feasibility and outcomes associated with agriculture and dairy investments.

2.67   Quality at entry is rated Satisfactory.

2.68 Quality of Supervision. In 2002, the Quality Assurance Group of the World
Bank undertook an assessment of the quality of supervision and rated it satisfactory. The
assessment noted the appropriate focus on capacity building in communities to ensure a
participatory approach. The balance of expertise applied to the supervision work was
found by QAG to be optimal. The IEG mission findings are that the supervision team was
thorough and flexible, encouraging adaptation and experimentation where it was needed.
Areas where the team supported an experimental approach included micro-insurance,
innovative marketing products, the food credit line, and community level procurement.
While much of the creativity in this first project appears to have been generated internally
within the state by both SERP and community groups, the Bank also brought ideas from
other global and state experience, for example some of the lessons from earlier
watersheds projects and from the wider India and global micro-finance experience.

2.69 Ratings during supervision were consistently applied. The Bank financed a
special review to handle the large number of 8,500 CIF sub-project investments. One
creative supervision innovation adopted was that Bank supervision missions were
preceded by community participatory supervision missions, a form of self-supervision in
which MS staff along with project staff presented their findings on strengths and
weaknesses. This allowed supervision missions to focus on problem areas and learning.
The Bank also promoted the use of peer supervision.

2.70 Quality of supervision is rated Satisfactory. Taking into account the quality at
entry and the supervision ratings, overall Bank Performance is rated Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
2.71 Government Performance. From the late 1990s, prior to the approval of the
project, the state government had redirected its approach to rural development towards a
more bottom-up, community-based, approach with increased government line agency
accountability. The seeds of the project not only fell on fertile ground, there was a
convergence of interests particularly on the primacy of women’s needs. At the time , there
was also rising state government concern about the high level of remaining poverty and
poor health indicators which engendered strong government commitment. This was
manifested partly in the provision of a strong government project preparation team and
the early establishment of SERP. The state commitment was underlined by the
commitment of having the Chief Minister take the chairmanship of SERP’s General
Body. Preparation was a joint effort.

2.72 Government commitment was also demonstrated in the formation of a Poverty
Eradication Mission that was supported by experienced experts, by the Andhra Pradesh
Vision 2020 report, and, later by the sustained commitment to the follow-on project to
expand the program. The state government gave high priority to the staffing of the project
at all levels and especially to the continuity of staffing.
                                            18


2.73   Government performance is rated Highly Satisfactory.

2.74 Implementing Agency. SERP is an autonomous organization within the state
government(s). It is government owned under the Department of Rural Development and
the board is chaired by the Chief Minister. At senior levels, it is staffed by state
government staff on deputation and professionals on fixed-term appointments. The level
of autonomy is therefore not that of an independent NGO.

2.75 The IEG mission found that SERP staff (through both projects) were skilled,
dedicated, and innovative. They quickly adopted and implemented a program of
participatory rural development that involved over 2 million rural poor constituents. They
adopted and implemented new methods for participatory poverty mapping that were
different from the national poverty mapping method. All aspects of supervision managed
by the implementing agency were sound including safeguard compliance, community
procurement, and financial management. SERP staff operated at all levels, with only a
small cadre in headquarters in the state capital. Most SERP staff located themselves at the
district and sub-district levels.

2.76 Interviews with beneficiaries revealed a unanimous appreciation for their support
across all thematic areas financed by the project. The project could have benefited from a
beneficiary feedback mechanism, or a social accountability tool, to have allowed an
independent reporting back on SERP performance.

2.77 The education components were implemented by the Andhra Pradesh Social
Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (APSWREIS) (the Andhra Pradesh
Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society). APSWREIS is also a state
government initiated society (as of 1984) developed to provide quality education to poor
SC, ST, and other Backward Caste students by establishing residential schools.
Notwithstanding some early difficulties, APSWREIS satisfactorily implemented the
educational component, constructing the residential schools and operating them.

2.78   Implementing Agency performance is rated Satisfactory.

2.79 Taking into account the government and implementing agency ratings, overall
borrower performance is rated Satisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.80 M&E was generally well designed and implemented. In 2007, just after the
project closed, the project received, along with the overlapping follow-on APRPRP, the
World Bank Agriculture and Rural Development Department’s Golden Plough Award for
innovation in Supervision. The Award recognized that the process monitoring and the
flows of real time feedback from communities were innovative and effective. As noted
earlier under Relevance of Design, M&E was designed with a comprehensive MIS-type
data system mainly aimed at recording and measuring inputs, outputs, and processes.
Evaluation was carried out partly through an impact study carried out by CESS and partly
through smaller internal studies by SERP or, in some cases, contracted to other agencies.
The impact study consisted of a 2001 baseline survey, a 2004 midterm and a 2006
                                                          19


completion survey. Evaluation benefited by the high profile of the project and the
substantial database that drew the attention of a number of researchers. The project
became widely studied.

2.81 In terms of implementation, monitoring units at state and district level fed data
into the MIS. During implementation, there was monthly videoconferencing between the
state and district monitoring units. At intervals, process monitoring was carried out
looking particularly at village level institutional changes, beneficiary satisfaction, and
achievements in inclusiveness.

Lessons
2.82 Lessons for the two projects are aggregated under the follow-on project assessed
in the following chapter.



3. Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project
Background
3.1     The Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project (APRPRP) overlapped with
the earlier APDPIP. APRPRP became effective on May 13, 2003 and APDPIP closed on
December 31, 2006 and so there was about a three and a half year overlap. The aim was
to scale up and build directly on the APDPIP experience. APRPRP had similar objectives
but placed greater emphasis on convergence with government schemes, strengthening the
tiered community structures, financial inclusion, livelihoods, land access, and social
protection.

Objectives, Design, and Relevance (include M&E design)
3.2      The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) objective (p.20) was: "To assist
Andhra Pradesh to enable the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor, to improve
their livelihoods and quality of life."9

3.3    The PAD added that “the project builds upon the APDPIP and includes: (i)
expansion of the geographical coverage to the entire state; (ii) sharper focus on the poorer
and more vulnerable members … of rural communities; (iii) emphasis on livelihoods
issues of the poor with a focus on sustainable rainfed farming systems and non-farm
employment opportunities; (iv) pilots on community-based land purchase, and social risk
management instruments to reduce risks faced by the poor; and (v) inclusion of other

9
  The poorest of the poor were defined as those who could eat only when they got work and lacked shelter, proper
clothing, social respect, and means to send their children to school. The poor were defined as those having no land,
living on daily wages, and needing to send school-age children to work in times of crisis. The not-so-poor were defined
as having some land, proper shelter, sending their children to public schools, being recognized in society, and having
access to bank credit as well as public services. The non-poor were those having more than 5 acres of land, no problem
to obtain food, shelter, and clothing, hiring laborers, sending children to private schools, using private hospitals,
lending rather than borrowing money, and having considerable social status.
                                             20


stakeholders, especially local governments and the private sector …” The objective in the
Project Appraisal Document (p.3) was effectively the same except that it excluded the
opening phrase, "To assist Andhra Pradesh ..” These objectives were not changed over
the life of the project. This assessment uses the DCA language.

Relevance of Objectives.
3.4     The objective was consistent with the 2009 – 2012 Country Strategy, in particular
with the goal entitled "Enhancing Development Effectiveness - Social Protection”. The
strategy covered the improvement of social protection programs and services for the
poor, to assist them to cope with extreme/chronic poverty, and to manage the impacts of
shocks on their welfare. The project was also relevant in complementing and expanding
the earlier but still ongoing APDPIP.

3.5    The objective was relevant to the federal and state government's policy of
reducing poverty in rural areas. As discussed in the APDPIP chapter, Andhra Pradesh
was the first state to develop a sustained and long-term Rural Poverty Production
Program. This had two main objectives: (i) promoting economic mobility; and, (ii)
enhancing social protection by reducing vulnerability for the poor.

3.6      With this objectives statement, this second project went further in terms of
specification of outcomes by referring explicitly to livelihoods and quality of life. It also
added a greater focus on reaching the poorest. It should be noted that the extension
initially to 16 districts and 560 mandals, later expanded through Additional Financing to
the whole state, meant that, for the six districts covered under the APDPIP, this was a
continuation of the latter project building on what went before. In the new districts and
mandals, it was merely a start with building SHGs where they did not already exist from
earlier programs but with the advantage of a tested and modified proof of concept.
Effectively, the beneficiary coverage sequence was two million women targeted at
appraisal, then, with the first additional financing, 6 million, then, with the next
Additional Financing, 11 million. It was for this reason that the Institutional and Human
Capital Development Component went from US$25 million, which was originally only
for technical assistance, to US$156 million, a sixfold increase in cost for a nearly sixfold
increase in beneficiary coverage.

3.7    Relevance of objectives is rated High.

Design and Relevance of Design
3.8    The project as designed had five components:

3.9      Institutional and Human Capital Development (Appraisal US$25.19 million;
Additional Financing US$130.52 million; Actual US $155.70 million). This component,
initially, only provided technical assistance for: (i) strengthening and building institutions
for the poor including self-help groups and federated groups at the village and mandal
(sub-district) level; (ii) building capacity of line departments and local government to
focus on the needs of the poor and the poorest of the poor through joint planning,
monitoring, training and implementation; (iii) supporting reorientation of the Education,
                                             21


Health and Nutrition Departments towards the needs of the poor in 80 selected sub-
districts; and, (iv) building private sector partnerships for enhancing livelihoods
opportunities. The additional financing for this component was aimed at building greater
capacity of community organizations through activities beyond simply technical
assistance in areas such as technology, pilots and scaling up successful pilots such as
insurance, health and nutrition. Also, a PRI pilot activity was intended to enhance poor
women’s community influence on local government through elected office.

3.10 Community Investment Fund (Appraisal US$143.13 million; Additional
Financing US$43.35 million; Actual US$190.48 million). This component was intended
to transfer financial and technical resources to community-based organizations and local
governments to support sub-projects on a demand-driven basis in social development,
community infrastructure, income generation, livelihoods, and land purchases. The CIF
shifted, after the early APDPIP experience, from a grant fund to a lending fund.

3.11 Support to Pilot Programs (Appraisal US$7.45 million; Actual US$7.45
million). This component supported pilots covering strengthening local governments and
their response to the needs of the rural poor, social risk management and health to test
community-based insurance packages and a community managed comprehensive basic
health package to complement the insurance.

3.12 Support to Out of School Children (Appraisal US$57.38 million; Actual
US$57.38 million). This component supported the overall state goal to enroll all children
in school by 2005 by motivating parents and children to go to regular schools and bridge
camps to prepare them for formal education and to retain girls in formal schools until
completion of their secondary education through the construction of 64 residential
schools.

3.13 Support to Persons with Disabilities (Appraisal US$11.32 million; Actual
US$11.32 million). This component aimed to meet the needs of people with disabilities
in 80 sub-districts through social mobilization and building local institutions to focus on
the needs of disabled persons. It sought to improve livelihoods including supporting
caregivers and promoting coordination in health and education interventions from
government while also encouraging community-based interventions.

3.14 Project Management (Appraisal US$17.72 million; Additional Financing
US$32.38 million; Actual US$50.10 million). This supported the activities of the main
implementing agency, the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP), including
staff for the state and district project-management units, independent monitoring and
evaluation, environmental management training, and special studies.

3.15 There was no major change in the original components in terms of broad intent
but there was continued evolution of processes and some additional activities, including
further evolution of the community organization model, additional capacity building, a
number of experimental activities, and changes of scale with the two Additional
Financing tranches.
                                            22


Relevance of Design
3.16 The project objectives and design were consistent with GOAP’s long-term Rural
Poverty Reduction Program which aimed to “eradicate povert y; promote human capital
development; focus on the welfare of children, particularly girls, women, the old, and the
infirm; and build an equitable society in which people participate in making decisions
which affect their lives and livelihoods”.

3.17 Results Framework. The results framework provided in the PAD established a
logical chain between the intended outcomes and the interventions to be financed. The
project was designed to provide support for building and strengthening self-managed
institutions of the poor. This included self-help groups and the federated umbrella
organizations. It aimed to build the capacity of line departments and local governments.
The design also focused on building private sector partnerships for livelihoods
opportunities. It called for the transfer of financial and technical resources towards
community-based organizations and local governments to support subprojects on a
demand-driven basis. While largely based on SHGs, the design also included support to
help retain girls in schools up to the end of secondary education including the provision
of school facilities and support for persons with disabilities needing prostheses, training,
employment and other assistance. The indicators were generally sound although there
could have been better specification of how empowerment and how responsiveness of
local government was to be measured.

3.18 Targeting. Targeting was addressed in the design by the following approaches:
(i) coordination and convergence of all the different state anti-poverty programs; (ii)
steering committees were to be set up at state, district and mandal level to facilitate
poverty data sharing and targeting (PAD p. 10); (iii) a database was to be developed
based on Participatory Poverty Assessments; (iv) training on the needs of the poor was to
be carried out for line agencies; (v) government orders on poverty focus had been
recently issued on poverty focus for all line agencies.

3.19 Relevance of Component Design. The components outlined above were
consistent with the objectives. Strengthening and building institutions for the poor
including self-help groups and federated groups at the village and mandal level was
needed to establish the platform for support. There were alternative options to women’s
self-help groups, for example a program of conditional cash transfer or a stronger
government safety net. However, neither would have enhanced women’s empowerment
at scale with potential for sustainability. Financing was important but it was the
connection of financing to women’s empowerment on a large scale that was central to the
concept. The reason the project shifted away from CIGs was because of concerns about
sustainability when there was only a single enterprise binding the members in
transactions related to that enterprise. While in some cases such groups may have been
productive and sustainable, it was believed that they would not have offered the scale of
voice and the webs of social and economic linkages and the wider purpose offered by
women’s SHGs.

3.20 Building capacity of line departments and local government to focus on the needs
of the poor and the poorest of the poor through joint planning, monitoring, training and
                                            23


implementation was important to ensure complementary services to support the poor.
Reorientation of the Education, Health and Nutrition Departments towards the needs of
the poor in 80 selected sub-districts was a necessary first step towards enhancing welfare
and skills and improving health both for its own sake and to enhance the productivity of
labor and therefore livelihoods. While there were specific proposals for some line
departments, others were to be redirected towards a poverty focus largely by training. As
discussed later, in the event, some – such as agriculture – felt sidelined.

3.21 Building private sector partnerships was expected to give greater public resources
leverage for enhancing livelihoods opportunities and helped to build greater capacity of
community organizations. The CIF component was to contribute support for sub-projects
on a demand-driven basis. The social development, community infrastructure, income
generation, livelihoods, and land purchases supported by the CIF were complementary to
other activities, for example creating land assets for the poor in order to raise incomes to
improve livelihoods. The pilots for strengthening local governments, the social risk
management and health pilots to test community-based insurance packages, and the pilots
for the community managed comprehensive basic health package complementing the
insurance support, filled gaps in the social services support for the poor. The activities
supporting out-of-school children and people with disabilities enabled reaching the
poorest and most disadvantaged with support that would have long term benefits in terms
of livelihoods and dependency.

3.22 Relevance of Institutional Design. Three main options to the design were
explored in the PAD (p. 17):

      (i) Working exclusively with the elected Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs). The
       PAD enumerated a number of political difficulties of doing this. In particular it
       noted that the funding of PRIs was likely to be subject to power structures noting
       that there was at that time “an evolving relationship between PRIs and state
       politicians and administration.” This was a valid concern. From 2006 there were
       delays in panchayat elections and between 2011 and 2013 there were further
       political disputes about the election timing and the percentages of reservations for
       the Backward Classes. IEG accepts that increasing the powers and roles of the
       PRI, relying on the PRI structure at that time and place, would have been risky.

      (ii) Independently managed “social fund” transferring resources to NGOs
       working directly with the poor. This was a more realistic option. The
       disadvantages listed in the PAD were not entirely convincing in light of the
       proposed continued use of SERP. The disadvantages given were that such an
       option would by-pass the PRIs and so was less sustainable. However the SERP
       arrangement presented the same risks. The second objection posed was that a
       social fund model would have reduced learning. The third objection was based on
       a belief that the NGO model would create dependencies and that funds for the
       communities would be crowded out by the NGOs hired. IEG finds all of these
       risks to be similarly present with the SERP model selected.

       (iii) Pursuing convergence of line departments with anti-poverty programs
       through restructuring them and improving their public expenditure management.
                                             24


       The PAD argued that the two main disadvantages of this option were that a
       change in line departments on this scale would require broader reforms better
       handled through a development policy operation. Sequencing was also an issue.
       Such broad reforms, the PAD posited, would require strengthened social capital
       and a more inclusive, responsive, budgetary approach.

3.23 While the PAD-postulated option of social fund transfers to NGOs was the most
plausible alternative, this would have been more plausible for the first phase when testing
the design prior to scaling was the imperative. As suggested in the PAD but not fully
followed up, the project could have benefited from a more hybrid approach, whereby the
NGO sector worked hand in hand with SERP to complement activities and to support
capacity building of the rural institutions for a smooth and effective transition out of full
support once the community bodies were deemed mature. Using a number of NGOs was
discussed during project preparation in workshops with the NGO sector, and some
activities were undertaken, but NGOs were not integrated in a systematic way into project
design. The suggestion that the NGOs could have worked on specialized sectors, such as
enabling deeper reach to the dalits or the disabled and connecting them to services
deserves further attention in future stages.

3.24 A separate design issue that came to complete fruition in the second stage was the
decision to move away from mixed gender community interest groups (many were
mostly men) towards full support for female empowerment through the Self Help Group
model. Given the disempowered position that women held and that women continue to
face - and their potential to lift both themselves and their families out of poverty if given
the economic opportunity - this theory on women’s groups still holds. However, from a
sociological perspective, more could have been done to sensitize and educate men about
savings, investment decisions and prudent lending (including the importance of
repayment) since in many cases, the surveys suggest decisions in the household are taken
by or in tandem with the member’s husband. Mother-in-laws were supported in joining
SHGs, but the mission found this level of sensitization to be less important than the
interactions that could have been useful with the opposite gender.

3.25 Relevance of M&E Design. M&E design was a continuation of the design set up
during the first project but modified with experience. It included a comprehensive MIS
system that became increasingly more sophisticated over time. The main weakness was
that it did not offer much evidence to track the application of borrowed funds, so the
impact of lending, whether from the CIF or commercial banks, has been difficult to
measure. However, this would have taken it beyond an MIS system and would probably
have called for some sample field survey work to uncover emerging problems with the
implementation of productive investments. Such a study would have been intermediate
between the MIS and the Impact Study.

3.26   Relevance of design is rated High.

Implementation
3.27 Project Financing and Dates. The focus in this section is on the changes in
implementation compared with the design. The total project costs almost doubled from
                                                          25


US$266.19 million to US$472.43 million through additional financing with a closing
date extension of three years. There was also a reallocation of funds in September 26,
2011. The first additional financing was for US$65 million approved on July 10, 2007.
The second was US$100 million on December 22, 2009. By project closing, US$333.9
million had been disbursed. Trust funds provided US$3.6 million additional for studies
out of which US$2.1 million was disbursed. The projection at the time of appraisal was
that local communities would provide US$13.96 million and local financial
intermediaries US$52.1 3 million. The project team considered the corpus of savings of
the community organizations to be their contribution.

3.28 Strategy Shift. Just over a year after project effectiveness there was an important
strategy shift. The original strategy had been to support, through matching grants,
Common Interest Groups (CIGs) oriented around an economic interest. However, the
prior project (still under implementation at the time of this project design) found that the
women’s self-help groups were more likely to repay the bank loans, and thus more likely
to go to scale. With the Self-help Group model, the focus shifted away from the dual
model (economic interest models and women’s self-help groups) towards women’s
groups that engaged in savings, bank linkages and productive investments .

3.29 Financing Shift. As discussed in the previous review, the Community Investment
Fund was switched from a grant giving mechanism to a revolving loan fund. The aim of
the switch was to support greater group participation and use of funds through revolving
credit, and cost-recovery. The shift was also designed to allow the poor, though a group
lending model and repeat credit usage, to build up a track record with the Banks.

3.30 Monitoring and Evaluation. There was a strong focus on M&E implementation
across all districts down to the Self-Help Group level. The extensive data is publicly
available on the SERP websites (now separate for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana). In the
database there was more focus on output data such as group participation than on
outcome evidence at the group or individual household level. But M&E was
supplemented by an Impact Assessment and there were a number of topic studies
conducted by SERP and outside researchers that provided evidence on outcomes.

3.31 The Mid-Term Review (2006) report suggests a pro-active approach to
implementation. The main recommendations included: benchmarking CBO performance
at each level; more capacity support for community resource persons10; the need for a
staff grievance system; diversification in marketing procurement centers (including
franchises with retail chains); attention to backward linkages of fodder and feed for dairy
activities; the need for funding on-farm trials and demonstration for the non-pesticide
management activities; expansion of the jobs placement activities; scaling up of the land
purchase activity; training for elected women’s representatives; staffing and systems
improvement in the insurance activities; continuation of the nutrition work with no major
changes; greater involvement of VO, MS and ZS in the support for out-of-school
children; scaling up the support for persons with disabilities and support for partnerships
and increased disability certification; the need to address the multiple accounts at the

  These were people working at village or mandal level with skills in a wide range of areas including health, social
mobilization, agriculture, bookkeeping, land acquisition, and family councilors, some needing further training.
                                            26


District Project Management Unit level which could weaken controls; and the need for
decisions on some of the outstanding contracts.

Safeguard Requirements and Compliance

3.32 The project was a Category B. It triggered the Environmental Assessment
safeguard (OP 4.01), the Pest Management safeguard (OP 4.09), the Cultural Property
safeguard (OPN 11.03), the Indigenous Peoples safeguard (OD 4.20), and the Safety of
Dams safeguard (OP 4.37). There were no major safeguard issues reported in the ICR or
found during the mission.

3.33 On the environment and pest management safeguards, the activities with some
potential risk were agriculture and livestock. The support for cropping was designed as a
low input non-pesticide management approach and was implemented as such using zero
or low artificial input techniques including vermiculture (composting using worms in
organic material) and application of manure and a number of natural pest management
techniques including pest counting and the use of natural Neem tree oils and extract. In
livestock, there was limited grazing activity, mainly with sheep and goats while there was
promotion of stall-feeding. The dairying activity was almost entirely stall-feeding with
cultivated fodder. On cultural property, there was a negative list for sub-project screening
applied to all the CIF subprojects. On Indigenous Peoples, a Tribal Development Plan
was prepared and implemented. A substantial part of the project support was directed
towards support for tribal people including measures to increase land access through the
establishment of rights.

Fiduciary Management and Procurement

3.34 The Mid-Term Review raised some concerns about the large amounts of unused
funds in various CBO accounts but this issue was gradually resolved during the second
part of the project. Bookkeeping was an important part of support provided to SHG's. As
the project evolved and expanded, improved accounting systems were developed suitable
for each CBO and each state administrative level. An Electronic Fund Management
System was developed which improved the ability to keep track of transactions. This was
then linked to the Core Banking System (CBS) platform. The package of systems enabled
monitoring of fund flows and utilization across accounting units. Mission interviews with
SHGs and bookkeepers found generally orderly and sound bookkeeping practices; the
books were available for inspection.

3.35 The project was not without some intermittent financial issues that needed
attention and resolution. Implementation Status Reports indicate that there were issues
with delayed utilization certificates on sub-project investments that SERP was able to
gradually address. There was important work under the project to put in place a standard
accounting system at VO, MS, and ZS levels. There were particular issues including
accounts staffing problems with the Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions
Society handling the girls education program. These were gradually resolved. There were
also staffing vacancies and delays at the senior finance level in SERP. In 2004-2005,
there were some qualifications by auditors. These issues were rectified but in 2006 there
was a delayed submission of statements. At one point, supervision ratings of financial
                                                         27


management were lowered from Satisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank team
appears to have been pro-active on financial issues as they emerged, there was an agreed
Action Plan at the MTR. One supervision mission in 2004 called for action on different
definitions being applied in different areas or branches on what constituted an overdue
loan, on the calculation of recovery rates, and on what were delinquencies and losses.
Standard definitions were later adopted. There was pressure to fix financial problems
quickly in order to process the first additional financing.

3.36 On procurement, the most significant activities were consultancies and service
contracts and the construction of the schools for girls. The majority of the procurement of
goods was carried out at community level by SHGs and higher level by MSs and ZSs.
The project developed manuals for procurement procedures. There was a considerable
amount of procurement training provided under the project. SERP enhanced its skills in
procurement, building on its experience with the prior project. Commercial banks, under
the bank linkages activity, and with support from SERP, monitored the application of
loan funds at SHG level to check that funds were being used for the purposes set out in
the micro plan. No major issues were reported on procurement.

Achievement of the Objectives
3.37 The objective of the project was to enable the rural poor, particularly the poorest
of the poor, to improve their livelihoods and quality of life. In interpreting the term
livelihoods we apply the following definition: “A livelihood is a means of making a
living. It encompasses people’s capabilities, assets, income and activities required to
secure the necessities of life.”11 This definition overlaps with the quality of life element,
but we assume that quality of life reaches beyond capabilities, assets, income and
activities to social changes such as, better health, supportive social activities, reduced
violence in the home, confidence gains, support for the disadvantaged, and release of
time from drudgery.

3.38 The main evidence for output and outcome achievements comes from the
following sources: the CESS Impact Study (2010); a study by Prennushi and Gupta
(2014),     independent research papers, the SERP database, the Implementation
Completion Report, supervision reports, and mission interviews with a range of SERP
and government officials, a sample of 15 SHGs, elected PRI officials, staff of CBOs
(Mandal Samkhyas and Village Organizations), Community Resource Persons, bank
branch managers, NGOs, and experienced observers of the program (see Annex B, Table
2, for the main APRPRP activities).

3.39 Rural Institutions. To enable the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor,
to improve their livelihoods and quality of life, the project continued to invest in the
formation of rural institutions comprised of and led by the poor (See Annex B, Chart 1
for the relationships between the CBOs). By project end, 11.3 million women were
participating in 1 million project supported Self-Help Groups in the now states of Andhra
Pradesh and Telangana. This level of participation is five times the original target set. Of

11International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies definition (source ifrc.org website under “What is
a Livelihood?” Most other sources have similar language.
                                            28


the 11.3 million women participating, 2.85 million were considered poorest of the poor.
According to the Impact Assessment, based on a sample survey, 70 percent of
participating households were either poor of poorest of the poor.

ENABLING THE RURAL POOR, PARTICULARLY THE POOREST OF THE POOR, TO IMPROVE
THEIR LIVELIHOODS

3.40 Savings and Borrowing. Like the first phase project, APDPIP, the project
promoted group formation, savings and internal lending. Total group savings is reported
to have increased from US$66 million (US$113 million by the end of APDPIP) to
US$1.13 billion by project end. Groups interviewed by the IEG mission attested to
lending internally at a rate of 12.5 percent. The project also utilized the Community
Investment Fund, with total project costs equaling US$190 million in the form of a
revolving loan fund. However, unlike the first phase, members had greater access to
capital through a Banking Linkages Program from which they sought the bulk of
borrowing. The Impact Study found that 69 percent of SHGs had received bank loans
and, of those, 75 percent were distributing equally. Prennushi and Gupta (2014) report
that participant women were able to borrow up to two and a half times more than the non-
participant women during the study period. The amount of credit available through the
Bank Linkages program grew from US$404 million at project start to about US$7.9
billion by project end.

3.41 The mission found conflicting messages being given to SHGs about savings. On
the one hand, the project discourages holding too much money for long periods in group
savings accounts. Holding too much money for too long can result in a group
performance downgrade. It is believed that savings should be recycled internally through
on-lending within the group, preferably for productive purposes. On the other hand, bank
branch managers want and encourage SHGs to hold substantial amounts of savings partly
because savings are seen as a form of collateral and partly because it contributes to the
branch being able to meet its monthly deposit targets. In one case an SHG group
interviewed reported that a branch manager was preventing them from using their
deposited savings to reduce their indebtedness when their repayments had fallen behind.

3.42 SHG borrowing came from a number of sources. According to the impact
assessment, total borrowing of all participant households increased by about 60 percent
between baseline and end line. Roughly 40 percent of this increase was from project
supported borrowing, another 40 percent came from informal borrowing (money lenders),
and about 20 percent was from other banking sources. The impact assessment estimated
that the average level of indebtedness at the household level for participants was Rs.7,250
versus Rs.5,350 for non-participants. However, the impact evaluation also found that
participants had much greater access to lower interest rates through formal sources of
lending.

3.43 Investments. Investing through the two sources of financing, the CIF and access
to formal banking services, the most commonly sought investments were livestock (56
percent, with an average loan size of US$323); agriculture (17 percent, with an average
loan size of US357); Non-Farm activities (13 percent, with an average loan size of
                                            29


US$316); and trade and services – that could also be considered non-farm activities (10
percent, with an average loan size of US$380).

3.44 Assets and Expenditures. With increased access to capital, there is evidence that
there was asset accumulation and increased expenditures on social and economic
priorities by the poor. The impact assessment estimated that on average, there was a net
increase in the total value of assets for participating poor households of Rs. 103,774 and
Rs. 64,234 for the poorest of the poor households. Prennushi and Gupta (2014) reported
that, from 2004 to 2008, the poorest program participants’ monthly per capita
expenditures increased 9.1 percent annually compared to 6.6 percent for non-participants.
They also found that the project’s impact on asset accumulation was stronger with length
of program exposure.

3.45 Food Security and Consumption. The project supported a food security
initiative through which some 3.4 million households were helped to gain access to the
public food distribution system and food credit facilities. The CESS Impact Assessment
found that food expenditures per household decreased by about 8 percent over the project
period with increased consumption of more nutritious foods. It was estimated by SERP
that the bulk procurement of food arranged by the District and Sub-District organizations
(the Zilla and Mandal Samakhyas) helped to cut out the middlemen and to pass on these
savings to the SHGs. SERP estimated these savings to be roughly US$48 per household.

3.46 Owing in part to savings on food, the impact evaluation estimated that the average
increase in consumption per poor household was Rs.14,843 for the poor participants and
Rs.13,852 for the poorest of the poor.

3.47 Income Effects. Income effects were assessed by the impact evaluation. The
evaluation found that the average annual income increase of participants over non-
participants was US$107 for the poorest of the poor and US$263 for the poor. According
to the evaluation, the percentage of participating households that fell below the poverty
line dropped from 29.8 percent at baseline to 17.5 percent by project close, compared to a
control group of households who barely moved from a baseline of 29.8 percent to 27.5
percent by project close. Prennushi and Gupta (2014) found that impacts were stronger
across most impact variables for the poorest and the poor and that the poorest mid and
late joiners as well as the poorest Scheduled Tribe early participants had about Rs. 1,800
more savings than the non-participants.

3.48 Increased incomes were in part achieved by economic diversification. While the
project had a heavy focus on agriculture and livestock activities, it also provided
opportunities for the rural poor to diversify into non-farm productive opportunities.
Activities that were supported included training and credit for petty trading, handicrafts,
pot making, sari making, the running of small hotels, and other small business ventures.
By project close, the impact evaluation found that the percentage of household income
being derived from non-farm activities was 48 percent for project participants but 37
percent for non-participants. Diversification favored the poor. For both the poor and
poorest of the poor, income derived from non-farm activities was estimated to be about
55 percent. There was a 34 percent recorded increase in self-employment for poor
                                           30


participants compared to 24 percent for non-participants and a 32 percent increase for the
poorest of the poor participants compared to 17 percent for non-poor participants.

3.49 These effects were complemented by support for marketing. The project provided
support for commodity marketing where the volume of marketed produce through the
supported channels in 2011 reached a value of US$344 million. This is believed to have
raised farm gate prices which was expected to contribute to farm household incomes.

3.50 A weaknesses in the agriculture approach however pertains to the narrow focus on
one type of agricultural practice that was heavily promoted by the project. The
Community Investment Fund made credit available for agricultural investments, but, in
cropping, this was limited to support for Community Managed Sustainable Agriculture,
or CMSA, that provided finance and technical assistance for low input or organic
agriculture. For a household with no interest in low or zero artificial input practices in
agriculture, or looking for a range of cropping technologies to spread risk or for
diversification, the project had limited technical support to offer. The agriculture
department played almost no role in the CMSA and there was little coordination with it.

3.51 Livelihood Support for the Most Vulnerable. Many disabled persons have been
able to form SHGs and have, as a result, accessed more productive activities. A
substantial program of disability assessments was carried out with project support
covering some 938,000 people. Roughly one-third of this cohort was mobilized into
32,780 SHGs. A third of this total cohort was able to access credit – at a level of about
US$25,000 per disabled group. Investments were made in economic activities, and the
funding was utilized to cover health and education expenses. SERP facilitation and the
federated service delivery model helped to link the disabled with their rightful pensions,
insurance and the public employment program.

3.52 Livelihood Support for Youth. There was a job scheme for youth funded partly
by the project and focused on skill development programs through which about 400,000
rural youth were trained under the Employment Generation and Marketing Mission
established in 2005. Some 300,000 were placed in jobs with 3,500 companies.

3.53 Access to Land. Land purchase was estimated in a SERP study to give an IRR of
40 percent. The legal and survey assistance of the project helped resolve 430,000 tenure
disputes improving accessibility to 875,000 acres. The land access activities were well
focused on a paramount need, to get at least some access to land into the hands of the
poorest. However, Prennushi and Gupta (2014) found only a modest gain overall in land
access for the poor, with non-poor participants experiencing the most significant effects
from land purchase.

3.54 In sum, this assessment finds that the extent to which the project enabled the poor,
particularly the poorest of the poor, to improve their livelihoods is rated High.

ENABLING THE RURAL POOR, PARTICULARLY THE POOREST OF THE POOR, TO IMPROVE
THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE

3.55 Building Capacity. The project effectively helped to build the capacity of
millions of rural poor women to begin to take charge of their priority social and economic
                                            31


needs. It helped to develop a federated model of service delivery – a central organizing
platform – that helped to leverage millions of women’s voices for more accountable and
effective service delivery. As a leveraged whole, women repeatedly reported having
access for the first time to government decision-makers – such as sub-district and to a
lesser extent district revenue agents, with whom only their husbands had spoken before.
Anecdotally, they reported being invited to “sit in the chair, across from the district
revenue officer, rather than the floor.”

3.56 Group leaders at the district and sub-district level for the most part volunteer their
time towards this endeavor, out of duty and passion for the rural poor. When interviewed,
group leaders revealed that they willingly forgo several days of paid labor to enable this
platform of support. In group interviews, IEG asked members of leadership why they
sacrificed days of paid work to support the work of the samakhya? The most frequently
occurring answers were:

      Social Recognition
      A Sense of Civic Responsibility
      Opportunity to get new Knowledge and Skills – share knowledge with the Village
      It brings us out of the home to learn new things
      Brings Enjoyment

3.57 Recognizing that many of these leaders have had to manage social and household
pressures during a decade that has been witness to a significant level of transformation in
the project areas, IEG asked members of the samakhya whether their husband or mother
in laws objected to their level of commitment that they have dedicated to the program.
The following responses were most representative of the most commonly expressed
sentiments of members of these groups:

      “We are expected to cook, feed the children and take care of the house and then
       we can go to the group meetings.”
      “There are problems when travel is very far, and when it takes too long.”
      “Why are you going to these meetings? We are not getting paid!”
      “You are going and attending the meetings – now you are asking for so many
       rights in the household.”
      “If we return at 7pm, then you have to feed the buffalo. When the woman says that
       the man should help, the husband says you are expecting equal rights.”
      Mother in laws are coming on board because now the mother in laws are part of
       the SHGs.

3.58 Group interviews conducted by IEG were intended to further probe findings from
the impact assessment and the literature that had conducted their investigation more than
five years ago. In the widely circulated World Bank study, Voices of the Poor, Narayan et
al (undated) found that in the District of Anantapur, "self-help groups supported a
fundamental shift in women's roles in the family and outside. The improvements in
economic well-being of households whose women belong to groups were mirrored by a
fundamental change in women's roles in the family and community. ”
                                             32


3.59 Voice and Participation in Decision-Making. This economic empowerment was
made possible by enabling millions of women access to increasingly higher levels of
formal banking finance, which in many cases endowed them with a greater voice in
decision-making at the household level than they were previously afforded. By project
close, participants had accessed US$7 billion of finance, over which many had at least
partial allocative control. This economic empowerment has in turn led to greater voice in
both household and village level decision-making. The CESS impact assessment, for
example, found that participation in community discussions on drinking water, irrigation
facilities, access to education, approach roads, and child labor were higher for
participants than non-participants (and with regard to child labor, non-participants had no
voice at all). Prennushi and Gupta (2014) similarly found general improvements over and
above the evolving societal trends at the time with regard to women’s ability to leave the
home without permission, to disagree with their husband, and to participate in village
meetings. After controlling for initial propensity to participate, the impact assessment
additionally found that project participants were 4 percent more likely to attend village
gram sabha meetings than nonparticipants as of project close.

3.60 The project also provided a range of services – or helped to connect the poor to
government entitlements that they had previously not been able to access. Prennushi and
Gupta (2014) found that participants were significantly more likely to benefit from the
targeted government programs, particularly the employment guarantee program, but also
the midday meals program, hostels, and the housing program. The project supported the
development of village health centers with a focus on teaching visitors about nutrition,
maternal and child health. The idea was to teach women about the best way to care for
themselves and their pregnancy outside of the influence of the home. As such, the centers
were accessible by both SHG participants and non-participants. Data on health related
outcomes is for the most part unavailable in project documentation. However, Prennushi
and Gupta (2014) also found that indicators of maternal and child health did not show
much improvement. The percentage of births that took place at a facility or with trained
attendance increased, for both participants and nonparticipants. However, this is not
surprising since, based on mission visits, many project non-participants had access to
these services and took advantage of them.

3.61 In sum, this assessment finds that the extent to which the project enabled the poor,
particularly the poorest of the poor, to improve their quality of life is rated High.

Efficiency
3.62 The ICR first estimates a Financial Rate of Return (FRR) aggregating the benefit
streams and including the total project investment cost. The FRR comes to 18.1 percent.
In a second analytical step, the analysis then adds the large institutional SHG/bank
linkage activity which raises the FRR to 26.3 percent. Including, in a third analytical step,
the further benefits of marketing and employment raises it to 31.2 percent. Finally,
adding some omitted additional project costs lowers that figure marginally to 30.1
percent.

3.63 The ICR reports the SERP analysis of a sample of 475 sub-projects selected in
proportion to the sub-project population in DPIP. The study found a range of sub-project
                                                             33


IRRs between 174 percent and 40 percent, higher than the projections in the PAD12.
While not without value as representative models, this sample is the same that is given in
the APDPIP efficiency analysis so it dates from February 2007, only four years into
APRPRP. It covers only the six APDPIP districts. It is therefore not fully representative
over districts or time period although the six APDPIP districts were picked up by
APRPRP once APDPIP closed. A second source of data was a survey for the National
Rural Livelihoods Program covering a sample of 153 households benefiting from
livelihoods investments, we believe purposively selected, and another 250 households
surveyed associated with groups and federations in livelihoods activities. The data from
these was used to generate representative models supplemented, according to the ICR,
with other evidence from published materials, GOI, and NABARD. In aggregating the
benefit stream, the ICR applies the derived enterprise models to the five main project
activities at the scale covered by the project. A third source of efficiency data used by the
ICR was the CESS Impact Study (2010).

3.64 There are three benefit stream valuation questions related to the rate of return
analysis (ICR p. 51). First, the assumption of the average net benefit of $142 per
household per annum for all households is higher than the Impact Study data suggests.
However, the $142 is close to the average income gains for the poor and the poorest of
the poor. Second, the bank linkages net benefit stream used in the ICR analysis is of a
completely different order of magnitude than the livelihoods activity – the present value
of costs in the bank linkages is about 15 times the costs of the livelihoods activities –
making the livelihoods investments almost irrelevant in an aggregate IRR. While this is
not incorrect methodologically, it does prompt a question about how much of the bank
linkages are really attributable to the project. In the absence of the project, the banks
would have done some of their own group formation, based on discussions with Bank
team staff, perhaps about one third of what was achieved. If that is a correct assumption,
only a portion of the bank linkages benefits should be included. However, if this
adjustment were made, it would reduce only the scale of the bank linkages attributable
benefit stream, it would not alter the IRR of that activity since both costs and benefits
would be reduced13. It would however alter the Net Present Value. Third, the interest rate
subsidy (Pavala Vaddi) that is listed on page 19 of the ICR in the Efficiency section is not
a project benefit it is a government subsidy. However, it is not clear whether this subsidy
was, in fact, treated as part of the benefit stream and added into the ICR aggregate
tabulation (ICR page 54).

3.65 Notwithstanding these caveats – which, in any case, would only somewhat
negatively affect the aggregate IRR scenarios – there are multiple partially quantified or
unquantified benefits to be considered In some cases these overlap with the IRR analysis,
and therefore may double count, in other cases they would be additional. These include:
land acquisition benefits with 875,000 acres of improved access; commodity marketing
estimated by the ICR to have benefits of US$49 million; nutrition benefits from bulk
purchase (food security benefit estimated by the ICR at US$161 million); enabled

12While high at the top end of the range, the middle range of these IRRs are not inconsistent with a rule of thumb often
used in research and extension that, mainly due to high discounting of future benefits and risk, a poor farmer is likely to
want to see a 2:1 or at worst a 1.5:1 Benefit Cost Ratio to trigger significant adoption of a new technology or practice.
13   Note that rates of return cannot be used to compare investments of a different scale.
                                             34


government poverty support funds through panchayats; quality of life disability benefits;
insurance benefits – both health risk and widows; pension benefits (estimated by the ICR
to total US$443 million); education benefits including the education fund; the gender
fund; employment benefits off-farm – jobs benefits are estimated by the ICR at US$540
million with the national guarantee employment scheme adding a further US$134
million; environmental benefits from the CMSA activities including a health factor; and
benefits from learning for other programs. While there may be some overlap of these
benefits with those calculated in the IRR and while in some cases the attribution
connection to the benefit stream is only one of facilitating access, many of these are
additional benefits and some are of significant scale. However, against these benefits
would need to be set some other counterfactuals, for example, some elements of
education, jobs and insurance would probably have been obtained through other means
but at lower levels. We are unable to estimate these.

3.66 With a benefit stream composed of a significant share of benefits that reached the
poor and the poorest of the poor, there is a methodological question of whether there
should be any social adjustments to raise the value of benefits reaching the lower income
groups. Social Cost Benefit Analysis adjustments are rarely done but this is a case where
there would be a case to do so. Raising the value of the benefits to these two groups and
the disabled would raise the overall IRR relative to other projects with a lower share of
poor beneficiaries. However, this report has not attempted such an adjustment.

3.67 A further piece of evidence on efficiency is the Deininger and Liu (2013) finding
reported in the APDPIP analysis that, notwithstanding the question raised about
additional costs in that section, still showed a good rate of return for the consumption
elements of the project. While this was based on the data from that project, it seems
probable that similar benefit streams have been sustained in APRPRP.

3.68 On operational costs, it has not been possible to estimate the costs of SERP, first
because a number of staff are on deputation and second because their budget is covered
under a number of different heads and line items. The project management costs provided
under the project, partly the Bank and partly borrower contribution, comes to about 11
percent of the total project costs. From discussion with Bank team staff it is probable that,
if all uncounted government costs were included this would at least double the costs.
There is, however, an important qualification to the uncertainty of the overhead costs of
SERP. Since, the benefit stream for the bank linkages far outweigh the other activity
benefit streams, and since the ICR finds that, adding the bank linkages to the livelihoods
investments raises the FRR from 18.1 percent to 26.3 percent, the sensitivity to different
levels of SERP costs is heavily diluted. The bank linkages are estimated to have
leveraged US$7.86 billion in loans. Against this, a doubling of the project overheads
adding another US$50 million would be of small significance. In other words, the
sensitivity of the SERP costs is modest if one includes a substantial share of the bank
linkages.

3.69 While it would take a substantial study to assess the marginal costs and of each
additional increment of SHG activity, up to some absolute ceiling of complexity, there is
likely to be a declining marginal cost to adding additional SHG activities or entitlements.
The start-up cost of establishing a functioning SHG for a first activity, say bank linkages
                                             35


only, may be significant, but the marginal cost of adding each additional activity is likely
to be smaller and declining as establishment and operational costs are spread.

3.70 In terms of relative cost effectiveness, with some caveats, the Andhra Pradesh
projects appear to be better than all the other livelihoods projects implemented in India
recently. The APDPIP and APRPRP combined had a cost of US$44 per household over
the six year period 2003 to 2009. As of March 2009 the cost was US$55 per household
including the interest rate reimbursement subsidy. This compares to Tamil Nadu at about
US$430 per household, Madhya Pradesh at about US$257, and Rajasthan at about
US$473 (Hancock and Bauman 2012). While these figures are not strictly comparable by
period and are confounded by different levels of state government contributions that are
difficult to calculate, the relative differences are large enough to suggest that the AP
projects have been relatively efficient against the only comparators available. This is
probably largely due to the scale of the AP projects.

3.71 An additional stream of benefits that is difficult to quantify is the learning for
other livelihoods projects in India. This has not only been passive learning in the form of
others studying the project for guidance. It has been active learning promotion based on
demand. Skilled people from Andhra Pradesh have been sent to other states to offer
advice and support, particularly on women’s empowerment.

3.72 Finally, in a project within a comprehensive state-wide program, close to all-
encompassing and covering every district, one cannot apply assumptions about the
without project scenario in determining net incremental benefits without also accepting
that a share of that implied spillover to non-beneficiaries also must be attributable in
some way or another to the project. It is difficult to see any other major source of the
evident spill-overs found in the Impact Study except the NREGA program.

3.73 In conclusion, the partial CIF FRR is 18.1 percent, the overall FRR is 30.1
percent. While some questions have been raised in this section on data and methodology,
even with substantial downside adjustments through reduced attribution of bank linkages
and higher SERP costs, there would still likely be a very robust FRR because of the large
scale of the project. In the 30 percent FRR scenario, the Net Present Value is over US$2
billion. A project of this scale will be quite insensitive to changes in overhead costs or in
cost or benefit streams unless they are large and pervasive across several components. To
these FRRs, or to any downward adjustment of them to allow for reduced attribution or
higher costs, must be added, on the positive side, the unquantifiable benefits of women’s
empowerment and the other social benefits. We also here consider the Deininger and Liu
finding on APDPIP and suggest that it seems probable that similar benefits have been
achieved in APRPRP. Efficiency is rated High.

Outcome
3.74 Relevance of the Objectives and Design are both rated High. The project was
fully consistent with the state strategy and vision and the Bank’s strategy and the design
reflected that. Efficacy of the two sub-objectives of improvement of livelihoods and
improvement of quality of life are both rated High. Efficiency is rated High on the basis
of a satisfactory IRR together with substantial unquantified benefits. Taking into account
                                                          36


the scale and depth of the empowerment of women that led to social and economic
opportunities not plausible without the support of the project, the Outcome is rated
Highly Satisfactory.

Risk to Development Outcome
3.75 This discussion of risk covers both APDPIP and APRPRP since, apart from some
degree of risk discounting over time, that in separate ratings would favor APDPIP, the
two projects face qualitatively the same risks.

3.76 Behavioral and Financial Sustainability. Based on the Impact Study, the financial
sustainability of the community-based organizations was variable but generally sound at
the time of project close. SHGs had very small incomes and expenditures since, apart
from their social roles and social activities, they are acting as conduits for lending and
repayment and are generally passing on to members whatever interest rates and subsidies
they receive. Repayment is their main challenge not profit margin. The study did not
show what percentage of SHGs had significant income deficits to cover expenditures. At
the VO level, average annual surplus over expenditure was Rs.15,417. At the MS level
much larger amounts are being handled, the average surplus was found by the impact
survey to be approximately Rs.1.0 million (about US$23,000 in 2008)14.

3.77 Subsequent to the closing of the project, rumors of loan waivers and the
application of interest rate rebates threaten to alter group behavior and the carefully built
credit discipline achieved by the project. Since the project closed, an interest rate rebate
has been introduced in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. For SHGs that are borrowing
from the Banks and that are current on repayments, the state reimburses the interest rate
down to an effective 3 percent. While at the time of the mission the political thinking on
waivers appeared to be still somewhat fluid, there was a proposal in Andhra Pradesh that,
in place of a loan waiver there might be a Rs.100,000 grant given to eligible SHGs.
(Telangana was not considering a loan waiver at the time).

3.78 Field visits found that a number of SHGs had halted loan repayments as a result
of the rumor of waivers. All SHGs interviewed indicated that they considered it had been
a sensible decision to stop repayments if a waiver was indeed being offered. They based
their decision on previous offers made, during prior election campaigns, when the rumor
of waivers came to fruition. In this round, women also felt and expressed regret, since the
waivers were not implemented. The experience demonstrated the risk of non-payment: it
changed the SHG relationship with the Banks, group credit ratings, and it resulted in high
non-payment fees. Women continued to save internally throughout the non-payment
period, however, and in many cases were able to quickly regain traction on payments
once rumors of the waivers had subsided.

3.79 Heavily subsidized interest rates, rebates, and waivers raise questions about the
long-term viability and sustainability of the bank linkages portion of this program. They

14A caveat to all these financial figures is that the Impact Study surveys were not financial audits, they were merely
recording reported data. It is not clear how much was based on financial audits although the higher levels CBOs were
being audited.
                                             37


also run the risk of allowing for the politicization of an otherwise formidable platform for
women’s and families’ social and economic development. Possible unfavorable outcomes
associated with these types of continued interruptions include (i) a shift by SHGs away
from their strong focus on internal credit discipline towards the application of their
newfound empowerment to demanding greater government subsidies; (ii) banks could be
expected to assign greater risk to this type of lending; (iii) increased credit demand for
low return investments owing to the distortion in the market; (iv) with the interest rate
rebate, group decisions are now allocating the subsidized loan funds equally and passing
on the rebate so as to share the windfall fairly. This means there is less likelihood of
funds being directed efficiently towards the best investment proposals within the group.

3.80 A related risk is the risk that is posed to individuals affected by group behavior.
While a single nonpayer can reportedly be managed by increasing group savings, two to
three non-payers represents a significant risk to the ten to twelve women in the group. In
this case, there is a risk that all individuals, regardless of individual credit discipline,
become ineligible for formal banking services. It is not clear how the program has
managed this risk for the individuals who are unlucky to be grouped with defaulters since
the mission was not able to obtain data or interview members of defunct defaulter groups.

3.81 Exogenous Risks. The management of the “microfinance crisis” that occurred in
2010 in Andhra Pradesh has resulted in several risks to credit liquidity and affordable
access to finance. Charged with levying excessive interest rates, using coercive debt
collection practices, and making excessive profits, the sector was regulated at a level that
all but shut it down in the state, in spite of the fact that MFIs were an important source of
credit for many individuals and groups, often providing readily available and shorter-term
lending.

3.82 One response has been the introduction of a new state run Credit Cooperative
Federation, or Stree Nidhi, which uses the existing District Rural Development Agencies
and the federated rural institutions at the Village and Mandal level for “last mile”
delivery to keep costs below 1 percent, a further project benefit of the group formation.
Stree Nidhi partly depends on compulsory saving deposits from members of the federated
model. The effort, to date, is modest in scale and runs the risk of stretching available
finance too thin. It should not be seen as a substitute to fixing the ailing micro-finance
sector which had been a significant share of borrowing for individuals and groups.

3.83 Fiscal Sustainability. At the state level, the capacity of the two states, Andhra
Pradesh and Telangana, to sustain financing of the many constituent programs that were
either initiated or supported by the project is an issue. The current financial situation in
Andhra Pradesh stands out as a particular risk. Telengana also faces a difficult financial
situation.

3.84 Institutional Sustainability. At the time of the mission, the future of the
implementing agency, SERP, was unclear, and yet, no alternative arrangement was yet in
place to fulfill the broad facilitation and support role that it is currently playing. The
bifurcation into the two states has added to that risk. While there is a need for an
evolution in the system – by identifying and supporting weaker links and devising new
and innovative methods to reach the poorest of the poor – the SERP function is an
                                            38


essential pillar of the built system. Future arrangements will need to untangle overlapping
responsibilities with line ministries – some of which could be characterized as an
encroachment by SERP on these ministries’ roles. But there is no evidence that SERP’s
role even here has not added value in light of the scale and depth of need.

3.85 Risk of Not Reaching the Poorest of the Poor. Evidence suggests that those at the
very lowest income levels, particularly the destitute and those in remote areas, have been
very difficult to reach and support. Going forward, there is a need for a renewed focus on
the poorest, which has been a recurring concern of the project and a challenge faced by
other participatory rural development programs – such as the Aga Khan Rural Support
Program in Pakistan. It is now believed, and reflected in recent project designs, that
reaching the poorest will call for support to individual households or even individuals
persons. One reason is that the rigid demands of group commitment in terms of financial
contributions, time commitment, meeting attendance, and repayment may be too
burdensome for the poorest. Many very poor people migrate to find work, have unstable
incomes and the contribution of their time is inflexible and has a high opportunity cost.
Such constraints are a handicap for group formation, group management, and group
sustainability. Thus while the evidence from the two projects is that some progress was
made in reaching the poor, there is still an unmet need.

3.86 A third phase of this program of support was approved by the Bank’s Board
recently with the aim of reaching the poorest of the poor, but there are some questions
about the design. IEG has pointed out in this report the somewhat narrow focus on
technology choices, with regard to non-pesticide low input agriculture and the associated
lack of linkages with the line department. The recently approved Andhra Pradesh and
Telangana projects may be similarly narrowing the range of technology support by a
focus on organic production and niche markets although they also propose to support the
marketing activities for a number of commodities that should help raise farm gate prices.
The new Andhra Pradesh inclusive rural growth project has proposed to work with small
and marginal producers who “have already built up productive assets, have previously
participated in productivity improvement, and have the potential to exploit growth
opportunities for high value commodities such as red gram, milk, poultry, small
ruminants, fisheries, turmeric, cashew, and coffee.” This presumably will exclude those
poorest low asset households who have not yet been able to achieve productivity
improvement. While non-farm and urban growth has recently become a more important
driver in India than agricultural growth for overall poverty reduction even in rural areas,
agricultural growth, through gains in agricultural productivity in terms of yields and
increases in agricultural wages, is still an important driver of rural poverty reduction
(Binswanger-Mkhize 2012, Himanshu et al 2010).

3.87 The Risk to Development Outcomes, owing to the range of social and economic
empowerment that has been achieved, is rated Moderate. Risks associated with the
sustainability of the financing model should be attended to going forward.

Bank Performance
3.88 Quality at Entry. The project was thorough in incorporating the lessons of the
previous AP District Poverty Reduction Initiative Project and also the earlier lessons
                                            39


from the UNDP South Asia Poverty Alleviation Project. The design was based on a
substantial livelihoods assessment. From this, the strategy emerged to focus on three
main areas of support: (i) protecting maintaining and building the critical assets of the
poor; (ii) empowering the poor so they could use those assets productively with less
restriction; and, (iii) providing the poor with more or better opportunities to use their
assets. It was argued that the bonding social capital in SHGs was the foundation for the
remainder of the livelihoods improvement process.

3.89 The project carried out a thorough and frank assessment of the problematic
question of how to involve the Panchayati Raj Institutions. The World Bank project team
grappled with many difficult design issues that could have handicapped progress in this
project, including land market issues, the need for a tribal strategy, institutional
arrangements (also associated with the Tribal Development Plan), and a gender strategy.
There was also good attention to the financial issues including the design of accounting
procedures, audit arrangements and the computerized financial management system.

3.90 The project was designed to be flexible and provided for sufficient M&E to learn
from experimentation. M&E was thoughtfully designed, referred to in the PAD as a
Monitoring and Learning system. It proposed creative ways to support self-monitoring at
the community level, input-output monitoring, process-monitoring and impact evaluation.
It assigned responsibilities for each level of monitoring, building on the experience of the
APDPIP. It encouraged and financed an impact assessment. However, the Results
Framework and the Management Information System could have included more
qualitative indicators to measure capacity strengthening and the effects of female
empowerment within the household and the greater society at large. A more rigorous,
periodic and systematic system for the evaluation of a sample of productive investments
could have supported adaptation of project design along the way.

3.91 The treatment of safeguards was thorough, leading to a screening system for sub-
projects and the incorporation of the pest management operational policy into the design
of the integrated pest management program.

3.92   Quality at Entry is rated Satisfactory.

3.93 Quality of Supervision. Supervision was thorough, flexible and creative and
responsive to the needs of the borrower. There was an exceptionally good relationship
with SERP and the state. The Chief Minister would often give considerable time to
meeting with the Bank project team. The thematic approach focusing on different priority
themes each mission rather than universal coverage allowed greater depth of analysis.
The Bank was right and nimble to respond when it did with Additional Financing
although there were risks in scaling up so fast. As noted in the ICR, the supervision team
was awarded the first Golden Plough award for excellence in supervision.

3.94 Supervision documents suggest that the Bank played an important role not only in
enabling innovation but in judiciously feeding in ideas from global experience. The Bank
provided specialist advice in activities such as insurance and finance and had staff on
missions with experience of community development projects in other countries and
elsewhere in India. The Bank also encouraged and supported learning visits outside of
                                            40


India and outside the state. In interviews with borrower project staff, Bank skills were
acknowledged as important. The Bank also provided a platform for SERP to try new
things that in the absence of the project, would have been more difficult within
administrative constraints. There is evidence in the supervision documents, which had
clear recommendations for action and from interviews with GOI and GOAP staff, that
there was a "try-anything" attitude from the Bank team that was creative if, in retrospect,
perhaps a little too open-ended.

3.95 Quality of supervision is rated Highly Satisfactory. Overall, Bank Performance is
rated Satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
3.96 Government Performance. The government at both the center and the state level
were fully committed and provided strong policy and implementation support to the
project. The State allowed for the retention of a highly qualified director within the
implementing agency which contributed to learning and project performance.
Government commitment – which had been in place years before this project was
appraised - was maintained throughout across different administrations. Government
financing for the program exceeded its original commitments, further signaling a strong
commitment to the project objective of alleviating rural poverty, particularly for the
poorest,

3.97 The performance of the central and state government is rated Highly
Satisfactory.

3.98 Implementing Agency Performance. SERP performed well with great
commitment and skill and was strongly supported by its parent department, the state
Rural Development Department. SERP proved to be creative and agile in adjusting to
evolving circumstances. SERP was able to attract and retain some excellent staff with
very good appreciation of the needs of a participatory approach centered on self-help
groups that were targeted at the poorest. The IEG mission was impressed with the quality
of SERP staff.

3.99 SERP oversaw effective implementation of the project safeguards. Procurement,
mainly conducted by the district and sub-district level organizations, was implemented
effectively. A standard accounting system was put in place for effective coordination
with the federated rural institution. While there were some intermittent financial issues,
SERP rectified these issues with the support of the Bank.

3.100 Overall, in implementation, as a result of responsiveness to changing
circumstance and fiduciary needs, the performance of SERP and its parent department is
rated Highly Satisfactory.

3.101 Taking into account the rating for government and implementing agency
performance, the overall rating for government performance is Highly Satisfactory.
                                                           41


Monitoring and Evaluation
3.102 M&E was well designed and implemented. The citation for the award noted
above recognized that the process monitoring and the flows of real time feedback from
communities were innovative and effective. The database, as an MIS system, is
comprehensive and user friendly15. It is not common that IEG can select small groups to
be interviewed, either randomly or purposively, by using a project database. The
adjustments made during the project make it clear that the M&E findings were utilized.
The CESS Impact Study, despite a few weaknesses, was useful and informative and open
about the main methodological challenge which was the lack of a satisfactory control
group and the possible options for a proxy.

3.103 In addition to the MIS data and the CESS Impact Study, a number of topic papers
were produced to aid learning. Three that were reviewed by IEG were: Livelihoods
Learning (2007) covering the project-supported program for the bulk purchase of rice for
consumption to reduce household food costs; Making Markets Work for the Poor (2007)
covering community managed marketing integrating the poorest producers into the
markets; and, Creating Jobs for Rural Youths (2010) covering employment generation for
youth including educational products, microcredit products, and scaling up. There was
also a study supported by the Norwegian Governance Trust Fund covering Community-
Based Procurement (2009). This reviewed the value for money, efficiency, transparency,
and fairness of the community procurement practices covering 22 Community Driven
Development projects in India including the Andhra Pradesh project16.

3.104 More could have been done to trace the application and benefits of individual
household loan funds particularly on productivity. More is known from the database
about the amount and type of borrowing (output) than on the impact on household
livelihoods (outcome). While the Impact Study was able to estimate increased household
expenditures it was not able to provide much evidence on investment productivity or
enterprise success.


4. Lessons
There are four main lessons from the two projects:

15 As an example of what is available, some Districts, using the SERP data system and data of their own, offer
summarized District Data-at-a-Glance information sheets on the internet giving a wide selection of data including:
overall district statistics, poverty distribution, SHG statistics including savings and corpus, training, mandal
performance data, audit coverage, human resources, bank linkages component achievements, action and investment
plans, people trained, the CIF funding use, achievements of the various programs, marketing activities, food security,
land purchase, Community Managed Sustainable Agriculture achievements, Poorest of Poor strategy, employment
achievements including job training and placement, education achievement including pass results, disabled component
achievements including certification, pensions, and revolving funds, health and nutrition activities including the health
risk fund, kitchen gardens, sanitary achievements, weaning foods, community pharmacy, early education fund use,
social security pensions achievements by caste, widows pension and death claims data, dairy program achievements,
and grain bank achievements.

16It found: better value for money from community implemented works compared to contractors; a better sense of
ownership leading to enhanced sustainability; despite being strong on need identification they scored poorly on search
for bidders and tendering; and, the need to ensure in the design inclusive participation.
                                          42


   Support for the establishment of women’s self-help groups with linkages to
    bank finance and within a supportive policy and institutional environment
    can lead to enhanced confidence and capacity of women both collectively and
    individually. The evidence from Andhra Pradesh suggests that collective
    empowerment can support greater accountability for service delivery that, in turn,
    can positively affect the livelihoods of the poor.

   In the early phases of rural development projects that support large-scale
    community group formation as a means to leverage more equitable service
    delivery, including finance, there is a need to think long-term about the
    transition strategy for the chosen implementing agency. In the case of Andhra
    Pradesh, the implementing agency support became an essential pillar of the built
    system, undertaking roles and responsibilities for service delivery that overlapped
    with the line ministries. Without an effective transition strategy that integrates the
    philosophy, training and acquired skills into the broader administration, there is a
    risk that gains made under the project will be lost and efforts to reach the poorest
    of the poor may not be sustained.

   Reaching the poorest of the poor can prove difficult through group
    formation owing to rigid rules of attendance, set savings contributions, joint
    liability, and other group non-negotiables. Going forward, the strategy may
    need to be altered towards household or individual support, or differentiated
    models that consider the needs of the poorest of the poor, prior to group
    formation. This multi-stage approach is bound to incur additional costs. This
    implies trade-offs between depth and coverage and between short-term and long-
    term impact that should be accommodated in project design.

   The pursuit of a single group model, such as women’s self-help groups, to the
    exclusion of other approaches, limits the ability to learn from the user –
    about what works and why in different contexts - and to test alternatives in
    parallel rather than in sequence. Greater experimentation during the first phase,
    when the project was rolled out in the first six districts, could have laid the ground
    for more creative destruction, adaptation, and learning prior to scaling.

2. Targets are mostly end 2005 targets. 3. Target for this is given in ICR as US$15 million which seems too low, or an
incorrect target date.
