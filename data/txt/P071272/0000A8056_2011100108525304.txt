                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to enable the rural poor, particularly the poorest of the poor, in Andhra Pradesh improve their livelihoods and quality of
                         life. The proposed project builds upon the Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiative Project (APDPIP) (Cr. 3332) and includes: (i) expansion of the geographical
                         coverage to the entire state; (ii) sharper focus on the poorer and more vulnerable members (e.g., persons with disability) of rural communities; (iii) emphasis on
                         livelihood issues of the poor with a focus on sustainable rainfed farming systems and non-farm employment opportunities; (iv) pilots on community-based land
                         purchase, and social risk management instruments to reduce risks face by the poor; and (v) inclusion of other stakeholders, especially local governments and
                         the private sector in preparation implementation.
