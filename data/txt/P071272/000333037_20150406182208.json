Pradesh District\n            Poverty Initiatives Project for India were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: support for the\n            establishment of women\u0092s self-help groups with linkages to\n            bank finance and within a supportive policy and\n            institutional environment can lead to enhanced confidence\n            and capacity of women both collectively and individually.\n            In the early phases of rural development projects that\n            support large-scale community group formation as a means to\n            leverage more equitable service delivery, including finance,\n            there is a need to think long-term about the transition\n            strategy for the chosen implementing agency.   Reaching the\n            poorest of the poor can prove difficult through group\n            formation owing to rigid rules of attendance, set savings\n            contributions, joint liability, and other group\n            non-negotiable. Going forward, the strategy may need to be\n            altered towards household or individual support, or\n            differentiated models that consider the needs of the poorest\n            of the poor, prior to group formation. This multi-stage\n            approach is bound to incur additional costs. This implies\n            trade-offs between depth and coverage and between short-term\n            and long-term impact that should be accommodated in project design."}, "docdt": "2015-03-30T11:16:00Z"}
