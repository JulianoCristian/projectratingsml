geographical coverage to the entire state; (ii) sharper focus on the poorer and more vulnerable members
(e.g., persons with disability) of rural communities; (iii) emphasis on livelihood issues of the poor with a
focus on sustainable rain-fed farming systems and non-farm employment opportunities; (iv) pilots on
community-based land purchase, and social risk management instruments to reduce risks face by the poor;
and (v) inclusion of other stakeholders, especially local governments and the private sector in preparation
