F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to enable the rural poor; particularly the poorest of the poor, in Andhra Pradesh improve
their livelihoods and quality of life. The proposed project builds upon the Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiative Project
(APDPIP) (Cr. 3332) and includes: (i) expansion of the geographical coverage to the entire state; (ii) sharper focus on the poorer
and more vulnerable members (e.g., persons with disability) of rural communities; (iii) emphasis on livelihood issues of the poor
with a focus on sustainable rain-fed farming systems and non-farm employment opportunities; (iv) pilots on community-based
land purchase, and social risk management instruments to reduce risks face by the poor; and (v) inclusion of other stakeholders,
especially local governments and the private sector in preparation implementation.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO and the key indicators were not changed, although scope and scale was increased with two additional financings.

(a) PDO Indicator(s)
Baseline Values from Project Outcome Indicators/Date of Value (from approval documents)
Details, sources and additional relevant indicators discussed in main text section 3.2. The final values achieved at

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Program (APRPRP) was set up to respond to the poverty
situation in Andhra Pradesh (AP) and the government‘s comprehensive response to it through
Government of Andhra Pradesh (GOAP) Vision 2020 and its Rural Poverty Reduction Program. The
project closely aligned with the World Bank CAS focus on pro-poor rural development, and the Bank‘s
support to several sector and participatory oriented projects in the State.
The project also built on several important initiatives in the country and in the State, over the preceding
10 years. This included the UNDP South Asia Poverty Alleviation Project (SAPAP), AP Government‘s
investments in institution building through thrift and credit based women Self Help Groups (SHGs)
focused on capacity building through social and economic mobilization of women and developed
innovative participatory approaches involving women SHGs for Community Based Convergent Services.
Development programs like literacy, preventive health care, girl child education, elimination of child
labor etc. were dovetailed to the thrift and credit activities undertaken by SHGs. NABARD supported
self-help group (SHG)-Bank linkage program also had good progress in the State.
In particular the project formed part of a progression of Bank projects in India using a community driven
development approach, with increasing focus on community organizations addressing voice and
participation, human capital, livelihoods, governance and incentive oriented government response. In the
case of AP the APRPRP would directly build on, scale up geographically, and complement the Andhra
Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives Project (APDPIP), implemented by the State level Society for the
Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP), which started in 2000 and ended in 2006. The APRPRP had
similar objectives as APDPIP, but with greater emphasis on convergence with government schemes,
strengthening the multi-tiered institutional community structures, financial inclusion, livelihoods, land
access and social protection services.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project development objective is to enable the rural poor; particularly the poorest of the poor, in
Andhra Pradesh improve their livelihoods and quality of life. The proposed project builds upon the
Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiative Project (APDPIP) (Cr. 3332) and includes: (i) expansion of the
geographical coverage to the entire state; (ii) sharper focus on the poorer and more vulnerable members
(e.g., persons with disability) of rural communities; (iii) emphasis on livelihood issues of the poor with a
focus on sustainable rain-fed farming systems and non-farm employment opportunities; (iv) pilots on
community-based land purchase, and social risk management instruments to reduce risks face by the
poor; and (v) inclusion of other stakeholders, especially local governments and the private sector in
preparation implementation.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The PDO and the key indicators were not changed, although scope and scale was increased with two
additional financings.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
APRPRP was designed to reach 560 disadvantaged mandals (sub-districts) in sixteen districts. The
mandals were to be identified using criteria—such as, human, economic and infrastructure development.
Within these mandals, the poor and the poorest were targeted—e.g., scheduled caste; scheduled tribes;
backward class; people with no control over or access to productive resources, especially landless; daily
wage laborers; bonded laborers; unskilled marginal farmers; disabled people; socially disadvantaged
people like out of school children, especially girls; widows and female-headed households; and
involuntary migrants. Among the poor, project interventions started with the ―poorest of the poor"
through a participatory self-selection process. The PAD estimated that two million households would
benefit from the project. By the second financing the number of beneficiary households was estimated at
11 million, covering all rural mandals and SHGs of the poor in the State.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project was designed with the following components (with original costs):
   i.   Strengthening Institutional, Social and Human Capital ($25.19m), with the following
        subcomponents: a) Formation and development of community based organizations (CBOs),
        including SHGs; b) Formation and strengthening federations of self-managed groups,
        cooperatives and other people‘s organizations; c) Capacity of Panchayat Raj Institutions (local
        government), line departments and NGOs; d) Convergence; e) Strategic communication; and f)
        Building partnerships.
  ii.   Community Investment Fund ($147.13m), with the following subcomponents: a) Social
        Development (e.g. early childhood centers, and disability interventions); b) Physical
        infrastructure; c) Income generation and livelihoods improvements; d) Land (lease and) purchase
        for the landless.
 iii.   Support to pilot programs ($7.45m), with the following subcomponents: a) Decentralization and
        the role of Panchayats; b) Social risk management and health life insurance, health package and
        income protection.
 iv.    Support to Out of School Children ($57.38m), with the following subcomponents: a) Social
        mobilization and bridge schools; b) Residential schools for girl children ($50.2m) – 64 schools;
        and c) Early childhood development mobilization (also EC centers under CIF, and converging
        health and nutrition services).
  v.    Support for persons with disabilities (11.32m), with the following subcomponents: a) Institutions
        of the disabled; b) Improve livelihood opportunities for the disabled; and c) Promote convergence
        for programs of the disabled.
 vi.    Project management (17.72m), with the following subcomponents: a) Support to the SERP and
        APSWREIS; b) NGO Partnerships; c) Monitoring and Evaluation; d) Environmental
        Management; e) Tribal Development Plan Monitoring; f) Gender Strategy; and g) Technical
        Assistance.
1.6 Revised Components
No significant changes in the component structure were made except that the additional financings
emphasized building higher capacity of CBOs through technology infusion and scaling up successful
pilots—like life and disability insurance, health and nutrition, etc.—for higher order impacts. The PRI
pilots refocused to allow greater community influence on local government through election of women
SHG members into key positions and jointly evolving a pro-poor agenda for enhanced transparency,
downward accountability, and effective delivery of public services and entitlements to the poor.
1.7 Other significant changes
The project increased significantly in scale from the original $150 investment through two rounds of
additional financing: in 2007 ($65m) and in 2009 ($100m), with final extension of closing date to 31
September 2011. There were no changes to the PDO, PDO outcome indicators, or components; however,


                                                   2
GOAP scaled up APRPRP into the state-wide program, Indira Kranthi Patham (IKP), which increased the
scope of the project. The following are significant changes to original design of the program.
The operation scaled up to encompass the vast majority of the poor in the State and practically all rural
villages. By the first additional financing, the number of poor organized and mobilized into SHGs was
expected to be 6 million and by the second 11 million; the number of SHGs formed and strengthened
930,671; the number of SHGs linked to banks 800,000; and benefits would reach 1 million of the poorest
of the poor (POP). Considering challenges in reaching the ultra poor, a specific strategy was pursued in
the additional financing to reach the hardest to reach the remaining poorest of the poor (POP) in the State.
APRPRP facilitated the formation of multi-tiered federations of SHGs—i.e., institutional platforms of the
poor. The project consciously shifted emphasis towards institution building of federations of SHGs, at
village, Mandal and District level. These institutional platforms enabled specialization for higher order
services that required convergence with public, private and financial sectors. For example Mandal
Samakhyas managed Bulk Milk Cooling Units (BMCUs), and the Village Organizations managed Milk
Collection Centers at the village level. Similarly, micro insurance initiatives are managed by Zilla
Samakhya at the district level. This shift also meant emphasis on consolidation of institutional
development efforts and putting in place supplementary institutional and technological support systems
during additional finance phase to achieve higher development impacts.
Financing arrangements at the community level moved away from grants to revolving funds. As a
corollary, the project decided to finance micro plans of SHGs/VOs for financing livelihoods of the poor,
instead of one time sub-projects, which ensured both efficiency and equity in use of CIF. Encouraging
response from commercial banks to finance SHGs also reinforced the idea of using the CIF as a revolving
fund, which precludes distortion in local credit markets.
Focus shifted from community infrastructure to building livelihood assets and services. In line with
priorities expressed by the community and the poor during various participatory needs assessments, the
project initiated large scale programs for strengthening sustainable agriculture, livestock, NTFP, non-farm
sector                                                                                          livelihoods.
In any case, the CBOs leveraged several well running programs on community infrastructure aligned to
their interests.
Several successful pilots were significantly scaled up in the additional financing phases. Encouraging
response from supply side institutions like insurance companies enabled the project to universalize life
and disability insurance initiatives and micro pension interventions like across the State. Similarly, early
success of pilot interventions like health and nutrition enabled the project to expand to nearly 4,200
villages. Similarly, the focus of Panchayats related interventions changed, after MTR, concentrating on
the demand side leveraging institutional platforms of and their Federations, considerable political
empowerment of women and their interaction with local governments to build collective voice for
influencing delivery of public services.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project design benefited from a range of relevant poverty reduction oriented experiences in the State,
and provided a critical five-year time horizon to deal with a range of initiatives:
      i.   The project was developed in the early stages of the implementation of the Bank supported
           Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiative Program (APDPIP), with the foundation of SERP as
           an experienced implementing institution in place.
     ii.   Lessons from previous programs—like UNDP supported South Asia Poverty Alleviation
           Partnership (SAPAP), APDPIP, etc.—on CBOs and federations, creation of social capital and
           financial inclusion were available.
    iii.   A cadre of experienced state managers from previous programs and projects formed the
           leadership of SERP. Several design aspects came from these managers who wanted to scale up
           new initiatives.
    iv.    Encouraging response from supply side institutions, particularly commercial banks and insurance
           companies to the catalytic investments in thrift promotion, credit planning and financial
           management capacities of the CBOs was leveraged to access resources from mainstream financial
           sector.
     v.    The project design came at a critical time providing a longer 5-year perspective, both to deal with
           emerging initiatives and lessons under APDPIP, as well as to undertake innovations with for
           example government‘s SGSY4 program, which would have been difficult for managers under the
           government programs, with their yearly budget cycles, and short political time horizons.

 SGSY - Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana, Scheme from 1999 in rural areas of the country. SGSY is holistic
scheme covering all aspects of self-employment such as organization of the poor into Self Help Groups, training,
credit, technology, infrastructure and marketing. The scheme aimed at establishing a large number of micro
enterprises in the rural areas.

                                                          4
The project design was based on the need to address multiple needs identified under livelihoods studies,
and their required institutional underpinnings that had been identified and to some extent tested under
APDPIP, in the form of pilots.
The commitment of both the GOAP and the World Bank was very high at the time of design. In a
presentation made to World Bank President, the then Chief Minister of the State clearly explained how
the project fits into the GOAP Poverty Reduction Strategy. This was reinforced by providing strong
budget support, full commitment to SERP as implementing body, and showing willingness to harmonize
the use of staff, for example DRDA positions, as district managers of the project rather than creating new
parallel positions and mechanisms. On its part, the World Bank was also committed to support GOAP
towards achieving its Vision 2020. World Bank was also uniquely positioned to feed its global
experiences and emerging lessons from livelihoods and community driven development projects
including those from APDPIP into the design of APRPRP. This was complemented by initial technical
assistance through various analytical studies.
2.2 Implementation
Both APDPIP and APRPRP have produced transformative results at the national (the GoI‘s new
livelihoods strategy around National Rural Livelihoods Mission effectively builds on their experiences),
regional (new generation livelihood projects in SAR embrace lessons from AP), and even global level
(they introduced a compelling new ‗technology‘ of development raising interest for collaboration with in
community practice in the World Bank as well as among client governments). Outputs are examined in
more detail in Annex 2 and outcomes in section 3. The project fully achieved its initial PAD targets and
significantly exceeded the enhanced output and outcome targets for the two additional financing
operations. The project had mobilized nearly 11.3 million households who were mobilized into 1 million
SHGs by 2011. In comparison, there were about 6.5 million members in about 0.5 million SHG in the
State at the beginning of the project.5 This was done alongside organic evolution of community
organization model that is in place now, with several levels of federations in response to the need for new
services and livelihoods functions. These institutions manage their own corpus of US$1.1 billion loaning
to SHGs, investing in food security, commodity marketing and several other community enterprises. The
demand-driven nature, peer support, solidarity mechanisms, and financial systems and controls in these
CBOs enabled them to leverage nearly US$7.9 billion loans from commercial banks. In addition, they
leveraged US$100 million from different government programs—like SGSY, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas
Yojana (RKVY), RSVY Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana (RSVY), National Rural Health Mission (NRHM),
etc.—to deliver various public services and entitlements to the poor. In other words, every US$1 invested
by the project leveraged US$25 from the communities, public, private and financial sectors. As a result
the project had several livelihoods and poverty reduction outcomes even significant at the State level
(section 3.2, 3.4. and 3.5). It also resulted in changes in policies and institutional mechanisms at the State
level to support and sustain the strengthened service delivery (section 3.5, and Annex 4). The project also
serves to a large degree as model for the recently established National Rural Livelihoods Mission
(NRLM), taking lessons from the project to countrywide level. The key factors for the successful
implementation of the project are as follows:
a) A strong commitment to develop a sustainable management capacity for a large scale but grassroots
poverty reduction program.

 The APDPIP ICR notes that about 2.3 million poor were mobilised under APDPIP, and mobilised or strengthened
170,000 SHGs, up to the end of project in December 2006.

                                                      5
   i.   The project provided the resources and timeframe for the GOAP and SERP to flexibly and
        continuously develop identify new ideas, and develop processes and mechanisms for taking the
        program to large scale, which were in turn supported by the Bank‘s responsive additional
        financing. The following key elements stood out with regards to this commitment: The vision of
        the State government, the management and professional team at SERP to deliver impacts at scale
        from an early stage, which continuously drove refinement in approaches and innovations. Though
        the project took an iterative approach to reach large scale—there was ‗seamlessness‘ conceptually
        about scaling-up goals.
  ii.   Strong underpinning of pro-poor ethos in project teams (learned from previous projects)—and
        continuous efforts for engaging stakeholders, including politicians around such ethos enabled the
        project to build strong support across the political spectrum. Consistently bringing politicians
        from all levels to observe progress in the field, and listen to the women beneficiaries‘ own
        experiences helped a lot.
 iii.   Continuous delivery focus and the commitment to consider alternative and effective models for
        delivering programs through community engagement allowed the project to build
        complementarity with several other Government programs resulting in pro-poor changes in
        policies, procedures and resource allocations.
 iv.    A range of HR strategies were pursued for addressing the challenges of quality with scale. These
        include selection of Government officers as Project Directors (at district level) based on high
        performance and pro-poor sensitivity; head hunting of expert professionals from banking, civil
        society and private sectors for key positions at State level; young professionals strategy; induction
        training and immersions of all staff at best practice locations, etc. A comprehensive HR system
        was later developed in 2007.
  v.    With the huge challenges to provide support at scale the project adopted the Community
        Resource Person (CRP) approach from 2004 onwards. The CRPs are mostly the poor women
        who have come out of poverty through systematic participation in various programs of the
        project. These skilled and experienced facilitators and trainers, from the communities and largely
        paid by the communities themselves, provided a major breakthrough for the program to reach
        scale with quality.
 vi.    Finally, there was good continuity of Project Director, Bank TTLs, and managers at different
        levels—people who brought with them very practical and intensive field level focus. The Bank
        supervision team provided intensive and cohesive support, and there was strong continuity in the
        team.
b) To be able to reach greater scale and sustainability, the project Consolidated a determined shift from
asset based Common Interest Group, to thrift and credit based SHG model, the and the project
facilitated nested federations model for providing a range of services. This had three core elements:
Full support to SHGs and Bank linkages. Only a year or so after start the project reviewed the channeling
of matching grants to common interest groups for physical assets, also done under APDPIP. As the
findings indicated much better leverage of commercial bank links through SHGs, and greater potential for
expanding membership, there was a shift to fully supporting affinity based and functionally effective
SHGs only. The SHGs became the building blocks of the community institutional architecture. These
institutional platforms of the poor focused on private goods and allowed the poor to access safety nets and


                                                     6
entitlements to address vulnerabilities and risks while building assets and linkages with banks, livelihood
services, and markets. Three key elements in the strategy—household level micro-planning; a revolving
fund with implicit financial planning and control functions; and community enterprises for last mile
service delivery (commodity procurement centers, milk collection centers, nutrition and day care centers,
etc.—strengthened institutional capacities of SHGs and their federations. This not only allowed rapid
scaling up with strong sustainability, it attracted supply side institutions—like government departments,
commercial banks, insurance companies—to work with them and make them channel partners and
franchises.
Community Investment Funds (CIF) were used flexibly to promote equity and product innovations and
leveraged investments. The CIF helped strengthen CBOs and the revolving element provided equity (as
more members could benefit), efficiency, and sustainability of institutions. The repeat doses of assistance
based on micro-plans helped the poor develop a track record of credit usage and repayment encouraging
the commercial banks to perceive them as ‗preferred clients‘. Community institutions also used the CIF
set up enterprises to co-produce livelihood services (like food security, health and nutrition, agriculture,
dairy, etc.). Product innovations, by bundling livelihood services with credit, made them reliable and
affordable for the poor. These social businesses were not only financially rewarding but also transformed
the impacts of the project. The system was supported by community-bank linkage agents (Bank Mitras)
and facilitators, and managed by federations of SHGs at different levels.
Capacity development of federations and their services. APRPRP oversaw the full scale shift to and
approach of creating financially sustainable livelihoods and service institutions managed by poor women.
The federation model became the central organizing platform for the project: to provide leverage, revolve
funds and build assets for multiple uses, social networking, and demanding and managing services. The
project has also benefited from efficiencies of what was called the ‗communitised‘ model. The model
applies to practically all innovations in the project, incorporating mechanisms which engage the
federation structures, capacity building mechanisms, and self-sustainability. This was done largely using
CBO structures and CRPs as major driving force linkages and shared responsibilities between institutions
and federations at different levels and in particular community self-financing where possible. This
efficient model creates its own dynamics for initiatives to gain scale, and attracting new agencies to
consider SHGs and federations as channels for a range of new schemes.




                                                     7
In addition, as women‘s groups increased their influence both economically and politically in Andhra
Pradesh, the State‘s commitments to the communities has grown, for example through the direct interest
in SHGs by commercial banks and through the State‘s Pavala Vaddi program (a loan repayment incentive
mechanism, discussed in Annex 2). Other convergent schemes with the state that have emerged during
the project are discussed later in the report.
c) Flexibility and capacity to innovate: Taking advantage of the original design and its pilots, but also
using additional financing to expand successful new initiatives, APRPRP‘s flexibility and capacity to
innovate helped the project to learn and bring new ideas to scale:

   i.   Aside from innovations on inclusive financing, the project fostered experimentation and
        innovation (mostly from the field), and it allowed for failures. APRPRP developed over 15 new
        initiatives under the project—such as end to end small holder dairy production and marketing,
        community managed sustainable agriculture (CMSA), mutual insurance, health, community
        managed nutrition services, access to education services with significant community management
        and financing etc. (see Annex 2)—that emerged from at least 100 experiments and were tested
        through several versions at scale. A condition was that they had to be linked to the core
        institutional strategy—to make sure process is ‗communitised‘, and thus scalable and sustainable
  ii.   The MTR was used as learning and re-strategizing process thus providing the basis for First
        additional financing decisions: such as phasing out direct engagement with Gram Panchayat



                                                   8
        activities and capacity building, reducing CIF infrastructure interventions, and refocusing the CIF
        to ‗revolving funds‘.
 iii.   The Bank and the State took on these innovations by scaling-up through additional financings and
        related decisions. The Government used the World Bank supervision missions as technical
        assistance to examine dedicated themes for each mission—such as for CMSA, Dairy, Poorest of
        the Poor (PoP) strategy, etc. With frequent missions, the project never entered problem status,
        and the World Bank task team won the first ever inaugural Golden Plough award for excellence
        in supervision from the Agriculture and Rural Development Sector.
The project has been successful, but has nevertheless faced considerable challenges during
implementation. These include those in the control of the project and those outside their control.
d) Challenges within the control of the project
Inclusion of the Poorest of the Poor: With expansion of the project a very large number of the poorest of
the poor (POP) and poor, identified in a participatory identification process at the beginning of the
project, have been included during implementation and have benefited from the project. However, from
MTR onwards through the project‘s comprehensive data on POP and their program coverage, it was
found that the lowest two deciles were difficult to reach through social mobilization approach. Thus the
approach to include them was refined all the time and a dedicated PoP strategy became the focus for
additional financing. Considerable emphasis is now placed on individual household needs and plans,
tailor-made intensive support to left over poorest of poor households, covering all aspects of needs, from
financing, livelihoods and a range of social services and safety nets, and backed up by a detailed
computerized tracking system.
Managing a complex portfolio: With the expansion in the number of components and sectoral
interventions, the program managers had to respond to many emerging needs and manage at scale, so the
project introduced flexible HR models—e.g., a cadre of community resource persons and interns and
young professionals to bring rigor and expertise and linkages with various market functionaries.
Developing scalable and replicable models on livelihoods: Very large amounts of money invested by
SHG members in livelihoods, and livelihoods support activities, have been addressed through new and
scaled up initiatives on CMSA, marketing, dairy, which have reached a very large number of people,
beyond the possible initial expectations. But many more poor people need to reach to ensure good returns
on loans. There was strong emphasis on core SHG and federation structures and micro financing, but the
day to day support to dealing with a household‘s complex rural, often agriculture livelihoods, has no
immediate simply replicable model. The livelihood focus started from 2006 and could have started
earlier. It was difficult for the project to deal with scale and livelihood specialization as there were
tradeoffs.
e) Challenges outside the control of the project
Political change: The project witnessed two Assembly elections in 2004 and 2009 and a change in the
Government in 2004. These types of changes often result in threats to changes in project administration
and policies. Nevertheless, the program enjoyed political support at the highest level in the State due to
good performance of the project in different aspects of poverty reduction including targeted social
mobilization, women empowerment, financial inclusion and participation of institutions of the poor in
effectively delivering public services and entitlements.



                                                    9
Natural disasters: Recurrent droughts affected implementation through the destruction of livestock and
agricultural assets and shortages of fodder that brought heavy economic losses to farmers. Similarly, the
tsunami that struck Andhra Pradesh‘s coastal districts adversely affected the assets of fishing
communities and created additional expenditure obligations on the project. The strong networks fostered
by the project enabled these groups to reach out to every fishing family in the shortest possible time and
helped them resume their livelihoods.
Across the board waiver of agriculture loans: The rural loan waiver announced by the Government of
India to provide debt relief to poor farmers in view of recurrent droughts in 2008 did not cover
commercial bank loans to SHGs. Paradoxically, while the recovery of all categories of rural loans
dropped sharply, SHG loan repayments were largely unaffected due to the strong partnerships developed
between CBOs and local banks. In fact, non-performing assets (NPAs) of SHG loans constituted only 0.5
percent of the total outstanding US$ 1.58 billion, against the national average of 2.9 percent.6
AP Microfinance crisis: Sudden surge in credit during the period 2008-2010 by microfinance institutions
(MFIs) resulted in large scale overlap of client base of MFIs and that of the SHGs. Multiple loans to
same households without proper due-diligence by lenders led to unsustainable debt burden for these
households. A spate of suicides due to indebtedness was reported in the national media leading to
promulgation of AP MFI Ordinance by GoAP in October 2010 which put some restrictions on loaning by
MFIs and capping of interest rates. This also impacted recovery of SHG loans and NPAs levels of SHG
portfolio of the commercial banks rose to 2.0 percent of the total loan outstanding of US$2.72 billion by
March 20117. The project responded by (i) intensifying financial literacy/credit counseling services to
promote responsible borrowing, (ii) promoting strong savings focus in SHGs, (iii) building robust MIS
and information bureau to track multiple borrowings, (iv) data sharing with commercial banks, and
(v) activating community based recovery mechanisms ensure prompt repayment of loans. The
implications of this crisis on livelihood economy of the poor households needs to be studied in the long
term and would be one of the research areas for the newly launched National Rural Livelihood Mission
supported by the Bank.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Management Information System: A close management structure with hands on management supervision
at the field level, backed up by various manual and spreadsheet management information systems (MIS)
was used to help monitor the project in the beginning. A more integrated computerized MIS was
developed relatively late. At the time of the ICR a much more comprehensive IT approach being put in
place – technically sophisticated and results oriented, with many innovations for data entry (through use
of desktops, laptops and mobiles) and real time monitoring (electronic Fund Management System) and
linkages between data modules covering different components. The community institutional platform
with functional linkages and reporting between committees at different federations levels provides an in-
situ monitoring system.
Process monitoring was undertaken by an independent agency with access to data gathered by the MIS.
The assessments provide regular feedback into the quality of project implementation at the grass roots and
community response to project interventions. The SPMU and DPMU took into account the observations
made and appropriate corrective actions were taken to improve quality of implementation. This
concurrent monitoring has improved the adaptability and efficiency of the project.

Impact evaluation and thematic studies: External impact evaluation was carried out by Centre for
Economic and Social Studies (CESS) in three stages. Base line impact studies were carried out with a
sample size of 4,000 households in 2004 and follow-up surveys were taken at the mid-term (2006) and
end term (2009). Another 8,000 household survey for an updated impact assessment by the project was in
process at the time of the ICR mission. In addition, several other thematic studies and evaluations were
carried out by independent agencies as well as the project. Bibliography of the studies and articles on the
project is given in Annex 10.
The CESS impact evaluation measured and compared changes in key outcomes both at the project level
and at the household level mainly under three impact domains: Income Poverty, Non Income Poverty and
Sustainability of the Program. The size and complexity of the project and its many emerging initiatives
makes the exact measurement of outcomes and impacts challenging especially in identifying an
appropriate control group, as the project covered directly or indirectly all villages in the State. The
evaluation also addressed the issue of spill-over effects, attrition of survey households or internal and
external validity concerns. In the same vein, the sheer scale and universal coverage of the project in the
State, with wide spread system level impacts, meant that some of the gains of non-participant households
could in varying degrees be attributed to the project, due to program externality (for example improved
project supported services also reaching non-participants), although this is very difficult to quantify. A
number of other impact and process oriented evaluations focused on specific themes throughout the
project period.
Use of M & E in the project: There was fundamental management openness and responsiveness to M&E
information, with rapid follow-up field checks and through systematic regular meetings, especially
between management with MS and ZS federations, which gave them a core overview of monitoring
information and decision system to address issues, and suggestions for improving systems. In addition, a
monthly video conferencing arrangement between SPMU, DPMU, ZSs and community functionaries for
identifying issues and innovations has improved the information exchange and learning processes. This
could be considered as one of the best practices in terms of experience sharing, learning and use of IT to
facilitate concurrent monitoring.
There was then a further coordinated use of community supervision, project supervision and
implementation support missions in a structured way to have the maximum impact. These M&E systems
are likely to be sustained to a large degree post-project, with SERP‘s ongoing mandate and work program.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
There were no major safeguard issues during the project. Assessment of different elements of safeguard
and fiduciary issues is detailed below:
Social. APRPRP‘s objectives, activities and indicators largely concern the development of social capital
and institutions of the poor. The project in several aspects favored scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and
marginalized groups like fishermen, migrants, etc. in its activities. While covering an increasingly large
number of very poor under all components of the project, it also developed the specific PoP strategy to
ensure all hard-to-reach, very poor households would be included in the program benefits. The project
also had a dedicated and well-integrated tribal development plan covering 730,890 tribal households
which     was     effectively   implemented       on    a    very     large  scale     in   tribal    areas.
Dedicated Tribal Project Management Units (TPMU) were set up in seven districts with significant tribal
population coordinated by State level Tribal Management Unit (STMU). Exclusive institutions of tribal
groups—53,276 SHGs, 3,293 VOs, and 78 MSs—were promoted with livelihood strategies centering

                                                    11
around vulnerability reduction like food and health security, safety nets, reducing influence of money
lenders, enforcement of land rights, collective NTFP marketing, education, etc. Tribal MSs received 50%
more allocation of CIF than their counterparts in non-tribal areas. Promoting a central role for women in
CBOs, and enhancing their influence in delivery of public services, including food security, mother and
child health, education, gender safety was key to project‘s gender agenda. The project facilitated ‗social
action committees‘ in 13,058 VOs supported by similar committees in 552 MSs to spearhead the agenda
covering awareness raising, policy advocacy and collective social action. About 490 community managed
family counseling centers were set-up to address domestic violence and gender issues which took up
31,379 cases and resolved 22,042 cases.
Environment. The project was supporting a wide range of livelihoods activities without large
environmental impact. The project was encouraging use of alternate fuel sources, stall fed goat rearing
and restricting sheep rearing to available grazing area, etc. to mitigate micro level environmental risks.
Moreover, the project has pro-actively taken several steps to promote climate friendly initiatives. These
include adoption of sustainable agriculture practices (without use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers) in
over 3 million acres of land leading to improvement in soil carbon and convergence with MGNREGS for
land improvement, ground water development and soil fertility treatments. Other initiatives include
application of tank silt for enhancing soil fertility; promotion of community kitchen gardens; and fodder
cultivation to reduce grazing and thereby soil erosion.
Financial Management. At the mid-term review there were some concerns about the large amounts of
unused funds held in various accounts, but this was no longer an issue by the end of the project. In terms
of the management of the CIF, there were built in mechanisms for bookkeeping and accountability at all
levels, from SHGs to the State level, with regards to accounting, auditing and financial management
capacity. The project nevertheless had to constantly develop increasingly sophisticated systems to deal
with the rapidly expanding number of transactions. The project has invested in Electronic Fund
Management System that integrates transaction processing in the project with cash management services
offered by the banking system on Core Banking System (CBS) platform. This system has not only made
the fund management very efficient but allowed real time monitoring of fund flows and utilization across
accounting units.
Procurement. Aside from the component on ‗out-of-school children‘ implemented by APSWERIES, the
project was not concerned with major physical works. The only significant contracts were consultancy
and service contracts. Almost 89% of the total goods procurement under the project was successfully
carried out by the community itself. SERP has built good in-house capacity for procurement management
with officials in Procurement Unit trained by ASCI. The unit developed manuals in local language and
provided capacity building and handholding support to CBOs on procurement procedures. These
arrangement helped communities build their capacity for carrying out procurement. One of the major
activities under the project was procurement of 4,944 net books which was efficiently procured by 373
community based organizations (Mandal Samakhyas) following the shopping procedures. Throughout
the project period, no complaint was reported on procurement related issues. The procurement of all the
Goods and Services has been completed.
Governance and Accountability. The project embedded good governance and accountability practices at
all levels of project implementation. It also focused on building and strengthening community institutions
around these principles and practices through intensive institutional building efforts which were
rigorously measured and monitored through a mix of internal and external mechanisms. Finally, their
external linkages to private banks and public programs incentivize optimal governance and accountability

                                                     12
practices. Annex 2C describes captures various governance and accountability measures instituted in the
APRPRP.
2.5       Post-completion Operation and Next Phase
The Project during its implementation put in place broad based community institutional platforms, and
several mechanisms and policies enabling delivery of various Government programs and resources to
poor households through them. These are likely to contribute significantly to sustain the CBOs and the
related processes after the project ends, and which also mean that transition to post-completion is likely to
be smooth:
Organizational Sustainability
      a. Self managed institutions and last mile service delivery: Community institutions have developed
         into self managed entities and at each tier have developed well defined roles and rules of
         engagement. The VOs are being used by line departments as effective service delivery agents
         and by commercial banks as banking correspondents. VOs also manage community enterprises
         of the poor engaging in collective purchase of food, production inputs and raw materials, and
         marketing of agricultural commodities. VOs manage Nutrition and Day Care Centers and Early
         Child Education Centers and play key role in ensure access to public services, entitlements and
         other social security schemes like MGNREGS, etc.
      b. Nested institutions for convergence of services: MSs have emerged as sub-district level federation
         of CBOs and are providing multiple types of support to SHGs and VOs. Besides financing micro
         credit plans of VOs, MSs are also engaged in organizing and managing livelihood support
         services in sustainable agriculture, dairy, handlooms, nutrition and day care centers, early
         childhood education centers, etc. They also play important role in facilitating convergence with
         government departments, banks, etc.
      c. Higher order aggregation and coordination: ZSs act as forums for discussion and articulation of
         larger social and developmental issues affecting the poor. They have emerged as life insurance
         intermediaries in all project districts and coordinate with district level institutions like District
         Collectorate, DRDA, Government Departments, Commercial Banks, market institutions, etc.
         They also manage jobs call centers and network of rural English, work readiness and computer
         academies. In a few districts ZSs also run ‗gender call centre‘ in close coordination with police
         department and a network of counseling centers established by MSs.
      d. Social capital: More than 174,000 Community Managed Functionaries (Community Resource
         Persons (CRPs), Community Activists (e.g., health activists), Animators, Facilitators,
         Bookkeepers, and Para-botanists etc) support the CBOs.
Financial Sustainability. The major factors for financial sustainability in the project are the following:
      a. Internal Corpus: Propelled by the regular member savings, earnings from inter-lending and
         receipt of revolving fund, the resource base of the SHGs has expanded to US$1.1 billion. On an
         average, the corpus per SHG worked out to US$1,118 at the close of the project. About 868 MSs




                                                      13
          are functioning on a sustainable basis. An external study by SOCHURSUD, 20118 on these CBOs
          showed that incomes of VOs were twice over their operating costs.
      b. Loans from commercial banks: Annual credit flow to poor households and their groups has
         increased multi-fold and now stand at US$1.5 billion a year. The cumulative credit flow from
         commercial banks to these groups since the start of the project has grown to US$7.86 billion.
         Hence, each US$1 of CIF has leveraged about US$21 as loans from mainstream financial sector.
      c. External Funds: The Tribal Welfare Department and the SC, ST and BC corporations are also
         routing their funds especially revolving funds through MSs. It is expected that SHGs, VOs and
         MSs will be able to sustain the recurring costs of managing the organizations and will be able to
         leverage significant amount of investments in form of credit and grants after the project
         investments are over.
Economic Sustainability. The various tiers of institutions have developed business and management
skills, making them viable economic institutions with public, private and cooperative partners. The line
departments/government agencies have come to recognize SHGs and their federations as representatives
of the poor and have established very productive partnerships to facilitate delivery of economic and social
services. Similarly, commercial organizations acknowledge the low cost and efficient distribution and
service delivery channels offered by the CBOs.
Pro-poor Institutional Ecosystem. The women‘s empowerment program in AP is the largest in the
country and accounts for more than 42 % of the total SHG-bank linkage portfolio in the country. The
project has been instrumental in reformulating the poverty reduction strategy of GOAP. The Government
also responded effectively by putting in place many policies and legal provisions to sustain and scale up
several of the project interventions. These include: Andhra Pradesh Self Help Groups (SHG) Women Co-
contributory Pension Act, 2009, Andhra Pradesh Women SHG (Leasing of Agricultural land Bill, and
convergence of various Government programs with IKP, Rajiv Yuva Kiranalu (Jobs Mission), Milk
Mission etc.
Supporting national poverty reduction initiatives. The National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM)
launched in 2010, is largely drawn on the successful practices in APRPRP and other livelihoods projects
in India. The World Bank supported National Rural Livelihoods Project (NRLP $1 billion) approved in
2011, will strengthen implementation of NRLM by setting up dedicated institutional structures like that of
SERP in 13 high poverty and lagging states (accounting for 88 percent of the rural poor in the country)
and establishing effective program management systems. It will also support intensive implementation in
400 blocks in these States as local proof of concepts, drawing heavily on twinning arrangements and TA
provision from APRPRP and other large scale livelihood projects.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
At the end of the project, objectives, design and implementation were still of highest relevance with
regard to the Bank‘s CAS and government plans and programs. While in the State of AP the project has

                                                     14
contributed to a significant degree in addressing the objectives (see next), the extent and scale of poverty
issues and the depth of poverty of the poorest of the poor means work has not finished yet.
The design at the time of the ICRR, with its modifications and up-scaling, built on and strengthened the
original design elements in the PAD from 2003. These have also evolved into the State‘s fully supported
IKP program, and most of the new associated schemes that were included in the additional financing are
embedded with other State institutions, which now continue to provide services and outreach to the
poorest in the State. The project design, as noted above, also provides a considerable basis and learning
ground for NRLM – which are also reflected in Government of India‘s recommendations for the Twelfth
Five Year Plan.
The project amply demonstrated that the implementation processes both at management level and those
practiced by women SHGs are still fully relevant to the State and beyond. While there is little doubt the
right approaches are in place to build on demand side services, the State and program have expressed the
need to develop models with more strategic approaches on addressing the specific and higher level needs
of economic livelihoods development in particular.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
APRPRP significantly exceeded development outcomes envisaged in the project. It delivered not only
household and community level outcomes but also had a profound systemic impact leading to policy
reforms for building pro-poor ecosystem in the State akin to what is normally achieved under
Programmatic Lending or Development Policy Loan operations. The project is, by far, one of the largest
poverty reduction initiatives in the world with an outreach of 11 million households. The nearest
comparable initiative in the region is that of Grameen Bank which has reached 8.3 million households in
Bangladesh.
During both rounds of additional financing the intermediate and overall outcomes were enhanced
considerably, and these were all surpassed by the time of ICR mission. Further, the pilots launched in
APRPRP to achieve higher order outcomes—like health and nutrition, education, etc.—were not only
substantially scaled up but also served as national models for second generation investments in livelihood
projects. Some of the significant achievements are reflected by the outcomes and impacts created by the
project at household level, community level and system level, reflected in the assessment of indicators
from the PAD and related targets outlined in Table F in the data section and discussed below (and in
greater detail in a special Annex 3). While the highly satisfactory achievement of quantified indicators is
clear, it is important to note the breadth of achievement of the project, in livelihoods and institutional
terms:
   i.    APRPRP is one of the largest social inclusion program targeting women from the poorest and
         most vulnerable communities and marginalized groups like SC, ST, particularly vulnerable tribal
         groups (PVTG), differently-abled persons (DAPs), migrants, etc., to get program benefits and
         efforts to mainstream them.
  ii.    The project‘s interventions have enabled the poor and poorest households to reduce impact of
         shocks and vulnerabilities, acquire assets, and enhance incomes, increase consumption, and link
         with markets.




                                                    15
  iii.   The community institutional platforms and substantial pool of social capital resulting directly
         from project investments have provided peer support in crisis, improved access to livelihood
         services, leveraged financial services, and delivery of public services in the last mile.
  iv.    The project facilitated the poor and their institutions to command considerable market share in
         formal markets, covering financial, commodity, job, markets and safety nets (discussed further
         below under relevant indicators).
   v.    Results from last mile service delivery approaches using institutional platforms of the poor have
         impacted the manner in which several existing programs are administered. For instance, setting
         up help-desks for poor viz. ‗case managers‘ at Primary Health Center (PHC) or ‗bank mitra‘
         (banking facilitators) in a rural branch of commercial bank have significantly enhanced the
         access to services for the poor. Similarly, the community procurement of AP/NTFP
         commodities has impacted administration of Government procurement operations under
         Minimum Support Price (MSP) schemes.
  vi.    APRPRP approach formed basis for several second generation livelihood projects in other States
         of India like Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Orissa. Now Government of India has formulated National
         Rural Livelihoods Mission with estimated investment of US$5.5 billion, based on the successful
         experiences of World Bank supported livelihood projects particularly APRPRP.
 vii.    The project provided TA through training and exposure visits for almost 25 countries in South
         Asia, East Asia, Central Asia and Africa in the areas of social mobilization, institution building,
         financial inclusion and livelihoods development.
The analysis of the achievement of the PDO is based on an examination of the PDO indicators outlined in
the PAD. The additional financing project papers note no significant changes to the results framework
aside from changes in scope, and some additional refinements to take into account new initiatives.
Specific targets set during the project period are categorized under the original, often unquantified,
original PAD indicators. The analysis largely draws upon the Impact Assessment done by Center for
Economic and Social Studies in 2010 (CESS 2010 IA), based on a panel survey of 4,800 project
participant (PP) and non-participant (NP) households. Looked at rigorously, participants and non-
participant households in the CESS 2010 IA are not fully comparable as they had slightly different
starting characteristics (see Annex 5 for analysis), therefore to minimize attribution errors, where possible
the analysis has used comparisons of relative changes within social groups to minimize any such effect.
In addition the analysis draws on extensive MIS data and a number of other independent impact and
qualitative assessments done in the project period (see References). The scale of APRPRP inputs and the
timing of the benefit flows during the main APRPRP disbursement period give considerable confidence
in drawing the conclusions below.
a) Empowerment (voice) of rural poor enhanced largely through number and percentage of
community-based organizations (CBOs) functioning well in relation to their social, economic, and
political objectives. A cumulative number of over 11.2 million rural households have been organized into
1 million SHGs (PDO Indicator 1, table F), exceeding the initial targets and those revised in the second
additional financing (2nd AF), covering 90% of the identified poor households in the State. SHGs at
neighborhood level were federated into 38,646 VOs at the village level, 1,098 MSs at the mandal level
and 22 ZSs at the district level thus covering all the rural mandals and districts in the State (and achieving
targets set in 2nd AF). These institutions are supported by 173,841 community functionaries (2nd AF
target exceeded). The CBOs have built up a very large amount of financial capital through savings of Rs

                                                     16
730 million and a corpus with addition from interest repayments and other funds amounting Rs 1.1
billion, the 2nd AF and thus the PDO indicator 2 of US$1 billion target was thus exceeded.
b) Increased access to credit, insurance and reduced indebtedness. Achieving the PDO indicator 3,
over 929,000 SHGs cumulatively leveraged US$7.86 billion from commercial banks, building on the
SHG Bank linkage Program. The increased access also allowed households to swap high cost debts
lowering the interest repayment obligations, by 4-10 times. About 9.6 million SHG members enrolled for
life and disability insurance program. Together with enrollment of over 5 million members in co-
contributory pension scheme, this achieved the PDO indicator 4 targets which had to be scaled back by
caps on numbers set by the State government, after the second financing targets were agreed.
c) Percentage increase in access to and/or ownership of land. Legal and survey assistance helped to
resolve 430,000 tenure disputes, improving accessibility of SHG members to very large area of 875,000
acres, achieving the PDO indicator target 5 set under the 2nd AF. This was in addition to assisting the
direct purchase of land to over 5,000 poor mainly SC/ST members to get about an acre each in early
stages of the project, as designed in the PAD.
d) Household income of the poor increased and/or sources of income diversified. The incomes of
participants household grew from US$488 per annum to US$1,132 per annum. While no target was set
for PDO indicator 6, the indicator can be considered achieved as for the poor and POP groups the
increase was greater among participants (124%) than non participants (111%), by nearly 13%, with
poverty reduction effects (see section 3.5.a). Household expenditures, especially for the poorest of the
poor were also greater among project participants. The project also supported the diversification (PDO
indicator 7) and strengthening of livelihoods systems in terms of sustainable agriculture, dairy,
community marketing and youth employment schemes, which were piloted and scaled up, resulting in
important market share by the poor in the sectors in the Sate. For example 3.8 million acres of land
brought under sustainable agriculture practices, 80 million liters of milk is procured annually from
151,000 dairy producers, US$578.2 million worth of Agriculture Produce (AP)/Non-Timber Forest
Produce (NTFP) procured annually from small and marginal producers, and 306,183 rural youth trained
and placed in private sector jobs. The targets for these set under the 2nd AF were largely met or exceeded
(no targets in PAD).
e) Household perception of the quality of and access to basic services--education, health, integrated
child development services (ICDS) – improved. There was substantial increase in the percentage of
beneficiaries accessing PDS and in procuring additional quantities of cereals, sugar, edible oil and pulses
from PDS. The project participants accessed an increase of 3.28 kg of PDS cereals, about double
accessed by non-participants (PDO indicator 9, not targets set, achieved). On the health front and across
project participants in the sample of CESS 2010 IA, the number of unsafe deliveries has declined by 9%
among participants from around 30% (achieving PDO indicator 8).
f) Increase in percentage of children (by gender) enrolled to schools. Over 115,000 girl children were
enrolled in Residential Schools (PDO indicator 10)– exceeding the PAD PDO target 11 of 25,000
children, many times over – with pass percentages consistently 10-15% higher than government schools.
Also 21,700 mainly tribal children, enrolled in Early Childhood Centers.

g) Improved access to disability certification and increased use of community-based rehabilitation.
306,211 persons with disabilities (PWD) have been mobilized into 32,780 SHGs achieving PDO target
11 under 2nd AF, and far exceeding PAD target. The project has been able to leverage over US$3 million

                                                    17
from Government departments and NGOs for free surgical corrections, and distributed aids and
appliances to over 18,000 PWD. Further, the project facilitated improved access to credit with bank
linkages of Rs 157 crore ($35 million) to 11,990 PWD SHG groups.

9) Local governments more inclusive and responsive to the needs of the poor in pilot mandals (sub-
district level of government). While the project decided not to work directly with Gram Panchayats at
MTR, the increased participation of poor in Gram Sabhas, election of large number of Women into
leadership positions in the local Government ( Panchayats) in 2006 and 2010, and introduction of rights
based schemes like MGNREGS brought inclusivity and pro-poor agenda in Panchayats (PDO indicator
12).
3.3 Efficiency
The initial CBA for the Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction project (APRPRP) analyzed the two
largest components of the project: (i) Community Investment fund (CIF) and (ii) Educational support for
girls‘ out-of school and school dropouts. The PAD assumed: Benefits from (i) dairy, (ii) cashew, (iii)
land development and cultivation of sorghum and red gram, (iv) NTFP, and small infrastructure. The
evaluation of the livelihood subprojects was based on a minimum financial cost benefit return. Each of
the subprojects analyzed possessed a financial return in excess of 12%. In the PAD, for the educational
support component, an economic analysis was made showing an ERR of 12.1%. No overall ERR was
done. Based on the investments made by the project and estimates of household incomes, certain
efficiency ratios have been presented below:

To assess the IRR of sub-projects, a study was conducted by SERP across 6 project districts covering 475
sub-projects. The selection of different categories of sub-projects was in proportion to the population
proportion. The sample sub-projects for which IRR is calculated is furnished below. The study brought
out that the IRR was much larger than what was envisaged in PAD for almost all activities.

In addition with the building of self-sustaining CBOs, with growing own capital, leverage and bank
linkages, and stronger livelihoods support services. Additionally with the revolving fund system and
leverage, this has greatly increased the number of beneficiaries, and thus the economic returns are
expected to be considerable. In addition to the elements used in the PAD analysis, the project has had
important economic support activities that have scaled up significantly to large numbers of rural poor.
These have been in community marketing of agricultural produce, dairy marketing, sustainable
agriculture, formal job creation, and improving land tenure, with measured benefits in terms market
volumes, turnover, incomes and employment creation. Estimates of benefit/cash flows at household level
in respect of major interventions of the IKP are given below:

Through the CBOs the project has also created an efficient service delivery system for a range of
government schemes, of which those on insurance, pensions, public food distribution system, are
effective at State level significance. Not only are these low cost delivery, recognized by government
agencies as such, but they have also improved targeting and reduced leakage, with greater quality of
services, further increasing efficiency and effectiveness. These services, together with the State wide
outreach of livelihoods activities, are likely to have poverty reduction results with potential of further
creating important, but hard to quantify, fiscal effects.
Economic and Financial Analysis was carried out for total project investment of US$472 million taken at
current prices. With the provision of only US$ 190 million for the livelihood investments, the FRR is
18.1%. Institutional linkages with Banks providing access to US$7.86 billion for 0.9 million SHGs
improved the FRR significantly to 26.3%. Diversifying the income activities through community
managed sustainable agriculture, livestock, community led marketing and employment generation
activities further enhanced the FRR to 31.2%. Inclusion of all project costs resulted in 30.1% FRR for the
project as a whole. Net present value increased from Rs 3 billion (only project led CIF) to Rs 82 billion
(with institutional linkages for additional credit) and further to a maximum of Rs 112 billion (with
diversified income generation activities). Livestock and sustainable agriculture are two pre-dominating
activities and is an option of 73% of the beneficiaries. ERR is not expected to be much different from
FRR, since international traded inputs and outputs are only marginal. What is therefore important is the
financial attractiveness of the community led project interventions. This is confirmed by the annual
income levels of US$488 per annum to US$1,132 per annum for all groups according to Impact
Evaluation Study by CESS 2010, which means sustainability of project interventions are most likely.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (component wise outcome rating in Annex 2b)
Rating: Highly Satisfactory




                                                   19
The project has had three types of impacts (i) household impact (envisaged in the PAD); (ii) System impact
(envisaged but not to the extent it happened—e.g. bank linkage and credit (oversupply of which became a
problem and lead to the microfinance crisis) and enhanced access to entitlements; and (iii) Policy impact
(not envisaged in the original design and is a big bonus). Unlike many investment lending projects which
do not have the impact beyond the system boundaries, the investment by APRPRP in creating institutional
platforms of the poor (SHGs and their federations) facilitated efficient delivery of entitlements and public
services and created a pro-poor eco-system and a policy climate for attracting the mainstream public,
private and financial sectors to partner with the poor. Considering the multitude and the scale of impacts,
and leverage of resources and services from the cumulative project investment of US$315 million, make
APRPRP very cost effective.
The project was very successful in building a pro-poor financial sector in the State that has cumulatively
loaned US$7.86 billion to institutions of the poor and enrolled 9.1 million poor for life and disability
insurance. It has also enabled access to entitlements like MGNREGS, social pensions, other safety nets to a
tune of US$1.6 billion in a targeted manner. Many Development Departments in AP particularly Rural
Development, Agriculture, Health, Women and Child Welfare, etc. have started using the community
institutional platforms of the poor in their design of service delivery arrangements. These are backed by (a)
legislative initiatives like Andhra Pradesh Self Help Groups (SHG) Women Co-contributory Pension Act,
2009 and Andhra Pradesh Women SHG (Leasing of Agricultural land) Bill; (b) policy initiatives like
convergence of MGNREGS, National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana
(RKVY) with IKP; Rajiv Yuva Kiranalu (Jobs Mission) for creating 1.5 million jobs, Milk Mission for
doubling milk production in the State, etc.; Scaling up Nutrition and Day Care Centers (NDCCs) across all
36,000 villages in the State based on the results from such centers in 4,200 villages. (c) institutional
arrangements like ‗Employment Generation and Marketing Mission‘ (EGMM) was created as a dedicated
institution to support market/placement linked skill trainings and ‗Sthree Nidhi‘ as an apex for SHG
Federations managing and recycling CIF on a technology platform that allows rapid loan disbursement.
The impact of the project in ushering various pro-poor policy initiatives in Andhra Pradesh is given in
Annex 2d, (c) procedural reforms like payment of social pensions and social audit by CBOs, etc. and (e)
dedicated resources for schemes like Pavala Vaddi (interest incentive for SHG loans).
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Reduction in Poverty Incidence: APRPRP contributed to a considerable reduction in rural poverty in
Andhra Pradesh.9 The percentage of households below the poverty line declined from 29.4 percent to 20.7
percent between baseline (2004) and end term (2009)—a decline of about 2.1 percentage points per
annum. However, the estimates indicate that most of this decline was due to the rapid reduction of
poverty among the participants which reduced from 29.8 percent to 17.5 percents in comparison the
poverty ratio for non participants declined to just 27.2 percent. In comparison the percentage of
households below the poverty line in rural Andhra Pradesh as per NSSO data the poverty estimates
declined from 42.5 percent in 1993-94 to 29.3 percent in 2004-05, at 1.2 percentage points per annum.
Subsequently, between 2004-05 and 2006-07, rural poverty declined sharply at the rate of 2 percentage
points per annum to 25.3.
9
  Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS) attempted to relate poverty estimates by NSSO with the baseline
survey. Using NSSO data and revised poverty line (rural) of 2004-05, percentage of households below poverty was
estimated for base line survey (2004). For the poverty line for end term survey in 2009 was estimated by updating
the BLS poverty line for price changes using the price index computed from CPIAL.

In comparison, analysis across social groups indicates that poverty declined among participants from
socially excluded households (SCs and STs) more substantially than non-participant SCs and STs
between BLS and FUS-2. In the case of SCs, the decline was 14.7 percentage points compared to 6
percentage points among the non-participants, and for ST households the poverty among participant
households declined by 15.5 percentage points against 8 percentage points among the non-participants.
Gender Empowerment: The empowerment of women has taken place on a large scale, combined with a
greater role in the livelihood economy. Moreover, in response to their increased capacity and confidence,
women have identified and helped pilot many process innovations and new interventions that are now
scaled up under the project. With increased confidence they have tackled a range of other community
issues—such as food security, drinking water, sanitation, etc. Further, through a dedicated gender
strategy backed by strategic awareness raising and communication (see Annex 2), the project has
addressed alcoholism, domestic violence, child marriage, trafficking and legal cases (over 22,000 cases),
and through Mandal and village social action committee and community managed social counseling
centers. The Impact Assessment by CESS notes reduced percentage of women marrying below legal age,
and percent of children in household engaged in work, especially among SC and ST, whereas it increased
among non-participants.
Political Empowerment: In addition, the political voice of the poor and the women who lead the CBOs
has increased. A large number of CBO leaders from poorest households have contested and won the local
government elections: In the last Panchayat elections held in 2006, 25 % of the women elected at all
levels had been involved in the project supported institutions. This number further increased in various
subsequent elections with a number of participating women being elected to higher levels of local
government. The number of pro poor and women State policies developed during the project period
reflects the increased responsiveness of the State to the voice of a very large and increasingly influential
SHG movement. In a particular case, a ZS leader has been nominated as Member of Legislative Council
(Upper House) by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. On a more day to day basis the interaction with
local governments has intensified with collectors and line agency representative regularly joining monthly
ZS meetings, for example, to listen to issues and identify opportunities for improvement in service
delivery and collaboration with users.
Section 3.2 has covered extensive benefits in terms of poverty impacts, improvements in the situation of
and role of women, as well as in new social and political relationships. Gender and Social development

                                                      21
has had changes on a very large scale in terms of the development of highly inclusive and networked
federations, largely composed of poorer women from lower and tribal castes, and with a considerable
increase in economic roles, and in the access to a range of services which address specific gender and
poorer social groups‘ concerns.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
To a very large degree the project has been about institutional change, especially at the community level,
but also in the process strengthening the implementing institutions. With the scale of interventions and
engagement of a large range of agencies and actors in public, private and social sectors, it has contributed
to changing institutional landscape in the State for rural development. Here in summary are some of the
changes:
   i.   Institutional platforms of the poor in the form of an extensive network of CBOs with capacities
        and assets have been developed.
  ii.   Systems have been put in place, especially for last mile service delivery: banks, insurance,
        delivery of food etc. Services have changed the way they do business.
 iii.   SERP as mechanism and associated institutions has built up a considerable capacity for
        innovating and delivering rural development. Staff from SERP had also moved to key
        government positions, such as District collectors, influencing further how programs and schemes
        are implemented.
Not only this but the project has been a significant player providing space for managers and State
government to directly contribute to changing the policies related to the project outcomes:
   i.   There has been a higher level responsiveness – both by local and State government to modifying,
        and/or developing new programs and schemes to address new needs for SHG embers, for
        example in such schemes as: MGNREGS, pensions, social safety nets, credit policy, land access
        for leaseholders, CMSA, and nutrition,
  ii.   It was pointed out during the ICR mission, that convergence with government departments in
        some areas (e.g. agriculture) could have been stronger, and the project could have done a bit more
        on sectoral work with health, education and work with private sector.
 iii.   A very significant number of policies that have been changed or introduced at State level (see
        annex 4), often drafted by the concerned project officers.
 iv.    The project has influenced livelihoods programs in other States, and national architecture and
        approach for the National Rural Livelihoods Mission.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
Many initiatives were not foreseen at the outset of the project, or only piloted on small scale in the
beginning, which have by the end of project been considerable scaled up and have resulted in important
results: CMSA, legal empowerment approaches to gender and land claims, linkages with new programs
such as MGNREGS, etc. Many of these, and also the several of the projects core activities, have been
also been accompanied by new policies being established for institutionalizing the initiatives, which were
not foreseen at design.
Also the institutional systems provided important platform to provide rapid responses to Tsunami affected
communities, working through the network of federations. There has also been an adoption of the project

                                                    22
approach of the community institutional platform in the urban context of AP, with setting up of a
dedicated society for poverty elimination in urban areas. This society used a number of experienced staff
from APRPRP to kick start its activities. Project staff and approaches have provided direct lessons in the
design of new projects such as in Bihar, thus resulting in significant increase in effective implementation
and reduction of the learning curve.

Annex 3 provides a summary of the CESS Impact Assessment report of 2010. Annex 4 provides a
summary of a workshop held during the ICR mission, of testimonials of beneficiary experiences under
different project components.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
The project has withstood considerable changes. Nevertheless, all the political parties, irrespective of their
differences in the mandates and party philosophies, unanimously supported the growing SHG movement
and APRPRP in the state. All the three governments that came into power provided extensive support to
the project.
The strong microfinance network of SHG and their federations that has been built up has been able to
withstand the AP microfinance crisis, and also has been robust to the subsequent State legislation to
further regulate the sector.
The risk to a negative development outcome beyond the project period is Low, because:
   i.   Basic institutional platforms, capacities, systems and assets are in place at the community level,
        backed up by networks of federations and support institutions.
  ii.   The growth in bank linkages and assets is continuing, and more livelihoods initiatives are starting
        and increasing in scale.
 iii.   SERP and State government support remain strong (for example in the launching of Milk
        Mission, and continued budget support from the State Government).
 iv.    Not of major concern, but work still in progress for the completion of POP strategy
        implementation and full operation of MIS.
  v.    While large-scale implementation of livelihoods initiatives underway, the future institutional
        innovations in the form of Societies, Foundations or other forms for SPVs for sustaining
        specialized support for key initiatives like agriculture, dairy, health and education need to be
        further developed, and supported. This institutional mechanism will then will allow participation
        and linkages with public, private and social enterprise sectors.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory.
The World Bank oversaw a design process that was comprehensive, building directly on past and ongoing
projects and programs in the State, but also incorporating a flexible design, with a consistent set of core

                                                     23
components, but also providing room for innovation and pilots, which could be taken up and scaled up
further. The project design also incorporated intensive technical assistance, Finance Plus approaches, and
sharing and learning processes.
(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory
Supervision has been continuous, comprehensive, and highly responsive to the needs of the Borrower,
with a consistent team providing frequent and on needs basis support to SERP, with objective feedback
highly appreciated by the implementing agency. A key strategy for the supervision mission was to
conduct a range of thematic oriented missions and not trying to cover all aspects under the project in each
mission. This allowed the Project and Bank team to focus a series of missions on developing new
innovations and strategies. The Bank provided key support in the form of developing additional
financing to successfully deepen and further scale up the program to State wide scale. With frequent
missions more in the nature of Technical Assistance to the client, internally World Bank the task team
was awarded the first ever Golden Plough award for excellence in supervision.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank provided intensive and flexible support to the State to innovate and scale up.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
GOAP has shown remarkable commitment through:
       i.   Many supportive policies issued during the project period to reinforce and institutionalize
            initiatives started under the project, largely based on presentation of evidence of impacts.
            Similarly the State modified existing programs and resources, and also brought in new
            resources to address the needs of the target group.
      ii.   Routing schemes through community organizations, specifically like Tribal welfare, BC,
            Minorities, etc.
     iii.   The State government in the above recognized and responded to the emerging political voice
            of communities, reflecting a deepened appreciation of the paradigms of development that the
            project has promoted.
     iv.    Supporting a continuity and growth of cadres of experienced staff and providing them
            supportive career path, creating a strong incentive for high levels of performance and
            initiative. The project director was not changed for 10 years, highly unusual in any program
            in the country.
      v.    Significant investment in use of ICT to develop MIS, biometric based service delivery and
            use of mobiles for community organizations ahead of time in line with other e-governance
            initiatives in the State.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The State Rural Development Department and SERP have managed the project as part of bigger longer
term program, building on the methods and wins of earlier projects, both of World Bank but also earlier
empowerment projects:
   i.   SERP maintained an ethos and listening to the ultimate beneficiary throughout, and from this in
        particular, brought out new ideas and identified and built on innovations at all levels. SERP
        managed to maintain itself as a learning organization and allowed for innovation and learning.
  ii.   SERP managed the program with all components focusing on the core self-sustaining institutional
        development platform – with respective components managed highly professionally with the help
        of social capital. It managed scale and quality effectively.
 iii.   SERP developed a professional HR system to attract the best talent from the Government and the
        market to work on Rural Poverty Reduction and Livelihoods.
 iv.    Managers were intimately involved in the pro poor policy drafting processes, which were later
        adopted by the State. Thus SERP was able to play an advisory and advocacy role on pro poor
        policies and institutions which supported scaled up implementation and increased effectiveness
        and efficiency.
  v.    With scale and the individual efforts required for each component (many the scale of projects in
        themselves) sometimes a silo effect developed, especially with regards to developing a coherent
        MIS system. Even here however the project is developing technical system with potential for
        scaling up widely in India.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
Both the State government and the implementing agency SERP were fully committed to the aims of the
project using it a launch pad to develop and implement a State wide rural poverty reduction program. To
this, they committed consistently highly motivated and experienced staff, and gave them the flexibility to
operate for results and to innovating new ideas.
6. Lessons Learned
The project through during its implementation period has contributed to very important lessons which
have already influenced other livelihoods projects, policies and the recently approved National Rural
Livelihoods Project. The most significant is in developing a model for a State scale institutional platform
for empowering and reducing poverty of the rural poor through grassroots women‘s groups. The model
follows a comprehensive capacity building and targeted investment process, generating a many-fold
leverage of private and public resources, and creating a demand and channel for supplying last mile
services to reach out to the poor. The model builds in sustainability and inclusion, and with multiple tried
and tested functions, provides robustness for communities to deal with a range of external shocks. Some
important elements of this model for lessons are:
   i.   Politically and institutionally integrated support is crucial to the success of poverty reduction
        efforts. To start and grow such as movement needs initial core political support and high level
        commitment of dedicated officials (champions). Continuity of managers backed up by a

                                                    25
       professional project management team and large teams of locally grounded specialists has been
       critical to bringing the model to scale. A State level dedicated and autonomous project
       management unit/entity (PMU) with very close relationships to related government agencies, but
       with enough room and incentives to foster innovation and continuity is critical in the process.
 ii.   Building strong institutions of the poor enhances the predictability and effectiveness of
       development outcomes. Capacity building of professional staff and CBOs is critical. Effective
       targeting for inclusion of the poorest, social mobilization and capacity building of CBOs requires
       expert skills for both strategy formulation and field implementation. The project built a robust
       back-end institutional infrastructure to ensure a steady supply of trained professionals for
       livelihood projects and emphasized developing strong community institutions and a cadre of local
       community resource persons and best practitioners to take over a large part of the CBO building
       exercise and the project matured.
iii.   Create an environment for continuous innovation to support a multi-pronged approach to
       livelihoods development. It did this by keeping a flexible design that could easily respond to
       emerging ideas and successes, building the ability of communities themselves to develop and test
       ideas, a commitment to listening and responding to the needs and suggestions of beneficiaries,
       and a willingness to accept failure as long as the project learned from that failure. More
       innovation came from the grassroots than the board room.
iv.    Addressing deep-seated exclusion requires long-term investments. The project has included
       poor households into the SHG network on an unparalleled scale. This has been possible largely
       due to its processes like participatory identification of the poor, use of community resource
       persons for social mobilization, and a dedicated poorest of the poor (PoP) strategy for including
       the core poor into program benefits. It can be achieved over a decade of sustained effort
       requiring two traditional project cycles.
 v.    AP Microfinance Crisis. Over-supply of credit, coupled with lack of regulation, created
       disequilibrium that has had major negative repercussions on the microfinance industry. As a
       result, the following demand-side strategies should be supported early on in future operations: a)
       financial literacy and debt counseling services; b) promoting strong savings focus in SHGs, as
       against leveraging of credit from commercial banks and MFIs; c) strong financial management
       and accounting system at the SHG/federation; and d) intensive livelihood support and value chain
       development. The supply side should: a) engage SHG Federations as intermediaries; b) develop
       alternate delivery models for reaching financial services to the poor; c) building a robust MIS and
       information bureau and sharing the data, as required; and d) ICT-based systems for client
       feedback.
vi.    Convergence, partnerships and market linkages. Aggregate institutions of the poor attract
       mainstream market players. Convergence of programs allows bundled service delivery increase
       availability, accessibility, affordability and reliability of services. To support efforts of the poor
       in overcoming poverty, a household-centered approach with multiple project interventions has
       proved to be successful. Strategic partnerships (MoUs) with Government departments,
       commercial banks, public, private and social entrepreneurship sectors should be supported not
       only to provide smooth and preferential access to services by the poor but also capture growth
       opportunities amplifying the livelihood impacts.



                                                    26
vii.    Linking with Panchayats and local governments. The livelihood projects help people create
        their own private sector through federations of organized CBOs. These help the poor build
        private assets through savings and lending, co-create support services, and link with factor
        markets to enhance their livelihoods. Even while working on the private goods agenda, the
        empowered CBOs link more effectively up with Panchayats for public good interventions, local
        infrastructure and access to services and entitlements.       They also create the social capital
        foundations of the local governance systems. However this relationship needs to be managed
        carefully so that these institutional arrangements do not compete with each other. In case of AP,
        the commitment of State Government to Panchayats has been traditionally low thus limiting the
        collaboration between institutions of the poor and local government.
viii.   Results orientation and web-enabled MIS: Shifting away from the mere expenditure tracking,
        inputs and funds flow, the livelihood programs should move towards tracking results. With a vast
        scale of operations and multiple function M&E data management, information management are
        critical, and have to be appreciated from the very start as integral part of management at all levels
        with the attendant investment and innovation in modular and flexible MIS, drawing on a range of
        emerging IT tools, complemented by a range of qualitative tools. Innovative rapid impact
        assessment indicators and methods are required to facilitate real-time flow of information for
        effective decision making.
 ix.    Effective fiduciary assurance systems including standardized financial management, regular
        audits, etc. It will help projects to put in place computerized Financial Accounting and MIS,
        transparent and rigorous procurement procedures and dynamic monitoring and learning systems
        that will capture both qualitative and quantitative aspects of program implementations.
  x.    Integrating social accountability and good governance measures into project DNA. Managing
        scale is dependent upon a simple and result oriented governance and accountability framework in
        livelihood projects based on the principles of transparency, equity, accountability and
        performance. At community level, CBOs should be facilitated to develop norms and systems for
        downward accountability and peer supervision. These include shared leadership responsibility,
        consensual decision making, social audit committees and community auditors, public disclosure
        of accounts, etc.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
There were many changes in the internal and external environment. SERP was focused on building good
quality institutions at scale and develop in them the ability to address multiple issues affecting their
livelihoods and impacting poverty. The project was able to reach scale though extensive use of CRPs that
was more effective, sustainable and a low cost strategy. The project became a project by the people. To
overcome the development paradox described in borrower‘s comments, it was quite important for SERP
to come out with a clear strategy to ensure to provide exclusive support to PoP groups and approach them
in more focused manner. Similarly health and nutrition interventions launched in pilot mode at MTR
stage showed very positive results such as 100% safe deliveries in the pilot area, reduced anemia,
increased access to health services as well as improved nutritional and health security outcomes. Hence,
these were scaled up in additional financing stages and are expected to yield exponential results in the
near future. The accessibility to PDS for SHG members has improved tremendously in comparison to
non-SHG members.

Annex 2A. Outputs and Intermediate Outcome by Component
Component 1: Strengthening institutional, social and human capital
The focus of component 1 in the PAD was to (a) develop self-reliant and self-managed people‘s
organizations (CBOs) of the target communities; (b) build and strengthen federation and networks of
these groups; (c ) strengthen the capacities of the PRIs, especially at GP and Mandal levels and in line
departments and NGOs; (d) strengthen the convergence among education, Health and Nutrition
Departments; (e) promote information dissemination, awareness building, and knowledge sharing of the
project; and (f) build strategic partnership with the private sector and civil society. The project achieved
and scaled up the achievements of this component, meeting or exceeding ambitiously expanded additional
financing targets.

      The project used the CIF resources flexibly, focusing on revolving funds through SHGs and their
      federations, to build up their own financial capital, and leverage unprecedented levels of government
      resources, and especially bank loans (over 7 billion).

         The jobs programme was started only in 2006. Hence, 183,000 jobs were created in the last 2.5 years. Considering
      that the jobs program has been running well and the operational structures are well in place, a conservative target of
      120,000 jobs has been set for the next two years.
      11
         Target for collection of milk per day from dairy farmers was initially fixed assuming establishment of 300 BMCUs
      with Govt. funding, since Govt. funding was limited to establishment of 199 BMCUs only, milk procurement target
      is adjusted proportionately as 350,000 liters in peak season and 200,000 liters in lean season.

   Note 3: The spouses of the SHG members will now be enrolled in the life and disability insurance program versus
only SHG members as before. This leads to a conservative estimate of doubling of the participants from 8 million to
15 million. In view of the Govt. policy it is expected that these members are around 10 million.

   Note 4: Co-contributory pension scheme has been universally implemented in Andhra Pradesh by the state
government. Hence, it is anticipated that at least 6 million women will be enrolled in it. The Govt. has taken a
decision not to enroll new members. Hence, the expected outcome up to September 2011 would be restricted to 4.76
only.

Component 5: Support for persons with disabilities
Recognizing that People with Disabilities (PWD) are among the poorest and most vulnerable of the poor,
IKP adopted a participatory development approach to support them by building their capacities to
improve life skills and self-esteem. IKP has extended the support to enhance their livelihoods by creating
accessibility to government benefits and entitlements.
Subcomponent a)
Institutions of the disabled (PAD target 48,000 PWD in 80 mandals)
IKP adopted a participatory development approach to support persons with disabilities by building their
capacities to improve life skills and self esteem, with some of the following elements:

                                                      33
   Provision of assessment, treatment and rehabilitation services were made through community
    managed interventions through 88 neighborhood centers.
   Intensive activities were carried out in 748 mandals. 306,211 PWDs were organized into 32,782
    exclusive SHGs and also formed 3 Zilla Samakhyas in the State.
Subcomponent b)
Improve livelihood opportunities for the disabled
   PWDs are given an assistance of US$ 39.96 million through CIF, Bank Loans and Revolving Fund
    for enhancing their livelihood.
   Center for Person with Disability Livelihoods (CPDL) provided 902 placements in the public sector
    as against 1,493 trained.
Subcomponent c)
Promote convergence for programs of the disabled
   7,984 surgical corrections were carried out and 38,408 PWDs were issued assistive devices at no cost
    to them in the programme mandals.
   Through Software for Assessment of Disability for Access Rehabilitation and Empowerment
    (SADAREM), all the PWDs shall be assessed afresh, thus recording percentage of disability. All the
    existing Disability Certificates shall be replaced by re- assessing the persons with disabilities by
    concerned Dist. Medical Boards. So far 938,000 PWDs have been assessed against the target
    1,155,000.
   Under Jansree Bheema Yojana (JBY), 41,343 were covered and 300,000h PwD were proposed under
    JBY for 2011-12.
   6,094 Srama Shakti Sanghams have been formed exclusively for PWDs under MGNREGS.

Annex 2B: Assessment of Outcomes by Indicator
1. Empowerment (voice) of rural poor enhanced largely through number and percentage of
community-based organizations (CBOs) functioning well in relation to their social, economic, and
political objectives
Rating: Highly satisfactory
Coverage and scale: A cumulative number of over 11.2 million rural households have been
organized into 1 million SHGs (PDO Indicator 1, table F), using saturation approach to social
mobilization of all targeted poor households. The project has achieved its targets and unprecedented scale
of coverage, with results significant at the State and even national level, exceeding the initial targets and
those revised in the second additional financing (2nd AF).
Social Inclusion: The project has covered 90% of the identified poor households in the States and
mobilized 88% of the SC and 80% of the ST households. This has been due to combination of nuanced
strategies encompassing targeting, social mobilization, institutional development, resource allocation and
program monitoring. The proportional coverage of SC/STs uniformly is higher compared to their
proportion in the total rural population at the State level. The project placed specific emphasis on
organizing tribal groups and people with disabilities. This is largely mirrored in the analysis of project
participants and non-participants in the Impact Assessment by CESS (Annex 3). This also shows that the
POP (especially the more landless, livestock owning ones), were slightly underrepresented. In response
to the relatively low inclusion of POP and a desire to reach out to all the poorest in the State, the project
established a POP strategy, under initial implementation. All in all this level of inclusion of the poor
under a project is probably unprecedented.
Self managed institutions of the poor: The project supported the formation and strengthening of four tiers
of institutions of the poor: The affinity based SHG at neighborhood level were federated into 38,646 VOs
at the village level, 1,098 MSs at the mandal level and 22 ZSs at the district level thus covering all the
rural mandals and districts in the State (and achieving targets set in 2 nd AF). These institutions are
supported by 173,841 community functionaries (2nd AF target exceeded), including community activists,
community resource persons, book keepers, agriculture extension workers, para-vets, village botanists,
etc. All these tiers were to become self managed, self reliant and sustainable institutions. These
institutional arrangements have enabled the poor to access a range of services, resources and expertise
from both public and private sector. This is the core investment made by the project.
Economic resources: Collectively the CBOs have built up a very large amount of financial capital through
savings of Rs730 million and a corpus with addition from interest repayments and other funds amounting
Rs1.1 billion, the 2nd AF and PDO indicator 2 of US$1 billion target was thus exceeded. In addition
many communities, VOs and federations have acquired small scale infrastructure and service facilities
(for managing marketing, dairy collection units, early learning centers, etc). The thrift and credit based
SHGs and their federations have built considerable capacity to manage delivery of range of services to
their poor members including microfinance, livelihoods services, social services and safety nets,
insurance services, etc. by linking with Government departments, commercial banks, insurance
companies, private sector agencies and civil society organizations.
Gender Empowerment: The Gender strategy envisaged that the poor women would be able to access and
control over assets, incomes, all services available at village and individual level. Social Action
Committees (SACs) were formed in about 13,058 VOs with a membership of 112,739. Similar


                                                     35
committees were set up in 552 MSs to support the VOs to deal with the cases of gender discrimination,
gender violence and family disputes. 490 family counseling centers were also set-up in close
collaboration with police and district judiciary. 31,379 cases were taken up these centers and 22,402 cases
were resolved. These centers were recognized by Andhra Pradesh High Court as alternate dispute
resolution mechanism and settlement reached for family disputes and gender related issues were made
enforceable. The gender strategy backed up with strategic awareness creation and communication, the
project addressed issues of alcoholism, domestic violence, child marriage, female infanticide and child
trafficking. The Impact Assessment by CESS notes reduced percentage of women marrying below legal
age, and percent of children in household engaged in work, especially among SC and ST, whereas it
increased among non-participants.
Political Empowerment: The number of State policies developed during the project period reflects the
increased responsiveness of the State to the voice of a very large and increasingly influential SHG
movement. In a particular case, a ZS leader has been nominated as Member of Legislative Council by the
Government of Andhra Pradesh. A large number of poor women showed willingness to stand for in
different tiers of local government from district, mandal, Panchayat and ward level a large percent of
whom won (see under 9 below). According to CESS, 2.33% of participant members contested the
elections out of whom 1.3% won. While in the case of non-participants, it is 1.54% and 0.7%,
respectively. The CESS study also points out an increase in participation of women in gram sabhas and
community level meetings conducted by Panchayat bodies.
2) Increased access to credit and reduced indebtedness
Rating: Highly satisfactory
Financial Inclusion: Making poor the preferred clients of the formal financial system is core to the
financial inclusion strategy. The financial inclusion agenda pursued by the project embraced financial
advice, savings, cash transfers/Government payments, credit, insurance and pension services that were
provided to the poor on a significant scale (details provided in Annex 2). The project helped build a pro-
poor financial sector in the State through strategic partnership with commercial banks and insurance
companies.

Community managed financial systems attract mainstream financial sector to invest in poor households.
The SHGs of the poor and their federations together manage own funds of US$1.1 billion. The project
injected US$190.5 million for capitalization and strengthening the financial management capacity of the
CBOs, as well as providing leverage for external funds. Achieving the PDO indicator 3, over 929,000
SHGs cumulatively leveraged US$7.86 billion from commercial banks, building on successful SHG
Bank linkage Program in AP. With the efforts of the project nevertheless the rate of linkages and amount

                                                                       36
of bank capital channeled to SHGs and their members has increased many folds. The project
systematically invested in building institutional mechanisms like electronic book keeping, financial
literacy and credit counseling services, social audit committees to review utilization of bank loans,
community based recovery mechanisms, web-based MIS, etc. enhancing confidence of the commercial
banks to partner with CBOs. GOAP introduced a scheme – ‗Pavala Vaddi‘ reimbursing interest amount
paid over and above 3% per annum to those SHGs that were prompt in repaying their bank loans. The
scheme was largely successful in aligning the incentives of the banks, borrowing SHGs and the
promoting institutions (like SERP, NGOs, etc.). The non-performing SHG loans stood at rose to 2.0
percent of the total loan outstanding of US$2.7 billion crore by March 2011, the lowest percentage in the
country.
Community financial institutions partner with commercial banks to smoothen access to financial services.
Customer relationship managers - ‗Bank Mitra‘ or ‗help desks‘ for women SHGs and poor clients were
created by CBOs in all bank branches resulting in bringing down the transaction time for illiterate clients
from over three hours to just 15 minutes. Using CBOs at the village level as banking agents/business
correspondents, the commercial banks have steadily increased their rural footprint from 4,000 villages to
nearly 21,300 villages in the State by September 2011 enrolling nearly 12.0 million new clients
leveraging IT based financial technologies including smart cards, mobile banking and kiosk banking
platforms. The cumulative Government-to-person (G2P) payments under MGNREGS and other social
pension schemes through this branchless banking channel amount to US$ 458 million.
Flexible nature of CIF catalyzes product innovations and service innovations in CBOs. The CBOs used
CIF as a ‗resource in perpetuity‘ rather than one-time grant based activity to create private assets. Over a
period of time, the capital subsidies under SGSY was also routed through CBOs like CID 14. CIF more in
the nature of risk capital allowed CBOs to innovate, fail, iterate and standardize products and services
before taking to scale. In that sense, the CIF largely influenced the manner in which community savings,
bank loans and other public resources generate development impacts (see Annex 2 for detail). Some of
the financial innovations that were implemented in large scale include:
      i.   Savings products – Compulsory Savings, Health Savings, Education Savings, etc.
     ii.   Loan products - Health Risk Fund for meeting emergency health expenses and hospitalization,
           Loans for swapping high cost debts, land lease, home renewal, expansion and construction,
           advances against anticipated MGNREGS payments
 iii.      Bundled loan products to individuals - Food security credit, Nutrition credit, credit with
           livelihood services (community managed sustainable agriculture, livestock, etc.)
     iv.   Investment support for community enterprises – Food security enterprise, commodity
           procurement enterprise, milk collection and bulk milk cooling enterprises, etc.
     v.    Total Financial Inclusion (TFI) in partnership with commercial banks – a combo product offered
           to SHGs for supporting their members for swapping of high cost debts, investment in livelihood
           activities and housing renewal/construction
     vi.   Bulk loans to VOs and Mandal Samakhyas in partnership with commercial banks – for on-
           lending to SHGs, running food security enterprises or community procurement activities.



14
     This has now also been adopted nationwide under NRLM, which has transformed SGSY.

                                                      37
Increased access to finance resulted in reduced influence of money lenders. CIF investments made by the
project kick started SHG-Bank Linkage in many areas. Enhanced access to finance and using CIF on
multiple interventions like food security, health risk fund, supply of agri-inputs, and collective marketing
support of Agriculture Produce/NTFP unlocked the exploitative relationships with local money lenders.
With support of commercial banks for Total Financial Inclusion (TFI) a debt restructuring package to
poor households. The Impact Assessment by CESS showed that the participant households benefited
with increased loan access, by around US$204 (a threefold increase in case of the POP), with a large and
increasing proportion of this from formal sources (including SHGs). The increased access also allowed
households to swap high cost debts lowering the interest repayment obligations by 4-10 times, which are
often a major burden (debt-trap) to poor rural households.
Insurance services: There have been considerable innovations at scale for a range of finance related
mechanisms for social risk management. About 9.6 million SHG members enrolled for life and
disability insurance program. Together with the achievements of pensions below, this is close to
over the PDO indicator 4 targets set in the second financing15. The program envisages community
managed policy origination and claim settlement mechanisms in strategic partnership with insurance
companies. The system ensured timely delivery of insurance policy, and more importantly rapid release
of interim relief within 2 days which is often critical, as otherwise people will take out high cost loans
instead for meeting funeral expenses, trapping them in further debts. The project also initiated loan
protection scheme for covering against death of dairy animals financed by the SHGs.
Pensions: SERP and the CBOs are leveraged by GOAP for disbursing social security pensions to old,
disabled and destitute families. About 700,000 pensions are disbursed in the State each month. While the
CBOs are engaged as banking correspondents under the smart card banking project, the GOAP
formulated a separate co-contributory pension scheme – ‗Abhaya Hastham‘ for SHG women backed by
legislation in Andhra Pradesh Self Help. Groups (SHG) Women Co-contributory Pension Act, 2009.
About 5 million SHG women have joined a co-contributory pension scheme by September 2011
(PDO Target 4, see footnote under insurance above) and 420,000 old women are accessing their
pensions.
4) Percentage increase in access to and/or ownership of land
Rating: Satisfactory
The project facilitated purchase of cultivable land (endowed with water source) for landless poor under
the CIF component. Over 5000 poor mainly SC/ST members got about an acre each. A study on the
scheme showed that incomes increased by 30-75% as result of cropping income. However the project
identified an opportunity to unlock large tracts of land of the poor for their productive use, which was
otherwise tied up with numerous legal issues relating to ownership and title deeds, possession, possession
of land, restoration of assigned lands alienated or under illegal occupation, etc. District Land Rights and
Legal Assistance Centers were set up in all districts which provided services like Legal assistance, survey
assistance, access to records and expert advice under a single window. With this over 430,000 disputes
have been resolved, improving accessibility of SHG members to very large area of 875,000 acres,
achieving the PDO indicator target 5 set under the 2nd AF. The impact assessment by CESS 2010
indicates that the frequency of beneficiary households possessing land has increased about 3% compared
to non-participant households.

15
  The indicator targets for insurance and pensions had to be slightly scaled back in the later stages of the project due
to government setting caps on the schemes.

                                                          38
The project launched a major initiative of building inventory of lands belonging to SC/ST households so
they can be taken up for development in convergence with MGNREGS. 4 million lakh acres belonging to
1.7 million SC/ST households was identified, out of which 1.9 million acres was suffering from infirmity
in title or possession related land issues. From the land inventory, 3.0 million acres have been identified
for land development with an estimated investment of US$1.8 billion. Land development works have
since been completed on 53,959 acres with an expenditure of US$134.9 million. In addition, GOAP is
planning irrigation facilities for 1.0 million acres under its Indira Jala Prabha program.
5) Household income of the poor increased and/or sources of income diversified
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
Livelihoods and well being: With the improved incomes, financial resources and services to SHG
members there is considerable evidence for elements of improved household well being. The livelihood
sources for households have diversified owing to increased access to financial services and increased
asset ownership (land, livestock and other non farm enterprises). The poor were able to upgrade their
assets, acquire new assets and diversify their livelihood sources. With the reduced dependency on money
lenders for credit, increased surplus from economic activities and assets and reduced consumption
expenditure, livelihoods of the poor have improved.
Assets: The value of assets per household for project participants showed five-fold increase. The value of
assets of participant households increased from US$837 in 2004 to about US$3,983 in 2009. There was a
significant increase in the ownership of both immovable and movable assets. A large majority of this
investment has been made on purchasing and leasing dry and wet land, constructing houses, purchase of
milch animals and purchasing gold jewelry. Many households are participating in land lease market. The
extent of irrigated land owned by the poor has also increased. The overall value of assets increased across
the target group, especially for SC members where it increased by 5 times. Productive agricultural assets
formed a major portion of increased asset value.

Incomes and consumptions: The income per household for project participant increased by more than
two-fold. The incomes of participants household grew from US$ 488 per annum to US$1,132 per annum.
CESS Study 2010 show increased income for all groups. While no target was set for PDO indicator 6,
the indicator can be considered achieved as for the poor and POP groups the increase was greater
among participants (124%) than non participants (111%), by nearly 13%. This was mostly
contributed by the poor and SC households. Similarly, the dependence on wage employment declined by
about 5% for both POP and poor participant members, with corresponding increase in self-employment
activities, and share in incomes.


                                                             39
Consumption expenditure per household for project participant households grew by 80% with qualitative
changes in consumption basket. The Impact Assessment by CESS notes there has been a substantial
improvement in the total household expenditure per annum. The consumption expenditure of participant
households increased from US$543 at baseline to US$979 by end term. The increase was more profound
among POP members where the increase was US$143 more than non-participant POP. Similarly there
was increase in proportion of health expenditure by 7.0%, perhaps due to improvement in access to
entitlements and services. There was a 6% point improvement in health among the children due to RPRP
and this was highly noticeable among the children of the poor over the POP households. During the same
period, education expenditure in project participant households increased by 33%. This also correlates
with improvement in net enrollment rate of children in schools in the age groups of 6-11 years and 11-16
years.

Improved food security: Over 3.37 million households across the State access food security initiatives
which include collective purchase of rice and other food commodities, access to public distribution
system and food credit facilities. This not only made food affordable but also resulted in savings of
US$48 per household due to bulk discount and lower transaction costs. CESS reports that the food
expenditures of participant households, between the baseline and the end term, actually decreased by
8.3% accompanied improved frequency in consumption of milk, chicken and eggs. Increased intake of
pulses, sugar and oil was also observed. Food assurance has reduced the proportion of indebted
households from 21% to 13% and increased the daily wage rate by 30% due to the enhanced bargaining
power of the poor farmers.
Community managed health and nutrition initiatives: These initiatives are implemented in 297 mandals
of the State. About 4200 VOs manage Nutrition and Day Care Centers (NDCCs) serving over 283,000
families, over 40% of them POP. NDCCs provide health education, balanced meal, regular health check-
up and ante-natal care (ANC), post-natal care (PNC) services to pregnant women, lactating mothers and
infants. The project promoted health savings through 47,752 SHGs to meet health emergency and out-of-
pocket expense for health related issues. Further these have had significant impacts on safe deliveries,
baby birth weights, and immunization, but most significant and a drastic reduction in maternal (MMR)
and infant mortality rates (IMR) among 13,300 deliveries. An assessment of early outcomes of health and
nutrition initiatives in IKP by SOCHURSUD showed significant impact on MDG indicators. Weight
gained during pregnancy for women enrolled at NDCC was 9.01 kg as against only 7.22 kg for non-

                                                     40
interventions group. NDCCs had newborns with birth weight averaging 2.912 kg and higher impacts were
observed in health-seeking behavior and in neonatal care practices like colostrum feeding, immediate
wrapping of newborn, exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months and full immunization as per
schedule. All 297 mandals have achieved 100% immunization of children (below one year) and ANC
check-ups.
The project also supported the diversification and strengthening of livelihoods systems in terms of
sustainable agriculture, dairy, community marketing and youth employment schemes, which piloted and
scaled up. The targets for these set under the 2nd AF were largely met or exceeded.
Community managed sustainable agriculture (CMSA): The project has facilitated ‗ecological approach‘
to agriculture by over 1.1 million small and marginal farmers cultivating in 2 million acres (780,000
hectares) under CMSA combining scientifically proven crop technology, local wisdom, and, farmers‘
innovations. The strategy of CMSA works upon reducing the cost of cultivation of field crops even while
pursuing crop intensification like System of Rice Intensification (SRI), multi-cropping (36 X 36) models
covering fruit crops, tubers, vegetables, pulses, etc. for food and nutritional security of landless and tenant
farmers. Investments from MGNREGS are being leveraged for land development and improving land soil
and moisture conservations works for increasing the cropping intensity of rain fed areas. As a result of
decreased costs, a cotton farmer is able to save US$250 per hectare, which is 56% of the State average, in
cost of cultivation with modest improvement in yields. The savings and net additional incomes for small
farmers would in the order of US$155 to US$360 per hectare.
Commodity marketing: Over 2000 VOs provide commodity marketing support to more than 312,000
farmers in 84 items of agriculture produce (AP)/non-timber forest produce (NTFP) since the beginning of
the initiative. The volume of commodity handled during 2011 reached 1.6 million tones of AP/NTFP
commodities with value of US$344 million. The scale of this operation has system wide impact even as
close to 80% of the paddy bought by Andhra Pradesh Civil Supplies Corporation (APCSC) is procured
through CBOs, which is 16% of the marketable surplus in the State. The small farmers benefit in terms of
higher unit prices, elimination of middle men and rent seeking practices, lower transaction costs. As a
result of this intervention in maize a small farmer was able to benefit roughly US$ 3 per quintal for maize
or an increase in farm income of about US$ 55 per annum.
Dairy and livestock: The project supported large scale expansion of dairy activities through CBOs. The
CBOs are procuring nearly 258,000 liters per day of milk from 152,000 dairy farmers during peak season.
About 210 Bulk Milk Cooling Units (BMCUs) have been set-up to support village milk procurement
centers managed by 4,225 VOs. 159 fodder nurseries and 32 feed mixing plants have been established.
Total dairy incomes increased from US$7.4 million in 2007 to US$23.9 million in 2011, which is about
$150 per producer per year.
Jobs schemes: The project facilitated setting up Employment Generation and Marketing Mission
(EGMM) in 2005 with exclusive focus on placement based skill development programs. About 400,000
rural poor youth have been trained through 340 training centers/franchises. 300,000 of them placed in
formal sector jobs with about 3,500 companies. These youth typically earn between $95 and $150 per
month from their new jobs. They send remittances in order of US$450 – 500 per annum giving major
boost to their family income. Surveys have shown these incomes are used for paying off high costs debts,
savings, housing and other assets. EGMM has emerged the single largest jobs mission for rural poor in
India.



                                                      41
The project through developing federations, with staffing by community members at different levels, and
cadres of paid community professionals including CRPs has also contributed direct employment to
174,00 persons with more regular incomes. Also under the land development scheme with MGNREGS
IKP facilitated the poorest wage seekers to access the 100 days of wage employment, and also get their
lands developed at the same time. 43,800 households were assisted this way, and this scheme is now
being expanded. This activity has the potential for important convergence of schemes of critical
important to the rural poor: wage incomes, land tenure improvement and agricultural productivity
enhancements.

6) Household perception of the quality of and access to basic services--education, health, integrated
child development services (ICDS) – improved
Rating: Satisfactory
The CBOs have made significant investment in improving quality of access of livelihoods and basic
services. They developed a co-producing model with commercial banks, insurance company, government
departments and private hospitals in a variety of ways. These include:
   i.   Outsourcing services: Targeting and selection beneficiaries and delivering services as community
        intermediaries – Pensions, ration cards, job cards, MGNREGS works, entitlements etc.
  ii.   Help desks and information services: Provision of information, counseling, technical advisory,
        transaction processing support – Banks (Bank Mitra), Insurance Companies (Bima Mitra),
        Hospitals (Case managers), Para vet (Pala Mitra), Agriculture and livestock extension worker,
        para-botanists, etc. Community Enterprises: Managing last mile delivery of public services as
        social business as franchisees for government, public, private and cooperative sectors –ZSs as
        corporate agents of insurance companies, VOs as banking correspondents/agents, VOs managing
        PDS Shops, procurement centers, etc.
 iii.   Convergence services: CBOs partner with government and public agencies to enhance the reach
        of their programs and services – Medical and Health Department, Agriculture/
        Horticulture/Animal Husbandry/Forest Departments, Primary Education and Higher Education
        Department, Women and Child Welfare, Police, Judiciary, etc.
 iv.    Social audit of public services: CBOs participate in social audit mechanism and enforce social
        accountability of Government departments and public agencies using formal or moral pressure –
        Panchayats, PDS Shops, Schools, ICDS centers, Hospitals, etc.
Impact assessment by CESS 2010 clearly showed that participation in the programme has led to
substantial increase in the percentage of beneficiaries accessing PDS and in procuring additional
quantities of cereals, sugar, edible oil and pulses from PDS. The project participants accessed an
increase of 3.28 kg of PDS cereals, about double accessed by non-participants. On the health front
and across project participants in the sample of CESS 2010 IA, the number of unsafe deliveries has
declined by 9% among participants from around 30% (PDO indicator 8, with no target set). There
was also increase in access to private hospitals for pre-natal care by the poor (8%), SCs increased their
use of government hospitals. Improved access to housing by 5%, and the government housing program
by 8%, was reported especially among poorer categories.

7) Increase in percentage of children (by gender) enrolled to schools
Rating: Satisfactory



                                                   42
The project supported targeted interventions, several managed through the CBOs, directly benefiting
poorer children especially girls in communities where drop out school is common (Community managed
education services thematic paper). 90-100% of students in these initiatives were POP or ST.
APSWREIS Residential Schools: 61 out of planned 64 schools were constructed with over 115,000 girl
children enrolled – exceeding the PAD PDO target 11 of 25,000 many times over – with pass
percentages consistently 10-15% higher than government schools.
Early Childhood Centres: 21,700 mainly tribal children, could enroll in these, with better performance
and no dropouts in primary school afterwards.
The project also supported students from marginal groups to join higher level education, and quality
improvement in schools and through parental subcommittees.

8) Improved access to disability certification and increased use of community-based rehabilitation
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The project had specific initiatives to support the inclusion of people with disabilities. There has been
considerable success on this front: 938,000 assessments of disability have been carried and tracked in
specialized software. Out of these, 306,211 persons with disabilities (PWD) have been mobilized into
32,780 SHGs achieving PDO target 10 under 2nd AF, and far exceeding PAD target, also with 250
dedicated MS and 3 ZS for PWDs and dedicated PWD resource persons from the community. The
project has been able to leverage over US$ 3 million from Government departments and NGOs for free
surgical corrections, and distributed aids and appliances to over 18,000PWD.
Further the project facilitated improved access to credit with bank linkages of Rs 157 crore to 11990
groups. For 43% PWDs members this was the only loans they had been able to access. These loans they
have used for economic activities, health expense, and education, in that order. Increased awareness of
possible services had meant also that PWDs under the project had been able to avail of pension (82%) and
other entitlements, such as insurance. PWDs had also been linked to livelihoods activities, especially
petty businesses, and specialized wage opportunities under MMGNREGS.
9) Local governments more inclusive and responsive to the needs of the poor in pilot mandals (sub-
district level of government)
Rating: Satisfactory
The poor did gain significant political capital. The increased participation of poor in Gram Sabhas,
election of large number of Women into leadership positions and introduction of rights based schemes
like MGNREGS brought inclusivity and pro-poor agenda in Panchayats. Importantly the development of
a very large number of social and economic organizations of the poor ensured that they exerted demand
side accountability from local governments and line departments leading to improved last mile service
delivery.
Federations have worked closely with Panchayats to ensure access to various entitlements like the social
security pensions; MGNREGS wage opportunities, and food entitlements. Also universal and regular
social audits have been one of the crucial reasons for success of MGNREGS implementation in the state.
The entire social audit process has drawn extensive lessons from the social mobilization strategy of the
project and a large proportion of the social audit resource persons are the members of SHG federations.
Thus the project has clearly made a significant contribution to improving the performance of Panchayats
in provision of basic public services.

Annex 2 D. Impacts of the Project on Pro-Poor Policies in AP
Institution Building

   Implementation of anti-poverty schemes through CBOs

The Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) has realized the strength of Community Based
Organizations (CBOs) of the poor and has decided to deliver all its anti-poverty schemes such as housing,
marketing services, social security pensions, scholarships, public distribution system, health, etc. through
them. Two Government Orders (GO) have also been issued with respect to this - GO Ms. No. 83
(guidelines on release of training funds (10%) of SGSY for capacity building of CBOs) and GO Ms. No.
199 (mentions the role of CBOs in creation of awareness among communities on MGNREGA, supporting
wage-seekers in applying for work, provision of worksite facilities, etc.). The GoAP has also decided to
elect one woman SHG member as Member of Legislative Council for representing issues regarding SHGs
in the Assembly. Considering the request of CBOs, the GoAP has released an amount of Rs. 300 crores
for the construction of Sthree Shakti buildings to Mandal Samakhyas.

CIF and Financial Inclusion

   Micro Credit Plan based SHG-Bank Linkage by State Level Bankers‘ Committee

As per GO. Ms. No. 81, the Government has issued guidelines on releasing 70% of SGSY funds to MSs
as a grant to operate on the lines of CIF. According to GoAP‘s GO Ms. No. 152 on Pavalavaddi, SHG
Bank-linkage programme will reimburse interest over and above 3% per annum paid by SHGs and
disburse an amount of Rs. 870 crores to the SHG women in this financial year. The MS of SHGs in
association with the GoAP have promoted ‗STHREE NIDHI‘ Credit Cooperative Federation Ltd. to
address the issues of inadequate finance and to ensure timely availability of credit to the SHG women.
Under the Indiramma Housing program, SHGs were given loan to fund members‘ need in bridging the
gap between actual cost and government support. GoAP has also brought an MFI ordinance for
addressing the problems of SHG members.

Promoting Community Managed Sustainable Agriculture

   Convergence with MGNREGS for development of lands belongs to Poorest of the poor: As per
    GO Ms. No. 392, an effort is being made to forge a convergence with MGNREGS for development of
    lands belonging to the poorest of the poor. About 25,000 acres of land belonging to the poorest of the
    poor has been treated with soil and moisture conservation works and another 25,000 acres were
    adopted for improved cropping pattern. The average net incremental income for these farmers ranges
    between Rs. 5,000 to 10,000 per acre.

   Mainstreaming CMSA activities through Agriculture Technology Management Agency: GO Ms
    No.121 aims at mainstreaming community managed sustainable agriculture activities through
    convergence (CMSA) with Agriculture Technology Management Agency. As a result of this, CMSA
    farmers will be able to access funds for infrastructure development.

   Productivity enhancement and entrepreneur promotion in watershed: GO Ms. No. 110 provides
    for productivity enhancement and entrepreneur promotion in watershed through convergence with

                                                    46
    Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP). Under this, CMSA methods are promoted in
    cultivable areas under watersheds for productivity enhancement and support is provided for
    entrepreneur promotion.

   Mahila Kisan Saskthikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) is a centrally sponsored program which aims to
    upgrade skills of women farmers in sustainable agriculture and increase their net incomes.

Dairy

   Implementation of State Milk Mission through SHGs: The ambitious programme with an outlay of
    US$1.1 billion aims at doubling the milk production in the next 4 years. Government has decided to
    implement the major activity of induction of nearly 400,000 high yielding milch animals through
    SHG women.

   Godavari Milk Grid Project, an RKVY funded intensive dairy project, is entrusted to Mandal
    Samakhyas in West Godavari.

   Implementation of Kamadhenu scheme in Chittoor aims at induction of 10,000 high yielding
    animals to SHG woman through bank linkage and NABARD schemes.

   Inclusion of fodder development and conservation works under MGNREGS (more than 100,000
    works have been identified).

Commodity Marketing

   Convergence of Community Forest Management and Velugu; (GO Ms. 78 E F S&T dated
    17.10.2003) – Village Organizations partnered with GCC to procure NTFPs in Tribal Areas

   NTFP Trading Liberalized: Rc No 899/2004/M2 dated 2.7.2004 – Girijan Cooperative Corporation
    Limited permits NTFPs procured by VOs to sell to private traders on payment of charges

    a key role in preparation of the report of KRR Land Committee. The Government has accepted 90
    recommendations out of the total 104 recommendations of the Committee.

   Loan Eligibility Cards to tenant farmers: GoAP brought in an Ordinance in June, 2011 which is
    the first of its kind in the entire country. Loan Eligibility Cards have been issued to tenant farmers to
    enable them to get crop loans, crop insurance, input subsidies, crop damages compensation, etc.

   SHG Land Lease Bill: As per the land inventory survey, about 42% of SC/ST households are
    landless poor and land leasing activity is on the increase in the State. The SHG Land Lease Bill has
    been passed in the State Legislative Assembly and the bill has been reserved for the President‘s
    consent. Once the Act comes into force, SHGs can lease in lands for the benefit of their members for
    a period of five years. This will make more land available to the SHG women.

   Land Purchase Scheme: A new Land Purchase scheme is being designed exclusively for PoP
    households. One lakh acres of good quality cultivable land would be made available to SC/ST
    families of the state under this scheme.

   MoRD Committee on State Agrarian Relations and Unfinished Task of Land Reforms in its
    report of 2008-09 recommended adoption of IKP model by other States with such modifications as
    may be deemed proper to suit the local environment.

   Setting up of Paralegal Assistance Centres in LWE affected districts: The GoI has announced an
    Rs.90 crore project for setting up Paralegal Assistance Centers in eight Left Wing Extremists (LWE)
    affected districts. The GOI is also adopting IKP Paralegal model in all LWE affected districts in the
    country.

Employment Generation Mission

   GoAP‘s flagship program ―Rajiv Yuva Kiranalu‖ on the lines of EGMM: Under GO Ms. No.
    286 and 253, the GoAP has launched the ―Rajiv Yuva Kiranalu‖ program on the lines of EGMM with
    the objective of providing employment to 15 lakh youth in three years, while maintaining a central
    unemployed youth database and MIS for tracking and implementing biometric attendance in all
    training centers.

   NRLM adopts EGMM‘s skill development model: National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)
    has adopted EGMM‘s model for its skill development project implementation.

                                                     48
   EGMM as resource agency for MoRD: EGMM is being considered as a resource agency to help
    MoRD in formulating state specific implementation strategies.

   EGMM‘s approach replicated across States: Based on the experience of Andhra Pradesh, the
    EGMM approach has been replicated in Indian states such as Bihar, Orissa and Rajasthan; and similar
    approaches are being adopted in other states such as Tamil Nadu.

Education

   Convergence of Anganwadi centers with ECE and NDCC centers: GO 55 deals with this issue.
    During the execution of the ECE project, problems arose from the Anganwadi workers at the village
    level. ECE centers were seen as competitors to the Anganwadi centers. With the effort of SERP and
    Mandala Mahila Samakyas, convergence meetings were conducted at Mandal, district and state level
    to resolve this issue. As a result, the Department of Women and Child Welfare Development issued
    this government order for convergence of Anganwadi centers with ECE and NDCC centers for
    overall better functioning.

   Corporate education taken over by Social Welfare Department: With the success of the corporate
    education concept in tribal areas, there is a demand from the community to extend this programme to
    other areas as well. Hence, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has taken a decision to implement the
    project all over the state and has handed over the implementation of the project to the social welfare
    department which in turn distributed the responsibility to various line departments like BC Welfare,
    SC Welfare etc.

   Ayah salary from Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme: In each ECE
    centre, 20 children had to be managed by one teacher which was getting tedious. Hence, Ayahs were
    allotted to the centers to support the teacher/instructor in managing the children. The Commissioner
    of Rural Development, Andhra Pradesh is providing salaries for the Ayahs in these centers.

   Integration of ECE teachers with Sarva Siksha Abhiyan at primary level: Under this,
    experienced ECE teachers are promoted to teach Class 1, 2 and 3 in the primary school. As a result
    of collaboration with the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, training was provided by them to the ECE instructors
    to teach primary level students in Govt schools.

Pensions

   Co-Contributory Pension scheme: All old age and other pensions are being distributed through
    CBOs. One of the major policy interventions was the introduction of the Co-Contributory Pension
    scheme. The Government of Andhra Pradesh has passed a bill in the State Legislature to provide
    Old-age Pensions.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The project supported and strengthened the institutions at all levels for efficient delivery of
enhanced sustainable livelihood income opportunities with improved access to financial and public
services for 10.1 M rural poor HHs. Total project cost is US$472.43 million, including IDA support of
US$315 M. Project benefits are quantified for the primarily for project interventions accounting for about
72% of the project costs, shared between strengthening institutional, social and human capital (32%) and
community investment fund (40%).

2.       Based on the investments made by the project and estimates of household incomes, certain
efficiency ratios have been presented below:

    Particulars                         Amount                       Efficiency Rates

    Entitlements                 US$1.6 billion            Per HH Entitlement: US$145
    Source: Internal MIS

3.      Due to the demand driven and market-led nature of the rural livelihood investment strategies,
assumptions and approach for assessing the multiple impacts like income, employment and efficiency, are
drawn from multiple sources including internal MIS, MTR, impact evaluations, thematic evaluations, etc.

4.       Project Benefits: Major quantifiable benefits for the EFA come from (i) productive livelihood
investments by poor HHs, (ii) improved access to multiple sources of credit for expanding/diversifying
livelihood investments, (iii) improved integration with entitlements, markets and institutions for scaling
up livelihood activities, and (v) enhanced skills linked with gainful employment opportunities for 306,000
million rural youth. In addition, strong community led 1.1 million SHG institutions, backed with a
network of 38,646 village organizations, 1,198 Mandal level federations, and implementing institutions at
various levels will sustain the delivery of livelihood services to the project beneficiaries beyond project
period with significant policy level impacts. Indirect economic (or multiplier as well as externalities)
benefits are likely to be substantial and hence, quantifying the direct project benefits only understates the
full economic impact of the project.

5.       Interventions, Investments and Leverage effects: The project invested US$155.7 million in
creating institutional platforms of the poor in the form of SHGs and their federation and nearly 90% of the
targeted poor HHs in the State has been mobilized into SHGs. Another US$190.48 was invested by the
project to capitalize these institutions so they can help their members achieve the goals of social
inclusion, financial inclusion, economic inclusion and delivery of public services and entitlements. This
meant investing of US$14.39 per household for building institutional capital and US$49.12 per household
to trigger livelihood investments over an eight year period.




                                                     50
6.      Perhaps, the most important interventions by the project was to facilitate SHG-Bank Linkage
which enabled poor to leverage US$7.86 billion loans from commercial banks over the entire project life.
This profound effort allowed the poor to avail loans worth nearly US$806.27 per household for
consumption smoothing, investments in productive assets, replacement and expansion of productive
assets. The quantifiable benefits will come from the range of livelihood investment initiatives. The
interventions of the project seeking to provide backward and forward linkages to livelihood activities also
influenced the investment choices particularly in agriculture, dairy, etc. Some of these include:

7.       Livelihoods portfolio: Without comprehensive institutional and capacity development at all
levels, SHG operations will be sub-optimal, constrained by inadequate credit and weak institutional
linkages for accessing credit, market and technology and over and above this. About 868 MSs are
functioning on a sustainable basis. An external study by SOCHURSOD on these CBOs showed that
incomes of VOs were twice over their operating costs. With effective institutional and capacity building,
all SHGs (100%) will be sustained in their operations and their services will get expanded and diversified
for longer project life (20 years) with

livestock has been a predominant activity
followed by agriculture. However, the benefits from these traditional activities stretched by nearly US$50
per household when they participate in CMSA and Dairy interventions. In other word, the institutional
platforms of the poor get linked with two or more interventions including credit, markets, producer
associations and technology support.

9.      Economic Analysis: The NRLP‘s cost-benefit analysis is conducted for major livelihood sub-
projects (livestock, agriculture, trade and services) and then aggregated for the project as a whole using
the investment as the weights. Incremental benefits for the livelihood sub-projects are estimated based on
field study, covering 153 sample HHs from project villages in Andhra Pradesh; and 250 sample
beneficiaries from individual/group/ federation based livelihoods from 40 project villages in the State.
The database was supplemented with other secondary published data/documents of GOI, NABARD, RBI,
and other state government project documents.

10.     To assess the IRR of sub-projects, a study was conducted by SERP across 6 project districts
covering 475 sub-projects. The selection of different categories of sub-projects was in proportion to the


                                                     52

study brought out that the IRR was much larger than what was envisaged in PAD for almost all activities.

11.      Through the CBOs the project has also created an efficient service delivery system for a range of
government schemes, of which those on insurance, pensions, public food distribution system, are
effective at State level significance. Not only are these low cost delivery, recognized by government
agencies as such, but they have also improved targeting and reduced leakage, with greater quality of
services, further increasing efficiency and effectiveness. These services, together with the State wide
outreach of livelihoods activities, are likely to have poverty reduction results with potential of further
creating important, but hard to quantify, fiscal effects.

12.      Project benefits from following sources are quantified: (i) livelihood investment benefits from
US$140 million, benefiting 33,867 SHGs, (ii) livelihood benefits enhanced through increased access to
US$7.86 billion through bank linkages benefiting 0.9 million SHGs, and (iii) livelihood benefits
diversified with community led marketing, production and employment generation activities. Finally, for
project as a whole, the analysis was done by using all project costs. Total project cost is US$472 million
at current prices. Livelihood incomes are further diversified through dairy, community based sustainable
agriculture, marketing and employment generation activities. All costs and benefits are converted to
constant 2011 prices. The quantification of benefits and underlying assumptions for the major sources is
drawn from the table discussed in para 6 above. Other assumptions underlying the EFA are; (i) the
benefits to start with one year lag, (ii) benefits to start and reach full level in 3 to 4 years time, and (iii) at
least 70% of the income generating livelihood activities started by SHGs with multiple sources of credit
will be sustained due to the institutional and capacity development achieved by the project. With the
provision of only US$190 million for the livelihood investments, the FRR is 18.1%. Institutional linkages
with Banks providing access to US$7.86 billion for 0.9 million SHGs improved the FRR significantly to
26.3%. Diversifying the income activities through community managed sustainable agriculture,
livestock, community led marketing and employment generation activities further enhanced the FRR to
31.2%.

13.      Finally, inclusion of all project costs resulted in 30.1% FRR for the project as a whole. Net
present value increased from Rs 3 billion (only project led CIF) to Rs 82 billion (with institutional
linkages for additional credit) and further to a maximum of Rs 112 billion (with diversified income
generation activities). Livestock and sustainable agriculture are two pre-dominating activities and is an
option of 73% of the beneficiaries. ERR is not expected to be much different from FRR, since
international traded inputs and outputs are only marginal. What is therefore important is the financial
attractiveness of the community led project interventions. This is confirmed by the annual income levels
of US$488 per annum to US$1,132 per annum for all groups according to Impact Evaluation Study by
CESS 2010, which means sustainability of project interventions are most likely. And these income levels
will only rise with the recycling of livelihood funds to further intensify and/or diversify the investment
activities which are not captured in this analysis and to that extent the estimated rate of return is likely to
be conservative.

14.      Poverty alleviation impacts: Average earnings for the employed youth range from US$56 to 122
per month. GOI estimated weighted poverty line monthly per capita income cut-off level, adjusted for
2010 prices, is US$13 for rural areas. Based on this, all families with employed youth are above poverty
line, by the end of the project. Weighted average incremental benefit from livelihood investment activity
for the project beneficiaries is estimated as US$ 160. Incremental benefits due to the project will be
sufficient to lift at least one member of the project benefited family to go above poverty line. More
importantly, poverty alleviation impact in the beneficiary families is both cost effective as well as
permanently sustainable. It was indicated elsewhere in the report that the percentage of households
below the poverty line declined from 29.4 percent to 20.7 percent between Baseline (2004) and End Term
(2009) - a decline of about 2.1 percentage points per annum. However, the estimates indicate that most of
this decline was due to the rapid reduction of poverty among the participants which reduced from 29.8
percent to 17.5 percents in comparison the poverty ratio for non participants declined to just 27.2 percent.

         Annex 5. Impact Assessment of Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project

                                          Executive Summary

ICRR Author‘s note: Due to the saturation coverage of the project, finding strict control groups was
almost impossible. Therefore the assessment compared project participants (PP), essentially households
where the woman has joined an SHG, with non-participant (NP) households, where the women have not
joined an SHG. There may be some biases therefore in comparing the two in terms of end of project
benefits, either because non-participants may have self-selected or have been excluded from joining
SHGs due to their socio-economic conditions, or benefited from a project externality, such as social
support from the SHGs to the wider village community. Comparing like for like groups among PoP or
poor to some degree minimises this, although this is not perfect either. Appendix 1 has a table comparing
PP and NP at baseline. It is assumed that the sample survey households have been sampled so that they
do not represent a group which would have benefited to a greater degree than the overall population by
one of the project‘s pilot such as for CMSA, dairy or marketing.
Introduction - Main Characteristics of APRPRP and Methodology for Impact Assessment
   APRPRP has been implemented in 16 districts of the State since September 2003.
   The project promoted people‘s institutions, which facilitate the poor in playing a decisive role in
    shaping their destinies.
   There are several issues to be tackled before addressing the pressing economic problems and proper
    sequencing is important to achieve the maximum impact from interventions.
   Thus there are all several challenges the APRPRP has to address for reducing different dimensions of
    poverty.
   The successful institution-building model of APDPIP is being emulated in the APRPRP.
   APRPRP aims at utilizing the existing huge SHG base, rather than starting completely anew, and
    building on it in a number of ways.
   The project aims at enhancing assets, capabilities and the ability of the poor to deal with shocks and
    risks.
   It recognizes that the livelihood strategies and income levels of the poor are inadequate not only due
    to lack of financial capital but also due to low/lack of physical and human capabilities.
   It assumes that the empowerment of poor women should be in place prior to the access to financial
    capital for the better utilization of existing resources and expanding the resource base.
   There are challenges relating to infrastructure and other related policies which are external to the
    project.
   The study focuses on the contribution of project activities in key areas – namely, well-being of the
    households in terms of income poverty and non-income poverty; sustainability of improvements in
    well-being captured through access to credit and borrowing capacity; asset base, livelihoods and
    organization of poor women; and, on the enhancement of performance of RPRP.

Methodology
   As the programme has been implemented in all the areas, the approach of participants and non-
    participants has been adopted to assess the impact of the programme.
   Non-participants are those who have not participated at all in the programme while participants are
    those who have participated during the mid-term appraisal and continued even in the end-term as well
    as those who have participated during the end-term period.
   As this is a panel study, all the 4800 BLS sample households were revisited and around 98% of the
    BLS sample households surveyed could be contacted.
   Important socio-economic indicators of the sample households show that the better-off among the
    PoP and poor have participated in the programme.
   The traditional Double Difference method to assess the impact of RPRP was found to be inadequate
    as it could not capture the positive externalities generated by the programme. Hence this method has
    been suitably modified to capture the externalities generated by the programme.
   The incomes derived are gross incomes net of paid out costs. Income, assets and credit of the
    households have been adjusted for prices.
   The participants of the programme are in the process of consolidating the benefits flowing from the
    programme. It may take some more years for them to reach the full potential of the benefits of the
    programme. Hence, the present benefits should be treated as the initial benefits obtained from the
    programme.
   The well-being derived and its sustainability are the two broad assessment parameters of the
    programme.
   Income poverty is measured in terms of level of monthly per capita consumption expenditure, quality
    of consumption-composition, frequency and vulnerability.
   Non-income poverty has been captured through the deficits in knowledge, health, women‘s
    empowerment and access to public services like education, health, housing and the public distribution
    system.
   The indications of the sustainability of improvements in well-being, if any, due to the programme
    have been located in the spaces relating to credit, assets, income and organizations of poor women
    (SHG-VO-MS-ZS networks).
   Drivers and Barriers; and HOT-SPOTS analysis has been conducted to explore the scope for
    improving the performance of the programme in future.
Impact Assessment Domains
Well-being of the households: Income Poverty Dimension
   There has been a substantial improvement in the total expenditure per annum and the expenditure
    towards food over BLS and the increase is higher for participant households.
   For instance, per household annual expenditure towards food for POP participants stood at Rs.
    20487/- (Rs. 13205/- for NP) – a clear increase of Rs. 7000/- over non-participants.


                                                   58
   Net impact of the programme on the total expenditure per household was Rs. 14378/- for all poor
    (POP + poor) participant households and Rs. 6384/- for non-participants (externality).
   Starting from the poorest to the richest deciles, more participant households have experienced growth
    in consumption expenditure than non-participants.
   Overall, the average growth rate of MPCE for all participant households between BLS and FUS-II
    was 5.41% per annum - substantially higher than for the non-participant households (3.5% per
    annum).
   Similarly, substantial improvement in the consumption of cereals, sugar, edible oil and pulses was
    noticed among the participant households - which are all indicative of consumption of quality food.
   The frequency of consumption of milk, chicken, and eggs has also increased as compared to non-
    participants and over BLS.
   There was a substantial decline in the expenditure on tobacco, alcohol/ intoxicants and health care,
    while the expenditure on clothing and footwear, education and social events has increased
    considerably which clearly show the impact of the project in improving the quality of life.
   The coping mechanisms adopted to circumvent food insecurity and shocks indicate that there were no
    interruptions in food consumption routines.
Poverty Ratio
   In the base year (BLS), the level of poverty among the participant and non-participant households
    was more or less similar – 29.2 among the participants and 29.8% among the non-participants.
   However, in the case of participants, the poverty ratio declined to 17.6% in FUS-II, while it declined
    marginally to 27.1% in case of non-participants.
   The decline due to the project worked out to 9 percentage points in 4 years.
   The analysis does indicate that IKP has contributed to a considerable reduction in rural poverty,
    especially among SCs and STs.
Well-being of the households: Non-Income Poverty Dimension
Women‘s Empowerment
   RPRP has contributed to the expansion of the space for women in household decision-making for the
    participants, more so among the POP.
   Due to their participation in RPRP, the participation of women in collective actions undertaken by the
    VOs and MSs has increased in regard to problems encountered like quality of drinking water;
    irrigation facilities; access to education; sanitation conditions; access to approach roads; and quality
    of internal roads etc. Such additional increase was comparatively higher for the POP followed by the
    poor.
   More STs could participate and more people could raise issues in gramasabha unlike other social
    groups.
   Women‘s participation has increased (due to participation in RPRP) in the collective actions
    undertaken against undesirable social practices like child labor; untouchability; domestic violence;


                                                    59
    gender discrimination; and disability. This has particularly resulted in the decline of child marriages
    and child labour.
Children‘s Health and Education
   There was a 6% point improvement in health among the children due to RPRP and this was highly
    noticeable among the children of the poor over the POP households.
   There was an improvement in net enrolment among children in the age groups of 6-11 and 11-16
    years.
Accessing Public Services
   Unsafe deliveries have declined significantly among the participants.
   Accessing public hospitals has increased for the poor, SCs and BCs due to RPRP.
   The programme has contributed to improved access to housing and related services to the poor.
   There is clear evidence that participation in the programme has led to: substantial increase in the
    percentage of beneficiaries accessing PDS; and in procuring additional quantities of cereals, sugar,
    edible oil and pulses from PDS.
Sustainability of Household Well-being
Indications from the Domain of Credit
There was a substantial improvement in the loans accessed by the participants from different sources as
well as share of formal loans in total loans and this was higher than for the non-participants.
   The net increase in the loans accessed from all sources was highest for the ST participants
    (Rs.10079/-) followed by POP participants (Rs. 9053/-) which was much higher than the benefit
    derived by the non-participants due to the externality of the project.
   The major portion of the net benefit in the loans accessed was from the formal financial institutions
    i.e. Rs. 8482/- for ST participants and Rs. 5157/- for POP participants.
   SC participants derived the maximum benefit through the project, recording an additional increase of
    16 percentage points in the share of formal loan in total loan followed by 13 percentage points by
    POP participants.
   In terms of the amount of credit, the increase was more than three-fold compared to BLS for POP
    participants (Rs.3161 to 10510 in ETA), and an increase of one and half times in the case of the poor
    (Rs. 7397 to 11297 in ETA).
   Though the percentage of participant households repaying the formal loan with ―no difficulty‖ has
    increased substantially, the results also clearly indicate that non-participants too benefited to a large
    extent due to the externality of the project.
   On an average, repayment of the loan amount, irrespective of the source of finance, seemed to be
    more regular in the case of participants during the two year period ending June 2008.
   It is interesting to note that repayment was more regular in the case of formal loans compared to
    informal loans.


                                                     60
   The borrowing capacity of all households, whether participants or not, has increased over BLS though
    the capacity of participants was much higher compared to non-participants.
   The capacity of participant households to borrow from formal institutions increased substantially due
    to the project. The net effect of the project shows that POP and poor participants could borrow
    additionally to the extent of more than Rs. 5000/-.
   The project initiatives also had a positive impact on the capacity to borrow from informal institutions.
Indications from the Domain of Asset Formation and Livelihoods
   Households with a relatively higher asset base were found to be participants from the poorest of the
    poor (POP) and poor households, while those with a relatively lower asset base were found to be
    participants from not-so-poor and non-poor households.
   It was seen from the BLS that agriculture related assets (land, agriculture machinery and irrigation)
    constituted around 90% of the asset base of the participants (all) as well as non-participant
    households.
   Asset profiles of the poverty and social groups have thrown up very clearly that there is a need to
    diversify the asset base of the participants towards animal husbandry and non-farm assets.
   The increase in the value of assets per participant household over BLS was around 5-fold for both the
    poverty groups. On average, it has increased from Rs.28298 in the pre-project situation to Rs.131360
    in the project-end situation for the POP, and from Rs.48028 to Rs.232700 for the poor.
   The asset base of SCs increased by 6-fold, while it increased by around 3-fold for other social groups.
   The net increase in the total value of assets at constant prices due to the project was substantial for
    poor participants (Rs. 103778/-) followed by POP participants (Rs. 64234/-).
   The gain in the asset base was higher for the ST participants (Rs.115512) and was Rs.100284/- for
    SCs.
   In the case of the POP, the increase in the extent of land as well as the increase in the value of land
    per acre has contributed to increase in the value of land, while only the increase in extent of land has
    contributed to the increase in the value of land in the case of the poor.
   The share of agricultural and allied assets accounted for more than 90% of the increased asset value
    for all the categories of households.
   Consumer durables have accounted for a considerable proportion of the increase in the value of
    assets.
   BLS results indicates that households with a relatively higher income from SCs, STs and BCs; and
    relatively with lower income from OCs were participants.
   The composition of income in BLS shows that the participant households depended more on wage
    employment as compared to non-participant households.
   The annual income of the POP who participated in RPRP, on average, has increased from Rs.21603
    pre-project to Rs.47079 at the end of the project.
   The income of the poor has increased from Rs.21736 to Rs.50386/- in current prices.

                                                    61
   Dependence on wage employment has declined by around five percentage points for both categories
    of participant households (POP and poor), with a corresponding increase in self-employment
    activities.
   The income gains were higher for the SCs and BCs as compared to STs. The gains were Rs. 3268;
    Rs.6680; and Rs 17 for the SCs; BCs; STs respectively.
   The net benefit due to the project in terms of income at constant prices was high for the poor
    participants (Rs. 16280/-) and Rs. 11774/- for POP participants.
   SC participants gained more (Rs. 9827/-) compared to STs (Rs.4913/-).
   Even non-participants gained substantially due to project externalities.
   As much as 99% of increased income came from self-employment activities for the POP, while only
    around 50% of the increased income was from self-employment activities for the poor.
   The poor could not diversify their self-employment activities as much as the POP towards non-farm
    activities.
   The increase in the share of income from self-employment activities in the enhanced income was
    33.86% for poor participants (vs. 23.65% for non-participants) and 32.10% for the POP participants
    (vs.16.82% for non-participants).
   The trend was similar with respect to SCs and STs.
   RPRP has contributed to upward mobility in the incomes of the participant POP, the poor and all the
    social groups. In the case of the POP, 15% of the households from middle income deciles have moved
    to higher income deciles. But in the case the poor, 3% households from the bottom two deciles and
    9% from the middle income deciles experienced upward mobility.
Indications from the Organisation of Poor Women
   The sustainability of these organizations should be captured through the structure and class
    composition of these groups; whether they are democratic in their functioning; transparency in their
    dispensation; and group cohesiveness and financially sustainability.
   In terms of social categorization of SHGs, in all, 40% of the groups belonged to the category of
    ‗Mixed Groups‘ i.e. members within the SHG belong to different caste groups. Further, in all, 48%
    of the SHGs members were poor and 19%, poorest of the poor.
   The manifestations of the structures can be traced in the attrition of the members from the groups.
    High attrition poses a threat to the sustainability of the group. The results indicate that moving out of
    the village was the major reason for the attrition of members (24%). Perhaps marriage might have
    caused the women members to move out of the village.
   Conducting meetings regularly is one of the important indicators for assessing the performance of
    SHGs and the results indicate that on an average, over 96% of the SHGs were conducting meetings at
    least once a month and 79% of the SHGs met regularly in the same place. Over one-third of groups
    imposed penalties for non-attendance, for non-payment of thrift and for loan defaulters. 60% of SHGs
    had trained book keepers. 90% of the SHGs have received IGA and 69% received bank loans and
    these loans are distributed equally. On an average, 46% of the SHGs surveyed have received
    paavalavaddi and SHGs in Kadapa dominated with 63% followed by Warangal (51%).

                                                     62
   SHGs by and large, were able to meet their annual expenditures through their incomes.
   No conflicts were reported in 89% of SHGs and the conflicts reported were resolved internally.
   The pattern was similar for the federations of these groups at the village and mandal level. There are
    sub-committees in these federations to look after different functions that reflect the democratization in
    the functioning of these institutions.
The Way Forward
Increasing credit from formal institutions, providing agricultural land and enhancing women‘s
empowerment for the low and middle order performers (in terms of level of incremental income); and
including non-participants into the programme; replicating the best practices of high performance
mandals in the low and middle performance mandals; and improving the functioning of the SHGs which
are of single caste, with more poorest of the poor members and which are financially unviable (annual
expenditure exceeds annual receipts) will improve the performance of the programme.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
ICRR Mission, Hyderabad, November 2011
The following testimonials were provided by SHG member beneficiaries during a stakeholder workshop
with 150 participants from different project districts.
Bank linkages
Member benefitted from Bank Linkage
   ―TFI has enabled us to invest on more than 1 livelihood activity. I could get a loan of Rs 45,000
   to start 2 enterprises (tailoring and mini flour mill). Both put together gives us an income of Rs
   6000 to 7000 per month and our monthly repayment installment is only around Rs. 2500.‖
Tribal SHG women benefitted from Bank Linkage
   ―I was refused entry into 3 or 4 SHGs that were formed before the project. With the support of
   IKP, I could form a group of my own along with other tribal women. Since then we have been
   regularly saving and I personally have accessed a loan of nearly Rs. 25,000 over the last few
   years. I run a small enterprise that gives us an income of Rs 4000 per month.‖
Dairy
Household that has taken up dairying
   ―As a landless marginalized woman, it was unthinkable for me to start a mini dairy. I was
   ridiculed too. But the loan from the bank and CIF gave me the required push to start the mini
   dairy and lease in land for fodder. With 10 cows and 8 heifers, today I am the most respected
   woman in my village.‖
Member of the Mandal Samakhya managing a BMCU
   ―From a meager start of 300 liters per day, our BMCU has come a long way. With a collection
   of 4000 liters per day we have managed to ensure better prices for the milk producers in the
   region.‖
Agriculture
Zilla NPM committee member
   ―Our members were reluctant to take up agriculture due to high cost of cultivation. Through IKP
   we learnt about NPM and various low cost interventions in agriculture. We have gained in two
   ways - reduction in the cost and improvement in quality.‖
SHG member following NPM methods of agriculture
   ―Ever since we have taken up NPM our health has improved to a great extent. Firstly there is no
   direct contact with harmful chemicals and secondly the quality of food that we are eating is much
   better‖
SHG member following NPM methods of agriculture
―Because of the NPM methods being followed we can clearly see that fertility levels of our soils have
improved to a great extent‖.

Jobs
Young girl (daughter of an SHG member) employed under the jobs program
   ―I had only passed intermediate (Class 12) and was sitting idle at home. That is when I heard
   about the jobs program and I wanted to join the program. However, my parents were hesitant to
   send me to Hyderabad. I ultimately joined the program because of the persuasion of the IKP staff.
   Even though I joined at a meager salary of Rs. 3000 per month 2 years ago, today I earn Rs
   15,000 per month. The most critical support for me was the handholding I received during the
   initial 2 to 3 months in the job. The IKP resource person was available for support round the
   clock. The person was just a call away and in fact 2 or 3 times he personally accompanied me to
   the office to allay any fears I had.‖
Young boy (son of an SHG member) employed under the jobs program
   ―I started with a salary of Rs. 5000 per month in a telecom company and in 2 years time have
   been promoted to the level of a store manager with a salary of Rs. 14,000 per month. I recently
   passed my graduation as well. Typically young boys who have passed class 10 or 12 and are
   sitting idle at home are highly susceptible to be influenced by anti social elements. The jobs
   program is critical to make sure that their energies are guided in the right direction.‖
   ―Earlier a government job was seen as the only alternative. Thanks to IKP people have realized
   there are plenty of opportunities beyond a government job.‖
   ―Today I have the ‗confidence‘ to get any other job even if lose my current job.‖
Insurance
Widow beneficiary of the Insurance Program
   ―I lost hope when my husband died. The call centre at the district came to our rescue and paid Rs
   5000 just within few hours of his death. With an amount of Rs 25,000 in an FD, I have secured
   my daughter‘s future.‖
Bima Mitra, Insurance Program
   ―During my visit to the house of a deceased I noticed that both his children were disabled. By
   seeking Mandal Samakhya support we were able to get the children admitted into a government
   residential school.‖
   ―By supporting them during the most turbulent times we become one among the family. My job
   as a Bima Mitra leaves me with a great sense of satisfaction.‖
Member, Insurance Committee, Zilla Samakhya
   ―We don‘t mind paying a higher premium today.           The members have benefitted from this
   immensely.‖
Health and nutrition
State Community Resource Person, Health
   ―I lost my 3 year old child because of my ignorance about good health and nutrition related
   behavior. I want to make sure the same does not happen with any other child either in my village
   or the villages that I go to as a CRP.‖

                                                  65
   ―Our efforts to train SHG members on better health along with presence of the NDCC in the
   village has brought down the total health expenses of our village from 1.5 lakh 5 years ago to just
   Rs 43,000 per year. Our village has not seen a death during delivery for the last 5 years and not
   a single new born for the last 5 years was disabled.‖
State Community Resource Person, Health
   ―I was married off at the age of 16 and went through an agonizing time during my pregnancy. I
   want to make sure that no pregnant woman goes through the same.‖
   ―Regular training on the importance of health and nutrition has ensured that all the SHG women
   in the village have understood how critical nutrition is for preventing diseases right from the
   beginning.‖
State Community Resource Person, Health
   ―External CRPs can only start the process of change. Long term change can be brought about
   only when the VO members take up full implementation responsibility of health and nutrition
   activities.‖
State Community Resource Person, Health
   ―The VOs and the mandal Samakhyas are monitoring the quality of services provided by public
   health facilities like the sub centers and the PHCs. There are many examples of how our
   federations have ensured that the doctor is available during the prescribed time or that the ANM
   performs all her duties.‖
Disability Program
Community Resource Person for Disability Intervention, Adilabad district
   ―I was just sitting at home thinking how unfortunate I was to have been disabled. I thought that I
   would not be able to achieve anything in life. It is at this stage that I heard about IKP and
   inspired by that started an SHG for persons with disability in my village. We started making
   regular savings and soon were able to get a loan from the project. I used the loan to start a small
   enterprise. Being a part of the SHG has improved my confidence immensely. I recently passed
   the class 10 exam and would want to take up higher studies.‖
   ―Earlier I was loved by only my own family, but today I have recognition from my village, district
   and the entire state.‖
Disability CRP, Khammam district
   ―As a person with disability I was frightened to interact with anyone in my own village. I got
   support from the project to form an SHG in the year 2004. My son was also born with partial
   disability; however the training on physiotherapy given by the project has made it possible for me
   to correct my son‘s disability‖.
Sulkamma, member, SHG for PWD
   ―Even though I studied till class 12, I had to face a lot of insults when I started looking for a job.
   I then joined an SHG for PWDs and the project helped me get a job in a diamond polishing
   company with a salary of Rs. 6000. The company also provides free hostel accommodation. I am
   extremely happy that now I am economically independent.‖

                                                    66
Member of Zilla Vikalangula Sangham
   ―The Vikalangula Sangham systematically plans for the development of all the disabled people in
   the district. We do a complete listing of the disabled and plan for surgical operations or
   equipment wherever needed. The sangham also acts as a platform for facilitating bank loans
   wherever possible. Our district sangham in fact has constructed a building with our own funds
   and support from the government.‖
Secretary of the Zilla Vikalangula Sangham
   ―Our Mandal Vikalangula Sangham has acquired a neighborhood care centre for the severely
   disabled and our Zilla Samakhya has also acquired a building with the help of the district
   administration. The sanghas have managed to help us get loans from the banks which was never
   possible before. Recently we highlighted our issues with our MLAs and MP and as a result of our
   efforts a GO that 10% of the MPLADS needs to be spent on PWDs has been issued.‖
Mallesham (member Mandal Sangham, an MTech Student)
   ―I have been able to pursue higher studies largely because of the encouragement and support I
   have got from the members of my sangham. Just last year, I had hesitated to take up my MTech.
   course due to financial constraints but the Mandal Sangham immediately stepped in to provide
   me with a loan to take up the course. Today if I am able to do this course, it is only because of
   the support of the sangham and the project.‖
Gender
Zilla Samakhya Gender Committee member, Krishna District
   ―We recently rescued a 15 year old girl who was about to be married off based on the
   information provided by our VO gender committee. The Zilla committee also took the
   responsibility to support the girl to take up higher studies. The girl is now appearing for her
   class 10 examination. We have prevented 52 such child marriages in the last 6 years.‖
   ―There are no avenues for poor women to share their problems and they do not have the money
   to approach the police and courts even if they are being exploited. It is mostly in such instances
   that the gender committees have come to their rescue and ensured that justice is delivered to
   them.‖
   ―We provide counseling to families so that they settle their difference and move on with their
   lives. Recently the wife of a senior police officer (Deputy Superintendent of Police) approached
   the district family counseling centre to solve the problems being faced by them.‖
   ―We have realized that unless there is equity and dignity for the women any number of economic
   opportunities would not make much difference to their lives.‖
SHG member who was a victim of trafficking
   ―I was taken to Bangalore by my husband on the pretext of getting me a job but he forced me to
   get into flesh trade. When I called a member of the gender committee in my village, they
   immediately came here and rescued me. Our SHG then helped me with a loan of Rs 40,000 to
   start an enterprise. Thanks to all their support, I am now economically independent and able to
   educate by daughter.‖
Zilla Samakhya Gender Committee member, Krishna District

                                                  67
    ―We may not have spent much in terms of budget but we are proud to have been able to change
    many people‘s lives.‖
Education
Member, Education Committee, Mandal Samakhya
    ―Monitoring through the VO education committee has ensured much higher attendance of the
    children in the school. We have taken up many surprise visits to the schools to monitor the
    attendance rates, the regularity of the teachers and the quality of mid day meals. In several
    instances we found that the teacher was maintaining fake attendance registers. In many cases the
    teachers were not present at all. We held several discussions with the teachers on all these issues
    and ensured that they improved their performance.‖
Parent of a child going to the community managed ECE centre
    ―I visit the centre on a regular basis as my child is enrolled in it. Learning is given the highest
    importance but most importantly my daughter enjoys the time she spends at the centre. In fact, I
    myself have learnt several of the rhymes and play activities practiced in the centre.‖
Member, Education Committee, Mandal Samakhya
    ―Our children never had good drinking water at the school and often went thirsty. Our
    committee (education) had a long struggle and waded its way through various PRI functionaries.
    Today our children have safe drinking water while at school.‖
Parent of a child going to the community managed ECE centre
    ―Thanks to its working hours, this Balwadi has enabled us to go for day long work. Our
    children are better prepared to join the primary school and look forward to going to balwadi
    every morning.‖
Parent of a boy who made it to the Indian Institute of Technology as a result of the corporate
education program
    ―The corporate education program at IKP helped my son access the best quality education at
    Vishakhapatnam. Hailing from a remote village this was a distant dream for us. His stride from
    a government school to IIT was possible because of IKP.‖
Students from a Residential Bridge School, Khammam district
    ―Most of us dropped out of school very early. We not only made it to the first division but also
    aspire to be engineers one day. Koyathuri Bata instilled this confidence within us.‖
CRPs on the focus areas for Institution Building in the next 3 years
   Focus on the PoP households and ensure that all 18 programs are implemented concurrently with all
    the PoP households. This would help the poorest to come out of poverty.
   Focus on savings is critical for future sustainability. Need to increase savings with time. This will
    ensure greater ownership of their institutions and make the institutions self reliant. Also regular
    audits of the institutions at all levels and sharing the findings with all the members will ensure greater
    transparency and ownership of the institutions
   Savings focus will also ensure that reliance on MFIs reduces considerably.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR



SERP‘s approach is path breaking in many ways. More than a decade after the initiation of this new
paradigm of development, the flourishing of these institutions of the poor is a testimony to the inherent
strength of the model, which must be the cornerstone of any strategy for poverty alleviation. The long
and arduous journey traversed by both the Sensitive Support Organization and the Community Based
Organizations has many lessons to offer to the whole gamut of stakeholders involved. It is in discerning
these honest and objective analyses of the various facets of this journey, partly supplemented by
hindsight, that the treasure of wisdom expected of an ICR report lies. The borrower comments needs to
be understood in this context.

Emerging Challenges and Opportunities

Balancing Scale, Quality and Multiple Interventions: SERP scaled up its operations rapidly from 316
mandals in 6 districts in 2000 to 1098 mandals in 22 districts in a span of 4 years. The social
mobilization process of the rural poor being a very intensive human-centric process, the scale of
operations did have an impact in terms of securing quality human resources and also monitoring the
purity of processes that is so important in social mobilization. Also over the years, the SERP
interventions began to rise exponentially from a focused social mobilization, institution building and
livelihoods to various fields such as Agriculture, Health and Nutrition, Education, Marketing, Land, Non-
farm, Insurance, Disability and Dairy. The expansion needs could not be sufficiently complemented by a
corresponding capacity building and IT based MIS with CBO‘s involvement.

Marking SHG-Bank Linkage - an option for Credit: AP is synonymous with the impressive SHG-Bank
Linkage programme accounting for 40 percent of the entire credit linkages in the country. Ironically, AP
also became synonymous with an equally impressive growth of the MFI sector. Since the SHG lending is
the one of the largest in the loaning portfolio of most of the Banks and reason for the very existence of the
RRBs, much more has to be done pro-actively by the Banking System to bring about systemic changes.
The challenge is to provide adequate and timely credit to the POP households.

Impressive Social Capital yet Poor Social Indicators: The paradox is too obvious to ignore. The low
performance on Human Development Indicators in A.P. is simply unacceptable in a situation where 1.1
cores women have been mobilized into 10 lakh SHGs and a 3 tier structure with access to government
programs and markets exists. Perhaps, an increased budgetary support to Social Development in A.P.
could have avoided this situation.

PoP Strategy: In spite of all the development achieved through SERP, the last mile solution to the
problem of abject poverty of the bottom 30% Poorest of the Poor (PIP) among the poor still remains
elusive. The decadal experience has shown that a Universal Approach has proven disadvantageous in
providing focused interventions to the POP due to inability to provide quality time by the project staff.
Given this, SERP has clearly articulated the need for a new vision and a fresh approach to finish the
unfinished business of the poverty elimination in the POP households. The lesson from A.P. is that, the
―last-mile‖ problem needs to be tackled up front by Community Driven Development Projects anywhere
in the World.

Shift in Focus from SHG to Individual Household: The MFI crises has shown very clearly that the POP
families require financial counseling to ensure that they make informed choices in both accessing credit
as well as investments to have stable returns. It is also now very apparent that they require support to
ensure avoidable expenditures. This is not possible in the present system where the focus is only the SHG
and it is presumed that the individual members‘ needs are automatically taken care of. The new approach


                                                     69
shall ensure that the POP households are not only focused but are also tracked continuously till such time
they come out of poverty. POP strategy will be universalized in all Mandals in due course.

ICT to Power the CBO Processes: The scale of operations in AP and the increasing complexities of the
processes make out a good case for proliferation of IT systems as the cutting edge to bring in not only
transparency and accountability but also efficiency and cost effectiveness into the operations of the
CBOs.

Converge to Bring Synergy: The demand side perspective of SERP to engage in pilots to demonstrate the
sustainability of community managed initiatives must be converged with the work of the line departments
concerned so that benefits of the proof of concepts are seen in the smooth scaling of implementation.
Convergence at the policy level has taken place to some extent due to the scale of the project. However,
at the implementation level, far more integration, knowledge transfer and capacity building must take
place for the project to reach a point where initiatives can be owned by the departments themselves. The
new approach is to pro-actively seek the involvement of the mainstream departments to converge in the
CBOs for a win-win arrangement that it is the interest of the poor.
