This is\n            the goal of the Employment Generation & Marketing\n            Mission (EGMM), which was established in 2005 by the Andhra\n            Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Program (APRPRP). Andhra\n            Pradesh's unemployment rate is slightly higher than\n            that of India, but these numbers do not give the full\n            picture of employment challenges. Rural areas are plagued\n            with low incomes and underemployment with many people\n            working in the informal sector, manual labor or seasonal\n            small scale farming. EGMM's mission is to respond to\n            this problem by facilitating employment in the formal sector\n            which offers more stable and higher incomes for economically\n            underprivileged rural youth so that poor households can\n            leave poverty within one generation. To achieve its goal of\n            generating employment for rural youth, EGMM works with the\n            state government, the private sector, and community\n            institutions of the rural poor. Accurate targeting is an\n            important component of the program. EGMM targets rural youth\n            from poor families of SHGs who are between 18 and 28 years\n            of age."}, "docdt": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
