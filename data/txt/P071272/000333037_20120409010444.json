highly satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: it did this by keeping a flexible\n            design that could easily respond to emerging ideas and\n            successes, building the ability of communities themselves to\n            develop and test ideas, a commitment to listening and\n            responding to the needs and suggestions of beneficiaries,\n            and a willingness to accept failure as long as the project\n            learned from that failure. More innovation came from the\n            grassroots than the board room.  Aggregate institutions of\n            the poor attract mainstream market players. Convergence of\n            programs allows bundled service delivery increase\n            availability, accessibility, affordability and reliability\n            of services. To support efforts of the poor in overcoming\n            poverty, a household-centered approach with multiple project\n            interventions has proved to be successful. Strategic\n            partnerships (MoUs) with Government departments, commercial\n            banks, public, private and social entrepreneurship sectors\n            should be supported not only to provide smooth and\n            preferential access to services by the poor but also capture\n            growth opportunities amplifying the livelihood impacts.\n            Effective fiduciary assurance systems including standardized\n            financial management, regular audits, etc. It will help\n            projects to put in place computerized financial accounting\n            and Management Information System, or MIS, transparent and\n            rigorous procurement procedures and dynamic monitoring and\n            learning systems that will capture both qualitative and\n            quantitative aspects of program implementations."}, "docdt": "2012-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
