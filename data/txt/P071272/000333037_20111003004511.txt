1.     Proceeds for India, Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project, Second
Additional Financing, Credit 46750-IN , P118821 will be reallocated as follow:

2.      Further to the approval of Second Additional Financing of the project on
November 23, 2009, which extended the credit closing date from December 31, 2009
until September 30, 2011, there is substantial progress in project implementation, in
particular on financial literacy, better governance of Self Health Groups (SHGs),
addressing malnutrition of pregnant and lactating mothers and children under 3-years,
and implementation of Poorest-of-Poor (PoP) strategy. As of June 2011, the
disbursement rate for Category-3 (CBOs/NGOs-Community Institution Development)
and Category-5 (Training Workshop and study tours) reached little more than 100%.
Hence additional allocation is required for Category 3 and 5.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to ensure the achievement of the key
project performance indicators. There are huge savings in category-2 (Goods/ equipment)
and category-4 (Consultancies, studies and technical assistance), since many of the
planned activities under category-2 and category-4 have been completed from other
sources of funds. The proposed reallocation of funds across disbursement category will
not impinge on the achievements of the project development objectives; rather the
reallocation will facilitate a more effective project implementation and achievement of
the project development objectives.
