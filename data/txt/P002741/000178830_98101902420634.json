It will also; (iii)\n            supply imported fuel and pulp to the mill for the first six\n            months of operation, and other materials and supplies\n            (chemicals, spares, consumables, etc.) for about the first\n            three years of operations."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
