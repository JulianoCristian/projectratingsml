(BWDB) Small Schemes Project will: (a) increase agricultural\n            production by increasing the area under high-yielding rice\n            and wheat cultivation through improved drainage and/or\n            irrigation and by reducing crop losses from flooding; (b)\n            strengthen the institutional capacity of the Bangladesh\n            Water Development Board (BWDB) to: (i) implement small\n            schemes; and (ii) carry out Operation and Maintenance (O and\n            M) for large schemes; and (c) support the transfer of O and\n            M responsibilities of small schemes to local bodies. The\n            Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Small Schemes\n            Project will include about 30 quick yielding, low cost per\n            acre, and high rate of return flood control, drainage and\n            irrigation subprojects. The Bangladesh Water Development\n            Board (BWDB) Small Schemes Project will support improvements\n            on about 225,000 acres. Over 80,000 farm families, or nearly\n            480,000 people, will directly benefit."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
