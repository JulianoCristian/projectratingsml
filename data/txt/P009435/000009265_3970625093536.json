Impressive gains in production\n            were delayed by the construction program and are now\n            threatened by deficiencies in operations and maintenance.\n            Sustainability of the increased production is uncertain, and\n            is contingent on removal of severe risks to the completed\n            infrastructure. Institutional development is rated as\n            negligible, reflecting the multiple operations and\n            maintenance activities promoted at appraisal and then\n            largely ignored. The Bank's performance was generally\n            satisfactory. The project was well defined and possessed the\n            required framework and guidelines for implementation.\n            However, implementation and operation of subprojects\n            suffered from shortcomings in project design. The\n            Bank's supervision missions made positive contributions\n            to the physical and institutional development of the\n            project. The Borrower's performance in carrying out its\n            obligations was below expectations. The chief weakness was\n            the persistent failure in timely acquisition of land for\n            construction and adequate provision of counterpart funds\n            when required. The main lessons learned are: (i) problems of\n            land acquisition should be anticipated, and fair and orderly\n            compensation measures planned in advance; (ii) the\n            construction program should be tailored to a realistic\n            projection of resources available to the Government; and\n            (iii) the Government must fulfill its commitments to carry\n            out regular operations and maintenance, supported by the\n            beneficiaries, otherwise the civil works will fail and the\n            benefits will be unsustained."}, "docdt": "1996-12-11T00:00:00Z"}
