Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan in Slovenia. The overall rating of the\n            project is satisfactory; and the performance of Bank and the\n            borrower is also satisfactory. Slovenia has made good\n            progress in transforming its economy to a market-based\n            system. Growth has been achieved in a stable macroeconomic\n            environment and in conjunction with considerable\n            microeconomic reforms. As a result of the privatization of\n            socially-owned enterprises, which is nearly completed, and\n            the entry of new private enterprise, the private sector is\n            now estimated to make up about 50 percent of GDP. Some of\n            the main lessons that can be drawn from this project are: a)\n            Comprehensiveness of Program Design - The Enterprise and\n            Financial Assistance Loan (EFSAL) was designed as a\n            comprehensive reform package addressing interrelated\n            macroeconomic, enterprise, and banking sector problems\n            within a single consistent framework. Concerns were raised\n            during the preparation and implementation of the EFSAL\n            regarding the broad scope of the program. However,\n            experience has shown in Slovenia as well as in other\n            transition countries that consistency and coherence of\n            macroeconomic, enterprise, and banking sector reforms are\n            essential for the success in achieving the reform\n            objectives. This was particularly relevant in Slovenia\n            because the EFSAL program was the first comprehensive\n            medium-term program for economic transformation following\n            independence. The scope of the program and some of its main\n            elements such as bank restructuring was replicated in\n            subsequent programs in the other countries in the region. b)\n            Ambitious Time-frame - Any program of major adjustments of\n            the enterprise and banking sectors addresses the core\n            foundation of the economic system. It should therefore be\n            expected that such reforms generate wide-ranging debate on\n            policy, institutional, and legislative issues. This was\n            particularly true in the case of Slovenia, a newly\n            independent country which was building its democratic\n            institutions, its public administration, and in which there\n            has been a tradition of consensus building."}, "docdt": "1997-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
