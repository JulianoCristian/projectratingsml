MEMORANDUM AND EOONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBID TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO RUSSIA
FOR AN EMPLOYMINT SERVICES AND SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the RussLan Federation for the equivalent of US$70.0
million to help finance an Employment SerAices and Social Protection Project.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of fifteen years, including five years of grace.
2.   laeg.gad. Despite its inefficiency, the former Soviet economic system
provided a relatively high degree of economic security to the general
population. Involuntary unemployment was unknown and there was wide access to
baalc social services. There was little inflation and although consumption
levels, especially of pensioners, were often meager, most individuals felt
that they could rely on a steady income and access to basic social services.
The adjustment process is causing a sharp fall in real incomes while the fear
of rapidly increasi"q unemployment is widespread. Without some reassurance
that reform will not result in personal destitution, public support for
present economic policies may disappear. An effective safety net is,
therefore, essential to Russia's program of adjustment, stabilisation and
systemic transition.
3.   The weakest link in the safety net is the ability to cope with extensive
unemployment, since unemployment was virtually unknown under the previous
system. Unemployment still remains low, but there are indications of the
potential for a sudden and rapid increase, especially since labor redundancy
was previously endemic and industrlal output has fallen nearly 20 percent
during the last two years. if systemic and structural reform is to be
successful, an increase in unemployment is inevitable, and experience in
zastern Europe suggests that in Russia it might reach between two and four
million by mid- 1993 and rise to over 10 million during 1994. There is
therefore a need to build up employment services as a matter of urgency,
particularly the capacity to deliver unemployment benefits. In addition, the
development of proactive employment programs is an important part of
establihing a market economy in Russia. Employment services which can
provide accurate job information and counseling, job placement, targeted
resj,nses to mass layoffs and the provision of opportunities for further
training, can lead to a more efficient deployment of labor, a reduction of
time lost in unemployment, and higher individual earnings. Other elements of
the social safety net also need strengthening, including pension
administration and the ability to target social assistance to those without
any other source of inome.
4    The Government's comaaitment to an improved safety net is reflected in
lts Memorandum of Economic Reform Policies supporting the Rehabilitation Loan.
With World Bank assistance, the Government has now defined a realistic
"subsistence minimum, that it intends to defend against inflation, and use as
the basis for determining pensions and unemployment benafits. It is also
developing policies to provide a more complete, targeted safety net for
individuals irrespective of their entitlement to categorical cash benefit
programs. The recent decision to upgrade the former Employment Committee to



2
an independent ministerial lawel agency, the Federal Employment service (FED),
LU evidence of the Government'e commitment to developing effective employment
service", although the agency is currently constrained by the number of staff
and lack of experience in developing and managing labor market policies and
programs.
5.   Under the Technical Cooperation Program between the Government and the
Bank, assistance has been provided to Russia to develop coherent policies with
which to implement a social safety net, particularly employment services. A
team of Bank-financed consultants collaborated closely witn the FES in
developing a proqram, and further preparation is continuing under a PPP. The
project is tho first phase of a larger program to be oupported by future
lending.
6.   Systemic reform of labor markets and the social safety not in Russia is
addressed in three ways under the projects (a) by developing an ability to
cope with large-scale unemployment, without which other measures to promote
reform are unlikely to succeed; (b) by improving the functioning of labor
markets, which is central to a successful restructuring of the Russian
economy; and (c) by supporting retraining of labor as a part of a massive
effort, which has already begun, to transform Russia's human capital base to
moet the demands of a market economy. A social sector study, which will be
ready for discussion with the Government in February 1993, will consolidate
and update this policy advice provided under the Technical Cooperation
Program, nd analyze expenditure and financing issues, describe the relative
roles of central and local government and enterprises and develop policy
recoimendations to facilitate the emergence of effective, functioning labor
markets. This study vill address the issue of how to restructure Russia"s
soclal sector spendinj#, including the issue of how to ensure adequate funding
for both unemploymeit compensation and the proactive programs needed to
address unemployment.
7.   Lessons from Experience. Research on the effectiveness of employment
services in OECD countries indicates that the quality of staff are a critLcal
input to employswnt services, particularly as the emphasis on proactive
policies, as distinct from benefit delivery, increases. The proposed project
places heavy emphasis on staff training for this reason. Moreover, experience
elsewhere indicates that computers are a powerful and effective medium for
integrating the diverse components of employment services delivery, provided
that the applications are carefully selected and based on well-designed
programs and operational procedures. In Bank projects, however,
computerisation has had mixed results and an important lesson from experience
in other Zuropean countries i that simplicity and speed, with emphasis on the
immdiate goals of the registration of clients and payment of benefits, are of
the esence. Thle project will provide for stand-alone computers using
existing soft-ware adapted for use nationwide.
8.   03D analysis of Bank involvement ln institutional strengthening has
emphasised the importance of both Government commitment and clarity of
objectives and procedures in a project. Both concerns have been addressed.
The comitment of the Government has been descrl'- ud above (para. 4).
Technical assistance will be of limited duration and the foreign advisors will



3
be matched by Russian counterpart staff to ensure continuity. The goals of
6larity and simplicity are met from the outset through the specificity of the
PCV mandate, detailed terms of reference, technical assistance contracts which
clearly specify the tasks to be performed and a project operations schedule
based on key benchmarks.
9.   Project Obiectives.  The principal objective of this project, which is
to be implemented between February 1993 and October 1994, is to quickly
develop the capacity of the FE8 to process the anticipated upsurge of benefit
claims from the rapidly growing numbers of unemployed following economic
restructuring and priv-tization. It is also designed to develop the capacity
of the FES to carry out active employmant policies, including retraining; and
to assist the NSP, in collaboration with other agencies, to reform the pension
system, improve its administration and begin the design of a modern social
security system. Indesd this project will provide the framework for successor
projects in the areas of employment services, social protection and training.
10.  Project Descrintion. The loan would finance equipment and technical
assistance:
(a)   to rapidly improve the FEUSs capacity to register and pay
benefits to the unemployed, and to introduce computer
systms, policies, standards and related software;
(b)   zo build the longer term capacity of the PUS and the ISP:
(i) for the PeUs to design programs, enabling
mchanism  and monitoring methods for the improvement
of labor market policies and management systems; to
strengthen program services, including model
employment offices and programs to deal with mass lay-
offs, and standby public service/and or temporary
mployment programs; to develop system  for monitoring
labor markets and poverty levels; to strengthen PUS's
efforts to organize job training for the unemployed In
the new skills required by a market economp and in the
preparation of curricula and training materials;
(i$) for the NSPs to improve the operational
effectiveness of the SP and, as an important
preparatory phase to a planned 1994 project, develop
and test the automation of cash benefit delivery on a
pilot basis in selected regions and in the design of
benefits program; and
(iii) to initiate the design of a modern social
security scheme and the development of a mastar plan
for the different agencLis involved with employment
services, cash benefits and social assistance,
together with recommendations for phasing and a
detailed design for the next phase.

11.   Protect mlemen^ation,.  A Project Coordlnation Unit (PCU) will be
established to suVport the management of the FE8 by developing operational
guidelines, performance benchmarks, reporting procedures, contract monitoring
and advice on procureent procedures. A special unit for staff training wlll
also be established within the FEB.
12.   A Project launch workshop is planned to familiarize officials from
local offices and other field level staff with the project and implementation
arrangements. Since the FE8 is expected to face rapidly increasing demand for
services due to unemployment, project implementation is planned for 15 months.
However, this timetable is undoubtedly ambitious, and the project completion
date has been set at 21 months after start-up to provide for possible
slippage. A mid-term evaluation is planned for October 1993.
13. Proisect ustainability. The Government has made a commitmert to
maintaining sufficient numbers of qualified sttff in the FEB to ensure that
skills provided by technical assistance are transferred to local staff. The
government's contribution to the project covers staff salaries, administrative
expenditures, training and the major share of the cost of preparlng offices to
receive equipment for automation. This is sufficient to maintain project
implementation. The Government is committed to ensuring sufficient funds are
available for the life of the project. The larger issue of financing the
unemployment compensation and proactive programs is discussed in para. 6.
14.  &tgXW  Actjms' During negotiations the following agreements were
reachedt (i) detailed terms of reference, to Le agreed between the FES and the
Bank, would be prepared for the labor market information systems work and for
the social security system study; (ii) procurement of training equipment would
begin only after detailed criteria for selection of training institutions and
courses have been approved by the Bank; (iii) the PFS shall furnish to the
Dank not later than May 30, 1993, regulations for the distribution of
computers to individual 135 field offices, an implementation plan including
crLteria for the selection of such offices, accepcable to the Dank, and carry
out the distribution of computers and related equipment in accordance with the
implemantation plan; (iv) consultant and counterpart staff of the PCU would be
maintained for the duration of the project; (v) a timetable for the
appointment of sufficient counterpart staffs (vi) a project operations
schedule including detailed benchmarks for activities under the project; and
(vii) a mid-term evaluation would take place not later than October 30, 1993.
Prior to Loan Effectiveness a contract for employment of technical assistance
for the PCU would be signed and qualified counterpart staff would be appointed
to the PCU to work together with international specialists.
1S. Unvironmental Issues. There are no environmental issues deriving from
this project which has been classified as Category 'C'.
16. Benefits. By providing the necessary equipment and training and by
strengthening the management of the FES, the project would help create the
capacity to provide timely support for the anticipated large numbers of
unemployed in the short-term, and in the longer-tere would assist development
of a wide range of labor market policies supporting the restructuring of
Russia's economy, and a modern computerized social security system.

17.  Risks. The main risk in that the project timetable, which is ambitious,
will be delayed. This risk in partially mitigated by the strong commitment of
the VEW and MWP personnel involved, and by the political and social pressure
on the employment services that may be ekpected as unemployment grows. Xn any
case, the urgency of the need does not permit a more relaxed timetable. A
second risk is that organization&l changes may weaken effectiveness or reduce
receptivity to foreign advice. This risk is acceptable since the FE8 has
recently been given an independent mandate and clear authority to accelerate
decision-making. A third risk is that local authorities will proceed so
independently of the central FE8 and M8e that the adoption of the project's
improvements will not proceed. This risk will be addressed by emphasizing
local consultation (efforts to date to involve local offices initiated through
bilateral donors and continued under the PPF are already paying d:vidends) and
staff training, which will be strengthened under the project. Moreover, local
offices will be required to meet criteria, still to be dotermined (para. 14),
to be eligible to receive computers and equipment.
18.  Reommenton. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreemnt of the Bank and recommend that Executive Directors
approve it.
