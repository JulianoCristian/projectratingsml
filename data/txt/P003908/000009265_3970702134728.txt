MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPM.NT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A RAILWAY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for the equivaLent of US$28.0 million is submitted
for approval. The loan would help finance the Railway Technical Assistance
Project and would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
2.        Background.  The transport sector in Indonesia grew an average of
12% a year in the 1970s and 8-10% in the 1980s. The country' s size, geo-
graphy, population of over 160 million and its spatial distribution have made
transport an important and difficult sector, with transport issues being very
different in different parts of the country. The Railway (PJKA), with a
network of about 6,000 km, operates only in Java and parts of Sumatra. In
1986, PiKA carried 48 million passengers (7.5 billion passenger-km) and
7.2 million tons (1.5 billion ton-km), which represented an average annual
growth in passenger and freight traffic of 7% and 4%, respectively, since
1979. The main weaknesses of PJKA are (a) lack of an adequate number of
experienced managerial and technical staff in the middle levels; (b) weak
financial position with revenues covering only 60% of operating costs; and
(c) chronic overstaffing. The Government is currently faced with severe
budgetary and balance of payment constraints, stemming from unfavorable oil
prices. At the same time, it is facing growing demands for transport and for
more efficient transport services in order to help in the drive for continued
economic growth. In early 1985 the Government requested the Bank to undertake
an examination of PJKA's problems. The Bank's conclusions were that PJKA's
operational and maintenance practices could be modernized and its efficiency
improved substantially with relatively small inputs of training and technical
assistance.
3.        Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.  Since the first Railway
Project (June 1974) the Bank has limited its involvement with PJKA to specific
components required to support other investments assisted by the Bank. Direct
involvement with the Railway was precluded by the unwillingness of the Govern-
ment and PJKA to undertake institutional changes required for meaningful
improvements to occur in the Railway's overalL operational efficiency and
financial viability. With growing pressure on public revenues resulting from
declining oil revenues, the Government and PJKA management are now convinced
of the need to improve the operations of public enterprises and reduce operat-
ing subsidies. The Bank's strategy is to support through the proposed project
a series of efforts by PJKA to address the major problems affecting the effi-
ciency of the Railway, while pursuing a dialogue on further improvements
needed, particularly on the Railway's finances and the formulation of a
rational future investment program.
4.        Project Objectives.  The principal purpose of the proposed project
is to assist PJKA in efforts to bring about measurable and significant
improvements in its traffic operations as well as in mechanical and track



maintenance over the next four years. Ac the same time, it would lay the
groundwork for a major reorientation of commercial, operational and
maintenance practices that should enable PJKA to become financially viable
over a seven- to eight-year period.
5.        Project Description.  The project wouLd be implemented over four
years and would comprise the following:
(a)  technical assistance (about 270 staff-months) to PJKA in the follow-
ing areas: a comprehensive management information system, costing,
procurement and inventory control, train scheduling, and ration-
alization of mechanical and track maintenance;
(b) training of railway staff (about 430 staff-months) in all areas of
modern railway operations and specifically train operations,
marketing and sales;
(c) acquisition of equipment for handling containers and intermodal
traffic, a few pieces of maintenance and miscellaneous equipment,
and computer hardware and software for a management information
system; and
Cd) minor physical improvements, such as paving of yards, to facilitate
container and intermodal traffic.
The prime emphasis in this project would be on efficiency improvements.
Improvement in PJKA finances is a longer term goal. It is expected that, if
this project is carried out satisfactorily, it will prepare the groundwork for
a rational future investment program, implementation of which should ensure
PJKA's financial viability.
6.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$31.0 million equiv-
alent, with a foreign exchange component of US$28.0 million (90x). A break-
down of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule,
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respec-
tively. A map (No. 19491) showing the transportation network is attached as
Annex E. A Technical Annex is also attached.
7.        Agreed Actions.  At negotiations the GOI agreed on the following
main actions:
(a) to reduce the number of PJKA employees from about 47,000 at present
to about 41,000 by March 31, 1991, and Lo provide funds to PJKA for
payment of the salaries of staff in excess of its requirements;
(b) to prepare at least two months prior to the start of the relevant
budget year a detailed training plan, satisfactory to the Bank, for
the training of PJKA staff;



-3-
(c)  to carry out a program for the conversior of PJKA into a "perun"
(government-owned public corporation) by March 31, 1989;
(d) to take all action necessary to enable PJKA to achieve the
operational and financial targets agreed with the Bank (para. 9 of
the Technical Annex);
(e) to submit to the Bank for comment, at least three months before the
relevant budget year, a draft of PJKA's annual investment plan, and
thereafter the final plan; and
(f) to sign the contract with the consultants (who have already been
selected) as a condition of loan effectiveness.
8.        Benefits.  Benefits from the project would accrue in the first
instance to PJKA itself in the form of lower operating and maintenance costs
and in lower investment requirements to cater to future traffic. These would
benefit the general tax-paying public in the form of diminishing demands on
the Government's budget for operating subsidies for PJKA and smaller demands
for equity contributions from the Government to help finance PJKA invest-
ments. The users of rail services would benefit from improved levels Gf
service and from more modern and technologically appropriate services that
would be cheaper than conventional rail or other transport services.
9.        Risks.  The principal risk involved in the project is that the
technical assistance and training efforts would not meet with much success.
Bearing the experience under the previous project in mind, the implementation
of this project has been designed to maximize the chances of success through
placing the responsibility for developing solutions to problems and implement-
ing them on PJKA staff, so that they identify themselves with the solutions
and their implementation. The other risk is that PJKA staff may not prove
adequate to the tasks under the project in some areas. PJKA has already
selected the staff who will be involved in the project, end every effort has
been made to identify the most suitable staff.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

RAILWAY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
The State Railway (PJKA)
1.        PJKA operates a network of some 4,400 route-km on Java and three
oeperate systems totalling some 2,000 km in North, West and South Sumatra.
About 163 km on Java are double-track, of which 55 km are electrified. Since
1971, PJKA has been a government agency under the Ministry of Communications
headed by a Chief Director who reports through the Secretary GeneraL to the
Minister. Although a government agency, the Railway has its own budget and
accounts, as well as its own management and personnel, albeit governed by
general government regulations. The Minister can give directions of a general
nature, controls both the capital and current portions of the annual budget,
and approves the levels of passenger fares and freight rates.  PJKA's head-
quarters are in Bandung, 190 km from Jakarta, the country's capital, where the
government ministries are located. The Chief Director is responsibLe for day-
to-day management. However, his powers are limited in regard to senior staff
appointments, personnel policy, capital expenditures, changes in budgetary
allocations, and tariff increases; the Government has the final authority on
all these matters. He is also responsible for liaison with the Government.
2.        The Railway is divided into six regions for operational purposes--
three in Java and three in Sumatra--each headed by a Chief of Region. At
headquarters, the Chief Director is assisted by eight senior officials of
director grade, each in charge of a major department or unit, such as track,
locomotives and rolling stock, traffic, etc. Considerable responsibility is
delegated to the Regional Directors in operational matters. The present
number of PJKA staff is around 47,000 (compared with 50,000 only 15 months
ago). PJKA has agreed to reC'ice this number further to 41,000 by 1991.
Probably not more than 30,000 would be needed for PJKA's operations, if effi-
ciently run with present technology. Improvements in technology could help
reduce staff numbers further.  PJKA has approximately 500 diesel locomotives,
about 1,400 passenger coaches and 14,000 freight wagons.  The railway uses a
variety of signalling systems, and these need standardization. A plan for
upgrading the signalling systems is currentLy under consideration by the
Government   The communications system relies on VHF radio, telephone and
telegraph.
Railway's Shortcomings and Avenues for Improvement
3.        The principal weakness of the PJKA organization has been the
excessiire demands made on the Chief Director, who has consequently had Little
time to devote to overall strategy and long-term development. Two senior
Directors lLave recently been appointed as Coordinators of Operations and
Administration, respectively, to assist the Chief Director.
4.        PJKA's other weaknesses arise from a Lack of adequate numbers of
experienced staff in the middle management levels (due mainly to its saLary



- 12 -
Technical Annex
Page 2 of 5
scales being tied to those of the Government, which are low), lack of satis-
factory operational and financial data for day-to-day management, an
inadequate accounting system which does not permit proper budget control, up-
to-date traffic costing and tariff setting, and an inadequate inventory
control and procurement system. Poor communications facilities combine with
the geography of the country to aggravate the above problems. To deal with
the first problem PJKA needs greater freedom to set salary scales to attract
candidates of the right calibre and motivation for management and technical
positions. In order to confer on it the necessary degree of freedom, the
Government has decided to convert it into a perum in accordance with a time-
table agreed with the Bank. The other problems will be addressed under the
proposed project.
5.        PJKA's financial position is far from satisfactory.  According to
its financial statements, revenues have for several years covered only 601 of
operating costs. Since tariffs for both passengers (65% of revenues) and
goods (35%) are competitive with road transport, the scope for tariff
increases is close to nil. However, there is considerable scope for
i) increasing the availability and utilization of operating assets;
(ii) economies in the use of labor, materials, fuel and equipment; (iii) sa-
ings in mechanical maintenance which is now based on the practices developed
during the era of steam locomotives, involving excessive and poorly planned
and executed maintenance; and (iv) identifying new areas for profitable, new
services, and providing those services.
6.        The availability of passenger coaches and goods wagons has been
below 75%. These could be increased to around 90% which would increase PJKA's
carrying capacity by 201 and help it to avoid an investment of at least
US$60 million. The availability of locomotives is around 75Z; this could be
improved to 85%. In addition, the utilization of PJKA's assets should be
improved. For example, wagon turnaround time for an average haul of 200 km is
at present over 9 days; this could be reduced by one half, thus doubling the
capacity of the wagon fleet (and saving a total investment of about
US$200 million in new wagons). Similar but less dramatic improvements in
locomotive and passenger coach utilization are possible.
7.        Some economies (up to 50%) are possible in PJKA's use of materials
like ballast and sleepers on branch lines and in maintenance of locomotives
and rolling stock. Also, the consumption of fuel could be substantially
improved (20-301) by reducing or eliminating waste in unloading and fueling,
losses from lack of measuring instruments for purchases, and so forth. In
addition to rolling stock use, PJKA can improve the use of items like track
maintenance machines to minimize the number that need to be bought. Also
equipment needed for railway operations and maintenance should be used more
fully before additional rolling stock and equipment are purchased (through,
for example, the introduction of multiple shifts in workshops). In general,
PJKA has too many workshops and maintenance facilities performing unneeded
work.
8.        PJKA's marketing could be more enterprising and willing to explore
new customer needs and how to meet them, especially through the use of door-
to-door services. Recently an express overnight freight service between



- 13 -
Technical Annex
Page 3 of 5
Jakarta and Surabaya has been started, with a premium charge. This seems to
have potential, since both cities are industrial centers producing for a
national market. The marketing efforts should be supported by cost analysis
of each specifE    -:ervice instead of using average cost data.  Cost data from
other railways could be adapted by PIKA, if necessary, until detailed data
from its own operations can be collected, compiled and analyzed.  For these
efforts to be successful, however, PJKA needs some freedom to vary tariffs and
to respond to changing market conditions promptly. Until recently, tariff
changes needed government approval, which could be a time-consuming process.
The Government has since allowed PJKA to vary freight tariffs according to
Lhanging market conditions.
9.        In addition to the efficiency improvements and cost savings
indicated above, PJKA can improve revenue collections through, for example,
charging on the basis of actual weight of goods loaded, instead of on the
basis of nominal wagon capacity. This is particularly important in the case
of commodities which are heavy relative to volume (e.g., pig iron and
dolomite).
10.       Immediate and short-term measures to improve the efficiency and
reduce the cost of PJKA operations, many of which are already being implemr
ented by PJKA, include the following: (a) simplification of operational regu-
lations, such as eliminating safety chains, reduction In restrictions on goods
train speed, etc.; (b) reduction in the manning and mainLenance of branch
lines as well as operations to absolute minimum levels and closing of branch
lines which will not cover variable cost even with such economy measures
unLess required for social reasons; (c) identification of excess employees and
their transfer to a separate account; (d) evaluation of the need to man each
of the road crossings on the basis of the volume of train and road traffic;
Ce) closing of unneeded facilities--workshops, sheds, stations, etc.; (f)
implementation of an improved system of accounting; and (g) providing better
support to management by strengthening the Railway's Planning Center to
analyze investments for financial and economic viability. PJKA has already
taken steps to set up separate marketing and intermodal service units (or
departments) to serve new customers more efficiently.  The proposed project
will further help the Railway deal with these problems.
11.       In the medium term, i.e., during the next 3-5 years, PJKA should
(a) initiate steps to rationalize and modernize workshops, locomotive and
roLling stock maintenance, track and bridge maintenance, signalling and commu-
nications, wagon fleet and fuel management; (b) introduce a modern management
information system for wagc'n control, mechanical maintenance, inventory
management and purchasing, billing, ticketing, etc.; (c) purchase a rail flaw
detector, a rail grinder, bridge crane and other required equipment to solve
immediate problems or for prototype purposes; and (d) undertake overseas
training of middle managers in all aspects of rail operations, management and
maintenance. To assist in the implementation of these measures, the proposed
project would provide PJKA technical assistance and training in improved
practices in addition to immediate equipment needs principally for training
and to implement the results of the technical assistance and training.

12.       Major investments in track, rolling stock, signalling and
communications and other equipment as may be justified by anticipated traffic
growth should be deferred until after the completion of the proposed
project. At the same time, establishing PJKA as a perum, with financial
viability as the ultimate goal, would also enable the Railway to revise salary
scaLes to attract and retain competent and motivated technical and managerial
staff.
13.       PJKA management is fully aware of many of the Railway's deficiencies
and has secured help from the Netherlands Government for developing the format
for a top management information system and in using the resulting data in
day-to-day operations. This work is ongoing and will be fully useful only
when reliable data from the field is fed into the central system, for which
the proposed project would provide assistance and training. PJKA has also
received an offer of assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany to
improve mechanical maintenance. This work will start in conjunction with the
proposed project and will concentrate on the three Sumatra regions of PJKA.
14.       One of the principal causes of PJKA's financial weakness is believed
to be the Jakarta commuter rail system (Jabotabek). In order to establish the
extent of loss on this system, and to more accurately determine the level of
subsidy that would be appropriate if Government wishes the services to con-
tinue at less than cost, PJKA has already taken steps to separate the accounts
of Jabotabek from those of the rest of the railway system. This will be com-
pleted in April 1, 1988, when a new system of accounting is introduced over
the entire network.
Project Details
15.       The technical assistance component of the proposed project would
involve approximately 270 man-months of effort by 40 experts over a period of
30 months. It would address the following areas: marketing, operations,
civil and mechanical maintenance, accounting and traffic costing, intermodal
services, planning, management information, and data processing. It would
also focus on improving passenger train services on the Jakarta-Cirebon-
Yogyakarta route and freight train operations on the Jakarta-Cirebon-Surabaya
route as demonstration efforts. The fee cost of technical assistance would be
US$2.7 million, plus US$2.5 million for travel, subsistence, office services,
etc., to support the expatriates' technical assistance efforts. In addition
to the full-time local counterparts who would work with their respective
expatriate counterparts and undergo training abroad, PJKA would provide some
350 man-months of staff time for monitoring, project magement and follow-up.
16.       The training component would address the same areas as the technical
assistance effort and would cover about 180 staff members of PJKA (most of
them already identified) and a limited number of HOC staff for a total of 430
man-months over a period of 30 months. PJKA staff would receive initial on-
"lie-job training in Indonesia by expatriate experts selected to provide
technical assistance, followed by training in the consultants' home office and
field visits abroad to observe how the training should be utilized to improve
the overall operational and management efficiency of PJKA. In some instances,
some academic training in the Bandung Institute of Technology or other

appropriate institution wouLd be provided to PJKA staff preparatory to being
sent abroad. The total cost of training is estimated at US$5.3 million,
including preparatory academic training in Indonesia.
17.       The following pieces of equipment, essential to the success of the
i  technical assistance and training effort, would be procured under the proj-
ect: one rail grinder, two earth-moving machines, one bridge crane, one high
rail crane, one rail flaw detector, one mobile wagon repair truck, two con-
tainer sideloaders, welding equipment (for bridges), and computer equipment.
The cost of these is estimated at US$14.6 million equivalent. Minor civil
works improvements, such as paving container yards, would cost US$0.8 million
equivalent.
Detailed Administration and Implementation
18.       The consultants for providing the technical assistance and training
have already been selected by PJKA in accordance with Bank guidelines on the
use of consultants. Items of equipment and materials to be procured under the
project (including materials for yard paving) would be subject to
international competitive bidding, except for US$2.5 million worth of items,
mostly computer equipment, for which prudent shopping would be more
appropriate. Minor civil works such as yard paving would be carried out by
force account. All bidding documents for packages costing more than US$0.5
million equivalent would be subject to prior Bank review. The total value of
contracts not subject to prior Bank review is not expected to exceed US$3.5
Willion.
19.       The proposed technical assistance would be provided almost entirely
by expatriates, with PJKA's Project Implementation Unit of eight officials
(already appointed) acting as the principal local counterpart or associate
group. This is considered essential and appropriate as the technical
knowledge and expertise required to provide the technical assistance is not
available in Indonesia. Terms of reference were agreed with the Bank, and
PJKA is expected shortly to conclude contract details with the selected
consultants. The signing of the contract with the consultants is a condition
of loan effectiveness.
20.       PJKA would be responsible for the implementation of the project,
with the help of the technical assistance consultants. It has already set up
a Project Implementation Unit headed by a Project Manager who would be
responsible for day-to-day project management, coordination and liaison with
the relevant railway departments/offices. The consultants' team would be
headed by a Project Director who will have direct responsibility for managing
the work of the consultants' team and work as co-Project Manager to support
the Indonesian Project Manager. The Government has decided to set up a
steering committee consisting of the senior officials of MOC, PHBD, BAPPENAS,
and PJKA, which will meet at least once every quarter to review the progress
of project implementation and to take remedial action as and when necessary.
21.       Periodic progress reports would be prepared by the consultants, and
copies of these would be sent to the Bank for comment. PJKA accounts, includ-
ing project-related accounts, would be audited by independent auditors accept-
able to the Bank.
