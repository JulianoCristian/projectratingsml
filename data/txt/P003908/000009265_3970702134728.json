(PJKA) in efforts to bring about measurable\n            and significant improvements in its traffic operations as\n            well as in mechanical and track maintenance over the next\n            four years.  At the same time, it aims to lay the groundwork\n            for a major reorientation of commercial, operational and\n            maintenance practices that should enable PJKA to become\n            financially viable over a seven- to eight-year period.  To\n            that end, the project entails four components.  First, the\n            project involves (a) technical assistance to PJKA in the\n            following areas:  a comprehensive management information\n            system, costing, procurement and inventory control, train\n            scheduling, and rationalization of mechanical and track\n            maintenance.  Further to this, it provides (b) training of\n            railway staff and (c) acquisition of equipment for handling\n            containers and intermodal traffic, a few pieces of\n            maintenance and miscellaneous equipment, and computer\n            hardware and software for a management information system.\n            Finally, the project includes (d) minor physical\n            improvements, such as paving of yards, to facilitate\n            container and intermodal traffic."}, "docdt": "1987-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
