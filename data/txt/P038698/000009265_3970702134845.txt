MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESDENT
OF TIIE INTRNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AND
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMET ASSOCIATION
TO TIlE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDiT TO SAINT LUCIA
FOR A BASIC EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Saint Lucia for the equivalent of US$3.364 million, and a proposed development credit for SDR 2.3
million, the equivalent of US$3.364 million, to help finance a Basic Education Reform Project to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of the education system, and enhance the equity of access to educatonal
opportunities. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15
years, including 5 years of grace. The credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35
years. Retactive fmancing of up to SDR450,000 (US$670,000 equivalent), or 10 percent of combined
IBRD and IDA project financing, would be provided to reimburse the Govermnent for eligible
expenditures incurred after November 3, 1994, to enable the Goverment to immediately commence
requisite steps to expedite the education reform process.
2.    Country/Sector Bakround. Saint Lucia, the most populous of the member countries of the
Organization of Eastern Carbbean States (OECS), has a current population of 156,000. In the 1980s,
real annasl growth of gross domestic product (GDP) averaged about 7 percent. Sound economic
management, including relatively high fisal savings, coupled with expansion of export markets for
traditional products, and success in the higbly competitive tourism industry, contributed to this strong
performance. Amid a rapidly changing exernal environment, however, GDP growth slowed to 4 percent
over the 1990-93 period. Social indicators reflect relatively high standards of living, and limited poverty.
Environmental awareness is high.
3.    Despite soumd economic management, its continued dependence on tourism and bananas, coupled
with vulnerability to naural hazards, renders the economy highly susceptible to external events. This
was most recendy evidenced by the September 1994 tropical storm "Debbie," which resuted in an
estmated banana income loss equivalent to 7 percent of GDP. Increased competition in bana exports
from Latin American producers under the new European Union banana regime and the implementation
of NAPrA, combined with reduced concessional aid flows, are likely to impact adversely on economic
prospects. The country faces a difficult period of economic transition.
4.    The recently prepared Medium Term Economic Strategy Paper and the National Environmental
Action Plan undersoDred the need for SL Lucia to reposition itself in the international economy. To this
end, the country recognizes that it must accelerate diversification while rapidly increasing the efficiency
of banana production. The success of its desired economic transition will depend in important part on
human resource development, thus ensuring a labor force well poised for an increasingly competitive
international economy. To secure the requisite modern labor force, standards of education and learming
must be raised significantly.
5.    Strong political commitment to education has been accompanied by sustained, relatively high
public investment levels and the highest proportion of recurrent budget allocated to education of any
OECS country (averaging 22 percet over the past five years). This has contributed to St. Lucia's
atinment of among the most advanced and innovative education systems in the subregion. Expansion
of coverage has been rapid, with almost universal access to primary education.



-5-
6.    Serious inequities exist in learning opportunities, however. Overcrowding is common in the
urbanized areas, particularly Castries, forcing delayed entry and adoption of double shift systems in select
primary schools, as well as maintenance of operations in often dilapidated, unhealthy and unsafe school
buildings. Notably, adequate primary school places exist virtually nationwide, were they well utilized.
Overcrowding reflects strong parental preference for Castries schools, where a large proportion of the
workforce is employed; and a serious shortage of secondary places, causing many over-age youth to have
to remain in primary schools to complete the compulsory, basic education cycle, encompassing students
from 5 to 15 years of age.
7.    Transition rates from primary to secondary education are among the lowest in the OECS,
reflecting serious constraints in the supplv of, but not the demand for, secondary places. Only about one
out of every two (54 percent) secondary school age youth, i.e., those 12-17, have access to bonafide
secondary education. The proposed project would add 1,675 secondary places, raising secondary school
coverage to 66 percent of the cohort. Even with project-supported investments, and other construction
planned in the Public Sector Investment Program, amid an estimated 18,000 secondary school age youth,
St. Lucia will not be able to attain its goal of universal access to secondary education until well into the
first decade of the next century, unless significant additional resources can be mobilized andlor efficiency
measures instituted to release resources for further expansion of places.
8.    Presently, secondary school places are severely rationed via a Common Entrance Examinadon
(CEE) administered to children around age 11, at the end of Grade 7. Given the high stakes, with only
one in two primary students gaining secondary school entry, succeeding in the CEE tends to become the
driving force of primary education, thereby distorting it from mastery of curricula toward exam-tested
areas. For the vast majority of students forced to remain in primary schools to complete the compulsory
cycle, this schooling reflects the terminal point in their formal education. Relatively few ultimtely attain
a "second chance" to enter secondary school via successful performance on the Common Middle School
Examination, administered at the end of senior primary school. The shortages of qualified teachers to
serve the all-age and senior primary schools, coupled with lower cumcular standards, suggest limited
value-added during the post-primary years, exacerbating problems of labor force absorption of these
students upon leaving school.
9.    The education sector faces several issues reting to the quality and efiwtiveness of teaching and
Iearning. Examinatons administered at the end of the prmary cycle (CEE), and lower secondary level
(Caribbean Examinations Council-CXC exam), suggest unacceptably low levels of student mastery of
curricula throughout the system. Test scores also indicate wide disparities in student performance across
schools and districts. Of increasing social concern are the significant gender differentials in student
achievement, with girls attaining higher scores than boys on the CEE, thus securing the predominant
share of secondary places, and a rapidly increasing share of tertiary education.
10.   Exisdng information suggests several key contibuting factors to low studentperformance in many
schools. These include: (a) quantiative and qualitative problems with regard to major education system
inputs, particularly the teaching cadre, educational equipment and supplies, and facilities; (b) inadequate
supervision of instructional delivery; (c) poor articulation of curricula within and between grades;
(d) distortion of the primary curriculum by the pressure of competition for secondary school places; and
(e) weak institutional capacity to plan, manage, or monitor performance of the education system
11.   With regard to efficiency, the relatively high teacher to student ratios of 1:27 at the primary level
and 1:17 at the secondary level reflect the absence of close monitoring of costs and efficiency, and lack



of detailed planning and programming of enrollments and recruitment and deployment of teachers. A
key underlying factor is the significant diversification of the curriculum in recent years, particularly at
the secondary level. Adjustment of and strict adherence to the reasonable Government prescribed ratios
of 1:35 at the primary level, and 1:20-25 at the secondary level, will be essential to ensure sufficient
resources are available to meet system-wide needs in management, equipment and supplies and
maintenance (presently significantly underfimanced), as well as recurrent costs to be generated in
improving the quality of primary, and expanding access to secondary education.
12.   From an equity standpoint, the poor face special geographic and economic constraints to access
to good quality education. The heavy urban, particularly Castries, concentration of secondary schools
limits their availability to poor, rural famities, who may not be able to afford relatively high transport
costs for their children to attend such schools when coupled with other considerable education-related
expenditures borne by the household Ci.e., textbooks, uniforms), although public education itself is free.
The poor CEE performance of many students in schools outside Castries also limits their access to
secondary education.
13.   National education policy, formally articulated in the 1992/93-1996197 Provisional Education
Plan, assigns highest priority to improving access to and the quality of basic, compulsory education,
encompassing the primary (Grades 1-7) through lower secondary (Forms 1-3) levels, consistent with the
OECS Education Reform Strategy. The Government has strongly reaffirmed its commiment to education
in recent budgetary speeches and policy pronouncements, underscoring the linkge between economic
diversification and growth objectives and human resource development, and the need to rapidly atain
universal access to secondary education. It recognizes that institutional and policy reforms will be
essential to achieve desired education sector improvements.
14.   With the share of public budget allocated to education unlikely to increase significandy over the
near term, the Government has emphasized the need to improve the efficiency of sector resource use.
High priority thus has been assigned to close monitoring of intra-sectoral recurrent budget allocations by:
(i) distinct levels of education; and Cii) the mix of salary and non-salary allocations. Salaries presently
consume, on average, over 90 percent of primary and secondary level outlays, thus severely
circumscribing funding for other key educational inputs, and ultimately limiting teacher effectiveness.
15.   Project Objectives.  The project has the overall objective of accelerating human resource
development to ensure that the requisite manpower exists to attain desired economic transition in St.
Lucia. It supports the first stage of a major reform of basic education, aimed at increasing the efficiency
and effectiveness of the education system, and at enhancing equity of access to educational opportmnities.
To these ends, a dual strategy will be pursued: Qi) strengthening the planning and institutional capacity
of the MOE to guide and carry out the long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to initiate
significant, urgent measures to address system-wide qualitative problems and expansion needs at the
secondary level; and (ii) catalyzing a major adjustment process, focused on revision to more reasonable
levels of primary and secondary teacher to student ratios. Such adjustment is critical to ensure that
already high levels of resource allocations to public education better respond to current and projected
needs. It also is crucial to ensure that sufficient resources are avaiable to support initiatives being
launched under the Basic Education Reform Project, and hence that these reforms are sustainable.
16.   Project Description. The project comprises three major components. A Sector Planing and
InsntutionalStrengthening Component (US$0.9 million equivalent, or 8 percent of total base costs) would
reorganize, upgrade staff, and create better linkages between key MOE operating units; reifrce sector



-7-
planning and analysis capacity and formulate a long-term sector development plan; initiate development
of an integrated education data system comprising student, school, financial and personnel information
to facilitate improved sector analysis, administration and management, and policy making; establish a
permanent project development and management capacity within the MOE; and finance special studies
critical to guide future policy and program development. A Qualitative Improvewment of Basic Education
Component (US$2.8 million equivalent, or 25 percent of total base costs), would enhance the quality of
teaching and learning through: upgrading basic teacher training and revising and intensifying in-sevice
training for all teachers (with special atention to science, mathematics, and language arts) and
concurrently ensuring their more appropriate utilization and job satisfaction through improved personnel
supervision, management and career development; formulating and adopting improved curricula
(especially in core subjects); establishing an educational testing and measurement capacity to monitor
student and system performance; and identifying and instituting more cost-effective methods of setection,
production, procurement and distribution of educational materias. An Ension of Access to Schoos
Component (US$7.5 million equivalent, or 67 percent of total base costs), would increase secondary
places in the most underserved districts, and replace and increase places at the secondary school destroyed
by the recent tropical storm, all of which investments also will significantly reduce overcrowding and
improve educational opportunities at the primary level; and would provide fimding for urgently needed
rehabilitation of selected primary school facilities.
17.  ]Project Implenentation. The project would be executed by the Ministry of Education, Culture
and Labor (MOE). W"ithin the MOE, the Govement would establish an Educational Planning and
Development Office, to include a Project Management Unit (PMU) to oversee project implementaion
The Bank and IDA would permit a portion of proposed retroactive fiancing to be utilized for meeting
PMU establishment and operaionalization needs. All entities involved in project execution would be
guided by a Project Implementation Manal. A Project Advisory Committee would be established, with
representation from the MOE and the Ministries of Finance, Planning, and Training, to provide advice
and counsel over the project implementation period.
18.   Project Sutainability. The proposed project enjoys broad political support, with planned
qualitative improvements and expansion of access to secondary education widely viewed as essential to
achieve desired economic growth and social development objectives. Requisite Goverment financing
for the project, including its contribution of US$2.3 million equivalent (net of taxes), can be easily met,
as it represents less than 0.5 percent of GDP; and the projected annual incremental recurrent costs of
US$2.4 million equivalent in current prices, to generated by the end of project implementation, are 0.4
percent of GDP. Incremental recurrent costs associated with various qualitative improvts and
additional positions to be created to strengthen educational administration and related overheads are
expected to be offset by the projected savings from the downward adjustents in the teacher to sudent
ratios planned for the 1995-1999 period. The design of the tedhnical assistance program seeks to
maximize development of local expertise and capacity, with complementary expert services and
fellowships, to help sustain project benefits well into the fiture.
19.   Lessons Iearned. An Implementtion Completion Report (ICR) is being prepared for the
recently completed OECS Regional Vocational and Technial Education Project (Credit 1785-CRG).
Reviewi of this OECS project, as well as of other Caribbean education projects, reveals that it is essential
to: (a) link project objectives to the broader sector and macro policy objectives; (1) carefilly evaluate
local procurement and project implementation capacities; (c) ensure annually that Govrnment budgets
provide the requisite project financing to sustain pmject activities and complete the project on schedule;
(d) involve all major stakeholders in an education reform process from the early stages of project design;



-8-
and (e) ensure that the policy environment within which the project will operate is supportive of project
objectives and facilitates the conduct of the needed systemic and institutional reforms.
20.   These lessons are taken into account in the proposed project design. The project objectives are
drawn from the St. Lucia Education Plan, reconunendations of the OECS Education Reform Strategy
paper, endorsed by all OECS member governments, and the Bank's report "Access, Quality and
Efficiency in Caribbean Education: A Regional Study." Extensive preparatory work has been undertaken
with a Japanese Grant to evaluate institutional capacities, and identify sector development constraints to
ensure adoption of the most cost-effctive approaches to achieving desired education system
improvements. As civil works represent 56 percent of total project cost, attention was given in the
preparatory phase to development of prototype designs and preliminary drawings which take into account
local building standards and experiences and environmental (mcluding climatic) and other factors. The
selection and methods for procurement of educational equipment and furniture have been carefully
assessed to ensure that detailed tedhnical specifications are developed with participation of end users, high
quality-low cost sources are identified and tapped, and comprehensive plans exist for operationalizing and
pilot testing new equipment, and training teachers in their appropriate use.
21.   Rationale for IBRD and IDA Involvement. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for St.
Lucia, under preparation as part of a Bank regional OECS assistance strategy, seeks to support the
Government program of economic transition, with special attention to: (i) acceleration of private sector-
led economic diversification into tourism and export services, with JDF grants moblized to evaluate the
potential for informatics and other export services; (ii) restructuring of the public sector to ensure
sustained adequate levels of public savings, while promoting greater regional collaboration; dii) human
resource development and poverty alleviation; and (iv) natural resource management. To these ends, the
Bank is pursuing a three-pronged approach in Saint Lucia, as elsewhere in the sub-region. First, through
ESW, it is providing intellectual leadership, in collaboration with the IMF and CDB, to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the country to identify priority policies and programs and effectively implement
them. Second, the Bankc is strengthening CIDB capacity in human resource development and
environmental management, so that in fill partnership with the Bank, it increasingly can undertake ESW
and lending in these key development areas. Third, the Bank is proactive in donor coordination,
including mobilizing the scarce etrnal financing available to OECS countries, the main forum for which
coordination will continue to be the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development
(CGCED).
22.   The proposed project supports filly the CAS, targeting the priority area of human resource
development, catalyzing an education sector adjustment process to improve efficiency of public resource
use, providing a model for education sector reform to promote greater regional collaboration, and
working closely from project preparation through planned iplementation and superision with the CDB,
which is co-financier. Notably, the project represents the first, pilot phase in a longer term program of
assistance to the OECS countries to meet their human resource development needsg By initiating an
education reform process in one of the most advanced, innovative education systems in the region, a
number of cost-effective approaches to education sector problems common throughout the OECS can be
launched, with a view toward their replication, as appropriate, in a subsequent project to encompass the
other four active Bank member countries in the OECS-Dominica, Grenada, St. Wmcent and the
Grenadines, and St. Kitts and Nevis.
23.   Agreed Actiwos. At negotiaions, the Government and IBRD and IDA reached agreement on the
content of the Education Strat   Letter descnbing its education sector reform strategy, and the priority



-9-
actions it will take to effect such reform, with special attention to the compulsory, basic education cycle.
It was agreed that the final Letter will include a schedule delineating annual targets for adjusting the
teacher to students ratios over the project implementation period. The Government also reached final
agreement wit IBRD and IDA on: (a) the content of the Project Implementation Manual (PIM), to
include agreed project monitoring and evaluation indicators and targets; and (b) targeted completion dates
for planning and policy-related studies to be carried out over the first two years of project
implementation.
24.   At negotiations, Government assurances were also obtained that it would comply fully with
standard Bank procedures relating to implementation of the project. The Government fiurther provided
assurances tat: (a) not later than March 31, 1996, it would have established, and subsequently would
maintain within the MOE, an ETX Unit; (b) it would allocate in 'St. Lucia's Annual Estimates of
Expenditure" for the years 1995 through 1999, the total respective amounts required for project financing
to support project implementation; (c) it shall cause SALCC to appoint candidates for project-financed
fellowships; and (d) it would seek IBRD and IDA agreement on all proposed fellowship candidates and
training institutions.
25.   As conditions of Lown and Credit Effectiveness, the Govermment will have: (a) presented to the
Bank and Association the signed Education Strategy Letter; (b) opened and deposited requisite funding
into a Project Account; and (c) ensured that a Project Implementation Manual, satisfactory to IBRD and
IDA, had been issued, and become effective.
26.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project does not represent enviromnental risks. It has
been assigned a "C" enviromnental classification.
27.   Progiram Objective Categories. This project consists of activities included in the categories of
economic management, and poverty reduction and human resource development
28.   Participatory Approach. Project preparation was coordinated by the Government and carried
out by multidiscipinary teams comprising international consultants and consulting firms, local consultants
and local counterparts. The preparatory phase included wide consultation with all major public and
private entities involved in the sector, including but not limited to teachers, principals, the teacher's
union, Ministry personnel, students and parents. The interactive process adopted provided a valuable
vehicle for broad discussion of investment and policy and institutional reform requirements.
29.   Project Benefits. The proposed project would significantly increase educational opportnties,
particularly for youth from the more remote areas. An additional 1,675 children, or 9 percent of the
secondary school age cohort, will have access to secondary eduzation via project-financed civil works.
Major improvements are expected in education provided throughout the compulsory cycle and, hence,
in student achievement and employment potential, from the considerable investments targeted toward
enhancing quantitatively and qualitatively the major educational inputs, i.e., trained teachers, curricula,
educational materials, testing and measurement, and school plant. An improved quality of primary
education is expected to help ensure that many more students will be prepared to benefit fully from
secondary education, as access to it increases. The project also should contribute significandy to building
institutional capacity, particularly at the MOE central Headquarters, district and school levels. It
promotes increased collaboration between key public and private sector entities involved in the education
sector at the national and regional level; and provides a model for initiating education sector refDrm,
consistent with die OECS Education Reform Strateg, for other OECS countries embarldng on this



-10-
process. Project support to such discrete areas as achievement testing, integrated education data systems,
and expansion and upgrading of educational materials production, will create a basis for OECS regional
collaboration, given common interest in these initiatives.
30.   Risks. The principal risks associated with the project relate to: (i) inadequate institutional
capacity to carry out the education reform process, including possible failure to augment the MOE with
requisite additional qualified staff; (i) unavailability of sufficient Government financing to sustain
reforms; (iii) failure to adjust and/or to closely monitor compliance with adjusted teacher to student ratios
in primary and secondary schools; (iv) reluctance to adopt regional, collaborative approaches, given their
inherent delays, even when these may represent the most efficient and effective long-term approaches;
and (v) PMU problems in meeting the administrative demands presented by heavy front loading of
implementation over te first two years, given limited Bank project execution experience. To mitigate
against potential institutional failures, strong emphasis is placed on sector planning and institutional
strengthening, including extensive staff upgrading, and Government assurances that the MOE personnel
complement will be expanded to ensure expertise exists to fulfill its broad education sector development
mandate. Given vulnerabilities of this small economy to external factors and shocks, Government project
financing has been kept within easily met ranges at present and projected GDP, and has been concentrated
on local cost-intensive investments. Incremental recurrent costs, often hampering achievement of
education sector reforms, will be partially offset by resources to be released from adjusting teacher to
student ratios over the project implementation period, presentation of a schedule for which is a condition
of Loan and Credit Effectiveness.
31.   To actively promote inter-country collaboration, high priority has been, and will continue to be,
assigned to pooling technical expertise, encouraging use of Caribbean expertise, sharing of experiences
and developing regional ii.erventions, where appropriate and feasible. Experience gained in preparing
and launching this project will help other OECS Govermments. Several measures are being taken to
facilitate smooth, timely project implementation, amid front loading of investments, including: (a)
advancing crucial start-up activities, e.g., architectural designs and equipment and firniture specification
lists, to be carried out befbre Effectiveness; (b) training of PMU staff in key management areas prior to
project commencement; and (c) provision of 8 months of Project Management expert services to support
the PMU over the initial months of project execution.
32.   Recommendation: I am satisfied that the proposed IBRD Loan and IDA Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and of the
International Development Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve them.
