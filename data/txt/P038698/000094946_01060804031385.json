Lessons\n            learned from this project include: It is important that all\n            persons who are expected to implement the project\n            participate in the analysis of issues and the design of the\n            project. Design of schools should be based on the actual\n            building sites selected, and functions must be discussed\n            with end users to ensure that the curricula can be\n            effectively delivered, and cost estimates are realistic.\n            Projects with a heavy organizational change component should\n            include a communication and change management strategy so\n            that all stakeholders are fully aware of the objectives,\n            strategies, and implications. Objectives such as gender\n            equity and poverty reduction require specific measures to\n            ensure their realization. Unit involved in project\n            implementation should be staffed with trained personnel\n            throughout the life of the project, particularly in critical\n            areas such as procurement. Management of the implementing\n            agency and Project Advisory Committees must provide the\n            necessary direction and support to ensure the success of the\n            project. Attention must be given to ensuring that studies,\n            formulation of policies, systems for monitoring efficiency\n            and effectiveness are implemented in a timely manner.\n            Fellows must be selected carefully and arrangements made for\n            trained personnel to be deployed appropriately to allow for\n            transfer of knowledge and application of skills."}, "docdt": "2001-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
