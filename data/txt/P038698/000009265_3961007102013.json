requisite manpower exists to attain the\n            desired economic transition in Saint Lucia. It supports the\n            first stage of a major reform of basic education, aimed at\n            increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the education\n            system, and at enhancing equity of access to educational\n            opportunities. To these ends, a dual strategy will be\n            pursued. The first part seeks to strengthen the planning and\n            institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education to guide\n            and carry out the long-term development of the sector, while\n            enabling it to initiate significant, urgent measures to\n            address system-wide qualitative problems and expansion needs\n            at the secondary level. As a second, integral part of the\n            strategy, the project catalyzes a major adjustment process,\n            focused on revision to more reasonable levels of primary and\n            secondary teacher to student ratios, in line with ratios of\n            countries at similar levels of economic and social\n            development. Such adjustment is critical to ensure that\n            already relatively high levels of resource allocations to\n            public education better respond to current and projected\n            needs, including increased financing for system management\n            and educational equipment and supplies, and school\n            facilities and equipment maintenance - all of which are\n            areas presently significantly underfinanced."}, "docdt": "1994-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
