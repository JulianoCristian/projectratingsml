1 It is important to highlight that the results framework developed for the Environment DPL
Program, during the preparation of the First Programmatic Environment SAL, did not formally
define baseline or target values for the Program's outcome indicators. As such, targets were
assessed on an operation per operation basis and achievements in meeting these indicators were
reviewed at the close of each operation. In addition, the results framework indicators--a subset of
the Government's indicators for their 2001-2006 Environment and Natural Resource Program--
were expected to be achieved at the end of a Program comprising a series of three operations
(EnvSAL I, EnvDPL II, and EnvDPL III). The EnvSAL I Program was completed in December
2003 and the EnvDPL II was completed in January 2006. However, preparation of the EnvDPL
III was delayed as a result of the political transition that took place in 2006. Since the EnvDPL III
was not prepared within a two-year timeframe, starting from the Board date of the EnvDPL II, it
is currently being prepared as a self-standing operation in accordance with Bank procedures (i.e.,
it will not be considered part of the EnvDPL series). As a result, this report examines results
achieved under the first two operations.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.A Sector Background at Appraisal
At the outset of the Environment DPL Program (designed as a series of three
operations--Environment SAL I, Environment DPL II, and Environment DPL III),
Mexico faced tremendous pressures on its natural environment, reflecting decades of
rapid industrialization and fast expansion of the agriculture, livestock, and transport
sectors, with relatively little regard for environmental consequences. Severe degradation
had taken place in a number of sectors. For example, over 50 percent of Mexico's
groundwater supply was extracted from approximately 100 overdrawn aquifers; public
health hazards were widespread, with about 70% of wastewater untreated, only about
one-third of solid and hazardous waste disposed of under sanitary conditions, and
concentrations of atmospheric contaminants frequently exceeding air quality standards in
urban areas; deforestation rates were among the highest in Latin America ­ about 60,000
hectares annually ­ increasing vulnerability to (already frequent) natural disasters; and
marine and insular ecosystem and coastal zones were threatened by accelerating tourism
and urban growth. The loss of social welfare associated with these factors was estimated
at 10 percent of GDP, while expenditure in environmental protection averaged around 0.5
percent of GDP.3 This loss in welfare is significant both in absolute macroeconomic
terms and in comparison with other OECD countries.

The Government of Mexico (GOM) was well aware of the challenges that it faced on the
environment front as well as the implications of inaction in environment on the economy
as a whole. In response to these challenges, the Government formulated its medium-term
strategy for sustainable development, "Environment and Natural Resources Program
2001-2006," with the following underlying pillars: integration, commitment at the level
of the Federal Government, decentralization and sharing of responsibilities for
environmental management, valuation of natural resources, improved enforcement, social
participation, and transparency. To support this program, the Government included the
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in all three Cabinet-level Commissions
that attended to national priorities: Growth with Quality, Human and Social Development,
and Order and Respect.

The GOM sought support from the Bank for a subset of its overall sustainable
development program, as indicated in the schematic diagram below (Figure 1). This
subset was comprised of two major areas: (i) the mainstreaming of environment in at
least four key sectors, namely water, energy, tourism, and forestry; and (ii) the
improvement of environmental management processes, particularly with an emphasis on
decentralization of federal environmental functions to States. These areas were identified

as priorities based on several criteria, including the urgency of the issue given its linkage
with growth and investment; the level of degradation; the likely impact on poverty
alleviation; and opportunity for progress, based on cross-sectoral consensus.




1.1.B Macroeconomic Context at Appraisal
During the preparation of the Environment DPL Program, economic activity in Mexico
experienced a sharp slowdown as the downturn in the global economy, and in particular
in the U.S. economy, spread across emerging markets. Growth of Mexican manufactured
exports, nine tenths of which go to the United States, plummeted from an average annual
growth rate of 20 percent to minus 3 percent in 2001. Such a pronounced drop in external
demand and the related slump in manufacturing investment led to a contraction of real
GDP growth during 2001, down to -0.3 percent, in contrast to the 5.6 percent average
annual growth rate observed over the preceding five-year period.

Even during the contraction, the economy proved resilient in many ways--thanks in part
to sound macroeconomic management. Whereas during the rapid economic expansion of
2000 there was a relatively expansionary fiscal stance and a tight monetary policy, the
new authorities during 2001 targeted a lower budget deficit (0.65 percent of GDP), and
implemented budget rules automatically cutting expenditures when revenues turned out
lower than budgeted. Monetary policy was eased, although cautiously, in the face of
strong capital inflows, weakening domestic demand, and lower inflation expectations.
Cautious monetary management, the appreciation of the currency (due to the strength of
capital inflows), and the slowdown in growth, all combined to keep inflation in check--
the 2001 year-end inflation rate fell to 4.4 percent, well below the initial target of 6.5
percent.

                                              2

Fiscal discipline was a key priority for the administration. As part of that discipline, the
government proceeded with the publication of a broadened fiscal deficit measure, known
as the Public Sector Borrowing Requirements (PBSR), which was projected at 4 percent
of GDP for 2002 (in contrast to the budget deficit target in its traditional definition at
0.65 percent of GDP). The shift of attention to the PBSR was part of the motivation
behind new tax legislation enacted in December 2001 that was expected to increase tax
revenue by 1.2 percent of GDP in 2002.
The Mexican economy was expected to recover over the next few years from its shallow
recession toward the economy's medium-term potential annual rate of growth of about 4-
5 percent. Even though the recovery of demand for Mexican manufactured exports was
expected to be the initial driver of the economic expansion, the strong rebound expected
during the second half of 2002 was projected to be broad-based. This growth pattern was
expected to lead to an increase in the country's balance of payments' current account
deficit from 2.8 percent of GDP to about 4 percent of GDP by 2004 and stabilize at that
level thereafter. Foreign direct investment flows continued to finance the bulk of the
country's external deficit.

It was determined that additional progress on the country's structural reform agenda was
needed in order to attain the projected level of growth and raise the country's medium-
term economic growth potential further, without the creation of undue fiscal, external
finance or environmental imbalances. Mexico's environmental degradation had become
one of the binding constraints to its external competitiveness, and to its ability to access
new markets, attract foreign investments, and further develop its tourism industry. The
government had therefore launched a multiphased program in the environmental area, to
contribute to its overall structural reform agenda. The loan for the Environment SAL
operation aimed to assist the government in making progress on the implementation of
this reform agenda and provided the public sector with resources to meet part of its
external finance requirements, thereby also indirectly facilitating the adequate access of
the private sector to domestic and foreign credit to finance its investments needed for
growth in a new policy framework that provided more protections for the environment.

1.1.C Rationale for Bank Assistance
The broad objectives of the government's program were consistent with the Bank's
commitment to support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
particularly goal number seven, by helping integrate environment into decision making
and planning, and addressing environmental degradation in key areas such as water,
forests, energy, and tourism development.

In addition, the EnvDPL Program's focus on addressing key cross-sectoral priorities,
emphasizing strategic environmental assessments to influence planning decisions and
policies, and supporting environmental institutional development and reform was fully
consistent with the Bank's Environment Strategy. The lending instrument was also
appropriate given the country context, in which Mexico was undergoing broad structural
reforms, including in the environment sector.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The objectives of the Environment DPL Program aimed to support the GOM's
sustainable development program by: (i) mainstreaming environmental concerns in key
development agendas of four sectors (Tourism, Energy, Forestry and Water) as
prioritized by the Government of Mexico; and (ii) improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of local environmental management processes in Mexico. This support was
expected to be provided via three, quick-disbursing loans.

The first loan (the Programmatic Environment Structural Adjustment Loan ­ ENVSAL I),
completed in FY2004, supported achievements toward objective (i), by (a) establishing
high-level interinstitutional coordination mechanisms between energy, forestry, water,
tourism and environment sectors; and (b) supporting the design and implementation of
fiscal instruments to promote the payment of municipal water fees and investment in
municipal hydraulic works and for revenue generation from the use of national marine
protected areas and corresponding reinvestment in the environmental management of
these areas. With respect to objective (ii), the loan supported: (a) the creation of an
enabling environment to decentralize federal environmental functions to the State level
via changes to key laws; (b) the preparation and implementation of a stepwise
decentralization strategy that included the use of third-party certification to ensure that
the quality of decentralized processes is maintained; (c) the preparation and publication
of decentralization plans on the part of at least 20 states; (d) the assignment of budget and
targeted use of the PDIA (federal grant program) to finance capacity building in States
with plans to assume new environmental management functions; and (e) the development
and implementation of a strategy to improve public access to information on
environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and permit applications based on the passage
of a national law on the transparency of information.

Building on the achievements of the ENVSAL I, the second loan (the Programmatic
Environment Development Policy Loan II ­ ENVDPL II), completed in FY2006,
supported objective (i), through the: (a) establishment and implementation of a set of
indicators and benchmarks of good environmental performance of tourist facilities and
destinations; (b) design of a national fund for renewable energy, approved by the
Secretariat of Energy (SENER); (c) establishment and start of operation of a Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) Office, involving SENER and the Environment and
Natural Resources Secretariat (SEMARNAT), according to rules set up at the Marrakech
and Bonn Conferences of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC); (d) publication of water availability data and an improved
water rights registry as foundational steps in the implementation of a functioning water
rights market, consistent with the current regulatory framework. In addition, this second
loan supported the attainment of objective (ii), by initiating decentralization efforts (as
evidenced by signature of a convenio, capacity building, or joint operation) in over 10
States, including the decentralization of permit issuance functions for sustainable wildlife
use in three states, for sustainable use of forest resources in one state, and the
decentralization of environmental licenses for industrial discharges and emissions
(Licencia Ambiental Unica) in two states.

Although completion of EnvDPL III was expected in FY2008, the preparation of this
third loan was delayed due to the political transition that took place in 2006. In mid
CY2007, the new administration requested the Bank's support in preparing a third
operation that would continue to support the GOM's sustainable development program.
Given that over two years have lapsed between the approval of EnvDPL II and the
expected approval of EnvDPL III, this third loan will be processed as a self-standing
operation in accordance with Bank procedures.

Achievement of the EnvDPL Program's objectives was to be assessed via the monitoring
of the following key outcome indicators, expected to be completed at the close of the
third operation (EnvDPL III):

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
The Environment DPL Program supported reforms under two strategic pillars:

         1. Mainstreaming of environmental concerns in sectoral development agendas
         2. Improving the effectiveness of environmental management processes

                                                      5

Criteria jointly defined with the GOM for the selection of sectors to be supported under
the first pillar included (i) the urgency of the issue based on its linkage with growth and
investment, either in terms of potential impact or as a growth constraint, as is clearly the
case for water; (ii) urgency of the issue based on the level of degradation; (iii) linkage
with poverty alleviation, particularly in cases where the natural resource is essential to
sustainable livelihoods, such as in the forestry sector; (iv) opportunity based on cross-
sectoral consensus; and (v) financial constraints and the need to use limited financial
resources to achieve as great an impact as possible. Based on these criteria, the key
sectors identified for support included water, energy, forestry, and tourism.

Water, given its close links to industrial and agricultural growth as well as social
development, was identified as possibly Mexico's most urgent environmental problem.
Pressure on Mexico's water resources had grown tremendously over the past decades,
reflecting rapid population growth from 25 million people in 1950 to over 100 million in
2002. Moreover, the availability of water is inversely related to the demand for it. While
population growth had occurred nationwide, it had been markedly greater in the semi-arid
and arid, industrialized north, northwest, and central regions, which have been
experiencing major water shortages with severe consequences for further development.
These areas accounted for 85 percent of GDP, 77 percent of the population, and 92
percent of the irrigated areas, but this same region had only 32 percent of the runoff. At
appraisal, 104 of Mexico's 653 aquifers were overdrawn and these accounted for over 50
percent of the country's groundwater supply. Contamination of both surface and
groundwater was also a major issue, as about 70 percent of collected wastewater
remained untreated.

Water issues cut across a number of sectors. From the perspective of quantity, the
agriculture sector has accounted for about 77 percent of water consumption, and industry,
municipalities, and rural domestic use has accounted for the remaining 23 percent. On the
other hand, water quality is affected by water discharges from municipalities, industry
and the tourism sector, as well as diffuse pollution from agriculture and livestock
production. In particular, for the case of water scarcity, priority issues that have needed to
be addressed include (i) overexploitation of surface and ground water, (ii) use of scarce
water resources for low value crops, (iii) lack of a strategy consensus between key
stakeholders, (iv) inadequate water rights administration, and (v) high subsidies and
inappropriate pricing (for example, water fees are applied mainly to industry and to a
lesser degree to municipalities, and farmers are exempt; further the agricultural electricity
subsidy (Tarifa 09) provides a strong disincentive to conserve water in irrigation, which
is by far the largest water user).

Energy was identified as an important pillar of economic growth, with the sector
accounting for 3 percent of GDP, 8 percent of all exports, 37 percent of fiscal revenues,
and close to 60 percent of public investment.4 The country's abundant reserves of fossil
fuels had played a key role in meeting Mexico's growing energy demand over the last

decade. However, Mexico had an energy intensity (total primary energy supply/GDP) of
0.42, which was well above the 0.29 and 0.19 averages for Latin American and OECD
countries, respectively, indicating relatively lower efficiency in energy use.

The environmental impacts of energy sector activities, especially those impacts
associated with energy consumption, were expected to increase at the outset of the
EnvDPL Program with the country's continued economic growth. Analytical work
conducted by the Bank found that Mexico's GDP growth rates would be the largest
determinant of air pollution in the coming decade,           5 with ambient air pollution
concentrations in the country's largest cities often exceeding national environmental
standards due in part to poor fuel quality. Further, activities in the energy sector from oil
and electricity producing facilities generated significant amounts of air emissions,
wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes, and other precursors of
environmental degradation. In 2000, SEMARNAT identified oil as one of the two
subsectors that generated the largest costs in terms of environmental degradation and
depletion of natural capital.

The GOM was aware of these challenges and the energy sector's mission statement noted
that one of its main goals was to increase its contribution to the country's economic and
social development, through world class energy companies, operating within an
appropriate legal and regulatory framework, and sufficient supply capacity, quality
standards, and competitive prices with full respect for the environment. The sector aimed
to encourage the efficient use of energy and the use of alternative and renewable sources.

Mexico's commercial use of forests accounted for approximately 1% of GDP and over
100,000 permanent jobs. These forests were home to over 10 million citizens most of
whom were disproportionately poor relative to national averages. In addition to the
benefits of jobs and the many commodities produced by Mexico's forests, there had been
growing recognition of the critical role of these forests in sustaining local livelihoods,
enabling a growing and strong tourism market, and protecting the nation's critical water
supplies. Of Mexico's 197 million hectares, 72 percent was under some form of forest or
natural vegetation. Temperate forests comprised 29 million hectares, and intact tropical
forests another 20 million hectares, with 34 million hectares capable of permanently
sustained timber production. However, a significant percentage of these forests were
degraded. Deforestation continued in the order of 600,000 hectares of standing forest lost
per year. In addition, 70 percent or more of forest area was within the boundaries of
social units, 7,000 to 9,000 ejidos or indigenous communities that own the forested land
of which 65 percent may have commercial potential. The sector challenges identified by
the GOM included curbing the high rate of illegal logging due to an inappropriate
regulatory framework and lack of enforcement; ensuring that livelihoods of natural
resources owners, particularly those in poorer communities, were improved through

Tourism was the third largest contributor to Mexico's GDP (after manufacturing and oil),
a major employer, and a potentially sustainable source of present and future economic
benefits. Tourism was also identified as a unique business since it relied heavily on the
national patrimony of the country--its physical environment and its cultural
environment--to attract visitors. As such, the GOM aimed that tourism be viewed as an
important industry that can produce important economic benefits, and an industry that
also requires management and investment to be sustainable. It recognized its challenge as
how to address environmental problems associated with the existing tourism industry and
to minimize environmental damage from future growth--each of which pose different
problems.

Improving the effectiveness of environmental management processes was one of the
GOM's main priorities within the 2001-2006 Environment and Natural Resources
Program. Although the GOM was continuing to decentralize environmental management
functions to the States, its strategy to carry out this decentralization had changed
considerably. Based on feedback from the states themselves on their own desire and
capabilities to assume these functions, the GOM now emphasized a slower, stepwise
decentralization of functions, with an emphasis on ensuring uniformity of institutional
capacity, processes, and standards across states. Functions identified that States could opt
to assume in their decentralization plans included issuance of permits and licenses and
the overall environmental management of resources currently under federal jurisdiction
(selected toxic wastes, selected environmental impact assessment administration,
conservation of soils, flora, fauna, and forest resources, and coastal management).

To improve environmental management processes, the GOM had also prioritized
improved social participation and transparency. The government aimed to implement and
maintain websites at the federal level and in selected states that allowed access to
information on EIA and licensing processes and to promote increased public participation
in the EIA process. It also intended to publish an Annual Report on the Environment.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
The policy areas remained unchanged during the preparation of the Environment DPL II.
The government has requested the Bank's assistance in preparing a follow-on operation
that continues to support (i) mainstreaming of environmental concerns in the
development agenda of key sectors (tourism, energy, water, and forestry) and (ii)
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local environmental management processes.
Given that more than two years have transpired between Board approval of the
Environment DPL II and the expected Board approval of the Environment DPL III, the
DPL program was considered by the Bank to have lapsed. As such, this third operation is
being prepared and will be presented as a self-standing operation (outside the
programmatic Environment DPL series). This loan is expected to be presented to the
Board for approval in FY09.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

2.2.A Strong Government Commitment
The success of this demand driven series of programmatic lending is due to the strong
ownership of the GOM to the Program. Both the Finance Secretariat (SHCP) and
SEMARNAT have provided stable leadership and oversight from the outset and ensured
the active participation of the sectoral line ministries and agencies involved in the
Program.

In spite of these successes, the EnvSAL I experienced a number of delays affecting both
loan effectiveness and the interinstitutional coordination required by the Program. The
effectiveness of the EnvSAL I was delayed given GOM's decision to sign a contract for
the loan directly with the Bank, i.e., without the National Bank of Public Works and
Services (BANOBRAS) as borrower. This was the first loan in which disbursements
were transferred directly to the Mexican government rather than a BANOBRAS account.
Consequently, a new template for the contract, Contrato de Mandato y Ejecución
between the United Mexican States, SEMARNAT and BANOBRAS, had to be
developed to reflect the new role of BANOBRAS as financial intermediary.

2.2.B Initial Delays in establishing Participatory Processes
Interinstitutional coordination, a valuable and essential element of the Environment DPL
Program, was also a source of delay during the implementation of the EnvSAL I as
institutions went through a process of learning how best to coordinate for the Program
and how to fully benefit from the process of coordination. This, together with scarce
human and financial resources, in a budget-constrained environment, assigned to the
adequate functioning of the Intersectoral Technical Working Groups (ITWGs), as well as
changes in ITWG participants resulted in delays in the initial adequate functioning of the
ITWGs. In addition, once the ITWGs were established for the four sectors, there was a
delay in getting high-level staff to participate in meetings with each of the four groups, as
required in the loan conditionality. Some of the actual procedures established by the legal
agreement that required high level participation were also considered excessively
cumbersome by the GOM during implementation, and the transaction cost of complying
with this condition was high. The process of interinstitutional coordination and the
extensive nature and content of the discussion involved required more time than initially
envisaged and led to an extension of the closing date of ENVSAL I from October 31 to
December 31, 2003.

2.2.C Lessons learned from Interinstitutional Coordination incorporated into design of
EnvDPL II
In order to overcome the delays encountered in establishing, as well as the benefits
derived from ITWGs during the EnvSAL I, the EnvDPL II incorporated various learning
mechanisms in which lessons learned were captured and fed back into the participatory
process in order to promote continuous improvements and a stable learning process for
the operation. These mechanisms continue to function to provide opportunities for social
learning in a cross-sectoral setting. In the energy sector, this learning process was
institutionalized with the creation of the Intersectoral Committee for Projects for
Emissions Reductions and Capture of Greenhouse Gases. This committee is comprised of


                                              11

representatives from the environment, energy, economics, agriculture, rural development,
fishery, communication, and transport sectors, and aims to facilitate, promote, and
evaluate projects supporting emissions reductions and greenhouse gas capture. In the
tourism sector, intersectoral coordination and environmental mainstreaming have been
consolidated through such mechanisms as the Intersectoral Commission on Tourism
established in September 2004.

2.2.D Sound Analytical Work to Support Program
The policy reforms undertaken by the GOM in support of the Program were founded on
sound and rigorous analyses conducted by federal agencies, the Bank, the Organisation
for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), and the United Nations'
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). This work
includes the Bank's Public Expenditure Review and the Bank's assessment of poverty
conditions in Mexico (Poverty in Mexico: an Assessment of Conditions, Trends, and
Government Strategy). Analytical work carried out by the GOM and other development
partners, such as ECLAC in 2002 and the OECD in 2003, provided a solid foundation for
the Program. The ECLAC report identified environmental problems and their causes in
Mexico. These problems included inadequate water quantity and quality, overexploitation
of natural resources, habitat change, and air pollution.

In addition, the Second Environmental Performance Review of Mexico carried out by the
OECD provided an independent assessment of the country's environmental challenges,
which corresponded with those identified jointly by the GOM and the Bank. The report
identified seven priority environment issues: (i) water and forestry management, (ii)
integrated management of natural resources, (iii) environmental management and
environmental planning at the watershed level, (iv) decentralization of environmental
management and decisionmaking, (v) increased public participation and the right of
access to environmental information, (vi) ensuring that users of natural resources pay for
the environmental cost of resource use, and (vii) strengthening of environmental
legislation, inspection, and compliance rates. In order to address the identified challenges,
the review recommended that the GOM further integrate environmental concerns into
economic and social decisions. This recommendation, as well as the identified
environmental priorities, were fully consistent with the objectives of the EnvDPL
Program.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a) M&E Design: A set of outcome indicators for measuring progress of the Program as
whole were defined during the preparation of the Environment DPL Program. These
indicators--a subset of the Government's indicators for their 2001-2006 Environment and
Natural Resource Program ­were selected in agreement with Government counterparts.
SEMARNAT, the primary counterpart agency for the two programmatic loans, was in
charge of overall M&E for the loan and for collecting the appropriate data to follow the
indicators, with each of the sectoral ministries and agencies involved in the operation
(SHCP, SENER, SECTUR, CONAFOR, and CONAGUA) responsible for reporting
progress on each of the Program's components. Although sufficient oversight was
provided by the GOM, the monitoring and evaluation framework developed during the


                                             12

DPL Program's preparation included a large number of outcome indicators (26 in total to
be achieved upon concluding the planned series of three operations) and did not formally
define baseline or target values for these indicators at the outset of the Program, making
the oversight process more difficult to manage. Further, some of the Program's outcome
indicators (in particular, better alignment of water fees with their economic value) were
ambitious in terms of the achievements that could realistically be expected at the close of
the Program.

(b) M&E Implementation and Utilization: Data availability for most indicators was
sufficient and timely during the supervision of both loans. An in-depth follow-up of the
EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II's progress took place in workshops at the close of each
operation, in which key government stakeholders and the Bank Task Team assessed the
status of the operation's outcome indicators as well as the target values for the next
operation. These workshops provided an opportunity to determine if any modifications
to these targets were required, and helped identify lessons that could be applied to
improve the design of and implementation arrangements for the following operation.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
Following the political transition that took place in CY2006, the GOM requested the
Bank's assistance in preparing a follow-on operation to the EnvDPL II in mid CY2007 to
build on the reforms initiated and implemented under both the EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II.
This follow-on loan is currently being processed as a self-standing operation given the
time lapse between Board approval of the EnvDPL II and expected approval of this
operation. The proposed loan, now titled "the Environmental Sustainability Development
Policy Loan," will continue to support the government's outcome-based program to
promote sustainable development, by (i) mainstreaming environmental concerns in the
development agenda of key sectors and (ii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of
local environmental management processes in Mexico. As such, it will continue to center
on the following areas, supported under the Environment DPL Program: (i) integrating
environmental sustainability considerations into the energy sector agenda; (ii) increasing
appropriate financing for sustainable forestry; (iii) increasing water use efficiency and
reducing water pollution; and (iv) integrating environmental sustainability considerations
into the tourism sector agenda. In addition, the operation will also support two new policy
areas, by integrating environmental sustainability considerations into the agriculture and
housing sector agendas.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Although the Program's PDO indicators were not expected to be achieved until the
completion of the planned EnvDPL III operation, the Program (EnvSAL I and EnvDPL
II) made substantial progress in achieving these indicators as reflected in the Results
Framework Analysis (see pages iv ­ xiv). For example, out of a total of 26 PDO
indicators, the Program fully met 17 of these indicators and made substantial progress
toward an additional seven. Further, the Program achieved 10 of the 12 indicators
established for the completion of the EnvDPL II Program (the Program's intermediate
outcome indicators, see pages xv - xviii). The government continues to work toward the
achievement of the remaining 10 PDO indicators and the proposed Environmental


                                             13

Sustainability DPL, currently under preparation, is expected to support the GOM in these
efforts.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The program development objectives were originally designed to support the
Government's 2001-2006 medium-term program to promote sustainable development
(the Environment and Natural Resources Program (ENRP)), and aimed to balance socio-
economic     development     with   environmental    protection  and    improvement      by
mainstreaming environmental concerns in key development sectors. However, the
Program's indicators and design continue to be relevant and are fully consistent with the
goals of the country's current 2007 ­ 2012 National Development Plan. This National
Development Plan outlines an extensive reform program centering on the following five
strategic goals: (i) state security and rights, (ii) economic competitiveness and
employment generation, (iii) equity of opportunity; (iv) environmental sustainability, and
(v) effective democracy. The Plan's environmental sustainability pillar stresses the
importance of the environment in enhancing the country's competitiveness and economic
and social development, as well as the importance of mainstreaming the sustainability
principle in sectoral policies.

In addition to supporting the country's current development priorities, the Program's
objectives and design are also fully consistent with Bank country partnership strategies.
The new 2008-2013 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mexico is comprised of the
same five pillars as the National Development Plan. This CPS provides a flexible
framework for future World Bank Group support to Mexico, and proposes a streamlined
approach to lending, consolidating most of the lending volume in one large annual DPL.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Outcomes of EnvSAL I:
First Tranche ($101.01 million)
GOM met all goals for the disbursement of the first tranche of EnvSAL I prior to Board
presentation. The achievements of the first tranche covered the setting of targets across
different sectors, preparation of a multisectoral program and the passage of critical laws
on both use of fiscal instruments and decentralization. Significant achievements with
respect to mainstreaming environmental concerns are summarized below.

(i)     Environmental fiscal instruments were developed for the first time in the history
        of environmental management in Mexico. Some of the results of the development
        of these instruments included:
        a. Increase in the revenues from the amount of water fees collected at the
            municipal level, and increased incentives so that municipalities could invest in
            water resource management programs. Specifically, the Law of Rights on
            water (Ley Federal de Derechos) was modified in January 2002 to incorporate
            the provision that up to 100% of municipal water fees collected may be
            returned to municipalities respectively, in accordance with an incentive
            scheme under which municipalities need to invest an equal amount of funds in
            water resource development programs. In addition, a Presidential decree was


                                            14

            issued in December 2001 to permit exoneration of water fee-related debt by
            the federal government for municipalities that agree to pay water fees in the
            future and to forego federal funding for water supply and sanitation in the
            event that fees are not paid. The Law of Rights was modified in December
            2002 to include a provision for charging a water fee to irrigation water users
            for water used in excess of their water right;
        b. Decrease of overexploitation and improvement of operation of and
            investments in national tourism resources. In particular, this included the
            approval by Congress of the articles on tourism in the Law of Rights which
            allowed user fees for maritime activities, protected areas, and whale watching,
            with a provision for earmarking revenue generated for reinvestment in the
            particular tourism resource generating the revenue.
(ii)    Approvals of amendments by Congress in December 2001 of four laws (Ley
        General del Equilibrio Ecologico y la Protección al Ambiente; Ley General de
        Vida Slivestre; and Ley de Bienes Nacionales) aimed to create an enabling
        environment to decentralize environmental management from the federal to state
        governments;
(iii)   Development of monitorable, medium-term targets to guide and monitor the
        incorporation of environmental concerns in key development sectors, namely
        water, energy, tourism, and forestry sectors; and
(iv)    Development of a strategy to improve public access to information on
        environmental management functions. The provision for public access to
        information on EIA and permits was made through the following legislation: Ley
        Federal de Transparencia y Acceso a la Información Pública Gubernamental,
        Ley General del Equilibrio Ecológico y Protección al Ambiente, and Reglamento
        de Impacto Ambiental.

Second Tranche ($101.01 million)
Building on a successful start, GOM's achievements met and in fact exceeded all but
three of the conditions of the second tranche. As explained below, the partial success
achieved under these three conditions was due to reasons outside the control of
SEMARNAT. Achievements under the second tranche reflect important advances in
interinstitutional coordination, aimed at facilitating mainstreaming of environmental
concerns in key sectors, and the decentralization of environmental management functions
to states. Noteworthy achievements include:

(i)     Establishment     of   interinstitutional   coordination    mechanisms     between
        SEMARNAT and energy, forestry, water, and tourism sectors. Through these
        mechanisms, four Intersectoral Technical Working Groups (ITWGs) for each of
        these sectors were established and played a key role in defining sectoral
        environmental agendas and priorities. The ITWG established for the energy sector
        opened up discussions on important energy topics in a sector where the Bank had
        no or little dialogue previously and no prior lending. The achievements of this
        Energy ITWG include, among others, designing programs for (i) developing
        environmental regulations for renewable energy sources, (ii) increasing the
        portfolio of carbon offset investments suitable for carbon finance, (iii) evaluating
        least-cost retrofitting of refinery investment plans using new sulfur-reducing


                                             15

      technologies, (iv) implementing and consolidating environmental management
      systems at the corporate level in PEMEX and CFE, and (v) developing and
      implementing an environment-energy strategy.
(ii)  Implementation of water fiscal instruments for both municipal water fees and
      protected areas where funds are channeled back to the sector to improve
      environmental management. Specific results included increased revenues and
      increased investment in water resource management as illustrated below:
      a. Return of over 95% (480.7 million Mexican Pesos) of water fees to CNA by
           SHCP for use by municipalities for better water management; and
      b. In the tourism sector, a 200-fold increase in marine park revenues (compared
           with 2001) was achieved in 2002 as a result of charging user fees and
           earmarking these for management of protected areas.
      c. In addition, by October 1, 2003, municipalities had paid water fees
           corresponding to 58% (approximately 3.2 million cubic meters) of the
           concessioned water use by volume (compared with baseline of 24% the
           previous year).
(iii) Improved public participation and transparency in environmental management.
      Public disclosure of processing information on some environmental management
      functions helped to minimize discretionary and inconsistent administration of
      procedures and enhance efficiency of environmental management. In
      SEMARNAT, public disclosure of information on some EIA review and approval
      and permitting was achieved on a pilot basis through a website.

As mentioned above, partial waivers6 were requested for the following conditions:
(i)   Condition 1: Establishment of Intersectorial Technical Working Groups (ITWGs)
      in Water, Energy, Tourism, and Forestry composed of members with designated
      titles. Although the ITWGs were established and fully functional, this request was
      purely circumstantial and necessitated by changes in a few of the titles of the
      members of the ITWGs. These changes, in some cases, were to ensure more
      appropriate representation in the ITWG than was originally envisaged during the
      preparation of the loan; in other cases, the agency in question was reorganized
      resulting in changes in the title of the post. In all cases, however, the positions
      were at the same organizational level, and continued to be with the same agencies
      specified in the EnvSAL I.
(ii)  Condition 8: ISO-9001-2000 certification of EIA review and approval, forest fire
      detection, and control and permit-issuance functions of the Ministry of
      Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) that are to be decentralized to
      the state governments from SEMARNAT. Three of these functions were not
      certified because they were transferred from SEMARNAT to CONAFOR. Further,
      an assessment conducted by SEMARNAT of its experience with decentralization




6A request for the Board's approval of these three, non-substantial waivers was sought in
a Memorandum of the President, dated December 4, 2003. The Board approved the
waivers through no objection on December 18, 2003.


                                           16

       concluded that certification was not necessary to assure the quality of
       decentralization and that it in fact presented considerable obstacles to the
       decentralization process. Based on this assessment, SEMARNAT decided to de-
       link certification from the decentralization process. This approach, in fact, has
       produced positive results, including the decentralization of permit issuance
       functions for sustainable wildlife use to three states and permit issuance functions
       for sustainable forest use to one state.
(iii)  Condition 11: Public disclosure of processing information on EIA review and
       issuance of permits by SEMARNAT. This third partial waiver request was also
       necessitated by the transfer of functions from SEMARNAT to CONAFOR (e.g.,
       forest fire detection and control permits). GOM has provided evidence that
       indicates processing information on EIA and control permits is publicly disclosed
       via government websites.

Overall Outcomes of EnvDPL II (single tranche of US$200.51 million):
GOM met all goals for the EnvDPL II prior to Board presentation. The Program's
achievements to date include its continued support to strengthening interinstitutional
coordination mechanisms among participating agencies, the adoption and implementation
of local Agenda 21 action plans, the operation of a Clean Development Mechanism
Office in accordance with the parties to the UNFCCC, and the approval of a Law for
Sustainable Forestry and corresponding regulations. Significant achievements with
respect to mainstreaming environmental concerns are summarized below.

(i)    To promote sustainable tourism development, the GOM has developed pilot local
       Agenda 21 action plans in 14 key tourism destinations: Acapulco, Cozumel,
       Bahía de Banderas, Campeche, Cuetzalan, Guanajuato, Huatulco, Ixtapa-
       Zihuatanejo, Los Cabos, Manzanillo, Mazatlán, Oaxaca, Patzcuaro, and San
       Miguel de Allende. These Agenda 21 action plans propose strategies and actions
       in the short, medium and long terms that aim to (a) strengthen the sustainable
       development of tourism areas, (b) promote participation of local communities in
       tourism-related activities, and (c) ensure the preservation of natural and cultural
       resources of tourist destinations in Mexico. Local Agenda 21 Committees in these
       tourist destinations play a central role in building consensus among stakeholders
       for the implementation of strategies to maximize social welfare, economic
       benefits, and environmental quality.
(ii)   The GOM has established and begun implementation of a set of indicators and
       benchmarks to measure good environmental performance in tourist facilities and
       destinations. In addition, SECTUR, PROFEPA (Procuraduría Federal de
       Protección al Ambiente, Federal Attorney General for Environmental Regulation),
       and the Mexican Association of Hotels and Motels launched a certification
       scheme in 2004 to recognize responsible environmental performance by tourist
       facilities based on established environmental indicators of sustainable tourism.
       The program provides incentives for full compliance with environmental law,
       which is verified through voluntary audits. As of May 2005, ten large tourist
       facilities (including hotels, golf clubs, and marinas) had been certified.
(iii)  During the preparation of the EnvDPL II, a Strategic Environmental Assessment
       (SEA) was prepared to inform future tourism policies and programs. This


                                             17

     analytical work provides the basis for adoption and implementation of an
     environmental policy for the tourism sector. In addition, it includes (a) the
     development of scenarios of tourism sector expansion, (b) the assessment of
     potential impacts of alternative scenarios, including environmental and social
     costs, constraints, and benefits, (c) the assessment of effectiveness of current
     policy instruments, (d) the assessment of institutional capacity for environmental
     management, and (e) the identification of priority issues and design or revision of
     public policies.
(iv) The energy sector has made contributions to reduce its contribution to air
     pollution and the negative impacts it has on health. For example, SENER has
     worked with other energy sector agencies and with environmental authorities to
     strengthen the national clean fuels policy. Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), the
     state oil monopoly has made advancements in improving fuel quality by reducing
     the sulfur content from 1000 to 300 ppm in Premium gasoline used in the Mexico
     City Metropolitan Area, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. The GOM has assessed
     investment needs to reduce sulfur content in all gasoline and diesel by 2008.
(v)  Within the DPL framework, the energy and environmental sectors have also taken
     significant steps to coordinate their efforts to reduce Mexico's contribution to
     climate change. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Office was
     established in 2004 in accordance with the rules set up at the Marrakech and Bonn
     Conferences of the Parties of the UNFCCC. In April 2005, SEMARNAT, SENER,
     and other Ministries modified the agreement which created the Intersectoral
     Commission for Climate Change, responsible for the definition of national
     policies on climate change. This Commission includes the Mexican CDM Office
     that has worked to increase the portfolio of carbon offset investments suitable for
     Carbon Finance.
(vi) One of GOM's major achievements in environmental mainstreaming has been the
     enactment of the General Law for Sustainable Forestry Development and its
     corresponding regulations. The law assigns clearly defined roles and
     responsibilities to the different agencies, sub-national governments and
     stakeholders that are directly involved in the sector. In addition, it stresses the
     separation of functions between SEMARNAT's role in formulating a forestry
     policy that is consistent with the national environmental policy and CONAFOR's
     responsibilities in the promotion of the sector's productive, protection,
     conservation, and restoration activities. The Law also allows for the consolidation
     of inter-agency collaboration to carry out the sector's strategies, including
     coordination with the Federal Attorney General for Environmental Regulation
     (PROFEPA) to strengthen inspection and enforcement activities, joint efforts with
     the National Commission for Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) to build
     synergies between biodiversity conservation through the establishment and
     management of natural protected areas and sustainable forest management, and
     increased dialogue with the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural
     Development, Fishing and Nutrition (SAGARPA) to mitigate the negative
     impacts of agricultural activities on forest ecosystems. The law incorporates
     environmental considerations in the national forestry policy that aim to ensure: (a)
     the protection, sustained provision, and valuation of environmental goods and
     services; (b) increased social participation in the establishment of policies and the


                                           18

       design and implementation of programs through the development of sector-
       specific cultural and educational programs and considerations to address the needs
       of indigenous groups, (c) mitigation of environmental risks and impacts
       associated with sector activities; and (d) advancements in decentralization of
       forestry functions and coordination with sub-national entities to integrate
       resources.
(vii)  Under the leadership of CONAGUA, progress was achieved in the integrated
       management of water resources, with efforts undertaken to limit the extraction of
       water from over-exploited aquifers or surface water bodies in order to meet
       sustainability objectives. With the DPL's support, measures have also been
       established to ensure that water users comply with their water rights and discharge
       obligations, and that water rights are consistent with water availability. These
       actions were implemented on a pilot basis in the Valley of Querétaro, Querétaro;
       Caborca, Sonora; and Santo Domingo, Baja California Sur where authorities
       negotiated with water users to limit the extraction of water from the over-
       exploited aquifers and agreed on several actions to meet sustainability objectives.
(viii) In addition, the National Water Law was amended, restructuring key functions of
       CONAGUA at the basin level. This amended legal framework and programs
       implemented by CONAGUA improve the public water rights registry as part of
       efforts to improve the enforcement of water property rights and improve the
       functioning of the water market. This water rights registry is publicly available
       via CONAGUA's website. Additional efforts by CONAGUA to increase rational
       use of water and foster water markets include the publication of water availability
       data for 188 aquifers and for the country's largest watershed, the Lerma-Chapala
       basin, and the disclosure of data on water availability, which provides authorities
       and water users with reliable information for a more transparent allocation of the
       resource among all water users. CONAGUA has also implemented a program to
       support installation of measuring devices to improve measurement of water use
       and discharges and thereby improve water rights enforcement.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The EnvSAL I operation supported initial actions to set medium-term targets to
mainstream environment in key sectors and create favorable conditions for the
implementation of reforms. The actions supported by EnvDPL II consolidated and
deepened the impact of these reforms by supporting the development of legal and
regulatory frameworks. Despite not completing the originally planned series of three
operations within the EnvDPL Program, the Program (EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II) did
substantially achieve its objectives as evidenced by the progress in meeting program
development objectives (out of a total of 26 outcome indicators, the Program fully
achieved 17 and made substantial progress toward an additional seven).

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Given that water and air pollution result in ill health, especially of the poor, and that
unsustainable forestry practices adversely affect livelihoods, actions under the


                                            19

Environment DPL Program have supported enhancements to the environmental and
health conditions of the poor. Those vulnerable population segments that depend on
natural resources for their livelihoods, such as indigenous peoples and ejido communities,
also benefit through the promotion of sustainable environmental practices.

Actions supported by the Environment DPL Program targeted at attaining sustainable
development of the tourism sector have helped build the capacity of municipalities as
well as of local citizens and of the poor to increase their access to information and
decision-making. Actions in the energy sector have contributed to reducing air pollution
and mitigating its impacts on human health. Workers in the energy sector and
neighborhoods close to PEMEX and CFE facilities will benefit from measures leading to
the reduction of pollution in these facilities. In addition, rural electrification will
contribute to reducing indoor air pollution and provide better living conditions for the
population.

In the forestry sector, actions supported by the DPL Program promote increased
opportunities for the development of income-generating activities and the generation of
employment opportunities for forest dwellers, ejidatarios, and indigenous peoples living
in forested areas. The implementation of these activities fosters the capacity of these
communities and cooperatives to take greater advantage of sustainable and productive
uses of forest areas. The Forest Law puts in place specific mechanisms for cost recovery,
non-timber forest production, ecological services valuation, small-scale user permits, and
intellectual property rights ­ all of which apply to indigenous communities and other
poor forest dwellers.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
The Environment DPL Program has supported the establishment of interinstitutional
coordination mechanisms between SEMARNAT and the sectoral line ministries (SENER,
SECTUR, CONAFOR, and CONAGUA); four Intersectoral Technical Working Groups
(ITWGs) for the energy, forestry, water, and tourism sectors have been established and
each have defined sectoral environmental agendas. The GOM has found the ITWGs to be
a useful mechanism for the delivery of high quality products based on collaboration with
other sectors. To underscore this, the President created the Intersectoral Commission on
Tourism (Comisión Intersecretarial de Turismo) in 2004, which provides the institutional
framework for better interinstitutional coordination among federal authorities, the private
sector, and civil society around the sector's main challenges and opportunities.

In addition, various mechanisms have been put in place and continue to function to
provide the opportunity for social learning in a cross-sectoral setting. In the energy
sector, high-level meetings between SENER and various governmental agencies have
been institutionalized in the Intersectoral Committee for Projects for Emissions
Reductions and Capture of Green House Gases. Objectives of this Committee are to
identify opportunities, facilitate, promote, disseminate, evaluate, and approve projects for
emission reduction and greenhouse gas capture. This committee is composed of
representatives from the environment, energy, economics, agriculture, rural development,
fishery, communication, and transport sectors. Also in the energy sector, a technical


                                               20

advisory team comprised of Mexican experts in environment and energy policy issues
will provide technical advice to inform the development of the sector's environmental
policy.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)
None.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Annex 2 provides a summary of the key results and lessons learned from the EnvSAL I
and EnvDPL II, presented by the Program's sectoral working groups at a stakeholder
workshop held on February 12, 2008.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
    Rating: Low

Upon conclusion of both the EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II operations, the risk to
development outcome is low. This was the Bank's first DPL Program to support the
GOM's medium-term sustainable development program and during the first and second
operations, the DPL Program benefited from strong government ownership of the reforms.
In addition, the GOM's request for continued Bank support for this Program in CY2007
following the change in administration in 2006 highlights the GOM's continued
commitment to these reforms, as a new operation is under preparation to both strengthen
the Program's current reforms and develop reforms in new areas (e.g., in the housing and
agriculture sectors).

Multisectoral coordination during the Environment DPL Program has been a key for
success. Given the multisectoral nature of the reforms, the development of the ITWGs--
which emphasize coordination and consensus building--has ensured a broader discussion
of the issues and promoted buy-in with respect to strategy proposals and instruments
from the sectors.

As summarized above, the overall risk of sustaining the Program's reforms is low.
However, there is a risk that one of the Program's expected outcomes--the issuance of
regulations associated with an amended Water Law supporting the decentralization of
water resource management functions--will not be achieved. The government is
preparing a new amendment to the Water Law, as well as an alternative to these
regulations, which will take more time than anticipated. In the meantime, the government
is supporting decentralized water resource management through the design and
implementation of flagship, integrated water resource management projects in the 32
states.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
    Rating: Satisfactory
Both EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II were prepared by a large multidisciplinary Bank team as
required by the intersectoral nature of the DPL Program. This team was composed of
specialists with ample experience working in Mexico, global experience in their sector,
and/or expertise in the design of programmatic DPLs. For the preparation of the EnvSAL
I, two preparation missions were conducted, comprising a total of nine specialists in
environment, environmental engineering, economics, environmental economics, water
resources management, energy, financial management, urban planning, and operations.
For the preparation of the EnvDPL II, five preparation missions were conducted,
comprising a total of 12 specialists in environment, environmental engineering,
environmental economics, environmental policy, water resources management, energy,
forestry, and operations. The teams for the two loans provided strong technical guidance
during the preparation of the loans, included an adequate level of expertise, and drew on
extensive background analyses in order to provide credible advice to the Government.

During the preparation of the EnvSAL I, one area in which the Bank could have
improved was its own internal process of intersectoral coordination in certain sectors,
such as water sector projects and Global Environment Facility (GEF), funded renewable
energy projects, particularly in the choice of activities in the Bank's portfolio and
pipeline linked to the Environment DPL Program. These could have been made in a more
strategic manner thus resulting in a greater impact in achieving key objectives defined in
the program matrix. Based on this lesson, the task team during the preparation of the
EnvDPL II made a concerted effort to improve intersectoral coordination in these two
sectors.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
     Rating: Satisfactory
During the supervision of the EnvDPL Program (EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II), over six
supervision missions were conducted involving staff with specializations in water
resources management, environment, environmental engineering, environmental policy,
environmental economics, social science, law, and energy. The Bank team also
maintained a continuous dialogue with the client to evaluate progress in carrying out
Program reforms and to continue to provide technical support. This technical assistance
provided by the Bank team has helped contribute to the achievement of Program
objectives. For example, the Bank offered support to the GOM in organizing a workshop
in 2005 to disseminate experiences on the implementation of Agenda 21 Action Plans in
tourist destinations. Approximately 115 representatives from 28 agencies, 55
municipalities, and 6 federal institutions attended this workshop.




                                              22

Lastly, at the close of each operation, the Bank and SEMARNAT organized a workshop
to review operation results and the status of PDO and intermediate outcome indicators.
These workshops have played a key role in initiating preparation of each follow-on
operation, in which the design of the EnvDPL II and the proposed Environmental
Sustainability DPL (currently under preparation) have benefited from the experiences and
lessons learned from the prior operation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
As Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision are rated satisfactory, overall Bank
performance is also rated satisfactory. Throughout the period of Program implementation,
the Bank team was highly involved in an active policy dialogue with government
authorities, identifying priorities and future challenges. The policy dialogue paved the
way for the development of a new DPL operation, currently under preparation, which
will help ensure the continuity and sustainability of reforms under the Environment DPL
Program.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The political will demonstrated by the GOM--in particular the lead roles taken by SHCP
and SEMARNAT--was a crucial factor in the fulfillment of the actions carried out under
both the EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II operations. During Program implementation, the
leadership of SHCP and SEMARNAT encouraged other implementing agencies to
participate more actively. In addition, the government's commitment to sustainable
development was reflected in the changes made to the Ley Federal de Derechos,
approved by Congress in December 2002.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
As mentioned above, SEMARNAT and SHCP played lead roles in coordinating with
other implementing agencies to ensure cross-sectoral coordination in the development
and implementation of reforms. The PHRD preparation grants utilized for the preparation
of both the EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II operations helped galvanize this cross-sectoral
collaboration. However, with delays in PHRD implementation, this momentum was
dampened. For example, the contracting and implementation of studies financed under
the PHRD for the preparation of the EnvDPL II were delayed due to changes in senior
posts and hence a reassessment of strategic priorities for the remainder of the
administration at SEMARNAT and SENER.

Also, the implementing agencies did not initially take advantage of the Bank's early
offers of technical assistance (such as technical workshops for ITWG members on
particular topics, including Strategic Environmental Assessment, public expenditure
reviews, and financing sectoral strategies), following Board approval of EnvSAL I. This
may have resulted in significantly reducing the time that it took to meet certain conditions,
including those related to establishing the high-level ITWGs. During the preparation of



                                             23

the EnvDPL II, however, this changed with a strong demand from the GOM for technical
assistance from the Bank linked with the EnvDPL Program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
The GOM, particularly SHCP and SEMARNAT staff, participated actively in the
preparation of the Environment DPL Program, facilitated and coordinated actions with
other responsible agencies, closely followed the policy matrix, reported to the Bank on
progress in the Program's implementation, and suggested new policy areas (in the case of
the new operation under preparation).

6. Lessons Learned

ITWGs require substantial resources and commitments, but the benefits far outweigh the
costs. The EnvSAL I demonstrated that interinstitutional coordination is a complex
process that requires substantial efforts and unwavering commitments on the part of
participating entities which are required to undergo a profound learning process and
adopt significant behavioral changes. This learning process is challenging and carrying
out these commitments is both difficult and time consuming. On the other hand, this
operation also showed that where institutional coordination was successful, it led to
enhancements in the quality of outputs. The ITWGs became fully functioning and
adequately staffed entities, providing significant opportunity for cross-fertilization
between institutions in different sectors.

Additional resources, such as those provided by a TAL or preparation grant, can provide
technical assistance to strengthen coordination among key stakeholders. The preceding
lesson highlights the need for continuous budgetary support and adequate human
resources to ensure successful interinstitutional coordination. In other countries, a
Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) often accompanies a DPL to directly support the
development and implementation of program reforms. As such, a TAL represents an
important option to overcome some of the constraints mentioned above and provides
technical support in a timely fashion to help ensure both mainstreaming and sustainability.
Under Mexico's fiscal policy, loans do not increase aggregate fiscal resources available
to environment and other sectoral agencies since the fiscal envelope is defined by the
binding primary fiscal surplus targets. Nonetheless, GOM is ensuring that levels of
human and budgetary resources are adequate to ensure institutional capacity. Although
GOM has enough resources to finance reforms for the environment sector, the results of
Bank support have underscored the added value of the operation both in terms of
technical assistance provided and the institutionalization of spaces for intersectoral
cooperation and dialogue which probably would not have been created otherwise. The
Japan Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) provided important
resources (over US$1 million) that allowed for the development of key analytical work
and stakeholder participation for the preparation of the EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II. The
use of PHRD grant funds provided a positive incentive for mainstreaming environmental
concerns in key economic sectors.




                                             24

To ensure intersectoral coordination, a champion is imperative. To ensure that inter-
institutional coordination efforts are sustained throughout Program implementation and
beyond, it is essential that an entity take a leading role in overseeing these efforts,
particularly as participating entities undergo an initial learning process and define their
functions within intersectoral working groups. SHCP and SEMARNAT assumed this
coordinating role, helping to ensure the success of the Program's coordination efforts.

Importance of focusing on a select number of central actions, impacts, and results in the
design of the Program. The EnvSAL I had a large number of prior actions that covered a
broad range of development areas. Consequently implementation and supervision
covered a wide range of topics, presenting challenges in terms of sufficient human and
budgetary resources and constant dialogue between the Bank and GOM throughout the
period of implementation. It was determined that for future operations in the Program
fewer prior actions should be selected in such a way that they are strategically important,
will address the sectoral priorities of the country, and therefore will still have
development impact. As such, the number of prior actions under the EnvDPL II was
limited to five actions.

Importance of establishing specific, measurable, and relevant outcome indicators. A
relevant set of monitorable and meaningful outcome indicators should be established at
the outset of a Program, along with clearly-defined baseline and target values to monitor
progress and evaluate outcomes. Some of the indicators established for the Environment
DPL Program were overly complex and ambitious. Further, although target values were
defined during the course of Program implementation, the lack of a definition of baseline
and target values at the outset made it more difficult to assess the Program's overall
progress during implementation.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) reviewed the draft
ICR and provided its comments on February 28, 2008, in which the agency fully agreed
with the report's findings (see Annex 3). In its comments, SEMARNAT noted that the
document adequately reflects the results of the EnvSAL I and EnvDPL II, as well as the
status of the Program's outcome indicators. In addition, the Secretariat mentioned that the
Program has helped create and consolidate the country's environmental mainstreaming
agenda in key economic sectors.

Annex 2. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A workshop, attended by both government and Bank project teams, was held in Mexico
City on February 12, 2008 to explore the key results and lessons learned from the
Environment SAL I and Environment DPL II operations. The key results presented by
the various sectoral ministries are summarized below.

1. The Ministry of Finance (SHCP) identified the following principal actions under the
Program that have supported the development of fiscal instruments:

             ·  Development of a policy that provides fiscal incentives to water
                operators oriented toward providing incentives for investments in potable
                water, sewerage, and sanitation, as well as abating delays in the provision
                of water and sanitation.
             ·  Restructuring the fiscal policy corresponding to Natural Protected Areas,
                oriented toward valuing the services provided by these areas and
                supporting the financing of their conservation.
             ·  Development of a policy supporting payment for environmental services
                programs, oriented toward supporting the financing of these programs,
                creating markets for environmental services, providing incentives for
                biodiversity conservation, and generating future savings through
                conservation policies.

The primary environmental fiscal instruments used to support public policies for
sustainable development included assigning 300 million pesos annually from the income
collected from water rights to environmental service payment programs, as well as
returning income from water rights that corresponded to the Natural Protected Areas.
This policy support was enabled by a modification in the behavior of operators, who
previously did not pay for water rights and has lead to increase municipal investments in
water supply and sanitation. Between 2002 and 2006, the fees collected for municipal
water use amounted to 6,938 million Mexican Pesos, of which the federal government
returned 6,816 million pesos to the municipalities for investments in the sector. In
addition, the policy supporting Natural Protected Areas has led to an increase in the
income collected for area rights, in which collected resources have been channeled to
benefit the same protected areas and contribute to their maintenance and conservation.
Between 2002 and 2006, the resources benefiting protected areas were about 145 million
pesos. Lastly, the payment for environmental services policy has contributed to
developing environmental service markets and channeling resources to support
conservation policies. Between 2002 and 2006, the resources collected for environmental
service programs were approximately 1,100 million pesos.

2. The National Water Commission (CNA) identified the following lessons learned from
the implementation of both the Environment SAL I and Environment DPL II:

           ·   The operations have been beneficial given that they have strengthened
               interinstitutional and interministerial coordination to support the


                                             29

                   achievement of water sector objectives; this coordination, however, can
                   still be improved.
             ·     It is difficult to credit all of these achievements to the Bank's support,
                   given that it is possible that they would have been accomplished
                   independently.
             ·     Turnover among the teams supporting the Environment DPL Program has
                   had an impact in the Program's performance. As such, mechanisms that
                   strengthen institutional memory should be strengthened.
             ·     Clear incentives supporting the participation of each institution involved
                   in the Program must exist in order to meet the Program's objectives.

3. The Tourism Ministry (SECTUR) considered one of the Program's greatest benefits to
be its support toward the Ministry's working in a more coordinated fashion with the
environmental, water, energy, and forestry sectors in the following areas: (i) the Agenda
21 Program for Mexican tourism, (ii) environmental certification of hotels and tourism
facilities, (iii) the development of the "Mexico Clean and Beloved" campaign, and (iv)
the integration of clean beach committees in tourism destinations. Through the
intersectoral working group for tourism consensus has been reached on the strategies and
plans for these programs. For example, the Agenda 21 Program led by SECTUR in
coordination with SEMARNAT, CNA, INE, CONANP, CONAFOR, PROFEPA, among
other institutions, has allowed for the unification of criteria, resources, and actions in the
implementation of this program. Further, through the Agenda 21 Program environmental
best practices have been promoted in tourism businesses and destinations through the
Clean Beaches program and the awarding of environmental quality certificates. Lastly,
the Environment DPL Program has supported the development of tourism sustainability
indicators to monitor environmental, socio-economic, tourism, and urban development
conditions in the country's tourist destinations.

Annex 3. Summary of Borrower's Comments on Draft ICR

The following comments on the draft ICR were provided by SEMARNAT on Febrary 28,
2008:

En relación con el documento del Banco Mundial, IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION
AND RESULTS REPORT (IBRD 71360 AND IBRD 73280) presentado, como borrador
preliminar el 18 de enero del 2008, a la Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos
Naturales y como borrador final con fecha 12 de febrero de 2008, se emiten los
siguientes comentarios:

   1. El documento recoge con precisión los objetivos y resultados de los programas
       EnvSAL I y EnvDPL II, que apoyaron dos créditos del Banco Mundial al
       Gobierno mexicano por un monto total de 402.53 millones de US dólares.

   2. El documento contiene los indicadores de resultados de la gestión del gobierno
       federal en los cuatro sectores que formaron parte de los programas: agua, forestal,
       energía y turismo.

   3. El objetivo de los programas fue fortalecer las capacidades institucionales en
       diferentes dependencias de la Administración Pública Federal para instrumentar y
       desarrollar políticas sectoriales incorporando la visión de sustentabilidad en el
       manejo de recursos naturales y la preservación del medio ambiente.

   4. Los programas y las acciones promovidas contribuyeron a crear y consolidar la
       agenda de transversalidad de las políticas hacia el desarrollo sustentable en
       sectores de gran importancia para la economía mexicana por su relación directa
       con el aprovechamiento y manejo de los recursos naturales y su impacto en el
       medio ambiente.

   5. Adicionalmente se logró avanzar en el análisis y conocimiento de la situación
       ambiental y de los recursos naturales asociados a los sectores involucrados en los
       programas.

   6. El EnvSAL I inició en diciembre de 2002 y concluyó en octubre de 2003, y el
       EnvDPL II se inició en enero de 2005 y concluyó en enero de 2006. Con la
       experiencia obtenida del primer programa se revisaron las acciones para el
       segundo, logrando un mayor nivel de integración y de eficacia para las políticas
       ambientales.

   7. Los indicadores contenidos en el documento de referencia, fueron revisados por
       cada una de las dependencias involucradas y los logros alcanzados, mostrados en
       el mismo documento, son el resultado de las presentaciones de las mismas
       dependencias en el taller y en las reuniones de trabajo con la Misión del Banco
       Mundial, efectuada del 11 al 15 de enero del 2008.



                                             31

8. Los indicadores contienen las acciones más relevantes y de mayor impacto
   cuantificable de las políticas públicas del gobierno federal en los sectores citados.

9. Para fortalecer las capacidades institucionales en la ejecución de políticas
   transversales de protección del medio ambiente y manejo sustentable de los
   recursos naturales, se contó con una donación del Gobierno de Japón, Policy and
   Human Resources Development (PHRD).
