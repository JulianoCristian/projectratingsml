                     Energia (SENER).
 Amount and Terms:   US$200.5 10 million fixed spread, U.S. dollar-denominated loan,
                     4.5-year grace period and total repayment period o f 14.5 years.

I                    Front-end fee: 0.25 percent o fthe loanamount, capitalized.
                     The full amount o f the loan will be disbursed in a single tranche
 Tranching:          upon effectiveness.
                     The proposed loan will support the second stage o f the
                     government's medium-term, outcome-based program to promote
                      sustainable development. The overarching objective o f the program
                      i s to balance socio-economic development with environmental
                     protection and improvement. The program will focus on: (i)
                     mainstreaming environmental concerns in the development
                     agendas o f key sectors - tourism, energy, forestry and water - as
                     prioritized by the Government o f Mexico (GOM);              and (ii)
                     improving the effectiveness and efficiency o f local environmental
                     management processesinMexico.

                      The prior actions completed by the GOM for the proposed
                     operation include: (i) establishment and implementation o f a set of
                     indicators and benchmarks for measurement o f good environmental
                     performance o f tourist facilities; (ii)a Secretariat o f Energy-
                     approved design o f a national fund for renewable energy
                     promotion; (iii)  establishment and operational startup o f a Clean
                     DevelopmentMechanism (CDM) Office, involving at least SENER
                     and SEMARNAT, according to rules set up at the Marrakech and
                     Bonn Conferences o f the Parties o f the UNFCCC; (iv) publication
                     o f water availability data and an improved water rights registry as
                     foundational steps in the implementation o f a functioning watei
                     rights market, consistent with the current regulatory framework:
                     and (v) the initiation of decentralization efforts (as evidenced by
                     signature of,a convenio, capacity building, or joint operation) bq
                     over 10 States, including the decentralization o f permit issuance
                     functions for sustainable wildlife use inthree states, for sustainable
                     use o f forest resources in one state, and the decentralization oj
                     environmental' licenses for industrial discharges and emission:

Additional key actions undertaken by the GOM in preparation for
the proposed operation include: (i) the development o f action plans
in fourteen key tourist destinations to implement local Agenda 21
Programs for Sustainable Tourism; (ii)   the evaluation o f programs
to improve the quality o f transport fuels and establishment o f
incentives to promote energy efficiency andrenewable energy; (iii)
the enactment of a new General Law for Sustainable Forestry
Development and regulations consistent with the law; (iv) the
passing o f amendments to the National Water Law, publication o f
water availability data, and an improved water rights registry as
foundational steps in the implementation o f a functioning water
rights market; and (v) the decentralization o f environmental
management functions including streamlining the administrative
procedures inthe environment sector and continuing to implement
the Law on Transparency, which will allow public scrutiny o f
environmental management.
In the tourism sector, the implementation of cooperative
approaches involving public entities, the private sector and other
community      stakeholders   for   joint   action   in addressing
environmental    problems     helps   to   improve    environmental
conditions at tourist sites. Actions supported in the energy sector
contribute to reducing local air pollution and improving
mechanisms for climate change mitigation. Inthe forestry sector, a
new legal and regulatory framework fosters sustainable forestry
management practices. Actions in the water program promote
decentralization o fwater management responsibilities to river basin
agencies to improve the allocation o f water resources and enhance
programs for water pollution control. Actions to improve
environmental management strengthen              the   capacity    of
environment authorities to foster accountability and transparency
and to mitigate potential negative impacts o f investment projects.
Increased public participation indecision-making and transparency
inenvironmental management processeshelp ensure that the needs
o f vulnerable persons are taken into account indecision-making on
environmental issueswhich affect them.
The ENVSAL program               faces  a   number     o f   potential
macroeconomic, political, social and institutional risks.

(i) Macroeconomic risks could be associated with effects on the
Mexican economy caused by a sharper slowdown o f the US (and
global) economy, a stronger than expected tightening o f monetary
policy conditions, and a high volatility o f oil prices. Recenl
experience shows that such a slowdown most likely will affeci
Mexican economic growth rather than price stability or access tc

                 ...
                Vlll

external financing. A sharper tightening o f monetary policy in the
U S will lead not only to an increase o f interest rates on external
financing requirements, but also - and more importantly - to an
increase o f domestic interest rates. Mexico has made important
progress, however, to reduce its vulnerability to adverse shocks and
to enhance its ability to absorb such shocks.

(ii)Political risks would be associated with the Mexican
presidential election scheduled to take place in2006 exist. Changes
within the cabinet prior to the election, as well as the change of
administration in December 2006, may result in a loss of
momentum to complete the reforms supported by this program.
These risks are mitigated by the following factors: the legal and
regulatory framework established under ENVDPL I1through the
enactment o f laws and regulations provides a basis to ensure the
continuity o f the policies, and the design o f the program, which
anchors the formulation o f sectoral environmental strategies on
consensus-building      among     different   stakeholders,  further
strengthens the basis for continuity o fpolicies.

(iii)
    Potential barriers to decentralize water resources management
responsibilities to the water basin agencies andto promote a greater
degree o f transparency, accountability andpublic participation pose
certain social and institutional risks. These risks are addressedby
the actions supported by the program:
(a) an effective capacity buildingprogram;
(b) an accountability framework and a tracking system that will
monitor     decentralization   o f  environmental    functions   and
competencies;
(c) transparent and accessible environmental public infomatior
systems;
(d) anenhanced communication strategy for the sector; and
(e) the development o f financial autonomy plans in the case 01
decentralization to water basin agencies, as well as support foi
capacity building activities supported by other Bank operations
particularly the Integrated Management o f Basins and Aquifer:

1.        This document proposes a Second Programmatic Environment DevelopmentPolicy Loan
(ENVDPL 11)' o f US$200.510 million to the government o f Mexico (GOM). This development
policy loan (DPL) i s the second ina series o f three loans, to be disbursedover a five-year period,
and aims to support the government's efforts to achieve the objectives of: (i)mainstreaming
environmental concerns in the development agenda o f key sectors (tourism, energy, water and
forestry) and (ii)  improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f local environmental management
processes in Mexico. The ENVSAL program and proposed loan directly support actions that
promote environmental sustainability, which, in addition to reducing poverty, inequality, and
increasing competitiveness, i s one o f the four pillars o f the 2004-2008 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for Mexico and the GOM's Program for Promoting Sustainable Development in
the Federal Government (PSDFG). Progress on key actions completed by GOM up to May 2005
under ENVDPLI1is summarized inAnnex 1.

2.        The first loan (ENVSAL I),      completed in FY 2004, supported important initial actions
consistent with the objectives o f the ENVSAL program. These actions included, among others,
the establishment o f mechanisms for inter-institutional coordination among key sectors, the
development o f medium-term targets to guide the incorporation o f environmental concerns in
these sectors, and modifications o f laws to facilitate improvements and increase transparency in
environmental management. The specific achievements o f ENVSAL Iare summarized in the
Implementation Completion Report for the operation.2 The actions and activities to be supported
by the proposed loanbuildonthe achievements o fENVSAL Iandrepresent significant advances
inthe government's medium-term program. A third loan, contemplated for 2007, would support
the GOM's efforts to consolidate and ensure the sustainability o f its environmental
mainstreaming program inthe long term.

3.        The prior actions completed by the GOM for ENVDPL I1include: (i)             establishment and
implementation o f a set o f indicators and benchmarks for measurement o f good environmental
performance o f tourist facilities and destinations; (ii)   Secretariat o f Energy-approved design o f a
national fund for renewable energy promotion; (iii)          establishment and start o f operation o f a
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Office, involving SENER and SEMARNAT, according
to rules set up at the Marrakech and Bonn Conferences o f the Parties o f the UNFCCC; (iv)
publication o f water availability data and an improved water rights registry as foundational steps
inthe implementationofafunctioningwater rightsmarket, consistentwith the current regulatory
framework; and (v) the initiation o f decentralization efforts (as evidenced by signature o f a
convenio, capacity building, or joint operation) by over 10 States, including the decentralization


  The Program was first presented as a programmatic Structural Adjustment Program in 2002, but has been
redesigned for the proposed operation as a Development Policy Program in accordance with the Bank's recently
approved Operational Policy 8.60 on Development Policy Lending. ENVDPL I1previously has been referred to as
ENVSAL 11.The three-phase loan program continues to be referredto as the ENVSAL program.

publicationo f water availability data, and an improved water rightsregistry as foundational steps
in the implementation of a functioning water rights market; and (v) the decentralization of
environmental management functions including streamlining the administrative procedures inthe
environment sector and continuing to implement the Law on Transparency, which will allow
public scrutiny o f environmental management.

5.      This report is organized as follows: Chapter I1describes the country's economic context,
including recent economic developments and the macroeconomic environment. Chapter I11
presents the government's environmental mainstreaming agenda and discusses the measures it
has taken to address the challenges it faces, including specific measures supported by the
operations that constitute the DPL program. In this context, the chapter summarizes the
achievements o f ENVSAL Iand details specific actions and activities to be supported by
ENVDPL 11. Furthermore, prospective activities and actions to be supported by a future
operation (ENVDPL 111) are introduced. Chapter IV discusses the rationale for the Bank's
involvement inthe reform efforts inMexico and the lessons learned from ENVSALI. V        Chapter
describes the specific objectives o f the ENVDPL 11, including prior actions completed and
triggers met by the GOM for ENVDPL 11. Finally, Chapter VI discusses implementation o f the
proposed operation. The GOM's Letter o f Development Policy i s presented inAnnex 4.


                               11.     THEECONOMIC CONTEXT

6.      The Mexican economy gained momentum in 2004 by taking advantage of a global
economic recovery and strong oil prices. Broad-based economic growth - the highest since
2000 - was achieved within a framework o f macroeconomic and financial stability. Moderate
levels of inflation, fiscal discipline and a strengthened domestic financial system provide a solid
foundation for economic performance throughout the remaining period o f the current
administration, the upcoming presidential elections (July 2006), and the transition to the next
administration.

7.      Important policy challenges to enhance the economy's competitiveness and growth
capacity remain. Political pluralism has hampered ambitious reforms in areas such as
broadening the tax base, private sector participation inthe energy sector, labor market regulation
andjudicial modernization. The fragmentation of Congress, as well as the upcomingpresidential
elections, i s likely to limit progress on the reform agenda over the next year-and-a-half to less
contentious elements o fthe reform initiatives and issuesthat do not require legislative approval.

8.       Strengthenedmonetary, financial sector, fiscal and debt management policies and
institutionsshould allow the Mexicaneconomy to cope with marketvolatilitiesrelatedto a
periodof increasedpoliticalcompetition.Heightened political uncertainty inthe run-upto the
presidential elections may lead to increased volatility on financial markets with adverse
implications for the real economy. Mexico has had a particularly bad experience inthis regard,
as some o f the country's worst economic crises took place during periods o f political transition.
With the election o f President Fox in 2000, however, Mexico was able to avoid an economic
crisis due to its flexible exchange rate and prudent monetary, fiscal and debt management
policies, which have been maintained under the Fox administration. In addition to the progress
achieved with the continued implementation o f sound policies and a strengthening o f the
institutional framework, Mexican policymakers will be taking additional precautionary measures
to further reduce economic and market vulnerabilities during the upcoming period o f political
transition.

A.       RECENT ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

9.       Broad-basedeconomic growthduring2004 consolidatedthe recoveryfromthe slow-
growthand recessionaryperiodthat startedat the end of 2000. Real GDP for 2004 expanded
by 4.4 percent, a slightly higher rate than earlier expected and a sharp contrast to the weak
growth registered during the previous three years. A strong global economic expansion, high
international oil prices and export revenue, favorable external financial conditions, and an
increased availability o f domestic credit stimulated aggregate demand in2004 in all o f its major
categories: private consumption, investment and exports, thereby raising the level o f economic
activity and employment.

10.      A significantresumptionof non-oilexportgrowthsparkedthe recoveryof economic
activity and confirms a strong integration of a substantial segment of Mexican industry
into U.S. industrialgrowth.Non-oil exports increased by 12.9 percent in2004, compared to an
average annual decline o f 0.8 percent in the preceding three years. Mexican non-oil export
performance and industrial production are closely related to the U.S. industrial production cycle,
even though Mexican goods lost some o f their market share in U.S. imports, indicating some
structural problems o f competitiveness andproductivity.

11.      Continued price stability and an increasing availability of domestic credit
contributedto a further strengtheningof private consumptionand a recovery of business
investment demand. Throughout the past economic recession, the expansion of private
consumption exercised a moderating impact on the downturn o f economic activity. Despite a
reduction in formal sector employment, the lack of an erosion in real wages due to a further
reduction inthe level o f inflation allowed for such a positive evolution o f private consumption,
The outlook of continued price stability, as well as policies implemented over the past few years
aimed at a consolidation o fthe country's bankingindustry and financial sector development, also
allowed for a sound domestic credit expansion. In2004, for the first time since the 1995 banking
crisis, the amount of commercial bank credit outstanding to the private sector inMexico showed
an increase in real terms, thereby providing an additional impulse for private consumption and
business investment.

12.      Jobs lost in the formal, private sector during the recession were almost fully
recoveredinthe expansionof economic activity during 2004. Eventhoughthe number o fjobs
inthe formal private sector isnowback at the levelobserved beforethe recession, i.e., end-2000,
the continued expansion o f the economically active population demands a stronger generation o f
employment opportunities. According to a renewed, monthly national employment survey, only
37 percent o f the total working population enjoys access to employment-related social security
benefits.

13.      Headline inflation rising above its medium-term target interval of 2-4 percent
triggered a cycle of monetary policy tightening. Annual consumer price inflation increased
throughout 2004, with year-end inflation up at 5.2 percent compared to 4.0 percent at the end o f
2003. The rapid increase ininflation during 2004 has beenattributed inpart to temporary supply
shocks in areas such as agricultural goods and international commodities. Monetary policy
conditions were nevertheless tightenedon several occasions throughout 2004 and early 2005 in
order to avoid a spill-over into inflation expectations andcontractual wage settlements. Monetary
restraint also took place in line with and inanticipation o f a tightening of U.S. monetary policy.
Domestic interest rates, in particular toward the short-end o f the curve, moved up significantly
after having reachedhistorically low levels inmid-2003.

14.      The government managedto keep the deficit within its annual budgettargets and in
line with its medium-term target of fiscal consolidation. Higher-than-budgeted oil revenue
played an important role in achieving the annual fiscal targets, compensating for lower tax
revenue and higher expenditure in public investment and revenue sharing with state and
municipal governments. The increase o f oil-related budget revenue by almost 2 percentage
points o f gross domestic product (GDP) over the past two years thus allowed for a budget deficit
reduction by almost half that amount, though not in addition to the original deficit reduction
target (Table 11-1). This ledto a substantial increase o f the public sector reliance on oil revenue,
raising its share from slightly under 30 percent o f total revenue in 2002 to 36 percent in 2004,
andamplifyingthe vulnerability ofpublic sector finances to a drop ininternational oilprices.

15.      Off-budget items continue to contributesubstantially to the public sector borrowing
requirements (PSBR) and were reduced less than earlier envisaged largely through the
increased use of off-budget finance of public investments in the energy sector (Table 11-2).
Inaddition to the traditional budget balance measure, the Secretariat of Finance (SHCP) started
to publishas of 2001 a broader PSBR measure, including several off-budget expenditure items,
e.g., the cost to the public sector o fthe bank andtoll roadbail-outs (Institute for the Protection of
Bank Savings, IPAB, andthe toll road rescue program, FARAC) andthe private sector financed
projects in the state-owned energy sector companies (PIDIREGAS). The broader or augmented
PSBR (or PSBR without non-recurrent revenue) measure strengthens the need for fiscal
consolidation.

16.      Public debt-to-GDP ratios started to head downwards in 2004 as a result of fiscal
consolidation, higher growth and exchange rate stabilization, though remain at a
considerably high level. The total net public debt-to-GDP ratio fell by about three percentage
points to 41.4 percent in2004, thereby recovering the level attained earlier in 2001 (Table 11-3).
The increase o f the debt-to-GDP ratio in2002 and 2003 should be attributed mainly to a below
average growth and a depreciation of the real exchange rate, counteracting the impact o f fiscal
consolidation on the ratio duringthis period. In2004, these three basic elements that bring about
                                                                                           7
changes in the debt-to-ratio were aligned thereby allowing for the reduction in the ratio as
observed.

allows for a better understanding and international comparison of the level and evolution
of public debt. Mexico manages some public sector liabilities outside of its regular budget. A

broad debt measure, including such off-budget public sector liabilities, allows for a more
accurate assessment o f fiscal and debt sustainability and balance sheet vulnerabilities by both the
public and private sector. The Mexican authorities observe and publish the traditional net
budgetary debt as well as the broader net augmented debt, including all government guaranteed
debt. An even broader measure would suggest the use o f gross instead o f net debt, increasing in
the case o f Mexico the debt-to-GDP ratio by another 5-6 percentage points over the past few
years, At a gross augmented debt-to-GDP ratio o f about 47 percent at the end o f 2004, Mexico
maintains a level o f debt slightly below the median o f a group o f comparable emerging market
economie~.~

18.      Mexico has no Purchases and Loans outstanding with the IMF and maintains
periodic bilateral discussions as part of the Fund's regular surveillanceprogram. The last
Article IV consultation was concluded by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive
Board on October 18, 2004. The ExecutiveDirectors commended the Mexican authorities for the
continued pursuit o f sound macroeconomic policies, referring in particular to a track record o f
meeting fiscal targets, the successful implementation o f an inflation-targeting framework, an
effective flexible exchange rate regime, a sound banking sector, and a commitment to reduce
vulnerabilities relating to public debt. Some o f the main challenges going forward include
reinvigorating the program o f structural reforms and establishing mechanisms to reduce the
budget dependency on volatile oil revenues. The staff report, a Public InformationNotice, and a
statement by the Executive Director for Mexico have beenpublished in December 2004 and are
available on the internet (www.imf.org).

19.      The external conditions that provided a favorable economic environment during
2004 are unlikely to prevail over the next few years, while limited progress on the
legislative reform agenda will keep economic growth in Mexico largely subject to the
evolution of U.S. growth. The government's medium-term growth projection of 4.0 percent
annual average GDP growth for 2005-2008 may thus result slightly more challenging to attain,
even though the budget assumption of 3.8 percent GDP growth in2005 seems well within reach
inview ofthe higher-than-expected, broad-based growthperformance last year. A moderationo f
US. growth, lower oil prices, higher international interest rates and increased political
uncertainty in the run-up to the presidential elections and change o f administration are slowing
down economic growth inthe medium term.

20.     Sound monetary and fiscal policies will contribute to a continuation of the broad-
based economic growth that will avoid the creation of major macroeconomic imbalances
and lead to only a gradual and moderate increase of the country's balance of payments
current account deficit. Consolidation o f the progress attained inthe reduction o f inflation, the
banking sector, and reforms inthe country's financial sector will continue the healthy expansion
o f domestic credit and financial intermediation contributing to the growth o f domestic
consumption and investment inline with the steady development o f external demand. Financing
o f the country's external deficit, at about 2.0 - 2.5 percent o f GDP, will continue to take place
largely through non-debt creating foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, thereby maintaining
the current moderate vulnerability to adverse shifts inmarket sentiment.

21.     The government's          medium-term     fiscal framework aims at further           fiscal
consolidation and reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio. With the presentation o f its
2005 budget in September o f last year, the government updated its medium-term fiscal
projections for the period covering 2005-2008. The projections include ambitious targets on the
budget balance, consisting o f a small budget surplus as o f 2006, and a reduction o f off-budget
financing incorporating only existing PIDIREGAS projects. The fiscal consolidation effort
envisaged inthis framework should reduce the net augmented debt to about 35 percent o f GDP
by 2008. Bank staff estimates on the basis o f current information, including an adjustment of
economic growth and oil price assumptions for the period, points at a more gradual reduction o f
the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 39 percent by 2008. These estimates assume that the government
will be able to attain its budgetbalance target and allow for a slightly higher thanenvisaged off-
budget financing o f publicly guaranteed private sector financed investments inthe energy sector
inorder to assure future oilproduction.

22.     Despite some remaining vulnerabilities, public debt management diminished the
exposure to refinancing, interest and exchange rate risks. A consistent implementation o f the
public debt management strategy aimed at reducing vulnerabilities and long-term financing costs
has led to a significant strengthening o f the government's debt structure. The increasing use
made o f long-term fixed rate peso denominated bonds (with 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20-year fixed rate
notes now issued on a regular basis) to finance public sector needs contributed to a rapid increase
in the average maturity of domestic government debt, a reduction of debt and debt service
payment sensitivity to changes in interest rates or inflation, andthe development o f the domestic
yield curve. External financing of budgetary financing needs has been restricted to the
refinancing o f existing liabilities and repayments, thereby limitingthe increase inexternal debt to
the off-budget PIDIREGAS debt. As the latter i s used for investment in the energy sector
(primarilyoil), generating mainly foreigncurrency related revenue, this policy has contributedto
a reduction o f exchange rate risk o f public debt. The Hacienda cycle and Transformation
program includes public debt management activities within SHCP in areas such as registration,
accounting and on-line availability o f informationon public debt and debt transactions enhancing
the implementation o f debt and debt service related operations and the formulation o f adequate
debt management strategies.

23.     Mexico's macroeconomic framework is solid and is adequate for the purpose of this
operation. Progress achieved in attaining macroeconomic stability i s starting to pay off with
economic growth stabilizing around the economy's current growth potential. Improvements in
the country's sovereign credit risk ratings are yet another reflection of such progress achieved


                                                 8

and provide a reasonable assurance o f continued adequate access to external finance, even at
times o f increased market volatility. The Hacienda Transformation program further enhances the
ability o f the government to implement fiscal policies, including the formulation o f adjustments
incase of shocks byproviding accurate andtimely informationonthe evolution ofpublic sector
revenue and expenditure.

24.        Environmental degradation and unsustainableuse of natural resources can affect
the country's prospects for long-term economic growth. The tourism sector (which
contributes about 9 percent of GDP) would seriously overlook and compromise its growth by not
incorporating the -environment and its potential impact on the sector. Inthe case o f the energy
sector, environmental impacts on human healthcan affect labor productivity. A casual estimation
suggests that a 10 percent reduction in ozone and fine particulate matter levels would be
associated with health and productivity benefits o f US$2 billion per year.5The forestry sector is
affected by continued deforestation, which i s associated with an increased frequency inflooding
and landslides, loss o fagricultural landdue to erosion, andloss o flivelihoods for forest dwellers,
most o f whom are impoverished. Finally, water pollution has been estimated by the National
Water Commission (CNA) to result ina significant loss o f social welfare.

25.        Impacts of environmental degradation on human health, economic activities, and
social welfare indicate that the incorporationof environmental concerns in key economic
sectors is crucial to ensure the sustainability of long-term economic growth. The costs of
addressing environmental degradation and unsustainable use o fnaturalresources crowd out other
socially desirable expenses which could undermine long-term macroeconomic stability.
Safeguarding the environment and natural resource base over the long-term serves as a
complement to sound macroeconomic policies in enabling sustained high quality growth. Since
much environmental degradation results from productive sectors, there i s a growing need for
inter-sectoral coordination inorder to address them adequately.

A.         GOVERNMENT'SOVERALL PROGRAM

26.        Environmental degradation and overexploitation o f natural resources lie at the very core
o f Mexico's development challenges. The loss o f social welfare associated with these factors has
been estimated at 10 percent o f GDP, while expenditure in environmental protection has
averaged around 0.5% percent o f GDP6. These estimates underscore significant loss o f
productivity andinefficient use of valuable resources, which the environment sector can address
adequately only by coordinating its efforts with those o f the economic sectors that are
responsible for the largest share ofenvironmental degradation.

27.      The GOMhas embarked on an extensive reform program aimed to enhancethe country's
competitiveness and stimulate economic growth'. At the core o f this program, the G O M
acknowledges significant potential linkages between environment, competitiveness, and
economic growth. These potential linkages are evident in: (i)the opportunity to employ
Mexico's richly endowed natural environment as a competitive advantage to meet the demands
o f more selective and lucrative markets; and (ii) need for governmental interventions to
                                                            the
address the inability o f the market to mitigate the negative impacts o f environmental degradation
on humanhealth, productivity, and competitiveness.

28.      The overarching objectives o f the ENVSAL program were designed specifically to
support the G O M in introducing policy reforms that strategically focus on the above-mentioned
linkages in order to mainstream the environment in key sectors and improve the effectiveness
and efficiency o f local environmental management. Specific actions accomplished by the GOM
with the support o f ENVDPL I1 are presented in Annex 2. With respect to environmental
mainstreaming in key development agendas, the GOM has selected four sectors in which
environmental issues are closely linkedwith the country's broader development agenda: tourism,
energy, water andforestry. Results from analytical work show that environmental mainstreaming
i s crucial inthese sectors for the sustainability o f Mexico's growth,' particularly since the sectors
play a fundamental role infostering or constraining economic growth and investment.

29.      In2001, the GOMpresentedits "National Development Plan(NDP) 2001-2006," which
outlines the policies and strategies that the Federal Government would pursue to achieve
Mexico's development goals. The NDP identifies the country's priorities and provides the basis
for the creation o f three cabinet-level commissions to address them. The commissions focus on
three strategic areas: Social and Human Development, Growth with Quality (sustainable
economic development), andOrder and Respect (governance and rule of law). The importance o f
the environment and natural resource sector inthe NDP is highlightedby the fact that it is the
only sector that i s included in all three commissions, inrecognition of: (i)         the linkages between
environment and social welfare in promoting social and human development; (ii)                   the need to
rationally use the country's natural capital and its environment to stimulate sustainable growth;
and (iii) urgency of environmental problems related to water and forestry that require themto
          the
betreated as national security issues.

30.      The NDP lists the programs to be carried out by the executive branch and describes the
twelve principles that guide their development and implementation. Four o f these principles are
o fparticular relevance for environmental management:
     (i)Sustainability means that environmental considerations areto be incorporated inall
     government programs;
     (ii)Competitiveness calls for increased efficiency and effectiveness inregulation and
     governmental services to assist the development o fthe productive sector;
     (iii)
         Federalism calls for greater decentralization basedon efficacy; and

with the support ofmultilateral organizationssuchas OECD, ECLAC, andthe World Bank.

    (iv) Transparency requires setting clear criteria and procedures for governmental decision-
    makingprocesses and informing the citizenry about the progress of federal programs andthe
    resources that they used.

31.     In line with the NDP, the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources
(SEMARNAT) prepared the Environment andNatural Resources Program (ENRP) 2001-2006.
The ENRP lays out a new environmental policy, which stresses the need to mainstream the
sustainability principle inthe actions of ministries and institutions representing various economic
sectors. SEMARNAT developed 16 additional programs to address different environmental
concerns. Among these i s the Program to Promote Sustainable Development in the Federal

to improve the sustainability o f their actions, together with corresponding specific goals.
Government (PSDFG), which outlined activities to be undertaken by 16 ministries and a encies        5 Early
in2004, the ENRP was expanded to incorporate goals for a total of 32 public institutions inthe
Environmental Mainstreaming Agenda for Sustainable Development.

32.     The importance of mainstreaming environmental concerns in key productive sectors o f
the economy is evident in light o f the common underlying objective in each o f the sectors
mentioned above to incorporate principles of sustainability in their actions and activities. The
GOM has identified the tourism, energy, forestry, and water sectors as key drivers o f economic
growth inthe country and i s taking significant steps to guarantee that economic growth does not
occur at the expense o f environmental degradation. Environmental mainstreaming allows the
GOMto ensure that the significant contributions o fthese sectorsto the welfare o fthe country are
not undermined by undesirable impacts on health and productivity.

33.     In 2002, the GOM requested the Bank's support for the strategic components o f its
program described above. ENVDPL I1 aims to deepen and consolidate the reforms that were
initiated under the first operation (ENVSAL I)     by providing assistanceto continue the efforts o f
the GOM: (i)   to mainstream environmental considerations inkey economic sectors identified as
priorities, namely tourism, energy, water, and forestry, and (ii)       to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness o f environmental management processes. Environmental mainstreaming will help
advance Mexico's sustainability agenda and will focus on the four sectors that have been
selected by the GOM. In line with the NDP, improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f
environmental management processes will support the environmental sector's contributions to
enhancing competitiveness, decentralization, and transparency. The following sections describe
indetail the environmental challenges faced ineach ofthe four priority sectors andthe GOM's
program to incorporate sustainability inthe sectors by addressing the environmental challenges.

34.     The tourism sector has been, and continues to be, one o f Mexico's main drivers o f
economic growth. Mainstreaming environmental considerations into the tourism sector has
allowed Mexico to strengthen its competitive advantages to meet the demand o fhighend market
segments and provide a more sustainable basis for all tourism activities. The sector generates

approximately 9 percent o f the country's GDP and over 5 percent o f paidjobs nationwide.'O The
industry also provides relatively high-payingjobs, with highaverage annual earnings relative to
the national average. International tourism, largely explains the industry' s vigor. During 2003,
tourism generated foreign currency inflows close to US$ 9,500 million, the third largest amount
after oil exports and remittances. Tourism in Mexico has significant growth potential, as the
country ranks Sth among world tourist destinations and receives roughly 3 percent o f the world's
travelers. Revenues from international tourists have grown since 2000 and official sources
forecast a 42.5 percent increase for the period 2000-2006, based on projected U.S. economic
recovery and the comparative advantage o f Mexican destinations." These figures attest to the
progress that Mexico has achieved inreversing the loss o f competitiveness that characterized the
sector duringthe 1 9 9 0 ~ ' ~

35.      The importance o f the liqkages between the tourism sector's growth and environmental
quality i s evident. A recent customer perception survey o f 18 variables that affect the satisfaction
o f tourists with their travel experiences, conducted by the Secretariat o f Tourism (SECTUR) in
2002 and 2003, indicated that among the key factors that determine the selection o f tourist
destinations in the country are (in order o f importance) security, environmental quality, and
attractiveness o f features at tourist sites. Two o f these factors, however, cannot be manipulated
easily by the sector. The effects o f security are clear from observations o f tourist volumes to
Mexico following September 11, 2001. Increased security measures post-September 11
contributed to renewing tourists' confidence and attitudes to international travel and resulted in
increased tourist volumes in Mexico. The attractiveness o f a tourist site is typically an
independent variable defined by the presence or absence o f certain intrinsic qualities o f the site
and as such, offers limited opportunity to be affected for the purpose of influencing tourist
activity. By contrast, the environmental quality factor offers a greater opportunity to be
influenced for the purpose o f strengthening tourist activity and indeed the development o f the
sector.

36.      Environmental quality was rated as barely satisfactory and received the lowest score o f
all variables examinedinthe 2002 customer perception survey.l3             Environmental deterioration, as
perceived by surveyed tourists, was the direct consequence o f the sector's development path in
which activities geared toward attracting a larger number o f visitors were not matched with
adequate planningand investment to ensure that tourist sites developed adequate infrastructure to
service visitors. This situation was aggravated by the fact that an increase in the number o f
visitors results in a growth o f the local population, as the industry's high paying jobs attract
individuals from other locations. Consequently, many local authorities had been unable to
develop adequate infrastructure to dispose o f and treat wastes generated by tourists and local
populations. The importance of tourism development that i s balanced with adequate

environmental management is hrther highlighted given the trend among a growing number o f
consumers to demand sustainable practices inthe destinations that they choose to visit.

37.      In addition to the environmental problems described above, Mexico's tourist industry
faces the challenge o f diversifying inorder to remaincompetitive as some segments o fthe tourist
market shift from massive "sun and sand" destinations, which account for 32 percent o f
internationaltravel to Mexico, to "theme" travel. Tourism studies inthe region have shown that
international tourists are willing to pay more for, and spend more time in, destinations with
greater diversity, meaning a greater variety o f both in-site activities andtypes o f natural settings
that can be visited. As a biologically and culturally diverse country, Mexico i s well positionedto
attract a growing number o f      tourist^.'^

38.      In2001, the GOM developed a strategy to increase its market share inthe tourism sector
by increasing its competitiveness, which is inextricably linked to the quality and diversity of the
environment. In that same year SECTUR presented the National Program for Tourism 2001-
2006, which acknowledges the limitations o f the sector's past development model and
establishes the attainment o f sustainable destinations as one o f the key pillars o f the program.
Starting in 2003, SECTUR developed various programs aimed at increasing the sector's
sustainability, including: (i)    Mkxico Limpio y Querido, a program that, among other goals, seeks
to reduce pollution intourist destinations, particularly from solid wastes; (ii)            The Agenda 21 for
Mexican Tourism, which provides a fi-amework for action aimed at sustainable tourism
development with a strong emphasis on implementation at the municipal level; and (iii)a
programto foster the compliance oftourist facilities with environmental law.

39.      The National Program for Tourism 2001-2006 seeks to establish tourism as a national
priority, anchored to the following inter-related pillars: (i)              achieving satisfaction o f tourists
traveling in Mexico; (ii)attaining sustainable destinations; and (iii)developing competitive
tourism businesses. The program recognizes the inter-connection o f the tourism sector with other
sectors o f the economy, and consequently promotes a model that fosters inter-sectoral
coordination as a means to strengthen the competitiveness o f the sector and achieve lasting
results. With respect to attaining sustainable destinations, the program promotes actions aimed at
strengthening the capacity o f local and regional actors to address the challenges o f tourism
development; creating regional synergies that promote integration and increase competitiveness;
and implementingprograms and projects within a framework of sustainability. In addition, the
program seeks to incorporate state and municipal institutions as integral participants o f the
program's strategy through the assignment o f adequate financial resources and the definition o f
concrete regional plans according to regional needs.

40.      One o f the main elements o f the National Program for Tourism is the promotion o f
sustainable development o ftourism consistent with the government's goal o f growth with quality
and in collaboration with the environment sector and other local actors. Efforts to this end
include preparation, consensus-building and implementation o f a Program for Sustainable
Tourism, aimed at ensuring that new tourism developments do not create significant

environmental problems and at remediating environmental damage in existing destinations
through several activities, including: (i)implementing Agenda 21 recommendations; (ii)
preparation with SEMARNAT o f a municipal agenda for environmental management; (iii)
preparation o f an environmental agenda for coastal municipalities; (iv) implementation o f a
monitoring system for sustainable tourism to facilitate the evaluation o f existing environmental
conditions at tourist destinations and the impact o f actions to promote sustainability; and (v)
carrying out a communication programto publicly disseminate information on successful cases.

41.     The ENVSAL Isupported the designo f the Government's Programaimed at ensuringthe
mainstreaming o f environmental concerns in tourism through: (i)the establishment o f
appropriate goals for the medium-term, (ii)  the implementation o f key building blocks to move
towards these goals, (iii)the coordination o f and strengthened consensus among key
stakeholders, and (iv) the systematic measurement o f progress and impact. Specifically, the
GOM moved forward with the design and implementation o f a National Program for Tourism
2001-2006 that emphasizes environmental mainstreaming. The Intersectoral Technical Working
Group (ITWG) for the tourism sector was established to play a key role in definingthe sectoral
agenda and priorities, with input from other sectors. Inaddition, the ENVSAL Isupported legal
reforms designed to decrease the overexploitation of, and improve the operation o f and
investments in, national tourism resources through direct and indirect charges. These reforms
included Congress' approval o f articles 198, 198a, and 238-B o f the Ley Federal de Derechos,
which allow for user fees for maritime activities, protected areas, and whale-watching,
respectively, with provisions for earmarking revenue generated by a particular tourism resource
for reinvestment in that resource. As a result, a 200-fold increase in marine park revenues was
achieved under ENVSAL Iby rechanneling funds generated from marine user fees from
protected areas back to the sector. To foster increased transparency and improvements in
environmental management, the G O M publicly discloses information on the amount o f funds
collected from user fees for protected areas.

B.l     ACTIONS SUPPORTED BY ENVDPL I1

42.     Duringthe last three years, SECTUR has established coordination mechanisms with the
environmental sector and other stakeholders to address the tourism sector's challenges by: (i)
coordinating the public and private sector efforts to ensure that tourism-related activities do not
create significant environmental problems, and that adequate investments are made to minimize
the sector's environmental impacts; (ii) developing higher-value tourism products inconjunction
with tourism authorities; and (iii)ensuring that adequate financing is available for the provision
and maintenance o f public goods that attract tourists, such as beaches, natural protected areas,
and environmental quality. Specific actions completed inthe tourism sector with the support o f
ENVDPL I1are described below and summarized inAnnex 3.

43.     To promote sustainable tourism development, the GOM has developed pilot local Agenda
21 action plans in 14 key tourism destinations: Acapulco, Cozumel, Bahia de Banderas,
Campeche, Cuetzalan, Guanajuato, Huatulco, Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Los Cabos, Manzanillo,
Mazatlh, Oaxaca, Patzcuaro and San Miguel de Allende. The Agenda 21 for Mexican Tourism
proposes strategies and actions inthe short, medium and long terms that aim to: (i) strengthen the
sustainable development o f tourism areas; (ii)   promote participation o f local communities in
tourism-related activities; and (iii) the preservation o f natural and cultural resources o f
                                    ensure


                                              14

tourist destinations in Mexico. Local Agenda 21 Committees inthese tourist destinations play a
central role in building consensus among stakeholders for the implementation o f strategies to
maximize social welfare, economic benefits, and environmental quality.

44.      The G O M has established and begunimplementationo f a set o f indicators and
benchmarks to measure good environmental performance intourist facilities and destinations. In
addition, SECTUR, PROFEPA (Procuraduria Federal de Proteccidn a1Ambiente, Federal
Attorney General for Environmental Regulation) andthe MexicanAssociation o f Hotels and
Motels launched a certification scheme in2004 to recognize responsible environmental
performance by tourist facilities basedon established environmental indicators o f sustainable
tourism. The programprovides incentives for full compliance with environmental law, which i s
verified through voluntary audits. As o fMay 2005, ten large tourist facilities (including hotels,
golf clubs, and marinas) hadbeen certified.

45.      The General Law for Prevention and Integrated Waste Management (Ley Generalpara la
Prevencidn y Gestidn Integral de 10s Residuos), enacted by the GOM inOctober 2003, provides
a framework that fosters implementation o f waste management plans, particularly in urban
settings, and i s consequently a much needed tool to foster the development o f mechanisms for
private and public sector participation in the design and implementation o f waste management
plans intourist sites."

46.      In addition, SECTUR, SEMARNAT, the Secretariat of Health and the Mexican Navy
initiated an Integrated Program for Clean Beaches (Programa Integral de Playas Limpias) in
2003 to monitor and publicly disclose water quality data o f Mexican beaches. Although the
program met initial resistance stemming from concerns on potential negative publicity caused by
water pollution warnings, it has triggered substantive efforts by national and sub-national
governments for the adequatetreatment o fwastewater discharges.

47.      Inresponseto the growing number of cruises that travel to Mexico, SECTUR developed
a public policy containing provisions to mitigate their environmental impacts. As part o f this
policy, SECTUR conducted a study to assess the carrying capacity o f a tourist destination. Based
on the assessment, SECTUR has continued efforts to limit the number o f cruises to avoid a loss
o fnatural capital.

48.      The GOMhas found the ITWGs to be a useful mechanism for the delivery o fhighquality
products based on collaboration with other sectors. To underscore this, the President created the
Comisidn Intersecretarial de Turismo in 2004, which provides the institutional framework for
better inter-institutional coordination among federal authorities, private sector and civil society
around the sector's main challenges and opportunities. Within the framework o f this


l5The General Law for Prevention and Integrated Management o f Wastes has created the conditions for ensuring
that municipalities assume the responsibility for collection, transport and final disposal of wastes, as well as for the
separation o f solid municipal wastes l?om hazardous wastes. Also, the Law incorporates the private sector in the
provision o fwaste management services and inthe use o fwaste sub-products inactivities such as energy generation.
The local Agenda 21 action plans have promoted collaboration among the public sector, private sector, and civil
society to develop investment plans to address sustainable development priority issues in the main tourist
destinations. Local Agenda 21 plans also have facilitated agreements for increases in tariffs for the provision o f
water, wastewater treatment, and waste management services.

commission, ENVDPLI1supports the GOM with upstream analytical work and direct responses
to mitigate the environmental challenges faced by the tourism sector. Analytical work supported
by ENVDPL I1 will inform consensus-building and provide the basis for adoption and
implementation o f an environmental policy for the tourism sector endorsed by SECTUR. Such
analytical work includes: (i)    the development of scenarios of tourism sector expansion; (ii)    the
assessment o f potential impacts o f alternative scenarios, including environmental and social
costs, constraints and benefits; (iii) the assessment o f effectiveness o f current policy instruments;
(iv) the assessment o f institutional capacity for environmental management; and (v) the
identification o f priority issues and design or revision of public policy and areas and regions o f
critical developments.

B.2     PERSPECTIVESFORENVDPL I11

49.     Buildingon the achievements of ENVDPL 11, the GOM has committed in the medium
term to: (i)increase the number of tourist destinations with local Agenda 21 action plans,
including investment plans, from 14 to 35; (ii)develop a methodology to incorporate
environmental considerations into urban and regional planningwithin Agenda 21 action plans;
and (iii) a unified sustainable tourism strategy endorsedby SECTUR based on findings o f
          adopt
the strategic sectoral study supported by ENVDPL I1and through high-level workshops aimed at
consensus-building involving all stakeholders.

C.      ENVIRONMENTALCHALLENGESINTHE ENERGYSECTOR
        AND GOVERNMENTSTRATEGY

50.     InMexico, the energy sector is an important pillar of economic growth with significant
comparative advantages. The energy sector accounts for 3 percent o f GDP, 8 percent o f all
exports, 37 percent o f fiscal revenues, and close to 60 percent o f public investment.16 According
to the World Economic Forum both its oil reserves and natural gas production rank 9th in the
world.

51.     The country's abundant reserves o f fossil fuels have played a key role in meeting
Mexico's growing energy demand over the last decade. Hydrocarbons account for close to 90
percent o f primary energy prod~ction.'~Both Mexico's per capita and total final energy
consumption have risen over time, but the country's energy efficiency efforts have achieved
reductions in terms o f energy intensity per unit o f GDP. Nonetheless, Mexico has an energy
intensity (total primary energy supply/GDP) o f 0.42, which i s well above the 0.29 and 0.19
averages for Latin American and OECD countries, respectively. Consequently, there i s a need
and a basis for the country to implement policies that will increase energy efficiency and
renewable energy substantially. Furthermore, as a member o f the global economy, Mexico faces
the dual challenge a f producing goods that satisfy the needs o f its domestic market andthose o f
its trading partners,' which are often govemed by more stringent energy and environmental
standards.

52.     The environmental impacts o f energy sector activities, especially those impacts
associated with energy consumption, are likely to increase as Mexico's economic growth

continues. Analytical work conducted by the Bank found that Mexico's GDP growth rates would
be the largest determinant of air pollutant emissions inthe coming decade." Energy combustion
has been associated with significant outdoor and indoor air pollution. Ambient air pollution
concentrations in the country's largest cities often exceed national environmental standards,
partly due to poor fuel quality. In2002, the percentage o f days during which concentrations o f
air pollutants exceeded environmental standards in major cities was 80 percent in Mexico City
Metropolitan Area, 40 percent in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area, and 27 percent in the
Monterrey Metropolitan Area.19 Air pollution is estimated to affect 35 million people and to
cause between 2,000 and 4,000 premature deaths per year.20Back-of-the-envelope calculations
conducted in 2002 as part of a comprehensive study for air pollution in the Mexico City
Metropolitan Area indicated that a 10 percent reduction in fine particulate matter and ozone
levels would be associated with health and productivity benefits o f US$2 billion per year.21With
respect to indoor air pollution, as o f the ear 2000, some 17 million people relied on fuelwood
for cooking, particularly in rural areas?' Typically, women and children are most fi-equently
exposed to high particulate matter concentrations in homes where firewood i s used for domestic
purposes, and consequently are affected by the adverse health impacts such as acute respiratory
infections.

53.      Activities in the energy sector, notably from oil and electricity producing facilities,
generate significant amounts o f air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid andhazardous wastes
and other precursors of environmental degradation. In2000, SEMARNAT identified oil as one
o f two subsectors that generated the largest costs in terms o f environmental degradation and
depletion o f natural capital. The electricity, gas, and water subsectors taken jointly account for
the third largest costs associated with environmental degradati~n.~~Mexico i s the ninth largest
emitter o f greenhouse gases in the world, with an emission intensity similar to the world
average24and 47 percent o f its emissions result from energy production and c~nsumption.~~
Mexico has a clear stake in reducing environmental degradation in the energy sector and in
limitingthe emission o fgreenhouse gases.

54.      To addressthe challenges described above, the Secretariat o f Energy (SENER) developed
the Energy Sector Program (Programa Sectorial de Energia, PROSENER) in 2001, which
recognizes the sector's potential contributions to sustainable development, including the
sustainable use of renewable energy resources, increasing energy efficiency, producing a higher
percentage o f energy from renewable sources, and implementing environmental management
programs in oil and gas facilities as well as in electricity production, transmission and

distribution. In 2002, the energy and environment sectors jointly developed the Environmental
Energy Program, which includes sustainability goals for the sector's commitments per the
Sustainable Development Program (SLIP) developed by SEMARNAT.

55.     The Energy Sector Program developed under the framework o f the NDP, emphasizes
sustainable development by balancing developments inthe energy sector with economic, social
and environmental concerns. The program aims to promote environmental sustainability through
strengthening o f the GOM's capacity to design and apply policies to promote changes in
production and consumption practices inthe energy sector, and for all end users. The strategies
o f PROSENER include: (i)the development o f an energy-environment policy; (ii)the
development and strengthening o f policies to promote clean fuels; (iii)the promotion o f
compliance with environmental regulations by businesses in the sector; (iv) the promotion o f
sustainable energy projects; and (v) the mitigation o f greenhouse gases. The program establishes
mechanisms for monitoring andperiodic evaluation o f compliance with the goals o fthe program.
The Environment Program for the Energy Sector was developed as a cross-component o f
PROSENER andthe National Environment andNatural Resources Program (ENRP).

56.     Under ENVSAL Ithe Government designed and implemented an environmental
mainstreaming program that: (i)established goals for the medium-term, (ii)designed key
buildingblocks to move towards these goals, (iii)   established and implementeda mechanism for
coordination and consensus building among key stakeholders, and (iv) designed a monitoring
system for measuring progress and the impact o f the mainstreaming program. An ITWG was
established for the energy sector to play a key role toward achieving intersectoral coordination
andconsensus-building.

C.l     ACTIONS SUPPORTED BY ENVDPL I1

57.     Building on the progress made under ENVSAL I,ENVDPL I1 supports the
implementation and consolidation o f reforms aimed at incorporating environmental concerns in
energy sector activities. In this direction, the energy sector has carried out analytical work to
inform the development of an environmental policy for the energy sector (energy-environment
policy). A study completed during the first semester o f 2004 evaluated and integrated previous
studies to: (i) develop scenarios for expansion o f the energy sector, including the emissions
associatedwith each scenario and the potential for renewable energies; (ii)  estimate the potential
impacts o f the different scenarios, including the social and environmental costs and benefits; (iii)
evaluate the effectiveness o f the existing policy instruments; and (iv) identify priority areas and
issues. Specific actions completed in the energy sector with the support o f ENVDPL I1 are
described below and summarized inAnnex 3.

58.     Another initiative supported by ENVDPL I1isithe energy sector's efforts to reduce its
contribution to air pollution and the negative impacts it has on health. To this end, SENER has
worked with the other energy sector agencies and with environmental authorities to strengthen
the national clean fuels policy. Petrbleus Mexicanus (PEMEX), the state oil monopoly, has made
advancements in improving fuel quality by reducing the sulfur content from 1000 to 300 ppm in
Premium gasoline usedinthe Mexico City Metropolitan Area, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. The
GOM has assessed investment needsto reduce sulfur content inall gasoline and diesel by 2008.       '




                                                18

59.     Interms ofaddressing energy and environmental healthlinkages inrural areas, the GOM
has started to design and implement actions to address indoor air pollution caused by domestic
consumption o f fuelwood, including small rural electrification projects in selected states. The
projects constituted the seed for a National Program for Rural Electrification that is being
designedby GOM withthe support o fthe World Bank andGEFthroughthe Rural Electrification
project, implementation o f which is expected to begin in late 2005 or early 2006. The projects
are expected to benefit the most vulnerable groups, such as women and childrenthat are exposed
to indoor air pollution and who devote a significant share o f their time to gathering wood for fuel
rather thanto other economic activities.

60.     The GOM has taken steps to increase energy generation from renewable sources.
Specifically, the GOM has introduced economic incentives, with the approval in 2004 o f fiscal
provisions for the accelerated depreciation o f renewable energy capital. Also, the G O M has
undertaken further analytical work to guide the development o f additional instruments to
promote the development o f renewable energy sources, such as a study to develop a national
fund for renewable energy promotion, assess the incentives for independent producers of
renewable energy, and evaluate pricing and transmission policy options for renewable energy.

61,     The GOM's efforts to promote energy efficiency include the development o f mandatory
standards for equipments, sectoral programs, implementation o f methodologies for measuring
and monitoring energy efficiency baselines by sector, as well as business models and contract
forms for third party delivery o f energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, as a first step in
addressing existing distortions inthe electricity sector, CFE has begunpublishing the electricity
subsidies in individual utility bills, which i s expected to increase the transparency o f the tariff
and subsidystructures.

62.     Within the DPL framework, the energy and environmental sectors have also taken
significant steps to coordinate their efforts to reduce Mexico's contribution to climate change.
The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Office was established in 2004 in accordance with
the rules set up at the Marrakech and Bonn Conferences o f the Parties o f the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change. In April 2005, SEMARNAT, SENER and other
Ministries modified the agreement which created the Intersectoral Commission for Climate
Change, incharge o f the definition o f the national policies on climate change. This Commission
includes the Mexican C D M Office that has worked to increase the portfolio o f carbon offset
investments suitable for Carbon Finance.

63.     Another tangible step to reduce the sector's environmental impacts has been the
implementation o f environmental management systems (EMS) to reduce contamination by
PEMEX and by the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), which provides electricity to 90
percent o f the population. EMS have contributed to important achievements: (i) 63 percent
                                                                                       a
reduction inflaring o f natural gas (from oil and gas production); (ii) an increase from 22 percent
to 37 percent in the contribution o f natural gas to electricity production, mostly displacing fuel
oil; (iii)15 percent reduction in SO;! emissions associated with electricity generation; and (iv) a
         a
51percent reductiono f waste discharges to water bodies by PEMEX facilities.

C.2      PERSPECTIVESFORENVDPLI11

64.      Based on the results o f the strategic sectoral study supported by ENVDPL I1and high-
level workshops that will be conducted under ENVDPL 111, the GOM i s committed to the
adoption by relevant agencies o f a unified energy-environment strategy, endorsed by SENER. In
this context, the GOMexpects to continue its effortstowardenvironmental mainstreaming inthe
energy sector via three initiatives:
    (i) Buildingsupport o fkey stakeholders and implementingthe energy-environment policy;
    (ii) Conducting an analysis o f the environmental and economic benefits o f reducing the
    sulfur content infuels; and
    (iii)Developing a package o f legal and regulatory reforms for the promotion o f renewable
    energy resources.

D.       ENVIRONMENTALCHALLENGESINTHE FORESTRYSECTORAND
         GOVERNMENTSTRATEGY

65.      Approximately 28 percent o f Mexico's land area o f 197 million hectares i s covered by
forests and rain forests, and approximately 50 percent o f that surface has the potential for
commercial exploitation. In 1999, Mexico's forests accounted for over 1.2 percent o f GDP and
generated over 100,000 permanent jobs. An analysis prepared in 2001 found that institutional
weaknesses, such as lack o f clearly defined property rights, inefficient regulations, absence o f
inter-agency coordination, lack o f financial instruments that respond to long maturity periods o f
forestry sector investments, and policy failures (including subsidiesto agricultural activities) had
contributed to unsustainable practices that limitedthe realization o fthe sector's potential.

66.      The forestry sector faces environmental and sectoral challenges that are linked closely
with causes of poverty in Mexico. Some of the most serious challenges identified by the 2001
diagnosis included a highdeforestation rate o f about 1.1percent per year or 600,000 hectares per
year26that impacts the livelihoods o f the people that live inforests, most o f whom are poor.27At
the same time, an under-developed forest industry, as indicated by the fact that only 40 percent
o f the forest cover with potential for commercial exploitation i s currently managed for that
purpose, represents a significant loss of income-generating activities. Sustainable forest
management therefore continues to be essential both to provide opportunities for income-
generating activities and to reduce the negative impacts o f deforestation on forest-dwelling
communities.

67.      To address the multiple challenges faced by the forestry sector, the GOM established in
2001 the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) by Presidential Decree. In 2002,
CONAFOR prepared the National Forestry Program, based on the sector's long-term vision for
year 2025. The Program establishes the medium-termpriorities o f the sector which include: (i)
regulatory and policy reforms to consolidate decentralization processes inthe forestry sector; (ii)
the development of a reliable and publicly accessible forest information system to facilitate

resources; (v) an increase o f productivity and competitiveness in the sector by fostering
modernization o f industry and technology, and the integration o f productive chains through
increased private sector investments and efficient marketing systems; and (vi) the promotion and
development o f an environmental services market, improved basin msinagement system and
decentralization of forest management.

68.     The ENVSAL Iprogram supported the GOM's efforts to (i)         establish appropriate goals
for the medium-term, (ii)    implement key building blocks to move towards these goals, (iii)
ensure coordination and strengthened consensus among key stakeholders, and (iv) systematically
measure progress and impact. An ITWG was established for the forestry sector and continues to
play a key role inintersectoral coordinationand consensus-building.

D.1     ACTIONS SUPPORTEDBY ENVDPLI1

69.     One o f the GOM's major achievements in environmental mainstreaming has been the
enactment o f the General Law for Sustainable Forestry Development and its regulations. The
Law assigns clearly defined roles and responsibilities to the different agencies, sub-national
governments and stakeholders that are directly involved in the sector. The Law stresses the
separation of functions between SEMARNAT's role in formulating a forestry policy that is
consistent with the national environmental policy and CONAFOR's responsibilities in the
promotion o f the sector's productive, protection, conservation and restoration activities. The Law
also allows for the consolidation o f inter-agency collaborationto carry out the sector's strategies,
including coordination with PROFEPA to strengthen inspection and enforcement activities, joint
efforts with CONANP to build synergies between biodiversity conservation through the
establishment and management o f natural protected areas and sustainable forest management,
and increased dialogue with SAGARPA (Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural
Development, FishingandNutrition) to mitigate the negative impacts o f agricultural activities on
forest ecosystems.

70.     The Law incorporates environmental considerations in the national forestry policy that
aim to ensure: (i) the protection, sustained provision, and valuation o f environmenta1 goods and
services; (ii)increased social participation in the establishment o f policies and the design and
implementationo f programs through the development o f sector-specific cultural and educational
programs and considerations to address the needs o f indigenous groups; (iii)         mitigation o f
environmental risks and impacts associated with sector activities; and (iv) advancements in
decentralization o f forestry functions and coordination with sub-national entities to integrate
resources.

71.     The new law and regulations are consistent with the Bank's forestry strategy. In
particular, they: (i)facilitate the participation o f poor communities in sustainable forest
management and incorporate provisions to protect the rights of indigenous communities and
ejiduturios; (ii)integrate forests in sustainable economic development by focusing on enhancing
the sector's competitiveness and productivity; and (iii)   protect vital and global environmental

services by including provisions for the valuation and payment o f services that include
hydrological services, carbon sequestration, eco-tourism, and biodiversity.28

72.      CONAFOR periodically evaluates existing policies and programs, and uses these
findings as the basis for further policy improvements. As part o f these efforts, CONAFOR
contracted several academic institutions to conduct an independent evaluation o f several
programs, including the Program for Prevention and Control o f Wildfires, the Program for
Forestry Development, the National Reforestation Program, the Program for the Development o f
Commercial Forest Plantations, and the Program for the Payment o f Hydrologic Environmental
Services. Key findings that are consistent across all the evaluations include: (i)              positive social
impacts stemming from job creation and support for sustainable forestry management; (ii)
economic benefits, as evidenced by the positive net present value o f each program; and (iii)
increased trust in governmental agencies and satisfaction with government programs. All the
actions described above are summarized inAnnex 3.

D.2      PERSPECTIVESFORENVDPLI11

73.      The GOM intends to take steps inthe future to ensure the continuity and sustainability o f
the environmental mainstreaming program inthe forestry sector. These actions would include the
continued implementation o f the new forestry law and regulations, along with strengthening the
capacities o f vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples and ejidatarios, to take advantage o f
the new legal framework. In addition, the GOM will establish new benchmarks for forestry
sector programs that aim to create income-generating alternatives to improve the livelihoods o f
forest communities. Also, implementation o f the new legal framework for certification will
continue.

74.      With the support o f ENVDPL 11, the GOM recently conducted a study to promote
adequate valuation o f environmental services and establish the fiscal, market, and financial
mechanisms to facilitate payment for the preservation o f forest ecosystems in an effort to
alleviate poverty. The study examines the lack o f adequate funding for sustainable forest
development, as well as the risks that result from the extended maturity periods that characterize
investmentin sustainable forest management. Based on the results of this study, CONAFOR is
committed to establish mechanisms to improve access to financial services and products for
forestry sector investment.

law provides formal mechanisms for the payment o f eavironmental services, adequate valuation o fnatural
resources, andthe development markets for non-timber products.

out o f thirteen hydrologic-administrative regions are in a situation o f water stress,30 and
continued problems with water quality and quantity inMexico could constrain economic growth
inthe near future. The countryhas anaveragenatural water availability of4,547 m3/person/year.
This figure masks the extreme difference, however, between the country's southeast region,
where average availability is 13,566 m3/person/year, and the rest o f the country, where water
availability is merely 1,897 m3/person/year. The northern region, which has limited water
availability, i s occupied by 77 percent o fthe population andaccounts for 85 percent o f GDP.

76.     The severity o f Mexico's water problem cannot be overemphasized - 50 percent o f the
volume o f water consumed from underground water sources in Mexico is extracted from the
country's 102 overexploited aquifers. Approximately 77 percent o f the country's water supplies
are used for agricultural production, but only 19 percent o f the irrigation surface area i s
considered to have efficient irrigation technology. In 2000, coverage for potable water supply
and for drainage and sewerage was estimated at 88 percent and 76 percent respectively, butlarge
differences prevailed at the state level. According to the 2001 Water Quality Index, 94 percent o f
Mexico's water bodies are polluted. The problem is most serious inthe Valle de Mexico region
where 70 percent o f the water bodies are highly polluted. Treatment o f municipal and industrial
wastewaters is generally inadequate. On a national level, only 18 percent o f municipal
wastewater and 15 percent o f industrial wastewater are treated prior to discharge to water bodies.
The National Water Commission (CNA) estimates significant loss o f social welfare associated
withwater pollution eachyear.

77.     To address the challenges in the water sector, CNA developed the National Water
Program 2001-2006, which describes the investments requiredto reach a sustainable scenario by
2025. These include investments in technologies to increase water use efficiency and in
infrastructure to expand the percentage o f populationcovered with adequate water and sanitation
services. The National Water Program establishes the following objectives:
    (i) increasing efficiency o f water use in agriculture by providing assistance to users for
    improvements in efficiency and productivity o f irrigation zones, and to install new
    technology andmake investments ininfrastructure for irrigation;
    (ii) improve the coverage and quality o f drinking water, sewerage, and sanitation through
    development o f utilities, providing support to local and state authorities for consolidation o f
    service providers, gradually eliminate subsidies and recover costs o f services and create
    schemes for payment for water rights by utilities and returnfunds generated to the sector;
    (iii) establishing an integrated and sustainable management o f water in basins and aquifers
    through the recovery o f physical losses, water reuse, incorporation o f criteria for efficiency
    and equity in water use, improvements in water-related regulations and o f the economic
    value o fwater;
    (iv) the promotion oftechnical, administrative and financial developments inthe water sector
    through strengthening o f institutional capacity, decentralization, creation o f autonomous
    organizations for providing drinking water and sanitation services, and the development o f
    technological capacity;
    (v) establishing mechanisms for public participation inplanning, and use and management of
    water through the Water BasinCouncils; and

    (vi) decreasing risks and effects of floods and droughts through organizational arrangements,
    efficient information and alert systems, and drought management plans.

78.     ENVSAL Isupported the publication and inclusion inthe ENRP of the National Water
Program 2001-2006. Specific activities supported by ENVSAL Iinclude the establishment o f an
ITWG for the water sector, and support for legal reforms designed to increase incentives for
water conservation and increasing resources for investments and management through increase
and rationalization of water fee collection. Additional achievements under ENVSAL Iinclude:
(i)issuance of a presidential decree to permit the exoneration of past debts by federal
government for municipalities that agree to pay water fees in the future and forego federal
funding for water supply and sanitation inthe event of non-payment; (ii)               passage o f the Federal
Law on Water User Rights (Ley Federal de Derechos en Materia de Agua) with the provision
that up to 100 percent o f municipal water fees collected may be returned to municipalities
respectively, in accordance with specified criteria. Pursuant to this change, an incentive scheme
was developed under which municipalities need to have an equal amount o f funds invested in
water programs. These changes resulted in: (i)the payment, by the Distrito Federal and
municipalities with greater than 2500 inhabitants, o f water fees corresponding to 58 percent o f
water concession use by volume at the end o f the third trimester o f 2003, compared with a
baseline o f 24 percent in2002 and (ii)        the return o f over 95 percent o f water fees to the National
Water Commission by the SHCP for use by municipalities for better water management.31
Furthermore, the GOM publicly disclosed information on amounts o f funds returned, on a
national aggregatebasis, to municipalities.

E.1     ACTIONS SUPPORTEDBY ENVDPL I1

79.     The proposed ENVDPL I1 supports the continued implementation by CNA o f actions
included inthe National Water Program. The amended National Water Law, which will support
a sustainable condition o f water resources in Mexico, includes mandates for: (i)the
decentralization o f water resources management functions to Water Basin Agencies; (ii)                       tne
definition, creation and implementation o f a Water Financial System (Sistema Financier0 del
Agua, SFA); (iii)    an integrated management of water resources; and (iv) the improvement of the
public water rights registry. Specific actions completed in the water sector with the support o f
ENVDPL I1are described below and summarized inAnnex 3.

80.     The recently amended legal framework restructures key functions o f CNA at the basin
level. The mandate to decentralize the functions o f Comisibn Nacional del Agua to the water
basin agencies (Organismos de Cuenca) i s one o f the major reforms o f the recently amended
law. Inaddition to the Water Basin Agencies, the recent amendment o f the National Water Law
empowers the Basin Councils (Consejos de Cuenca) to be key players in the administration o f
the Water Financial System (SFA).32Currently there are 25 Basin Councils. The Basin Councils'
function is to formulate and decide on activities to improve water resources management and to



31The FederalLaw on Water User Rightsmandated that upto 100%ofthe collected municipal water fees couldbe
devolved to the municipalities for investment inwater programs that include wastewater treatment. This scheme also
contemplates allocation ofbudgetary resourcesthat are transferred through CNA.
32The exact role ofthe basinlevel institutions inthe SFA remains to be definedthrough the regulations ofthe
amendedNational Water Law. (Reglamento).

develop water infrastructure in their respective basin.33According to the amended Law, the
Basin Councils are expectedto guide, together with CNA, the work of the aforementionedBasin
Agencies.

81.      Under the leadership of CNA, there has been progress toward integratedmanagementof
water resources. The main efforts of the new approach attempt to limit the extraction of water
from the over-exploited aquifers or surface water bodies in order to meet sustainability
objectives. Actions in the water sector supported by ENVDPL I1 contribute to: (i)
implementation of a measurement system for water-use by parties that have water rights; (ii)
adjustment of regional water programs based on actual water availability; (iii)           establishment of
schemes to ensure that water users comply with their water rights and dischargeobligations, and
that water rights are consistent with water availability; and (iv) elaboration and start up of
implementation of an integrated wastewater strategy to augment the percentage of wastewaters
that are treated. These actions have been implemented in a pilot scheme in the Valley of
QuerCtaro, QuerCtaro; Caborca, Sonora; and Santo Domingo, Baja California Sur where
authorities negotiated with water users to limit the extraction of water from the over-exploited
aquifers and agreedon severalactions to meet sustainability objectives.

82.      The newly amendedlegal framework improves the public water rights registry as part of
efforts to improve the enforcement of water property rights and improve the functioning of the
water market. The public water rights registry i s available to the public at CNA's web~ite.~~
Additional efforts by CNA to increase rational use of water and foster water markets includethe
publication of water availability data for 188 aquifers andfor the country's largestwatershed, the
Lema-Chapala basin, and the disclosureof data on water availability, which provides authorities
andwater users withreliable information for amoretransparent allocation ofthe resourceamong
all water users.

E.2      PERSPECTIVESFORENVDPLI11

83.      The GOM will enact regulations (Reglamento) for the National Water Law, which should
lead to further improvements in the definition of the roles of governmental organizations, the
enforcement of water property rights, and the decentralization of water resources management.
Taking into account an economic evaluation of policy interventions inthe water sector (prepared
by the Bank), the GOM will develop and begin implementation of a unified strategy to promote
sustainable water resources managementinoverexploited basin and aquifers. The GOM also will
implement an integrated strategy for wastewater treatment. Actions for the water sector in the
future will also strengthen the water basin agencies and councils in order to increase their
participation in the design and implementation of programs. The GOM intends to prepare
integrated water resources management plans for severely overexploited and contaminated
basins and aquifers. In an effort to foster greater decentralization of water resources
management, different Bank programs are supporting the GOM's efforts (Table 111-1). Among
these is the ongoing Programmatic Analytical and Advisory Activity (AAA), which includes
studies on the economic value of water.

F.       ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT CHALLENGESINMEXICOAND
         GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

84.      Untilrecently, environmental protection has beenperceived as an obstacle to economic
growth. By 1996, a procedure such as environmental licensing, could take up to 245 days.
Environmentalmanagement was characterized by an extremely large number o fpermits and lack
o f transparency in the decision-making process, which created perverse incentives to comply
with environmental legislation. At the same time, responsible entities were understaffed to cope
withthe administrative work that was requiredto provide a license.


                                                     26

85.     To increase the effectiveness and efficiency o f environmental management processes,
SEMARNAT created in 2001 a new position for an Undersecretary o f Environmental
Management to oversee the elimination o f unnecessary permits and procedures, provide new
guidelines that reduced discretionary application o f criteria for decision-making, and reduce the
probabilities o f corruption. The main actions identified by the G O M to foster effective and
efficient environmental management in Mexico included: (i) development o f a regulatory
                                                                  the
framework governing decentralization o f environmental management; (ii)strengthening
procedures for processing ,of environmental impact assessments; (iii)financing for capacity
buildingand investments in states for improvement of environmental management; and (iv) the
establishment o f procedures and mechanisms for public participation and transparency in
environmental management.

86.     The need for reforms inenvironmental management to improve efficiency inresponding
to client needs and focus on strategic areas became apparent during diagnostic study conducted
by SEMARNAT. ENVSAL I supported initial actions to decentralize environmental
management functions to the state level:
    (i) Approval by Congress o f changes to four laws, including the Ley General del Equilibrio
    Ecoldgico y la Proteccidn a1Ambiente, Ley General de Bienes Nacionales, Ley Forestal and
    Ley General de Vida Silvestre to enable decentralization o f federal environmental
    management functions to sub-national levels;
    (ii)Development ofcriteria (withrespect to personnel and goods) necessaryto assume
    environmental management functions to be decentralized in 2002 that were under federal
    jurisdiction, relating to selected toxic wastes, selected environmental impact assessment
    administration, conservation o f soils, flora, fauna and forest resources and coastal
    management;
    (iii)S0certificationofenvironmentalimpactassessment(EIA)andpermitsthatweretobe
         I
    decentralized by SEMARNAT's Sub-secretariat for Environmental Management;
    (iv) Preparationofdecentralization plansby at least 20 states; and
    (v) Public disclosure o fall State decentralization plansapproved by SEMARNAT.

87.     Actions supported by ENVSAL Ito ensure adequate financing for environmental
management and strengthening o f environmental institutions included the establishment o f an
Environmental Institutional Development Program (PDIA) to finance capacity-building inthose
States with plans to assume new environmental management functions, through a federal pilot
matching grants scheme. Through the PDIA, transfers were made to 24 states for technical
assistance and capacity building based on environmental performance agreements. ENVSAL I
also supported actions to improve public participation and transparency, such as modifications o f
existing regolations to allow for public access to information on EIA and permits, and
implementation o f the modified regulations by public disclosure o f processing information on a
pilot basis o f some EIA andpermit issuance functions carried out by SEMARNAT.

F.1     ACTIONS SUPPORTED BY ENVDPL I1

88.     The ENVDPL I1has been instrumentalto the Mexican Secretariat o f Finance (Secretaria
de Hacienday Crbdito Pz2bZico, SHCP) efforts to strengthen environmental management through
the development o f economic instruments to improve financing o f environmentalmanagement at
federal and sub-national levels. Inline withthese efforts, SHCP developed: (i)   a set o f criteria for


                                               27

environmental fees as a guide for fiscal discussions in federal Congress; (ii)  specific guidelines
for local environmental taxes, fees, and charges; and (iii)   a proposal for fiscal instruments to
promote sustainable development. Specific actions supported by ENVDPL I1 to improve
environmental management are described below and summarized inAnnex 3.

89.     ENVDPL I1also supports continued implementationo f reforms initiated under ENVSAL
Iwithrespectto decentralizationofenvironmentalmanagement functions, improvement of
public participation and further improvement o f transparency inenvironmental management. The
Law on Transparency, enacted in2002, allowed decision-making by the GQM on environmental
management to be opened up to public scrutiny. To further improve public participation and
transparency in environmental management, SEMARNAT has initiated a yearly publication o f
environmental data to inform citizens about the state of the environment andpotential risks to the
public, andthe programs that the government i s carrying out to improve environmental quality.

90.     Environmentalmanagement also has been strengthened according to the competitiveness
principle. SEMARNAT has streamlined the administrative procedures for permits by eliminating
55 out o f the 145 permits previously requested by environmental authorities, reducing the
procedural time lag by up to 80%, and created an Integrated Service Center that decreases the
probability o f corruption by eliminating direct contact between the client and the official that
determines permit issuance or rejection. These improvements have considerably reduced
discretionary application o f requirements by public officials and provided strong incentives for
the regulated community to follow all the appropriate procedures, as is exemplified by the rising
number of projects that are subjected to EIA prior to their development. EIA is considered an
area where the GOM has achieved concrete results. SEMARNAT has published new guidelines
for EIA to minimize the processing time for licenses, identify and assess cumulative impacts,
increase public disclosure o f information and foster public participation.

91.     SEMARNAT has continued to provide important economic resources for capacity
building at the sub-national level through the PDIA. Furthermore, SEMARNAT is pursuing
additional improvements o f its decentralization model and has recently completed the first part
o f an evaluation o f the approaches that the sector has followed over the past decade, including a
review o f relevant international experience indecentralization, which i s expected to guide future
decentralization efforts.

92.     Between2001 and 2004, only one function was transferred to one state (permit issuance
functions for sustainable use o f forest resources were transferred from the Federal Government
to the environmental authorities o f the Estado de Mkxico). Since the decentralization o f
environmental management responsibilities did not achieve substantial progress, SEMARNAT
conducted an evaluation o f the decentralization program in late 2004. The evaluation found that
the most prominent obstacles that hinderedthe transfer o f functions to the states were the lack o f
priority-setting with respect to functions to be transferred andthe relative weakness o f state and
local authorities. Based on this assessment, SEMARNAT set priority environmentalmanagement
functions to be transferred relatingto forests and soils, the Federal Maritime Zone (ZonaFederal
Maritima, ZOFEMAT), and wildlife. In addition, SEMARNAT introduced mechanisms to
monitor and evaluate the performance o f state environmental authorities intheir handlingo f the
decentralized functions. The newly-established monitoring and evaluation systems eliminated the
need for certification and therefore SEMARNAT decided to de-link certification from the


                                               28

decentralization process. The new approach has already produced positive results. Permit
issuance functions for sustainable wildlife use have been transferred to the state authorities o f
Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Coahuila, and the permit issuance functions o f sustainable use o f
forest resources have been transferred to the Estado de Mkxico. In addition, the states o f
Guanajuato and Chihuahua have begun decentralization o f the Licencia Ambiental Unica.
Furthermore, SEMARNAT has increased the number of states to which PDIA resources have
been allocated to 27 states, for capacity buildinginorder to begin decentralization.

F.2     PERSPECTIVESFORENVDPLI11

93.     The GOM's program to improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f environmental
management in the future includes: (i)    the preparation of an initiative for fiscal instruments for
environmental management; (ii)     the continuation of the decentralization program based on the
outcomes o fthe ongoing evaluation by SEMARNAT; and (iii)        strengthening public participation
schemes.


              IV.     BANK SUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY


A.      LINKTO COUNTRYPARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY

94.     The proposed operation is included inthe portfolio for the base case lendingscenario and
i s one of two policy-based loans contemplated under the theme o f environmental sustainability in
the FY 2005-2008 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Mexico. The CPS presents a program
of operations to support the GOM's development objectives as detailed in the National
Development Plan 2001-2006, based on four pillars: (i)        reduce poverty and inequality; (ii)
increase competitiveness; (iii)strengthen institutions; and (iv) promote environmental
sustainability. With respect to environmental sustainability, the loan responds to the main
challenges identified by the CPS, as it contributes to the improvement o f environmental
governance by increasing the sector's transparency and accountability, and creates incentives for
more efficient and decentralized environmental management. Also, the loan supports policy,
legal and institutional reforms in the forest and water resources sectors to address key
environment-livelihood linkages, and contemplates actions to mitigate environmental and health
impacts, particularly those that stem from the energy andtourism sectors.

95.     The ENVDPL I1 operation will be a key tool in delivering Bank support to the
government to strengthen institutions and promote environmental sustainability in the current
CPS report (Report No. 28141-MEYdated March 18,2004). The report refers to the ENVDPL I1
operation as supporting CPS objectives by promoting the mainstreaming o f environmental
concerns and improved local environmental management processes. Building on the first
operation, ENVDPL I1will provide continued support to Mexico's five-year program, focusing
on addressing the developmental challenges o f environmental mainstreaming in four priority
sectors: tourism, energy, forestry and water, and on environmental governance (inparticular, by
increasing transparency and accountability).




                                                29

96.     Giventhat the operation's central thrust is to promote environmental sustainability, it is
also fully consistent with, and will contribute to, the achievement o f the goals o f the remaining
three pillars of the CPS. For instance, with respect to increasing competitiveness, the operation
supports strategic policy reforms ineconomic sectors, such as tourism or forestry, where Mexico
has important comparative advantages and where the incorporation o f environmental
considerations will increase the country's ability to maintain those advantages in the long term.
By supporting activities and actions that promote the reversal of the overexploitation of natural
resources, such as groundwater aquifers, the proposed operation will help to remove existing
constraints to growth. Furthermore, ENVDPL I1 will have an important impact on poverty
alleviation as the burden o f environmental degradation falls disproportionately on the
who depend on natural resources for their livelihoods. With respect to institutional strengthening,
the project will clearly respond to some o f the environment sector's weaknesses through
activities aimed to strengthen environmental governance. Other sectors are expected to benefit
from institutional strengthening also, particularly water resources management, where the Bank's
involvement has facilitated the building and expansion o f coordinationmechanisms.

97.     Furthermore, the CPS also stresses that to satisfy the needs o fthe most vulnerable groups,
the Bank will have to focus on areas where it can create value. Inthis regard, the operation takes
advantage o f the Bank's robust capacity to provide high quality policy, legal and institutional
analysis to support the GOM's program, and can leverage the Bank's convening power to
promote inter-sectoral coordination.

B.      COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

98.     Mexico currently does not have a financial support program or outstanding loans with the
IMF.Inview ofthe country's healthy finances, it is not expectedthat the GOMwill request IMF
support over the CPS period (FY05-08). The Mexican government does maintain an active
policy dialogue with the Fund, however, through the Fund's bilateral and global surveillance
activities. Inaddition, Fundand Bank staffmaintain a regular exchange on macro policy.

99.     There are no areas o f overlap between the Bank's and the IDB's work in Mexico.
Nonetheless, the Bank will continue to collaborate with the IDB - one o f the Bank's main
development partners in Mexico - with respect to environmental issues and related sectors such
as the water, sanitation, and housing sectors. In addition, the Bank recently initiated contacts
with two other institutionsto remain informed of developments intheir work and vice-versa: the
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which has a grant program to support
natural resource management, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which
has a technical cooperation program inhealth andenvironmentalprotection.

C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHERBANK OPERATIONS

100.    The proposed loan is the second o f three operations that constitute the Mexico
Environment Structural Adjustment Program. The first operation, ENVSAL`I,                consisted o f two

tranches o f $101.01 million each andwas completely disbursed inDecember 2003.36ENVSAL I
successfully supported the initial stage o f policy reforms, which the proposed operation will
build upon in order to ensure sustainability and to deepen the reforms to mainstream
environmental concerns inkey sectoral development agendas and improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of environmental management processes in Mexico. At the sectoral level, this
operation will complement the ongoing dialogue in priority sectors identified by the GOM,
namely tourism, energy, forestry and water.

101.    The reforms supported by the ENVDPL I1 will be fundamental to create an enabling
environment inwhich various planned projects included inthe current CPS can take place. Inthe
water sector, the ENVDPL I1will continue to build on the achievements o f the Bank's Water
Resources Management Project, which has helped to promote conditions for environmentally
sustainable, economically efficient and equitably allocated rights for use o f water resources in
Mexico, and to support the integrated management o f water resources. In addition, the sector
reforms supported by ENVDPL I1will be complementary to: (i)             the Water Programmatic AAA,
which will include studies on the economic value o f water; (ii) Integrated Management o f
                                                                          the
Basins and Aquifers Project, which will help improve conditions for sustainable integrated water
resource management, contribute to increased efficiency o f water use andfair allocation o f water
rights, consolidate water management institutions and promote stakeholders' participation in
decision-making; (E)the Mexico Water Rights Adjustment Program (PADUA), which promotes
aquifer stabilizationinwater-stressed areas through retiring water concessions where demand for
water exceeds sustainable supply from surface and groundwater sources; (iv) the Water and
Sanitation Technical Assistance Loan which will seek to implement reforms in the delivery o f
services in water and sanitation sectors; and (v) the Integrated Irrigation Modernization Project,
which is supporting the GOM's efforts to improve competitiveness o f irrigated water use in
selected irrigation districts and regions, through public-private partnerships, institutional
collaboration and strengthening the demand-driven approach to investment decisions and
financing.

102.    Activities under ENVDPL I1 that will support environmental mainstreaming in the
energy sector are fully consistent with several climate change projects and will reinforce the
sustainability o f project results by promoting an adequate framework that includes required
sector policy reforms. These activities include: (i)the PCF-financed Comexhidro/INELEC
Hydro Umbrella project, which replaces fossil-fired electricity generation with a package o f
mini-hydro developments associated with existing irrigation schemes; (ii)the PCF-financed
PEMEX Refinery Cogeneration project that will use carbon finance to promote the use o f
refinery wastes for high-efficiency production o f steam and power; (iii)the PCF-financed
Bagasse Co-generation project, which will support the use o f bagasse for high-efficiency
production o f steam and power with Mexican sugar factories; (iv) the Netherlands Carbon
Development Fund-financed Wind Umbrella project that will support the displacement o f fossil
energythrough grid-connected wind farms; (v) the GEF-financed Large-scale Renewable Energy
Development project that will support the development o f grid-connected renewable energy
resources and facilitate a financial mechanism offering competitively-based tariff support for
wind, hydro, biomass, and other renewable technologies; and (vi) the IBRD/GEF-financed Rural

in dispersed or remote areas, where connection to the electricity grid is not financially or
logistically feasible.

103.    Similarly, the activities that will be supported by ENVDPL I1inthe forestry sector will
have clear synergies with the Community Forestry I1 and Community Forestry I11
(PROCYMAF) projects. The latter will assist indigenous communities and ejidos that own
forests in priority areas to improve the management and conservation o f their forest resources
and to generate alternative sources o f income in a sustainable manner. Also, ENVDPL I1will
complement projects that promote conservation and sustainable use o f biodiversity such as the
GEF-financed Indigenous and Community Biodiversity Conservation project (COINBIO) and
the Consolidationo f the GEF-financed Protected Areas System project (SINAP 11). ENVDPL I1
will enhance sustainability o f the results o f the IBRD/GEF-financed Environmental Services
project, which will support the development o f economic incentives to promote conservation and
sustainable forest management inpriority watersheds.

D.      LESSONSLEARNED

104.    Some o f the most relevant lessons learned derive from the first operation (ENVSAL I).
The primary challenges faced and successes achieved underENVSAL Iwere associatedwith the
nature and requirements o f inter-institutional coordination. In particular, inter-institutional
coordination requires the unwavering commitment o f participating agencies to undergo a
profound learning process and adopt significant behavioral changes. Although this learning
process i s complex and time-consuming, it also proved effective in enhancing the quality o f
products ininstances where inter-institutional coordination was successful. Inorder to overcome
the difficulties and enhance the benefits associated with inter-institutional coordination, the
proposed operation incorporates various learning mechanisms whereby lessons learned are
captured, distilled, and fed back into the process in a step-wise manner to promote continuous
improvements o f outputs and smooth the learning process for this and future operations.

105.    Inlight ofthe above, various mechanismshavebeenputinplace andcontinue to function
to provide the opportunity for social learning in a cross-sectoral setting. In the energy sector,
high-level meetings between SENER and various governmental agencies have been
institutionalized in the Intersectoral Committee for Projects for Emissions Reductions and
Capture o f Greenhouse Gases (Comite' Mexican0 para Proyectos de Reduccidn de Emisiones y
de Captura de Gases de Efecto Invernadero). Objectives o f this Committee are to identify
opportunities, facilitate, promote, disseminate, evaluate and approve projects for emission
reduction and greenhouse gas capture. This committee i s composed o f representatives from the
environment, energy, economics, agriculture, rural development, fishery, communication and
transport sectors. Also in the energy sector, a technical advisory team comprised o f Mexican
experts in environment and energy policy issues will provide technical advice to inform the
development o f the sector's environmental policy. In the tourism sector, the GOM seeks to
achieve lasting results in environmental mainstreaming and to consolidate intersectoral
coordination at a high level through such vehicles as the Intersectoral Commission on Tourism
(Comisidn Intersecretarial de Turismo) established on September 28, 2004. Inaddition, to foster
learning and enrich ongoing efforts to ensure sustainable tourism development, SECTUR is
planningto organize a workshop inthe first semester of 2005 with the participation o f municipal


                                                32

authorities and civil society. The workshop will disseminate experiences on the implementation
o f Agenda 21 locally inMexico. A regional workshop planned for the second semester o f 2005
will elicit and disseminate lessons learned from successful cases of tourism development inthe
region. The findings o f this workshop will provide input to inform the development o f a tourism-
environment strategy.

106.    Under Mexico's fiscal policy, the proposed loan does not increase aggregate fiscal
resources available to environment and other sectoral agencies since the fiscal envelope i s
defined by the bindingprimary fiscal surplus targets. Nonetheless, G O M i s ensuringthat levels
of human and budgetary resources are adequate to ensure institutional capacity. Although GOM
has enough resources to finance reforms for the environmental sector, the results o f Bank support
have underscored the added value o f the operation both in terms o f the technical assistance
provided and the institutionalization o f spaces for intersectoral cooperation and dialogue which
probably would not have been created otherwise. The Japan Policy and Human Resources
Development Fund (PHRD) provided key resources that allowed for the development o f key
analytical work and stakeholder participation for the preparation o f ENVDPL 11. The use o f
PHRD grant funds provided a positive incentive for mainstreaming environmental concerns in
key economic sectors.

107.    Another important lesson from ENVSAL Irelates to the loan's conditionalities and
triggers, which covered a broad range o f development areas. Consequently, implementation and
supervision covered a wide range o f topics, presenting challenges in terms o f sufficient human
andbudgetary resources andthe constant and intense nature of the dialogue between the GOM
and the Bank throughout the period of implementation. To address these challenges, the number
of triggers or prior actions completed for the proposed operation has been limited to five key
actions.

108.    Under ENVSAL I,partial waivers were requested for three loan conditions. One o f the
requests was necessitated by changes in titles o f the members o f the Intersectoral Technical
Working Groups (ITWG), since the Loan Agreement specified titles for the members o f the
groups. This request for a partial waiver was purely circumstantial and showed that itwould have
been sufficient for the Loan Agreement to specify the names o f the organizations to be included
inthe ITWGandnotthe titles ofthe members.The secondrequest related to the requirement for
SEMARNAT to certify, using ISO-9001-2000, certain environmental management and permit
issuance functions that were to be decentralized to the state governments. Three o f these
functions were not certified because they were transferred from SEMARNAT to CONAFOR.
Furthermore, the assessment conducted by SEMARNAT o f its experience with decentralization
concluded that certification was not necessaryto assure the quality o f decentralization and that it
in fact presented considerable obstacles to the decentralization process. Based on this
assessment, SEMARNAT decided to de-link certification from the decentralization process. As
noted previously, this new approach has produced positive results including the decentralization
of permit issuance functions for sustainable wildlife use to three states and for sustainable use o f
forestry resources to one state. The thirdpartial waiver request related to the condition for public
disclosure o f Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) review and certain permit issuance
processes. The need for this request also was related to the transfer o f functions from
SEMARNAT to CONAFOR. Recent evidence obtained from the G O M indicates that the



                                              33

processing information on EIA and control permits i s publicly disclosed through governmental
websites.

109.     Inrelationto the secondpartial waiver request for ENVSAL I,anadditional lessonfrom
the decentralization experience i s evident from the inadequacy o f "supermarket" approaches to
the devolution o f permitting functions, whereby states can pick and choose which permitting
functions they want to assume via certification. This model results in an anomalous situation
where the least desirable functions are left to the federal government, and the states take over
only the easy or popular ones. Thus, it i s important to ask whether the permits make sense inthe
first place, after which it may be more practicable and cost effective to cluster permits and
transfer them as a package rather than one by one. Alternatively, various approaches with
different incentives could be tried, as they have proven to be successful incases such as the use
o f "fast-tracking" for the Licencia Ambiental Unica.

E.       ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

110.     The policy reforms that the G O M will undertake with the support o f the Second
Programmatic Environment Development Policy Loan are founded on sound and rigorous
analyses conducted by federal agencies, the Bank, OECD and ECLAC. The most recent work
includes several studies financed under the Japanese PHRD grant to prepare the second
operation. These studies support the development o f new environmental fiscal instruments, a
sustainable tourism strategy, proposals for improved inter-institutional coordination inthe water
sector, a tourism-environment strategy and options for medium and long-term use o f renewable
energy sources. Other related work includes the Bank's Public Expenditure Review, the Bank's
Infrastructure Public Expenditure Review (currently underway), and the Bank's assessment of
poverty conditions in Mexico (Poverty in Mexico: an Assessment of Conditions, Trends, and
GovernmentStrateay).

111.     Analytical work carried out by the GOM and other development partners, such as the
UnitedNations' Economic Commission for LatinAmerica and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in2002
andthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in2003, provides a
solid foundation for the program. The ECLAC document identifies various symptoms o f
environmental problems and their causes inMexico.37The Second Environmental Performance
Review o f Mexico concluded recently by the OECD provides an independent assessment o f the
country's environmental challenges, which correspond with those identifiedjointly by the G O M
andthe Bank.

112.     The 2001 World Bank Policy Notes for Mexico3* found that water resources
management, forestry,        air quality management and solid waste management among
environmental priority areas. With respect to water resources management, the main challenges
identified included the overexploitation o f aquifers due to over-allocation o f water users' rights,
inefficient irrigation, and water pollution. Furthermore, the Policy Notes stated that Mexico's

land and forest base were threatened by land degradation and deforestation. Other problems
associated with the forestry sector included the needto ensure that poor communities capture the
fullmarketvalue o ftimber andnon-timberproducts, andenvironmental services. Withrespectto
air quality management, problems identified included large, adverse health impacts from air
pollution associated with poor fuel quality, and legal barriers to energy efficiency gains and to
development o f renewable energy resources. Lastly, with respect to solid waste management,
inadequate treatment and final disposal posed environmental challenges, stemming from lack o f
a regulatory framework and its enforcement. The reforms being supported by ENVDPL I1
address a number o f the environmental challenges identified above that are associated with the
four priority sectors targetedby ENVDPL 11.

113.    The 2004 ECLAC document identified environmental problems and their causes in
Mexico. These problems included inadequate water quantity and quality, overexploitation o f
natural resources, habitat change and air pollution. The document cited changes in vegetation
cover as a key factor inenvironmental degradation inMexico - a consequence o f a vicious cycle
o f deforestation, intensive land-based farming practices and erosion. With respect to water, the
document predicted a sustainability crisis in a 15 - 20 year time frame in the sector relating to
inefficient water use and inadequate management o f pressures on existing water resources. The
problems inthe water sector were attributed to unequal spatial and temporal distribution o fwater
resources inthe country, unsustainable management o f water resources through overexploitation
of existing resources, depletion o f groundwater bodies and pollution o f surface waters. Other
problems that were associated with the water sector included: (i)  an inability to satisfy demands
for water for distinct municipal uses; (ii)
                                          the slow growth o f basic water services (drinkingwater,
basic sanitation) compared to the rate o f development; (iii)the use o f water for low-value
products rather than for high-value products; and (iv) inadequate public and private investment
in the sector. Hazardous industrial emissions, inadequate disposal o f industrial and municipal
wastes and air pollution in municipal zones were cited as precursors to environmental
degradation inthe country.

 114.   The 2003 OECD review concluded that Mexico hadyet to achieve significant decoupling
of environmental pressure from GDP. The review showed that Mexico continued to face
challenges with respect to adequate management o f air, water, waste, and nature and
biodiversity. Rapid economic growth has placed increased pressure on the environment, through
pollution and use o f natural resources. The review identified sevenpriority environmentalissues:
(i)water and forestry management; (ii)integrated management of natural resources; (iii)
environmental management and environmental planning at the watershed level;                    (iv)
decentralization o f environmental management and decision-making; (v) increased public
participation and the right o f access to environmental information; (vi) ensuring that users o f
natural resources pay for the environmental cost o f resource use; and (vii) strengthening o f
environmental legislation, inspection and compliance rates. One o f the key recommendations of
the review in order to meet the identified challenges was that G O M further integrate
environmental concerns into economic and social decisions. This recommendation is consistent
withthe objectives o fENVDPL11.

                                V.    THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

A.      PROGRAM OBJECTIVESAND PRIOR ACTIONS

115.    The main objective of the ENVSAL program since its inception in 2002 has been to
support the Government's efforts to: (i) mainstream environmental concerns inthe development
agenda o f key sectors, and (ii)  improve the efficiency and effectiveness o f local environmental
management processesinMexico. The first operation, ENVSALI,supported initial actions to set
medium-term targets to mainstream environmental concerns in key sectors and create favorable
institutional conditions for the implementation o f reforms. The proposed operation, ENVDPL 11,
will support the development of legal and regulatory frameworks and the continuation o f the
GOM's efforts to consolidate and deepen the impact o f reforms through implementation. A
listing o f all actions supported by ENVDPL I1i s summarized inAnnex 3.

116.    During ENVSAL Inegotiations, the GOM and the Bank defined a list of proposed
actions to be implementedby the GOM prior to appraisal o f ENVDPL 11.These triggers focused
on the four key productive sectors: tourism, forestry, energy and water, and in environmental
management. Advances ineach one o f them reflect the overall efforts o f the GOM to implement
the ENVSALprogram. Exampleso f actions include: (i) publication o f water availability data
                                                          the
and an improved water rights registry as foundational steps in the implementation of a
functioning water rights market, consistent with the current regulatory framework; (ii)the
establishment and implementation o f a set o f indicators and benchmarks for measurement o f
good environmental performance o f tourist facilities; (iii)Secretariat o f Energy-approved design
and preparation for implementation of a national fund for renewable energy promotion; (iv) the
establishment and start operation o f a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Office, involving
at least SENER and SEMARNAT, according to rules set up at the Marrakech and Bonn
Conferences o f the Parties o f the UNFCCC; and (v) the initiation o f decentralization efforts (as
evidenced by signature o f a convenio, capacity building, or joint operation prior to certification)
by six States o f at least one or more environmental management functions, based on
SEMARNAT-approved decentralization plans. Since these five triggers have been met, they will
be presented to the Board o f the Bank as the prior actions for this operation. Table V-I below
presentsthe triggers for ENVDPL I1and actions taken by the GOM to meet them.

C.       LOANAMOUNT AND TRANCHING

118.     The proposed US$200.5 10 million loan will be made to the UnitedMexican States. The
loan i s expected to be disbursed in a single tranche immediately upon effectiveness. The
proposed loan does not increase resources available for public sector spending. Under Mexico's
fiscal regime, a DPL from the Bank substitutes financing from alternative, more expensive debt
sources. The proposed loan does not increase aggregate fiscal resources available to environment
and other sectoral agencies since the fiscal envelope is defined by the binding primary fiscal
surplus targets.

D.       PRIOR ACTIONS FOR ENVDPL I11

119.     The Bank partnership with the GOM on the ENVSAL Program will continue into the
third operation, assuming a continued sound macroeconomic framework is in place and the
following triggers have been met: (i)         increase the number o f tourist destinations, with local
Agenda 21 action plans, including investment plans, from 14 to 35; (ii)             develop a package o f
legal reforms and regulations needed for promotion of renewable energy sources; (iii)               establish
mechanisms to improve access to financial services and products schemes to provide financing
for investments insustainable forestry management; (iv) develop a package o f regulations which
are consistent with the newly amended National Water Law; and (v) develop and publish new
methodologies and guidelines for incorporation o f public participation in environmental
management, including Environmental Impact Assessment. These triggers are summarized in
Table V-3 below.

                           VI.       OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.       POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

120.     The provisions o f OP 8.60 apply to ENVDPL 11. In general terms, improvements in
environmental sustainability are expected to benefit the poor. The Bank's recent assessment o f
poverty in Mexico3' points out the adverse effect environmental degradation has on the poor,
particularly interms o f health. Water and air pollution result inillhealth, especially o f the poor;
soil degradation and unsustainable agricultural and forestry practices adversely affect
livelihoods, as well as increase the vulnerability o f the poor to natural disasters. Therefore, it i s
expected that the ENVSAL program will enhance environmental and health conditions that
improve the potential opportunities for more productive workdays and a better life for the poor.
Those vulnerable population segments that depend on natural resources for their livelihoods,
such as indigenous peoples and ejido communities, would benefit also through the promotion o f
sustainable environmental management practices. These positives impacts on poverty and social
development vary, however, according to the specific set o f actions promoted by each o f the
policies andhave different effects depending onthe stakeholder.

121.     The actions supported by the ENVDPL I1targeted at attaining sustainable development
o f the tourism sector help buildingthe capacity o f municipalities as well as o f local citizens and
o f the poor to increase their access to information and decision-making. Inaddition, establishing
new destinations and promoting new investments intourism will contribute to creating newjob
and income opportunities for the poor. Differentkinds oftourism, such as cruises, ecological and
cultural tourism that are encouraged by the sustainable tourism strategy supported by this loan,
have demonstrated strong distributive impacts and social implications.

122.     The actions supported by the loan in the energy sector will contribute to reducing air
pollution and mitigating its impacts on human health. In urban centers, people living in low-
income areas are the most exposed to adverse environmental impacts. The most vulnerable and
the poorest, therefore, will benefit from these measures. Workers in the energy sector and
neighborhoods close to PEMEX and CFE facilities will benefit from measures leading to the
reduction o f pollution in these facilities. In addition, rural electrification will contribute to
reducing indoor air pollution and provide better living conditions for the population.

123.     The actions supported by ENVDPL I1 in the forestry sector promote increased
opportunities for the development o f income-generating activities and the generation o f
employment opportunities for forest dwellers, ejidatarios and indigenous peoples living in
forested areas. The implementation o f these activities will foster the capacity o f these
communities and cooperatives to take greater advantage o f sustainable and productive uses o f
forest areas. The new Forest Law puts in place specific mechanisms for cost recovery, non-
timber forest production, ecological services valuation, small-scale user permits, and intellectual
property rights - all o f which can apply to indigenous communities and other poor forest
dwellers. It also establishes a forest fund and a commission that can help build capacity inthese
areas. The GOM is implementing mechanisms to foster accountability in the decentralization

Bank.June 2004.

process by ensuring a stronger involvement o f the communities, ejidatarios and local civil
society organizations insectoral decision-making.

124.   The water program designed by the GOM envisages the provision o f adequate water
quantity and quality for a large number o f people inMexico. The amended National Water Law
makes particular reference to ejidatarios, small farmers, and indigenous communities. The law
prohibits extraction of water from parceled ejidos or community lands without authorization o f
ejidatarios, small farmers, and indigenous communities with the exception o f water for
subsistence or domestic use.4o

125.    Simultaneously, SEMARNAT i s strengthening its environmentalmanagementcapacity
to foster accountability, transparency and to ensure mitigation o f potential negative impacts
associated with tourism, energy, water, and forestry development. The program supports the
establishment o f effective mechanisms for channeling voice and building consensus, which are
important for ensuring successful and inclusive public participation in environmental
management and increased accountability o f public organizations. New Environmental Impact
Assessment guidelines, issued duringthe second operation, place particular emphasis on opening
updecision-making processesto public scrutiny.

126.    In accordance with OP 8.60, consultations were held in the process of preparing
ENVDPL 11. Several public hearings and workshops were heldthat focused onthe key aspects o f
Mexico's Environmental Mainstreaming Program (Programa de Transversalidad), and on the
design and discussion o f the new forestry law and the amendments to the water law. These
events included a workshop on the Programa de Transversalidad,held inMarch 2005 inMexico
with the participation of various stakeholders, including social and environmental NGOs; a
workshop held in Patzcuaro in 2005 that focused on control o f indoor air pollution caused by
domestic use o f fuelwood; and public consultations held on the environmental mainstreaming
program inthe tourism sector through workshops heldinJanuary 2005 andinMay 2005 with the
participation o f over 200 mayors, other representatives o f state and municipal governments, and
other stakeholders.

127.    The uneven effect o f reform implementation on different stakeholders and sectors o f the
population i s one o f the main challenges that the G O M will have to face, concerning the social
and poverty impacts of the environmental reforms. As stated above, all the measures supported
by the operation have positive outcomes for most o f the population. The opportunities to take
advantage o f these outcomes, however, are not the same for every one. It i s predictable that, if
appropriate institutional arrangements are not made and specific actions are not taken,
indigenous communities might not have access to potential benefits resulting from the cost-
recovery system, intellectual property rights and small scale user permits included in the new
Forestry Law. This would occur simply because they do not have the power to demand
accountability over their entitlements, the capacity to prepare management plans or to deal with
the cumbersome procedures in place to access these facilities. In order to enhance the
opportunities o f vulnerable groups to take advantage o f the new legal regulatory framework, the
G O M with Bank support is implementing various programs specifically targeted towards
indigenous communities and independent forestry workers. The Community Forestry Project

assists indigenous communities and ejidos in five states to improve the management and
conservation o f their forest resources and to generate sustainable alternative sources o f income.
The Indigenous and Community Biodiversity Conservation Project will strengthen andpromote
community conservation initiatives on communally owned lands inareas o f high biodiversity in
three states. Finally, the G O M with Bank support is conducting analytical work on the poverty
and social impacts of reforms. The analytical work underway will identify policies whose
impacts on distribution, inclusion and other social issues would be studied as part o f the
preparation o fthe subsequentoperation.

B.      SUPERVISION

128.    Each one o f the sectoral ministries and agencies involved in this operation (SHCP,
SEMARNAT, SENER, SECTUR, CONAFOR and CNA) will be responsible for implementation
o f the proposed components o f the operation and for reporting progress. The Environment and
Natural Resources Secretariat (SEMARNAT) will be responsible for coordinating actions among
the aforementioned agencies.

129.    The Bank team will supervise the ENVDPL I1with a particular emphasis to ascertain
whether the government o f Mexico i s carrying out the program with a focus on development
impact and due diligence to achieve development objectives in conformity with the legal
agreements. Bank staff will assess and monitor the adequacy o f the institutional arrangements by
which the government o f Mexico implements the actions indicated in the Policy Matrix, and
verify fulfillment o f program conditions and compliance with legal covenants. The Bank team
will focus on the impact outcomes o f the program and the adjustments that need to be made to
the operation as it evolves, to take into account the latest country developments, stakeholder
support, and feasible options for realizing the program development goals. The Task Team will
monitor actions and review progress o f the implementation o f ENVDPL 11, as well as the
subsequent actions o f the government's program. Before proceeding with the ENVDPL 111, the
Bank team will assess the government of Mexico's progress in implementing the expected
actions for the second operation, witha particular emphasis on the triggers presented above.

C.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

130.    The Mexico Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA, Report 29155-MX,
September 5, 2003) examined the GOM's implementation o f measures intendedto improve the
financial management o f the federal public sector. The CFAA found that the G O M has adequate
mechanisms in place to record and report public expenditures. The budget management o f the
Federal Government has several management instruments and defined objectives, standards and
procedures, fostering an accountable and transparent management o f State expenditures. The
main strength observed was the existence o f clear and complete rules that govern the Federal
Government's administrative financial transactions.

D.      DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING

131.    Disbursementand ImplementationArrangements. The proposed loan will follow the
Bank's disbursement procedures. N o procurement requirements will be needed. Once the loan i s
approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the loan will be disbursed by the



                                              42

IBRD. If,after disbursement, the proceeds ofthe loanare used for ineligible purposes as defined
inthe Development LoanAgreement, the Bankwill require the Borrower to either: (i) the      return
amount for use for eligible purposes, or (ii) the amount directly to the Bank.
                                             refund

132.     The administration o f this loan will be the responsibility o f the Banco del Ahorro
Nacional y Servicios Financieros S.N.C (BANSEFI) as financial agent of the Federal
Government through the Mandate Agreement between the Secretaria de Hacienda y Cre`dito
Pdblico and BANSEFI. A unit o f BANSEFI, the Subdireccidn de Financiamiento Internacional
will be incharge o f the coordination and fulfillment o f the terms and conditions set forth inthe
Loan Agreement. Although an audit o f the deposit account will not be required, the Bank
reservesthe right to require audits at any time.

E.       ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

133.     The provisions o f OP8.60 on Development Policy Lending apply to ENVDPL 11. The
raison d'itre o f the operation is to support policy reforms and actions that embody the principle
o f environmental sustainability by promoting economic development that i s not derived at the
expense o f the environment and natural resource base. In other words, economic development
that i s balanced with protection and improvement o f the quality o f the environment and natural
resources. The operation seeks to achieve this dual objective through the incorporation o f
environmental considerations in key productive sectors o f the economy, and by improving the
effectiveness and efficiency o f local environmental management processes. Consequently, it i s
expected that the proposed operation will have positive effects on the country's environment or
natural resources. The operation and indeed the program offer significant opportunities to
positively affect the environment and natural resources o f Mexico. Consistent with OP 8.60, this
section will discuss the argument that informs the expectation o f positive effects o f the operation,
drawing upon preparatory activities and aspects o f the operation and program design aimed to
ensure sustainability o f those effects.

134.     The actions included in the matrix for this operation have been designed based on a
strong foundation o f analytical work. A recent piece o f analytical work and a key component o f
the analytical foundation for this program i s the 2003 OECD Environmental Performance
Review, which concludes that rapid economic growth in Mexico has occurred together with
increased pressure on the environment. This operation focuses on four sectors -tourism, energy,
forestry andwater - key drivers of economic development inMexico. As discussed inpreceding
sections o f this document, the environmental challenges associated with each o f these sectors are
significant and allude to the need and opportunities that exist to incorporate environmental
sustainability considerations into the sectors in order to achieve the overarching goal o f growth
with quality that underlies the country's National Development Plan. Furthermore, the GOM
recognizes that environmental sustainability is a key factor to maintain the competitiveness o f
these sectors at national and internationallevels accordingly.

 135.    The reforms supported by ENVDPL I1will seek to build upon the achievements o f the
previous operation which focused principally on initial actions to create an environment
conducive to the facilitation o f the policy reforms and actions that are supported by subsequent
operations. These reforms and actions have been selected to directly respond to the
environmental challenges identified with each o f the sectors. As an illustration, a key challenge



                                               43

in the tourism sector is to manage the environmental problems associated with the existing
tourism industry and minimize damage from future growth. In this context, the proposed
operation supports actions that will improve environmental conditions at tourist sites, decrease
overexploitation o f natural resources and protected areas, ensure new tourism developments are
designed and tourist facilities are operated in a sustainable manner, and lastly to promote
sustainable tourism. On one hand, the proposed actions will seek to promote protection o f the
environment and natural resources, while on the other they also may bring about the effect o f
increasing infrastructure development activities to promote tourism that could potentially have
negative environmental impacts. Studies under this program, such as the strategic sectoral study
andthe strategic environmental assessments(SEAs), will be keytools inanticipating such effects
and outlining measuresupstreamto addressthem.

136.     Inaddition, the strategic environmental assessmentsand studies that are supported by the
operation will provide input to the development o f sector environmental policies intourism and
energy sectors, which often entail productive/sector activities that could contribute to
environmental degradation. It i s important to point out that although the GOM's plans for
development o f the tourism sector contemplate considerable development o f infrastructure to
boost the sector's growth, the proposed operation will not support investments in infrastructure.
The potential adverse environmental impacts o f infrastructure developments are recognized. It is
anticipated that such impacts will be identified through the pilot SEAs supported by the
operation, including proposals for policy options to address them. In the water and forestry
sectors, actions and reforms will increase the competitiveness o f the sectors by improving
efficiency o f sector activities and utilizing opportunities for growth in a sustainable manner. In
the case of the water sector for example, inadequate water quantity stemming from water loss
from inefficient or wasteful use insome areas and scarcity inothers is among the key challenges
o f the sector. In this context, the first operation supported actions that helped to increase the
efficiency o f collection o f water fees, and gradually instill changes in user behavior toward the
resource. To consolidate the benefits o f the first operation, the subsequent operations will
support actions aimedto better align water fees with the economic value o f water.

137.     Lastly, the inter-sectoral approach o f the program will provide a unique opportunity to
ensure that the reforms supported by the program will be sustained. This document recognizes
that inter-sectoral collaboration i s difficult and time intensive. The previous operation showed,
however, that where it did work, it resulted in higher quality products. The formation o f the
Intersectoral Technical Working Groups and their continued functioning have been a key vehicle
to promoting such coordination. As discussed in previous sections, the GOM i s on its own
increasingly usingintersectoral coordinationto approach cross-cutting environmental issues. The
establishment o f intersectoral fora such as the Comisidn Intersecretarial de Turismo (Tourism),
Comite` Mexican0 para Proyectos de Reduccidn de Emisionesy de Captura de Gases de Efecto
Invernadero (Energy), Consejo Consultivo del Agua (Water), Consejo Consultivo Forestal
(Forestry) allude to this development and indicate that the G O M i s advancing in the right
direction to address the country's environmental challenges by directly addressing them and by
continuing to create the requisite institutional and policy framework to support the delivery o f
results ina sustainable manner.

138.     As illustratedinpreceding sections on the environmentalchallenges inthe four sectors, it
i s clear that the severity o f effects o f environmental degradation may be localized as inthe case


                                                  44

o f water where the aridareas o f the northern region are occupied by 77 percent o f the population
and account for 85 percent of GDP. Consequently, it is important that the GOM is sufficiently
capable to undertake environmental management at the local level where it is most needed. The
proposed operation incorporates actions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency o f
environmental management processes. The benchmarks that have been realized by the G O M
indicate that the country i s headed in the right direction with respect to protecting the
environment and improving environmental quality. Improved quality o f environmental
management, and increased transparency and availability o f information to the public attest to
this accomplishment.

F.      RISKS AND R I S K MITIGATION

139.    The main macroeconomic risks to the ENVSALprogram could be associated with effects
on the Mexican economy o f a sharper slowdown o f the US (and global) economy, a stronger
than expected tightening of monetary policy conditions, and a high volatility of oil prices. In
terms o f a sharp slowdown o f U S economy, possibly related to high oil prices, the impact on
Mexico has been demonstrated by the experience over the past three years. Such a slowdown
will take its toll most likely interms o f Mexican economic growth rather than price stability or
access to external financing. A sharper monetary tightening by the U S monetary authorities will
lead to an increase not only o f interest rates on external financing requirements but more
importantly o f domestic interest rates as well. Mexico has made important progress, however, to
reduce its vulnerability to adverse shocks and to enhance its ability to absorb such shocks.
Although gross external financing requirements remain substantial at US$51.8 billion or 8
percent o f GDP, the country's investment-grade on sovereign debt and the integration o f the
Mexican business sector into the US. and global financial markets should continue to provide
access to finance. The moderate current account deficit, at 1.5 percent o f GDP, also contributes
importantly to the mitigation o fthe country's external financing risk.

140.    Political risks would be associated with the presidential election o f 2006. Mexico's
multipartydemocratic system is currently dominated bythree political parties, all o f which stand
a reasonable chance o f winning the election. Changes within the cabinet prior to the election, as
well as change o f administration in December 2006, may result in a loss o f momentum to
complete the reforms supported by this program. This risk i s mitigated by the following factors:
(i> a recently-passed law established a civil service in the federal public administration, which
will likely result in lower official turnovers; (ii)secondly, the third operation o f the program i s
scheduled to take place during the first year o f the incoming administrationto provide continuity
and ensure sustainability o f the policy reforms; (iii)the legal and regulatory framework
established under ENVDPL I1through the enactment o f laws and regulations provide a basis to
ensure the continuity o f the policies; and (iv) the design o f the program, which anchors the
formulation o f sector environmental strategies on consensus-building among different
stakeholders, further strengthens the basis for continuity o fpolicies.

141.    Social and institutional risks could be associated with the implementation o f institutional
changes included in the reforms or that would have to take place during its implementation.
There are two sets o f institutional changes that involve a number o f risks: (i)
                                                                                decentralization o f
core functions of policy implementation to states and lower levels o f government; and (ii)      the
promotion o f a greater degree o f transparency, accountability and public participation. Although


                                               45

decentralization creates opportunities for'policy implementation that takes into consideration the
specificities o f sub-national contexts and the needs and priorities o fthe population, it brings with
it risks linkedto the absence ofupstream accountability frameworks, andweak local institutional
capacity and experience.

142.     Concurrently, the promotion o f participation o f stakeholders in decision making and
monitoring o f environmental policy generally supports the credibility, sustainability and
effectiveness o f policy actions. However, participation could also entail risks that need to be
addressed by designing risk management and mitigation measures. The main risks associated
with increased participatory management are: (i)     frustration due to unrealistic expectations; (ii)
incoherent and low quality feedback due to lack o f clear channels o f voice and information; and
(iii) ofparticipatoryprocessesbyelitesoruseofthemwithpoliticalormanipulative
      capture
purposes. These risks are addressedby the following measuresincluded inthe policies supported
by the loan or by complementary measures to be discussed inthe context of the third operation:
(i)wellfundedandeffectivecapacitybuildingprogram;(ii)accountabilityframeworkanda
    a                                                             an
tracking system that will monitor decentralization o f environmental functions and competencies
(iii)transparency and accessibility of environmental public information systems; (ii) enhanced
                                                                                         an
communicationstrategy for the sector; and (iii)   the development and dissemination o f guidelines
for public participation inEIA process and other participatory mechanisms.

143.     Additional risks that could result from the decentralization process in the water sector
include: (i) insufficient budgetary allocations to river basin councils to finance their effective
functioning; (ii)  CNA and the RBCs' capacity to implement the functions associated with greater
decentralization may be constrained by scarce humanresources. The operation will contribute to
the mitigation ofthese risks by supporting the preparation ofdetailed plans for financial resource
autonomy, which constitutes a necessary element for RBCs' self-management. Moreover, the
Bank-financed Integrated Management o f Basins and Aquifers Project, which is currently under
preparation, will further mitigate these risks as it will help to build the capacity o f stakeholders,
including RBCs, to assume responsibilities relative to water resource management in order to
improve the conditions for sustainable integrated water resources management anduse.

ANNEX 4: LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY (cod.)


ANEXO 1. EL PLAN NACIONAL DE DESARROLLOY EL COMPROMISO DE
MEXICO CON EL DESARROLLO SUSTENTABLE

La actual politica ambiental de Mexico es un reflejo del compromiso de la presente
administracion con el desarrollo sustentable del pais. Csta emerge directamente del
Plan Nacional de Desarrollo (PND) 2001 - 2006, que fija las prioridades, objetivos y
estrategias de la Administracion Publica Federal (APF) para el periodo. El PND sienta
las bases para la politica ambiental, entre otras, en 10s siguientes campos:

  i)  El Desarrollo Sustentable como un tema transversal. El PND reconoce a la
      sustentabilidad como uno de 10s cuatro criterios centrales para el desarrollo de la
      nacion. En congruencia con lo anterior, el sector de medio ambiente y recursos
      naturales sobresale como el ljnico sector que participa en las tres comisiones
      creadas por el Poder Ejecutivo Federal para lograr la coordinacion
      interinstitucional en el disetio y ejecucion de politicas publicas en 10s temas de
      Desarrollo Social y Humano, Crecimientocon Calidad y Orden y Respeto.

 ii)  Una gestion ambiental que responde a 10s retos del desarrollo economico y la
      gobernabilidad democratica. El PND incluye a la competitividad como otro de 10s
      criterios centrales para el desarrollo de la nacion y setiala que la transparencia y
      la rendicion de cuentas son parte de las cinco normas de accion gubernamental.
      Desde esta optica, la gestion ambiental se concibe una herramienta que permite
      definir claramente 10s derechos de propiedad y acceso a 10s recursos naturales,
      asi como crear instituciones ambientales robustas, con el proposito de dar
      certeza a las decisiones de inversion y asi, fortalecer la competitividad del pais y
      sus empresas. De igual forma, las autoridades ambientales tienen la obligacion
      de abrir sus procesos de toma de decisiones al escrutinio publico. Finalmente, la
      rendicion de cuentas implica que las autoridades sectoriales son responsables
      de informar a la ciudadania acerca de la eficiencia con que administran 10s
      recursos publicos para ejecutar politicas y programas de gobierno, asi como la
      efectividad de estos para mejorar la calidad de vida de 10s mexicanos.

ANNEX 4: LETTER OFDEVELOPMENT POLICY (cont.)


ANEXO 2. EL PROGRAMA NACIONAL DE MEDIO AMBIENTE Y RECURSOS
NATURALES

La politica ambiental de Mexico se encuentra plasmada en el Programa Nacional de
Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (PNMARN) 2001            -   2006, integrado por la
Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT). El PNMARN fue
resultado de un proceso de participacion pljblica que incluyo la realizacion de 125 foros
estatales de consulta ciudadana, asi como la recopilacion e integracion de las
aportaciones de 10s Consejos Consultivos Nacional y Regionales de Desarrollo
Sustentable.

La politica ambiental parte del reconocimiento de la estrecha relacion entre el medio
ambiente y la competitividad global. El deterioro del capital natural implica la
destruccion o agotamiento de 10s recursos naturales que pueden aprovecharse para
promover el desarrollo y colocar bienes y servicios en 10s mercados nacionales e
internacionales. Tambien, la degradacion ambiental amenaza la salud humana y 10s
ecosistemas, por lo que contribuye a la ineficiencia de la produccion. El modelo de
crecimiento economico observado en Mexico es evidencia de lo anterior, ya que las
pautas de desarrollo del pais han llevado a una perdida significativa del capital natural
que afecta a 10s mas pobres y pone en riesgo el desarrollo economico de Mexico en el
corto, mediano y largo plazo. En este contexto, la politica ambiental actual se
constituye como el principal instrumento con el cual la SEMARNAT busca influir las
decisiones de 10s sectores economicos para alinear sus actividades con 10s objetivos
de desarrollo sustentable del pais.

La politica ambiental esta basada en seis pilares, a saber:

   i)  lnfegralidad. El manejo de 10s recursos naturales se realiza mediante un enfoque
       integral de cuencas, tomando en cuenta la interrelacion entre agua, aire, suelo,
       bosques y diversidad biologica e incorporando consideraciones sociales y
       economicas.

   ii) Compromisos de /os secfores del Gobierno Federal. El compromiso con el
       desarrollo sustentable representa una tarea compartida por la SEMARNAT y
       diversas secretarias e instituciones federales responsables de 10s distintos
       sectores de la economia. Est0 se refleja en la agenda de la transversalidad de
       politicas pljblicas ambientales, en la que diversas dependencias del Gobierno
       Federaladoptan metas ambientales.

   iii) Gesfion. La estructura organica de la SEMARNAT fue transformada para que
       sus unidades y 10s organos desconcentrados y descentralizados integren sus
       esfuerzos para la atencion de 10s problemas ambientales. La gestion impulsa la
       colaboracion de las autoridades estatales y municipales bajo un nuevo
       federalismo; el us0 eficiente de 10s instrumentos de gestion ambiental; el
       desarrollo de indicadores de desempetio ambiental; y la consolidacion del marc0
       normativo y de foment0 para inducir un buen comportamiento ambiental.



                                         63

ANNEX 4: LETTEROF DEVELOPMENTPOLICY (cont.)



  iv) Valoracion de 10s Recursos Naturales y Servicios Ambientales. Se pretende
      asegurar que el us0 de bienes y servicios ambientales refleje el verdadero costo
      ambiental, asi como que las comunidades e individuos que son propietarios de
      10s recursos naturales reciban un pago tanto por 10s bienes que producen como
      por 10s servicios ambientalesque mantienen.

  v) Apego a la legalidad y combate a la impunidad. La ley se aplicara sin
      excepciones y se hara un combate irrestricto frente al crimen ambiental y la
      impunidad.

  vi) Participacion social y rendicion de cuentas. Los ciudadanos tienen el derecho
      de acceder a la informacion acerca del estado del medio ambiente y 10s efectos
      de este en su bienestar social y economico. Ademas, la SEMARNAT ha
      establecido indices y metas de desempetio para que la ciudadania pueda
      evaluar la gestion ambiental.

A partir de esos pilares, la SEMARNAT y sus organos desconcentrados y
descentralizadoselaboraron 17 programas que se agrupan en 10ssiguientes rubros:

  i) Programas Sectoriales e Institucionales: Programa Nacional Hidraulico,
      Programa Nacional Forestal, Programa de Procuracion de Justicia Ambiental, y
      Programade la Comision Nacionalde Areas Naturales Protegidas.

  ii) Cruzadas Nacionales: Cruzada por 10s Bosques y el Agua y Cruzada por un
      Mexico Limpio.

  iii) Programas Estrateaicos: Programapara Detenery Revertir la Contaminacion del
      Aire, Agua y Suelo; Programa para Detener y Revertir la Perdida de Capital
       Natural; Programa para Conservar 10s Ecosistemas y su Biodiversidad; y
      Programa para Promover el Desarrollo Sustentable en el Gobierno Federal.

  iv) Programas Regionales v Multisectoriales: Programa Frontera Norte, Programa
       Estrategico para el Sur - Sureste, Programa del Mar de Cortes y Corredor
      Biologic0 Mesoamericano.

  v) Programas Especiales: Programa para 10s Pueblos Indigenas; Programa de
       Equidad de Genero, Medio Ambiente y Sostenibilidad; y Programa Ambiental
       para la Juventud.

Entre estos programas, cabe destacar el Programa para Promover el Desarrollo
Sustentable en el Gobierno Federal, el cual constituye el principal vehiculo para
asegurar la incorporacion del principio de sustentabilidad en el quehacer de la
Administracion PIjblica Federal. El Programa inicio como un foro interinstitucional de
acercamiento, discusion, interaccion y establecimiento de acuerdos a favor de la
sustentabilidad entre 16 institucionesde la APF.



                                         64

ANNEX 4: LETTEROF DEVELOPMENTPOLICY(cont.)


Hasta enero del 2005 la SEMARNAT ha logrado la incorporacion de 32 instituciones,
que, junto con sus acuerdos y compromisos, conforman la Agenda de Transversalidad
de Politicas POblicas Ambientales. La Agenda agrupa metas medibles y verificables a
las que cada dependencia se comprometio con el propositode mejorar su desempeiio
ambiental y promover el desarrollosustentablede Mexico.

De manera complementaria a 10s programas seAalados anteriormente, el PNMARN
identifica tres mecanismos e instrumentos necesarios para aterrizar 10s principios
rectores de la politica ambiental en todos 10s ambitos y sectores que participan en la
construccion del desarrollosustentable.

El primer0 se refiere a una reforma legal que ha impulsado la SEMARNAT para
garantizar el acceso efectivo a la justicia en materia ambiental, aplicar el enfoque de
manejo integral de cuencas, valorar social y economicamente 10s recursos naturales y
servicios ambientales, aportar 10s elementos necesarios para la descentralizacion
efectiva y en general, adaptar 10s instrumentos legales existentes a las necesidades
cambiantes del pais.

El segundo comprende el financiamiento y la realizacion de una reforma fiscal que
permitan alcanzar las metas de la politica ambiental. Esta ultima comprende establecer
cobros por el us0 de recursos naturalesy servicios ambientalesque Sean propiedad de
la nacion, incluso con la posibilidad de dar un destino especifico a las recaudaciones
para invertirlas en el mantenimiento del recurso natural que es la base de la actividad
economica a la cual se le cobra el derecho.

El tercer0 es el relacionado con la participacion publica y la necesidad de establecer
vias y mecanismos que garanticen la participacion responsable de 10s miembros de
todos 10s sectores sociales y ordenes de gobierno interesados en la proteccion del
medio ambiente y el equilibrio ecologico.

ANEXO 3. PRINCIPALES LOGROS DE LA PRIMERA OPERACION DEL EnvSAL

El primer prestamo del ENVSAL (conocido como ENVSAL I) busco apoyar la
instrumentacion de 10s componentes estrategicos del PNMARN y sus programas
orientados a: a) impulsar la transversalidad del tema ambiental mediante la
incorporacion de consideraciones ambientales en las politicas y actividades de cuatro
sectores fundamentales para el desarrollo sustentable de Mexico: turismo, energia,
bosques y agua; y b) fortalecer la capacidad interna del sector medio ambiente y
recursos naturales para cumplir con sus responsabilidades de manera mas eficiente y
eficaz.

De manera general, puede afirmarse que el ENVSAL I contribuyo al desarrollo
sustentable de Mexico al constituirse en un foro para que diferentes sectores y
subsectores pudieran atender de manera coherente e integral problemas de interes
comlin en 10s que tradicionalmente cada sector habia trabajado de manera aislada. La
metodologia de trabajo de ENVSAL I, basada en una matriz de politicas y en la
constitucion de grupos de trabajo intersectoriales,permitio que 10s diferentes sectores
orientaran sus esfuerzos al desarrollo de soluciones para la atencion de problemasy la
obtencion de resultados claramente definidos. Esta metodologia permitio la integracion
de consideraciones ambientales en 10s procesos de toma de decision de sectores que
juegan un papel fundamental en el desarrollode Mexico. Cabe destacar en este sentido
el papel del Banco como catalizador para la coordinacion interinstitucional.

En terminos del fortalecimiento de la gestion ambiental, 10s esfuerzos del ENVSAL I
estuvieron encauzados a incrementar la transparencia del proceso de toma de
decisiones del sector ambiental y consolidar 10s instrumentos para la rendicion de
cuentas, asi como para apoyar 10s esfuerzos de la SEMARNAT para avanzar en el
procesode descentralizacion.

A continuacion se presentan algunas de las actividades especificas que fueron
apoyadas por el ENVSAL I.

       Turismo. El prestamo apoyo en la formulacion e inicio de la ejecucion del
       Programa Nacional de Turismo 2001 - 2006, mismo que enfatiza la necesidad
       de integrar esfuerzos y politicas para lograr la sustentabilidad de 10s destinos
       turisticos. Adicionalmente, se consiguio la reforma por parte del Poder
       Legislativo de 10s articulos 198 y 198a de la Ley Federal de Derechos, con lo
       cual se establecio el cobro de derechos para la visita a las Areas Naturales
       Protegidas, parques marinos y observacion de ballenas. Los ingresos generados
       por estos derechos fueron asignados a derechos especificos para ser invertidos
       en la conservacionde 10s mismos sitios que generaron el ingreso. Este esquema
       permitio incrementar 10s ingresos en una magnitud de mas de 500 veces del
       monto original de las areas naturales.

ANNEX 4: LETTEROF DEVELOPMENT POLICY (cont.)


  ii) Energia. Con el apoyo del ENVSAL I, la Secretaria de Energia (SENER), en
      colaboracion con otras instituciones, elaboro y comenzo la ejecucion del
      Programa Medio Ambiente del Sector Energetico. Ademas, se integro el Grupo
      Tecnico de Trabajo intersectorial en el que participan diferentes dependencias
      con el objetivo de construir consensosen torno a la politica ambiental del sector.

  iii) Bosques. El ENVSAL Ifacilito el establecimiento de un grupo intersectorial para
      el sector forestal que permitio el establecimiento de las metas del sector en el
      mediano plazo y la construccion de consensos en torno a las politicas
      sectoriales a cargo de SEMARNAT y de la Comision Nacional Forestal
      (CONAFOR).

  iv) Agua. Los logros del sector agua en el marco de ENVSAL I incluyeron la
      preparacion del Programa Nacional Hidraulico en coherencia con el PNMARN.
      Adicionalmente, se publico un Decreto Presidencial por el cual el Gobierno
       Federalcondono la deuda ocasionada por la falta de pago de las tarifas del agua
       a aquellos municipios que aceptaran utilizar las asignaciones futuras del
       Gobierno Federal para agua y saneamiento como garantia de pago en el futuro.
      Asimismo, se aprobo la Ley Federal de Derechos en Materia de Agua, misma
       que contempla la posibilidadde que la totalidad de 10s ingresos recaudados por
       el concept0 de tarifas de agua Sean devueltos a 10s municipios, a cambio del
       compromisode estos de destinar esa cantidad y un monto equivalente adicional
       a la inversion en programas hidricos. Como resultado de estas ultimas dos
       acciones, el porcentaje de municipios con poblaciones mayores a las 2,500
       personas que junto con el Distrito Federal pagan sus tarifas de agua se
       incrementodel 24% en el 2002 al 58% en el 2003. Por su parte, la Secretaria de
       Hacienda y Credit0 Pliblico (SHCP) devolvio el 95% de las cuotas de agua a 10s
       municipios,conforme a lo previsto por la Ley. El Gobierno publico la informacion
       concerniente a 10s montos totales que fueron canalizados a 10s municipios bajo
       este esquema.

  v) Gestion Ambiental. En materia de descentralizacion, el ENVSAL apoyo el
       establecimiento del Programa de Desarrollo lnstitucional Ambiental (PDIA), a
       traves del cual se transfirieron recursos para la asistenciatecnica y el desarrollo
       institucionalde 27 estados, con base en acuerdos de desempefio ambiental. En
       terminos de transparencia y rendicion de cuentas, ENVSAL apoyo al Gobierno
       de Mexico en las modificaciones que se hicieron a la normatividad relacionada
       con la Evaluacionde lmpactoAmbiental (EIA) y otros tramites con el objetivo de
       abrir espacios a la participacionpublica.

ANEXO 4: COMPONENTES GENERALES DE LA SEGUNDA OPERACION DEL
PROGRAMA DE AJUSTE ESTRUCTRALAMBIENTAL (EnvSAL II)


1. Antecedentes

La primera etapa del Programa de Ajuste Estructural Ambiental (EnvSAL I) apoyo la
instrumentacion de 10s componentes estrategicos del PNMARN y sus programas
orientados a: i) impulsar la transversalidad del tema ambiental mediante la
incorporacion de consideraciones ambientales en las politicas y actividades de cuatro
sectores fundamentales para el desarrollo sustentable de Mexico: turismo, energia,
bosques y agua; y ii) fortalecer la capacidad interna del sector medio ambiente y
recursos naturales para cumplir con sus responsabilidades de manera mas eficiente y
eficaz.

El apoyo del Banco Mundial ha contribuido a consolidar las bases del desarrollo
sustentable en Mexico, a traves del EnvSAL I, pues 10s sectores participantes iniciaron
la construccion de consensos y el impulso a reformas de politica, y comenzaron a
atender, de manera coherente e integral, asuntos ambientales de interes comun en 10s
que tradicionalmente cada sector habia trabajado de manera aislada. La metodologia
de trabajo establecida por el Gobierno de Mexico se bas6 en la construccion de una
matriz de politicas y en la conformacion de grupos de trabajo intersectoriales, que
facilitaron la inclusion de consideraciones ambientales en 10s procesos de toma de
decision de 10s sectores que participaron en el EnvSAL I. Cabe destacar en este
sentido el papel del Banco Mundial, como impulsor y de la Secretaria de Hacienda y
Credit0 Publico, como garante para la coordinacion interinstitucional.

En terminos del fortalecimiento de la gestion ambiental, 10s esfuerzos del ENVSAL I
estuvieron encauzados a incrementar la transparencia del proceso de toma de
decisiones del sector ambiental y consolidar 10s instrumentos para la rendicion de
cuentas, asi como para apoyar 10s esfuerzos de la SEMARNAT para avanzar en el
proceso de descentralizacion.


II. Justificacion de unsegundo prestamo

La asistencia del Banco Mundial permitio lograr reformas en 10s marcos de politicas y
normativos que constituyen avances sin precedente en 10s esfuerzos de Mexico para
alcanzar el desarrollo sustentable. Sin embargo, dichas reformas representan apenas
10s cimientos sobre 10s cuales se habra de consolidar un marco institucional que
proporcione certeza a 10s inversionistas, asegure la internalizacion de 10s costos
ambientales y asegure el us0 eficiente del capital natural para fortalecer la
competitividad del pais. Es por ello que el Gobierno de Mexico considera necesario
continuar con la segunda operation contemplada por el ENVSAL.

ANNEX 4: LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY (cont.)


En particular, esta segunda operacion estaria orientada en apoyar un conjunto de
acciones que permitan profundizar y asegurar la sustentabilidad de las reformas
realizadas en el marco del primer prestamo. Este apoyo estaria canalizado hacia las
acciones estrategicasque cumplan con 10s siguientes criterios:

   i) Contribucion al aprovechamiento sustentable del capital natural del pais para
       utilizar la riqueza de 10s ecosistemas mexicanos como fuente de ventaja
      competitiva para satisfacer la demanda de nichos de mercado mas selectivos y
       lucrativos.

  ii)  Definicion de acciones de gobierno encaminadas a atender fallas de mercado y
      distorsiones de politicas que resultanen el deterioro de la calidad ambiental, asi
       como afectaciones a la salud pliblica y por ende, a la productividad y
       competitividaddel pais.

 iii) Adopcion de estrategias para la creacion de un clima propicio para la
       competitividad del sector productivo, incluyendo la definicion de reglas claras,
       sencillas y permanentes, asi como la oferta de servicios gubernamentales de
       gran calidad.

Mr.JamesWolfensohn
President
WorldBank


The government o f Mexico has concluded the First Phase o f the Program for Structural
Adjustment o f Public Policies (EnvSAL) in support o f the National Program for Environment
andNatural Resources 2001-2006 (PNMARN).

The proposal to enter into a loan agreement with the World Bank for EnvSAL was presented
May 26, 2002, by Official Note 00953, signed by the Secretary of Environment and Natural
Resources, to which a positive reply was granted with the signingo f Loan Agreement No. 7136-
ME.

As a result o f this Environment Structural Adjustment Program, the present administration o f the
government o f Mexico has implemented environmental public policies at the federal level inthe
subject areas selected for this purpose (water, forestry, energy, tourism, decentralization, and
fiscal policy instruments). The continuation o f these efforts would be guaranteed by a second
phaseo fthe program (EnvSAL 11).

During the first two years in which the program came into effect, the regulatory and
environmental policy frameworks were reformed, and progress was made to integrate
environmental management in the aforementioned sectors. These advances contribute to the
consolidation o f an institutional framework that gives confidence to investors and ensures the
internalization o f environmental costs and the efficient use o f natural capital to strengthen the
country's competitiveness. For these reasons, the government o f Mexico considers it necessary
to develop a second phase o fthe program.

This operation will be directed at the consolidation of actions carried out withinthe framework
o f the first phase and drive other identified activities to continue the strategic actions in the
aforementioned sectors.

The Secretariat o f Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) is convinced o f the need
to build bridges between different sectors in order to advance toward sustainable development.
The already constituted Intersectoral Working Groups have contributed decisively to the
intersectoral coordination and the shaping o f the mainstreaming agendas, which constitute a
Presidential priority.

Annex 1. TheNationalDevelopmentPlanandMexico's Commitmentto Sustainable
           Development

Mexico's current environmental policy i s a reflection o f the present administration's
commitment to the country's sustainable development. This policy stems directly from the 2001-
2006 National Development Plan (NDP) which establishes the priorities, objectives, and
strategies o f the Federal Public Administration (APF) for this period. The NDP sets the stage for
environmental policy inthe following areas:

      i. SustainableDevelopmentasacross-cuttingissue:ThePNDrecognizessustainability
           as one o f the four key criteria for the nation's development. Inline withthe above, the
           environment and natural resources sector stands out as the only sector that
           participates in the three commissions created by the Federal Executive Authority to
           achieve inter-institutional coordination inthe design and execution o f public policies
           on the issues o f Social and Human Development, Growth with Quality, and Order
           andRespect.
     ii. Environmentalmanagementthatrespondstothechallengesofeconomicdevelopment
           and democratic governance. The PND includes competitiveness as another o fthe key
           criteria for the nation's development and indicates that transparency and
           accountability are part o f the five norms o f government action. From this standpoint,
           environmental management i s conceived as a tool that makes it possible to clearly
           define rights o f ownership and access to natural resources, as well as to create robust
           environmental institutions, to give certainty to investment decisions and thereby
           strengthening the competitiveness o f the country and its enterprises. Likewise,
           environmental authorities are obliged to open their decision-making processes to
           public scrutiny. Finally, accountability implies that sectoral authorities are
           responsible for informing citizens about the efficiency with which they administer
           public resources in order to carry out government policies and programs, as well as
           their effectiveness inimproving the quality o f life o f Mexican citizens.

Annex 2.       TheNationalEnvironmentalandNaturalResourcesProgram

Mexico's environmental policy i s articulated in the 2001-2006 National Environment and
Natural Resources Program (PNMARN), developed by the Secretariat o f the Environment and
Natural Resources (SEMARNAT). PNMARN was the result o f a public participation process
that included 125 state forums for citizen consultation, as well as the collection and integrationo f
inputsfromNational andRegionalConsultative Councilson Sustainable Development.

Environmental policy stems from the recognition o f the close relationship between the
environment and global competitiveness. The deterioration o f natural capital implies the
destruction or depletion o f natural resources that may be used to promote development and place
goods and services in national and intemational markets. Environmental degradation also
threatens human health and ecosystems and thus contributes to inefficient production. The
economic growth model observed inMexico is evidence o fthis, since the country's development
models have led to a significant loss o f natural capital which affects the poorest people and
places Mexico's economic development at risk in the short, medium, and long terms. In this
context, the current environmental policy constitutes the key instrument with which
SEMARNAT seeks to influence the decisions o f economic sectors so as to align their activities
withthe country's sustainable development objectives.

The environmental policy is basedon six key elements:

   1.   Comprehensiveness. Natural resources management i s carried out by means o f a
        comprehensive watershed approach, taking into account the inter-relationship among
        water, air, soils, forests, and biodiversity and incorporating social and economic

  ..    considerations.

  11.   Commitments of Federal Government sectors. Commitment to sustainable development
        represents a task shared by SEMARNAT and various federal secretariats and institutions
        responsible for different sectors o f the economy. This is reflected in the environmental
        mainstreaming agenda, in which various Federal Government agencies adopt

 ...    environmental targets.

 111.   Management. SEMARNAT's organic structure was changed to allow its decentralized
        units and agencies to combine their efforts in order to address environmental problems.
        Management promotes collaboration by state and municipal authorities under a new
        federalism; the efficient use o f environmental management instruments; the development
        of environmental performance indicators; and the consolidation o f the regulatory and
        development framework to promoteproper environmentalbehavior.
 iv.     Valuation of Natural Resources and Environmental Services. The aim i s to ensure that
        the use o f environmental goods and services reflects the true environmental cost and that
        the communities and individuals who are the owners o f natural resources receive
        payment both for the goods they produce and for the environmental services they
        maintain.

  V.    Legality and efforts to combat impunity. The law shall be applied without exception and
        unrestricted efforts will be made to combat environmental crimes andimpunity.

ANNEX 4: LETTEROFDEVELOPMENT POLICY (cont.)


 vi.    Social participation and accountability. Citizens have the right to access information on
        the state o f the environment and its effects on their social and economic well-being.
         Furthermore, SEMARNAT has established performance indexes and targets so that
         citizens can evaluate environmental management.

Based on these key elements, SEMARNAT and its decentralized agencies prepared 17 programs
grouped under the following categories:

      1.     Sectoral and Institutional Programs: National Water Program, National Forest
             Program, Environmental Justice Mandate Program, and Program o f the National

      ..     Commission for Natural ProtectedAreas.

     11.
     ...     National Crusades: Crusade for Forests andWater, and Crusade for a Clean Mexico.

     111.    Strategic Programs: Program to Stop and Reverse Air, Water, and Soil Pollution;
             Program to Stop and Reverse the Loss o f Natural Capital; Program to Conserve
             Ecosystems and their Biodiversity;          and Program to Promote Sustainable
             Developmentinthe Federal Government.
     iv.     Regional and Multisectoral Pronrams: Northern Frontier Program; Strategic Program
             for the South-Southwest; Program for the Sea o f CortCs and Mesoamerican
             Biological Corridor.

      V.     Special Programs: Indigenous Peoples Program; Gender Equity, Environment and
             Sustainability Program; and Environmental Program for Youth.

Among these programs, the Program to Promote Sustainable Development in the Federal
Government should be mentioned. It i s the key vehicle to ensure the incorporation o f the
principle o f sustainability inthe duties o f the Federal Public Administration. The Program began
as an inter-institutional forum to bring together the APF's 16 institutions for discussions,
interaction, andreaching agreement on sustainability.

As of January 2005 SEMARNAT had incorporated 32 institutions which, along with their
agreements and commitments, make up the environmental mainstreaming agenda. The Agenda
contains measurable, verifiable targets to which each agency i s committed, for the purpose o f
improving their environmental performance and promoting Mexico's sustainable development.

Complementary to the above-mentioned programs, PNMARN identifies three mechanisms and
instruments neededto establish the guiding principles o f environmentalpolicy inall spheres and
sectors that participate inthe attainment o f sustainable development.

The first refers to a legal reform promoted by SEMARNAT to ensure effective access to justice
in environmental matters, apply the integrated watershed management approach, socially and
economically evaluate natural resources and environmental services, contribute the elements
needed for effective decentralization, and in general adapt existing legal instruments to the
country's changing needs.

The second includes the financing and realization of a fiscal reform in order to meet
environmental policy targets. The latter includes setting fees for the use o f nationally owned

natural resources and environmental services, with the possibility o f specifically allocating the
resources collected to the maintenance o f the natural resources which are the basis o f the
economic activity for which the fee i s charged.

The third relates to public participation and the need to establish means and mechanisms to
ensure the responsible participation o f members o f all social sectors and government agencies
interested inenvironmental protectionandecological equilibrium.

Annex 3.         PrincipalAchievements of the FirstEnvSALOperation

The first ENVSAL loan (known as ENVSAL I)sought to support the implementation o f the
P N M A R " s strategic components and its programs aimed at: a) promoting environmental
mainstreaming through the incorporation o f environmental considerations in the policies and
activities o f four key sectors for Mexico's sustainable development: tourism, energy, forests, and
water; and b) strengthening the internal capacity o f the environmental and natural resources
sector to fulfill its responsibilities more efficiently and effectively.

Ingeneral, it may be statedthat ENVSALIcontributed to Mexico's sustainable development by
creating a forum to allow different sectors and subsectors to coherently and comprehensively
address problems o f common interest inwhich each sector had traditionally operated alone. The
working methodology o f ENVSAL I,based on a policy matrix and on the formation o f
intersectoral working groups, allowed the different sectors to aim their efforts at developing
solutions to problems and at achieving clearly defined results. This methodology made it
possible to include environmental considerations inthe decision-making processes o f sectors that
play a key role in Mexico's development. Inthis regard, the Bank's role as promoter o f inter-
institutional coordinationshould be highlighted.

Interms of strengthening environmental management, efforts under ENVSAL Iwere aimed at
increasing transparency inthe environmental sector's decisionmaking process and consolidating
instruments for accountability, as well as supporting SEMARNAT's efforts to move forward in
the decentralization process.

The following are some o fthe specific activities supported by ENVSAL I,

   1.   Tourism.The loan supported the formulation and start-up of the execution of the 2001-
        2006 National Tourism Program which emphasizes the need to integrate efforts and
        policies to achieve the sustainability o f tourist destinations. In addition, reforms articles
         198 and 198a o f the Federal Rights Law were reformed by Congress, allowing for user
        fees for visits to Natural Protected Areas, marine parks, and whale watching. The income
         generatedby these fees was allocated to specific rights to be invested inthe conservation
        of those sites that generated this income. This scheme made it possible to increase

  ..    income by over 500 times the original amount for natural areas.

  11.   Energy. With the support of ENVSAL I,the Secretariat o f Energy (SENER), in
        collaboration with other institutions, prepared and began the execution o f the Energy
         Sector's Environmental Program. The Intersectoral Technical Working Group was
        formed, with the participation o f different agencies, to build consensus on the sector's
 ...    environmental policy.

 111.   Forests.ENVSALIfacilitated the establishment of anintersectoral group for the forestry
         sector. This allowed the sector's medium-term targets to be established and consensus
        building on sectoral policies under the responsibility o f SEMARNAT and the National
        Forest Commission (CONAFOR).
 iv.    Water. The achievements o f the water sector under the framework of ENVSAL I
         included the preparation o f the National Water Program in conjunction with PNMARN.



                                                  80

ANNEX 4: LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY (cont.)


    In addition, a Presidential Decree was published, by which the Federal Government
    forgave the debt caused by lack o f payment o f water tariffs for those municipalities that
    agreed to utilize future Federal Government allocations for water and sanitation as a
    guarantee of future payment. Likewise, the Federal Water Rights Law was approved.
    This law considers the possibility that all income collected from water tariffs will be
    returned to municipalities, inexchange for their commitment to allocate this amount and
    an additional, equivalent amount to investments in water programs. As a result o f the
    latter two actions, the percentage o f municipalities with populations o f over 2,500 people
    which, together with the Federal District, pay their water tariffs, increased from 24% in
    2002 to 58% in 2003. In turn, the Secretariat o f Finance and Public Credit (SHCP)
    returned 95% o f water fees to municipalities, as stipulated by the Law. The Government
    published information concerning the total amounts channeled to municipalities under
    this scheme.
 v. Environmental Management. In terms of decentralization, ENVSAL supported the
    establishment o f the Institutional Environmental Development Program (PDIA), through
    which funds were transferred for technical assistance to, and the institutional
    development of, 27 states, based on environmental performance agreements. Interms o f
    transparency and accountability, ENVSAL supported the Government o f Mexico in the
    modifications to regulations related to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and
    other processes, withthe objective o f opening spaces for public participation.

Annex 4:       GeneralComponents of the SecondOperationof the EnvironmentStructural
AdjustmentProgram(EnvSAL 11)


I. Background

The first phase o f the Environment Structural Adjustment Program (EnvSAL I)supported the
orchestration o f the strategic components o f PNMARN and its programs oriented to: (i)     promote
the environmental mainstreaming by means o f incorporating environmental considerations in
policies and activities o f four sectors fundamental to sustainable development in Mexico:
tourism, energy, forestry and water; and (ii)  strengthen the internal capacity o f the environment
andnatural resources sector to fulfill its responsibilities ina more efficient andeffective manner.

The support o f the World Bank has helped to consolidate the sustainable development bases in
Mexico through EnvSAL I,as the participating sectors beganconsensus-building and promotion
o fpolicy reform, andstarted to address ina coherent aridintegrated manner environmental issues
o f common interest, whereas traditionally each sector had worked in an isolated manner. The
work methodology established by the Government o f Mexico was baseduponthe construction o f
a policy matrix and inthe formation o f intersectoral technical working groups, which facilitated
the inclusion o f environmental considerations in the decision-making process o f the sectors
participating inEnvSAL I.Inthis sense it i s worth emphasizing the roles o f the World Bank, as
the driving force, and the Secretariat o f Finance, as guarantor for the inter-institutional
coordination.

Interms ofstrengthening environmental management, the efforts ofEnvSALIwere channeledto
increase the transparency o f the decision-making process within the environment sector, and to
consolidate fiscal instruments, such as supporting the efforts o f SEMARNAT to advance the
decentralization process.

11.     Justificationfor the SecondLoan

The World Bank's assistance allowed the country to achieve reforms inthe policy andregulatory
frameworks, representing unprecedented advances in Mexico's efforts to achieve sustainable
development. Nevertheless, these reforms represent merely the foundations upon which an
institutional framework will be consolidated to provide certainty to investors, ensure the
internalization of environmental costs, and ensure the efficient use o f natural capital to
strengthen the country's competitiveness. Therefore, the Government o f Mexico considers it
necessary to continue withthe second operation contemplated under EnvSAL.

Inparticular, this second operation will be oriented to support a set of actions that will deepen
and ensure the sustainability o f reforms achieved during the first loan. This support will be
channeled towards strategic actions that fulfill the following criteria:

   i. Contributetothesustainableuseofthecountry's naturalcapitalinordertoutilizethe
        richness o f Mexico's ecosystems as a source o f competitive advantage to satisfy the
        demands o f more selective and lucrative niche markets.

 iii. Adopt strategies to create the appropriate climate for the competitiveness of the
       productive sector, including the definition o f clear, simple andpermanent rules, as well as
       the provision o f highquality government services.

111.   MainActions ofthe SecondOperation

Based onthese criteria, the following demonstrates the principal actions andobjectives that make
up the second operation, which recognize the important advances Mexico has made in the
development and implementation o f policies that contribute to sustainable development, and
furthermore are consistent with the principles, objectives andlines o f action outlined by the PND
andthe PNMARN.

           actions that promote protection o f the environment andnatural resources as necessary
           elements to increase competitiveness and ensure the sustainability o f the tourism
           industry.

       0   Based uponthe consensus achieved by the Intersectoral Technical Working Group for
           Tourism, carry out the necessary studies to consolidate the national sustainable
           development strategy coordinated by the Secretariat o f Tourism (SECTUR) in
           conjunction with the other dependents that participate inthe Tourism Working Group.

       0   By means o f Presidential Decree, consolidate the Inter-sectoral Tourism Commission
           as a mechanism for inter-sectoral coordination at the highest levels, which will permit
           the integrationo fpublic policy to achieve the objectives ofthe NationalTourism Plan
           2001-2006, including the promotion o f sustainable tourist destinations.

       0   Consolidationby SECTUR and PROFEPA o fthe Environmental Quality Program for
           Tourism, which recognizes good environmental performance o f tourist installations
           and represents an incentive to comply with environmental laws. The certification in
           the context of the program is awarded based on results of an environmental audit to
           which the tourist installations submit voluntarily.

       0   Consolidation o f the Integrated Program for Clean Beaches, which includes a system
           o f indicators and base lines that allow the monitoring o f water quality in tourism
           centers. The indicators are publicly accessible, so that the general public can make
           informeddecisions for the selection o f tourism destinations that they visit.

ANNEX 4: LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY (cont.)


    0  Implementation o f a public policy for Tourist Cruises that recognize the growth o f
       this activity inthe country and seeks to ensure that the number o f cruises that visit the
       country do not exceed the carrying capacity o f the ecosystems. At the same time, it
       seeks to promote the provision o f services to cruises that result in a more pleasant
       experience for the tourists andmitigates environmental impacts.
       Ensure the application o f the new General Law for Prevention and Integrated Waste
       Management, which provides the legal framework for the appropriate handling o f
       wastes in urban centers, as well as the development o f mechanisms for the

       developing and implementing plansfor integrated waste management.

    Energy


    0  Achievement o f concrete actions that reduce environmental impacts from the energy
       sector on public health. Among these can be highlighted the improvement o f fuel
       quality, inparticular the reductiono f sulfur content from 1000to 300 ppmingasoline
       sold in the Mexico Valley Metropolitan Zone. At the same time, carry out rural
       electrification projects that allow for the substitution o f fuels currently used by rural
       communities that have negative impacts on health, affecting mainly the vulnerable
       groups such as women and children.

    0  The development, according to the agreements reached by the Inter-sectoral Energy
       Working Group, o f prospective studies on the energy sector that will guide Mexican
        sectoral policies to achieve economic, social andenvironmentalobjectives.
       Encourage the use o f renewable energy sources, such as by an Official Mexican
       Norm to regulate geothermal energy. In a complementary manner, develop
        institutional mechanisms that allow for the establishment o f economic incentives and
       market mechanisms that favor investment inthese types o f energies.

    0  Reduce the environmental impact o f parastatal companies inthe sector, in particular
       PEMEX and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). Both companies have
        adopted environmental management systems that allow them to achieve important
       results inthe short-term and continue to help improve environmental performance in
       the future.

    0  As part o f the efforts o f the sector to mitigate its impacts on a global level and
       consistent with Mexico's participation in international negotiations regarding climate
       change, support the operation o f the Clean Development Mechanism Office, whose
        functions include the implementation o f methodologies that permit the measurement
       and verification o f carbon reductions, as well as the strengthening o f the portfolio o f
       investment projects that have the potential to be financed through this mechanism.
       The office was established to conform to the guidelines established by the
       international community at the Conference o f the Parties to the Framework
        Conventionon Climate Change held inBonnandMarrakesh.

       Application of the General Law on Sustainable Forestry Development and the
       promotion o f the creation o f its regulations. The law represents a fundamental
       component of the reforms that the sector has undertaken to strengthen the legal
       framework o f the sector and to ensure that the development o f forestry activity
       conforms to well-defined rules that promote investment. The law assigns functions
       and responsibilities to different government entities for conservation, protection,
       restoration, production, harvesting and management o f the country's forestry
       resources.

    0  Approval o f regulations o f the Forestry Law which defines the regulatory framework

       economic resources to promote the sustainable use o f forest resources and payment
        for environmental services that they provide.

    Water


     0  Amendments to the National Water Law to advance the integrated management o f
        water resources. The amendments aim to define operational mechanisms for
        decentralized water basin authorities in which different water users can discuss
        relevant topics regarding water resource use, the strengthening o f the system o f water
        rightsandmodifications that will contribute to a better functioning water market.

     0  As complementary measures to the National Water Law amendments, carry out

       carried out by the Federal Government.

    0  Adaptation o f the legal framework and administrative processes to establish clear
       rules that favor investment and promote the compliance with environmental law. In
       this context should be highlighted the modifications that have been made to the
       environmental impact guidelines in order to reduce processing times, identify
       cumulative impacts, and open up areas o f public consultation for communities that
       could be affected by projects under consideration.

    0   Strengthening o f the decentralization process through a monitoring and evaluation
        scheme for the performance o f the state environmental authorities with relationto the
       functions that have been transferred to them. Based on this model, priority functions
       to be transferred to states have been identified that are related to the management o f
       ZOFEMAT, forests and soil, as well as wildlife. This scheme seeks to respond to the
       limitations o f the decentralization model that was adopted at the beginning o f the
       administration and has been modified in this second phase o f environmental
       management.

    0   Support discussions to approve fiscal and market instruments that generate income to
       finance environmental management inthe federal and state levels. Inthis context, the
        Secretariat o f Finance (SHCP) has developed criteria for establishing environmental
       rights, the guidelines for taxes, tariffs and environmental surcharges at the local level,
       and a draft ofthe Environmental Tax Law.

Background

Afterthreeyears of weak activity, the broad-basedrecovery underway this year provides
encouragingevidencethatthefactors hddlngbackMexico'sgrowthwere temporary. Business
confidenceand investment have risen,foreign direct investment(FDI)inflowsare
strengthening,exportshavepickedupsharply,andmarketperceptionsof Mexicoremain
favorable.While inflationhas risenmoderatelyabove the authorities'objective,itremainsfar
below levels historicallyexperiencedbyMexico.Higheroilpricesanda recoveryinnansil
exportshave ledto a narrowinginthe currentaccount deficit.The currentaccount deficit has
beenmorethanmatchedby FDIinfkom.

mechanismfor auctioninginternationalreservesinMarch2004.The Bancode Mexico
continuesto pre-announcethe amountof dollarsto be sdd inthe market, equalto 50percent
of net reserveaccumulationinthe previousthree-monthperiod. The sale of dollarswill now,
however, be spreadoverthe following 12months, as opposedtothree months,to reduce
volatilityinthe amount sold throughoutthe year.

Targetsfor thetraditionaldeficit havebeenmetin recent years. Butthe paceof fiscal
consolidation, viewed interms of the augmentedpublicsector deficit, hasbeenslower than
envisagedinthe authorities' 2002 medium-termplan. W          thisdeficitwas reducedfrom

depreciationand slow growth. For 2004, the augmenteddeficitisexpectedto remainbroadly
unchanged,while thetraditional deficitwould fall slightlyto 0.4 percentof GDP, inlinewith
budgettargets. The draft budgetfor 2005callsfor a declineinthe augmenteddeficitto 2.2

Thegovernmenthas madesignificant progress in strengthening the structure of publicdebt.
 Several liabilitymanagementoperations,includingan exchangeof giobalbondsinearly 2004,
 have helpedto improvethe efficiency of the yield curve. Domestic publicdebt management
 hasconcentrated on extendingmeturities, improving the liquidity of benchmrk issues, and
 deepening domesticfinancialmarkets.Nevertheless, some publicdebtvulnerabilitiesremain,
with a large portionof domestic debt either short term or linked to short-terminterestrates,
The publlcsector also hasa significant gross financingneed.
