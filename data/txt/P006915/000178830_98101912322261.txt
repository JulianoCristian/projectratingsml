COSTA RICA
INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
APPRAISAL OF THE FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Costa Rica has requested World Bank assistance in
helping to finance Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE)'s five year
(1978-82) telecommunications development program. The proposed Borrower and
Beneficiary of the loan would be ICE.
1.02      ICE's five year (1978-82) telecommunications development program is
estimated to cost about US$163 million and consists of:
(a) completion of ongoing projects which will involve total
expenditures estimated at about US$34 million;
(b) the proposed project (about US$94 million);
(c) advance expenditures (about US$28 million) for buildings
and down payments on equipment to provide for further
expansion from 1981 onwards; and
(d) interest during construction (about US$7 million).
The project is a self-contained part of ICE's five year development program
and is expected to be completed from 1978 through 1981. The project provides
for the installation of (a) local exchange lines; (b) long distance facilities;
(c) rural telephones; (d) expansion of the telex network; (e) replacement of
the existing archaic telegraph system and extension of telegraph service to
new areas; and (f) additional training facilities. The estimated project's
cost of US$94.1 million 1/ includes foreign exchange expenditures of US$53.3
million. 1/ The proposed Bank loan of US$10.6 million would finance part of
the foreign costs of the project. It would be associated with an approved
IDB loan of US$12.2 million and with various suppliers' credits (US$28.7
million). ICE would finance the local costs (US$46 million) and a limited
amount of foreign expenditures (US$2.8 million.)
1.03      The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector
in Costa Rica since 1963 through four loans: a first loan, 346-CR, effective
October 10, 1963, of US$22 million was made for electric power and telecom-
munications development. A second loan, 632-CR, effective October 20, 1966,
included US$6.5 million for telecommunications development. The two first
projects have been completed. A third loan, 801-CR, effective June 2, 1972,
including US$17.5 million for telecommunications development has been com-
pleted by the end of 1977; it has been delayed by one year, partly due to
an increase in the size of the project during execution to adapt it to higher
demand than earlier forecast, and partly due to difficulties in implementing
1/   These amounts do not include interest during construction (see paras. 5.10
and 5.14).

the rural telephone component. The fourth loan, 1006-CR, of US$23.5 million
effective November 19, 1974, corresponds to the fourth telecommunications
development project, which is progressing according to an agreed revised
schedule and is expected to be completed at the end of 1978.
1.04      This report is based on information obtained from ICE and from the
findings of the mission composed of Messrs. H. Richardot and A. Leoni which
visited Costa Rica in July/August 1977.



II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
2.01      Costa Rica, with an area of 51,359 square kilometers, is located in
the Central American isthmus. It is crossed by highlands oriented northwest
southeast on its total length, with a central plateau, which is the most
populated and most economically active area. The 1975 gross national product
per capita was estimated at $910 (but the average income of rural families is
less than half of the income of families in urban zones).
2.02      The principal objective described in the national plan for develop-
ment 1978-1982 is the elimination of the extreme poverty; among the diverse
lines of action that the Government intends to follow for doing so are the
integration of the different production sectors (especially agricultural and
industrial) to create more jobs, and to foster complementary activities in
the different provinces to reduce the inequities in development created by
the rugged geography of the country. Both objectives, and the corresponding
reinforcement of the guiding capabilities of the Government will require a
significant improvement of the communications system in Costa Rica (see para.
7.02).
2.03      Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), an autonomous
Government-owned public corporation provides - in addition to electric power -
all national and international telephone services; operates - with its fully
owned subsidiary RADIOGRAFICA COSTARRICENSE, SA (RACSA) - all equipment used
for telex operation; and offers circuits for private rental (see paras. 3.14
to 3.18 the description of the network). A 1964 law gave Radioagrafica
Costarricense S.A. (RACSA), at the time a concessionary company 50% owned
by ICE, responsibility for most international services. ICE bought the
remaining 50% of the shares in October 1975. In accordance with the law that
established RACSA in 1964, ICE would have taken over the company in 1977.
However, after some internal and external debate, a law was voted on July 27,
1977, which maintains RACSA's identity for ten more years and which provides
that the RACSA shares owned by ICE   be non-negotiable. Independently, "Junta
Nacional de Comunicaciones", a Government agency operates the existing tele-
graph network. In order to rationalize the sector and improve efficiency,
Government intends that this last entity should progressively use ICE's
telecommunications facilities (see Annex 2.01). Assurances have been obtained
during negotiations that ICE's charges for use of telephone and telex lines by
the "Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones" will be adequate to cover the cost of
providing such services.
2.04      The Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (SNE) is Costa Rica's
principal regulatory authority. It has jurisdiction over the tariffs,
technical standards and finances of ICE's electric and telecommunications
operations as well as over all other entities providing public electric
and water/sewerage services. However, SNE does not have jurisdiction
over RACSA. The government reviews SNE's decisions concerning tariff
matters.

2.05      A local factory, CONDUCEN, SA, produces cables of up to a size of
200 pairs.
Access to Service
2.06      Costa Rica's telephone density of 5.61 per 100 population is in
the medium range when compared with other neighboring countries -- Panama -
8.52; Mexico - 4.76; Colombia - 5.45; El Salvador - 1.39; Nicaragua - 1.00;
see Annex 2.02 -- all these other countries, however, have longer waiting
lists of applicants for telephone service. Existing telephone service is
largely concentrated in the central plateau, with a density of 16.1 in San Jose
metropolis (against Mexico City - 13.0; Bogota - 10.6; Santo Domingo - 8.9).
Telephone densities in the provinces of Costa Rica vary between 1.70 and
0.40. As of July 1977 there were 93,657 subscribers in Costa Rica, distributed
as follows:
No. of        Percent of    Percent of
Subscribers      Subscribers   Population
Area metropolitan                   71,112             76            28
Rest of the Country                 22,545            24             72
2.07      For purposes of Government administration, Costa Rica has 408 dis-
tricts, 246 of which have telephone service. The availability of telephone
service is much better in the urban areas than in the rural areas. All com-
munities with about 2,000 or more inhabitants have some access to telephone
service, but only about 50 of them can offer full telephone service with
exchange connections at business or residential premises. In those com-
munities with full telephone service, waiting lists of applicants are main-
tained, which show an average waiting time of about 11 months. In the other
communities equipped only with public telephones and in 162 rural districts
where no telephone service is provided, demand can only be roughly estimated,
as no waiting lists are maintained. (See para. 4.01.)
Telephone Service Usage
2.08      Telephone subscribers in Costa Rica are categorized according to
five classes (two-party, residential, commercial, PBX tie trunks, and public
telephones), with each category having different tariffs (see Annex 3.05) I/
depending on whether the connection is in an urban district or a rural com-
munity (the last category comprises exchanges with less than 300 subscribers).
In May 1977 the distribution was the following:
1/   However, "PBX tie trunks", which are physically different from " commer-
cial lines", are subject to the same tariff.

Other Localities             1              32               66                1
1/   Many of these telephones are actually used, at least partially, for
business purposes.
In the above table, the telephone lines of the Government are included in the
PBX and commercial categories. In the metropolitan area, there are 993 Gov-
ernmental subscribers, in the provincial capitals 269, and in the other locali-
ties 230. These figures include only the ministries and provincial services
of the Government (Governor) and not autonomous public services such as ICE or
social security.
2.09      With regard to the actual usage of telephones in the metropolitan
area, traffic originated by the PBXs (representing mostly large enterprises
and Government) accounts for 19%, commercial traffic for 33% (family and
moderate sized business, services and liberal professions) and residential
traffic 2/ for 48% of total traffic. In smaller towns the respective figures
are estimated at 17% for PBXs, 47% for commercial traffic and 36% for residen-
tial traffic. These figures represent the distribution of the traffic during
the busy hours.
2.10      The pattern of national long distance telephone traffic reflects
the dominance of the metropolitan area (San Jose and the nearby towns) as
the central commercial and administrative area servicing the economy of the
whole country. In small communities from 60% to 80% of the calls are directed
towards the metropolitan area. In the larger towns, this proportion of calls
is lower (in the 50% to 60% range).
Sector Problems
Quality of Telecommunications Service
2.11      ICE seems to have now attained a period of stable expansion.  Due
to the efficiency of the management, the quality of service in Costa Rica is
good, and the delay to obtain a telephone is presently reasonable compared
with other Latin-American countries (a maximum of 11 months is the target
to be achieved at the end of the proposed project). However, because of
2/   Part of this traffic corresponds actually to business transactions,
generated from small telephone users (see footnote Y below table
in para. 2.08).



- 6 -
the expected steady growth of the demand (11% on average from 1978 to 1981)
and of the long-distance traffic (14% on average) the quality of service would
deteriorate rapidly if the expansion of the network is allowed to lag behind
demand for any length of time -- examples exist, like the impO.tanL porL
Puntarenas, and the new district west of San Jose where no new telephone can
presently be connected. While the quality of service offered by the existing
rural public telephones is good, such service does not extend to all rural
communities, particularly in the small communities which are widely dispersed
and separated by the mountain ranges.
2.12      The service telex-gentex has been greatly improved with the in-
stallation in 1974 of an electronic exchange, serving initially 326 sub-
scribers. But, as has been the case with the telephone, the increase of
the demand had been underestimated, and the exchange which was expanded
in 1976 will be saturated during the first semester of 1978, with about 800
subscribers. The official waiting list for telex service is at present 60
due to a shortage of teleprinters and of available lines for connecting sub-
scribers. However, the potential demand is estimated to be much larger.
Ninety-seven percent of the telex traffic is international; the service is
good. Furthermore, the telex network will in the future be used to transmit
telegrams (see Annex 2.01). Expansion under the project should enable ICE to
largely meet the unfilled demand for telex.
Institutional Deficiencies
2.13      In the past ICE, RACSA and Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones worked
as separate entities and did not fully take advantage of possibilities of
sharing facilities and resources to reduce the costs. Similarly, the oper-
ational arrangements were not rationalized to secure least cost. Recently,
proposals have been approved and steps are being taken to remove these defi-
ciencies (see Annex 2.01).
Sector Constraints
2.14      Telecommunications services in Costa Rica are of reasonably good
quality but are insufficient and unequally distributed. The principal defi-
ciencies to be eliminated are the scarcity of telephone services outside of
the San Jose area, the long waiting list for telex, and the costly obsolete
telegraph system. Part of these problems have their origin in the too
conservative projections made by ICE during the past ten years. Another
reason for this insufficient development of telecommunications services
is the shortage of resources, which has not provided ICE with the financial
means to expand those activities which are not highly profitable (rural
telephones) or for which the demand was not clearly expressed (telex in its
initial phase). Even now, although ICE is in a position to raise long term
money for its operations, the spread of services to small communities without
service is still limited by financial constraints.
Sector Objectives
2.15      With Bank's assistance ICE has developed its telecommunications
operations from less than 10,000 lines, (mostly connected to manual exchanges)
in 1963, to 87,000 lines in 1976, 98% of which were connected to automatic



exchanges. ICE operates a modern long distance network which provides a good
quality subscriber dialing network covering nearly all automatic exchanges in
the country and which is progressively bringing telephone service to rural
areas. Besides this physical expansion, ICE has, with the Bank's help, estab-
lished a sound institutional and financial framework for future expansion and
operation.
2.16      Growth in demand is a futnction of economic development.  On this
basis the growth of the network should correspond to: an average annual
growth of 11% of additional telephone subscribers, 14% of long distance
traffic, 13.5% of international traffic, 17% of additional telex-gentex
subscribers per year. These growth rates are reasonable when compared with
similar countries. In addition, ICE would, among other objectives, continue
with measures to increase operational efficiency through improvements to the
quality of its staff and management.
2.17      As a consequence of the accent on rural development, and to reduce
the delay in providing services in these areas, ICE will decentralize part
of its maintenance and commercial activities during this plan, by creating
12 centers which will be able to promptly handle requests for providing tele-
phone connections and provide the basic material for undertaking repairs.
With the progressive extension of the telephone network to rural areas, the
existing telegraph offices will gradually be given access to the telephone
network (see Annex 2,01). In addition to its geographical and functional
expansion, ICE plans to adopt new techniques and offer new services, mostly
to be initiated during the present project (see paras. 5.05 to 5.08).
2.18      In next 10 to 15 years, ICE will extend its local services and high
quality long distance circuits using the latest available techniques, and will
concentrate on providing basic telecommunications facilities to rural areas in
the country, which are currently poorly served. ICE management will have to
carry heavier responsibilities, to function more effectively and to manage
efficiently a more complex network. ICE will have to formulate projects and
to review the need for telecommunications development on priorities designed
to meet the requirements of administering social services and improving
economic efficiency as well as meeting expected demand and traffic growth.
2.19      The sector objectives towards which the proposed project would con-
tribute are:
(a)  meet part of anticipated demands for local, long distance
and international services in San Jose and some 80 other
localities and maintain the present good quality of service;
(b)  increase penetration of telephone service in rural areas by
installing public call offices;
(c)  replace the existing archaic telegraph system and improve
the efficiency of operations of telegraph facilities by
use of telex and telephone facilities which are being
expanded;



- 8 -
(d)  introduce electronic switching and other modern technologies;
(e)  institution building -- further reinforce the capacity of ICE
to efficiently provide and operate the telecommunications net-
works to meet the needs of the society and economy and operate
on a sound financial basis: this will be achieved by ICE in
i) keeping the productivity at its present level (about 16 staff
per 1,000 telephones, which is extremely good for a developing
country); ii) decentralizing the operations out of San Jose,
thus improving local control and supervision; and iii) main-
taining ICE's financial soundness through improved financial
planning; and
(f)  expand and develop the training program, which is a prere-
quisite to creating small self-sufficient teams for basic
maintenance and for the rational use of new cost effective
technology (particularly for electronic switching and data
transmission systems).
The Bank's Role
2.20      The Bank's role in the expansion of telephone and telex facilities
through the four previous loans to ICE is set out in paragraphs 1.03 and
2.15. The Project Performance Audit Memorandum of the second project con-
cludes that this was a well-conceived project outstandingly carried out.
From past difficulties and from the assistance provided by the Bank for
revising the third project, ICE realized the importance of good project
planning. As a result, ICE with assistance from a consulting firm, has
developed its engineering and traffic forecasting on modern lines as part
of its aim to improve the quality of planning. The effort put in the prep-
aration of the present project (10 man-years of engineers, 3 man-years of
economists) and the level of detail taken into consideration mark a signifi-
cant improvement of the methods of planning for the physical content of the
project. However, the financial projections have not yet attained the same
degree of refinement, and the Bank should have a beneficial role in this
area during the execution of the project.
2.21      Another effect of the Bank assistance to ICE would be to achieve
a settlement of Government's bills. This has been a chronic problem, and
particular attention has been paid to it during the negotiations (see
para. 6.09); a solution has been worked out to eliminate this difficulty
and to prevent it from reappearing in the future.
2.22      The participation of the Bank will increase the chances of success
of the rural telephone development, both by its financing which directly
or indirectly will benefit all users of the telecommunication network and by
the emphasis it can put on the rural aspect of the project.

FIFTH TELECO1ZTUNICATIONS PROJECT
Internal Telegraph Service in Costa Rica
The national telegraph system is presently operated by the Govern-
ment. A subdivision, "Telegrafos y Radio Nacionales", part of the agency
"Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones", counting 1200 staff, maintains and oper-
ates 570 telegraph offices throughout the country. The equipment is old and
the service inefficient, as the traffic is low (from 10 to 20 telegrams per
day per office in rural areas). The necessity of keeping technical full time
staff for this service makes it a financial burden to the Government. While
keeping its overall responsbility, in a national move to reduce its costs,
Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones will in the future use more and more the
national telephone and telex network to transmit the telegrams. Accordingly,
the "Junta Nacional" plans to close down or arrange for ICE/RACSA to maintain
its present installations in each province. Most of the telegraph operators
being presently in charge of the mail in small communities are expected to
keep their position in the "Junta Nacional", while being relieved of their
technical responsibilities. The new proposals appear to present little risk
to ICE/RACSA as the financial arrangement provides for reimbursement by "Junta
Nacional" of the maintenance cost of its specific installations in addition
to paying the regular telephone and telex charges for the services it uses.
Furthermore, the additional investment and operational costs corresponding to
the service provided to "Junta Nacional" are negligible when compared to the
total telecommunication services in Costa Rica. The progressive use of ICE
and RACSA facilities for the public telegraph service will begin in 1978 and
is a rational move which should bring about major savings to the telegraph
service. But to ensure that this additional service will not be detrimental
to ICE, assurances have been obtained during negotiation that this service
will be charged to "Junta Nacional" so as to at least cover the corresponding
expenses incurred by ICE.

III. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
3.01      The proposed Borrower, ICE, is a government-owned autonomous in-
stitution responsible for telecommunications and electric power development.
Originally established in 1949 to plan and carry out a national electrifi-
cation program, ICE was authorized by a 1963 law to provide telecommunica-
tions services within the country. The law setting up ICE defines it as an
autonomous organization, authorized to carry out its activities independently
of the Government, except for approval of tariffs and bond issues which is
the responsibility, for both energy and telecommunications, of the Servicio
Nacional de Electricidad (SNE), the Costa Rica regulatory authority, and
reviewed by the Government. Except for an assessment designed to pay the
operating cost of SNE, ICE is exempt from all taxes.
3.02      ICE is administered by a seven-member Board of Directors, all
government-appointed for eight-year terms on a staggered basis, with the
exception of the Chairman of the Board whose four-year mandate corresponds
to the country's Presidential term of office. The present Board includes
two members of the opposition party. ICE's board membership has maintained
sufficient continuity; two Board members, one of whom is the Chairman of the
Board, have served since ICE's inception, and a third since 1954.
3.03      The Board appoints ICE's general manager, three deputy managers,
the treasurer and the internal auditors. The general manager appoints other
officials, subject to Board approval, for senior posts.
3.04      Prior to April 1973, seven sections reported to ICE's general man-
ager. Four of these related to electric operations, one to telecommunica-
tions, and two to accounting and administrative matters. In 1973, ICE took
a large step toward autonomy of its two operating sections by creating three
directorates headed by deputy managers: one each for power, telecommunica-
tions and administrative services. At the end of 1973, ICE's telecommunica-
tions directorate was divided into three divisions: engineering, which has
responsibility for economic studies and planning, including financial plan-
ning as well as system design and engineering; construction; and operations.
In February 1977, a fourth telecommunications division was set up to deal
with international telephone services. In addition, the administration and
finance directorate was divided in June 1977 into three divisions, administra-
tion, finance, and personnel (see Annex 3.01). This organization appears
adequate for ICE's present needs.
3.05      In addition to his responsibility inside ICE, the deputy manager
of the Telecommunication directorate of ICE is directly in charge of RACSA
(para. 2.03), and responsible for coordinating the complementary activities
of the two companies.



- 12 -
3.06      ICE's senior engineering and financial staff is generally competent
and has satisfactory experience in proper management. The middle and junior
personnel are qualified and closely supervised. A comprehensive training
program (see para. 3.13) helps existing staff to mas-er the rapidly evolving
telecommunicaion techniques and trains the new staff for the expansion of the
network.
3.07      In comparison with the well organized engineering planning, the
financial planning of the telecommunications directorate requires improve-
ment; this is caused by insufficient coordination between the financial
planning and the accounting units of ICE. Given the good quality of its
staff, ICE should be able to correct this deficiency itself; Bank's advice
during the execution of the proposed project would, however, be helpful in
this respect.
3.08      Because of the extreme centralization in the administration of the
country and of its economic activities in San Jose, much of the telecommuni-
cations development has been in the metropolitan area. This was to some
measure caused by ICE's concentrating on meeting the requirements in San Jose
where the demand and profits were greatest, particularly in the absence of
Government directives in the past to extend services to all parts of the
country. All management, maintenance and installation teams are now central-
ized in San Jose. Although the pattern is now changing, this centralization,
in turn, has led to inadequate emphasis on development in the provinces.
This bias against provincial and rural development has also been partly
due to a somewhat difficult geographical terrain and to inadequate funds.
Current Government policy emphasizes telecommunication development over the
whole country (see para. 7.02).
Accounts and Audit
3.09      In the appraisal report of Loan 1006-CR (May 1974), concern was
expressed about ICE's method of allocating administrative costs between the
energy and telecommunications services and further between operations and
construction of the two services. ICE agreed to employ consultants to review
the allocation of administrative costs and implement such recommendations
in time and manner satisfactory to the Bank. The findings of a first study
carried out by Peat, Marwick and Mitchell in June 1974 could not be imple-
mented by ICE because they would be too elaborate and costly to operate. A
second study was therefore made and completed in December 1975 and proposed
coefficients derived from a limited sampling of cost allocations. Cost
allocation coefficients for Fiscal Year 1978 are now based on a survey of
administrative employees taken in November 1977 showing time spent on power
and telecommunication matters and further, on operation and construction in
connection with power and telecommunications matters. Although this method
is considered satisfactory in principle, a longer sampling period than one
month should be used in order to obtain more accurate information. The
Borrower will therefore, by April 30, 1978, propose to the Bank for its
approval a sampling method to be adopted in fulfillment of the requirement of
Section 5.08(b). It has been agreed that, beginning fiscal year 1978, and at



- 13 -
least annually thereafter, ICE will allocate administrative costs between the
Power and Telecommunication Directorates, and further between construction and
operations in each Directorate, using methods of allocation satisfactory to
the Bank.
3.10      External auditing is performed satisfactorily by the local auditing
firm of Venegas, Alvarez and Company, who are affiliated with Seidman &
Seidman, a US firm of accountants. Internal audit functions are performed by
an internal audit group, the head of which reports to the Board of Directors.
Tariffs
3.11      The present tariffs, as of March 1976, are summarized in Annex
3.05. They include the recent changes presented in paragraph 6.02. Telephone
tariffs in Costa Rica are on the low side compared with the USA but are higher
than the tariffs in some other Central American countries such as Guatemala
and El Salvador. Representative monthly tariffs are at present $4.65 residen-
tial and $8.15 business, both with 100 free pulses. The revenue per line
amounted to $340/line/year in 1976 (as compared with $300 forecast during the
appraisal of the previous project) -- this is higher than in most developing
and developed countries.
Staff and Training
Staff
3.12      ICE's telecommunications staff at the end of 1976 was about 2,700,
46% for operations, 23% for construction and the other 31% for administra-
tive and institutional purposes. Both operations and administrative manpower
decreased in 1976 and a strict recruitment policy has succeeded in keeping
the ratio of the number of staff in operations to a low 16 per thousand tele-
phones. During the project period, ICE is expected to recruit about 850
additional staff for operations and another 300 for administrative support.
At the end of the project, when ICE would operate about 230,000 telephones,
the ratio of number of staff in operations 1/ per thousand telephones would
drop to about 14.4; this is one of ICE's key objectives and would be con-
sidered as very satisfactory. Annex 3.02 gives details of the number of
employees in each department for the years 1976 to 1982. The salaries are
slightly higher than those paid for similar types of work by other adminis-
trations in Costa Rica. Employment with ICE is made still more attractive
by a liberal policy of fringe benefits. Turnover of staff is reported to be
negligible.
1/   This includes all staff of the operations and construction divisions,
but not the administrative staff and the staff in the institutional
section. If they were to be included, the number of staff per thousand
telephones would be increased by one fourth.

Training
3.13      A specialized department, located in San Jose, and staffed with
38 persons (11 for telecommunications), covers ICE's in~bo¢   trai--   '
department has three sections offering courses in administration, electric
power and telecommunications, respectively. Training programs cover all
aspects of ICE's activity, and provide courses at all levels for new staff
as well as for internally promoted employees. Some of the courses are
given in ICE's offices outside of San Jose when the number of trainees
justifies it. The training program for telecommunications is reasonably
comprehensive, and in 1976 it offered 24 different courses for 380 partici-
pants (nearly 20% of the manpower of ICE-Telecommunications). This program
is specially designed to complement courses offered by the other technical
schools in Costa Rica; in cooperation with ICE, the University of Costa Rica
has recently created a "Licenciatura en Telecomunicaciones", adding one year
of specialization after the common electrical engineering curriculum. The
Bank helped the training program by financing training equipment and foreign
instructors; the proposed Bank project would further stimulate training
expansion by providing additional training equipment. In addition to this
in-house training facility, ICE uses to a large extent training provided by
foreign suppliers. ICE organizes seminars (14 on telecommunications topics
in 1976) often jointly with the other Central American countries, and also
offers scholarships (21 in 1976) to study abroad.
Existing Telecommunications Facilities
3.14      The existing exchange and long distance network in Costa Rica is
shown in Map No. IBRD-13121R. Basic network data are set out in Annexes 3.03
and 3.04. A brief description of ICE's facilities as of December 31, 1976
is given below.
3.15      Local Services:  Local services are provided via 50 local exchanges
-- of which 11 were manual or semi-automatic exchanges -- with a total capac-
ity of 111,400 lines; connected direct exchange lines amounted to 87,183, 98%
connected to automatic exchanges. The unfilled expressed demand for telephones
is about 7,000.
3.16      Long Distance Services:  Long distance services are provided by
microwave radio, coaxial cables, VHF/UHF radio and PCM and FDM carrier on
cables. Facilities for subscriber dialing of long distance calls are avail-
able to nearly all subscribers on the automatic exchange network; for the
others, long distance service is provided on semi-automatic, or fully
manual basis.
3.17      Telex and Telegraph Facilities:  San Jose is connected by telex/
gentex to 20 traffic centers using voice frequency telegraph. A telex ex-
change operated by RACSA, serving 516 telex and 34 gentex subscribers as of
mid 1977, is installed in San Jose. Independently, Junta Nacional de Comuni-
caciones operates a telegraph network with 570 offices (see Annex 2.01).



- 15 -
3.18      International Facilities:  Costa Rica has good international tele-
communications facilities to countries in Central America, USA and Europe.
Costa Rica is connected through a high capacity microwave system which pro-
vides 108 trunks to the other countries of Central America. This Central
American network is connected to other international circuits and provides
Costa Rica with extension links to Mexico and the US through Guatemala (53
circuits); similarly, it provides Costa Rica with extension to US, Venezuela
and Spain through the earth satellite station in Nicaragua (17 circuits) and
to the US, Spain and Colombia through a satellite station located in Panama (6
circuits). Costa Rica plans to install its own satellite station in 1980 or
alternatively (see para. 5.02) a submarine cable to the US to take over all
the present international circuits transmitting through Panama and Nicaragua,
and provide for further expansion. International direct dialing is avail-
able to the Central American countries, the US, and Europe. Toll ticketing
equipment is installed in San Jose to record international calls.

4.01      Demand for expansion of the network as a whole exists.  The present
unsatisfied demand as shown in the waiting list is 6,904, ha'lf of which are
in San Jose.  But this waiting list does not represent the total unsatisfied
demand I/ which is conservatively estimated at 10,000, or 9% of working lines.
Although a potential subscriber must register on an official waiting list to
acquire a telephone, waiting lists are maintained only in areas served by a
telephone exchange, or where one will be installed soon. The unsatisfied
demand in large urban areas is thus reasonably well known, except perhaps for
the newly developed districts. But in small localities, and particularly in
rural areas, in which waiting lists are maintained only when telephone ser-
vice already exists, the uncertainty is much larger. Total demand is in-
creasing by some 11% per annut  and will by 1981 amount to about 170,000 as
shown by historical tendency where waiting lists are maintained and inquiries
elsewhere.  Unmet deaand over the project period is therefore likely to in-
crease to about 15,000. 2/
4.02      More than one-third of the population of Costa Rica has no access
to telephone facilities. When rural telephone service is provided, many of
these people will start using this public facility and later move up to
applying for extension of the telephone facilities to their home and busi-
ness. It is likely that the nearer the public telephone servi'ce will be
brought to the yet unserviced population, the higher the demand for individual
telephones will be among them.
4.03      In addition, there is a demand for service by smal' enterprises
(for instance, mining and forest exploitation.) which are located in isolated
places. This service will also be invaluable for the tourist industry and
large farming development, which tend to appear outside the urban areas and
represent operations that presuppose basic infrastructure facilities which
include the provision of basic telephone services. The demand is estimated
at about 1,200 and will be met by the 1,200 radio telephones -- served by
1/   Total demand i_c^des the existing connected subscribers and the unsat-
isfied demand com^.sing the applicants registered on waiting lists
and the persons 7Zao would apply for a telephone if ICE tfas able to
provide it in the foreseeable future.
2/   Unmet demand at a given date in the future is estimated by subtracting
the number of telephone lines which are planned to be in operation at
that date from the total demand estimated by historical tendency or
inquiries. With its present physical and economical resources, ICE
could hardly undertake a program larger than the one proposed without
endangering i'ts financial viability and the normal progress of the
implementation of the project. Therefore, the existence of a reason-
able unmet demand after the completion of the program is considered as
acceptable.

operators -- which will be installed during the project all over the country;
these systems will meet essential needs until such time as the areas concerned
can be given full exchange facilities.
4.04      The long distance traffic increases per year have for the last
three years oscillated between 12% and 14%. Since the present project adds
a significant percentage of provincial subscribers, the projections of an
average increase of 14% per year during the execution of the project, which
has been used to dimension the long distance network, appears to be reason-
able. This higher traffic will largely be met through provision of circuits
by addition of multiplex equipment to existing radio routes and only a few new
long distance routes will be added (six only, of which four by microwave and 2
by PCM on existing cables).
4.05      Actual demand for telex-gentex has greatly exceeded ICE's and
RACSA's projections over the past few years. The historical rate of in-
crease of subscribers had been 20% in previous years although only 15% during
the past year due to the lack of equipment and the necessary links to the
network. The official waiting list for connections stands at 60, 90% of it
in San Jose, but this is of little value as a large number of potential
applicants are not recorded -- ICE/RACSA have been rather discouraging the
demands. ICE plans a 17% yearly increase of telex/gentex subscribers until
the end of the project.
4.06      The expansion of international traffic has been forecast at a 15%
of increase during years 1977 to 1979 and 12% thereafter. As the traffic
increase in 1976 was 17.8%, and averaged 20% during the previous years, the
forecast seems reasonable.

V. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
5.01      ICE's five-year (1978-82) telecommunications development program,
estimated to cost in the order of US$163 million, consists of:
(a)  completion of ongoing projects which will involve total
expenditures estimated at US$34 million;
(b)  the proposed project (US$94 million);
(c)  advance expenditures (US$28 million) for buildings and
down payments on equipment to provide for further expan-
sion from 1982 onwards (justified by the projected unmet
demand at the end of the proposed project, see para. 4.01);
and
(d) interest during construct4on (US$7 million).
The Project
5.02      ICE had, in 1973, developed a telecommunications expansion program
for 1974-1980 called Stage IV, the first part of which, called Stage IVa, was
financed by the fourth loan of the Bank. In 1977, ICE decided to remodel the
second part of the original project (Stage IVb) and expand it to the year
1981; ICE renamed it Stage V.  The proposed project consists of ICE's Stage V
expansion works comprising:
(a)  an increase in exchange line capacity of about 654100 lines
(of which about 13,000 will provide service in small
localities, most of them of less than 2,000 inhabitants).
These facilities will permit connection of some 54,500
additional DELs;
(b)  expansion of long distance facilities by microwave, PCM and
carrier cable systems and additional multiplex equipment to
provide 1,600 long distance circuits in the national network,
of which 200 will be on new routes;
(c)  installation of three new long distance exchanges and ex-
pansion of the existing ones 1/ to provide 1,900 new ter-
minations to accommodate the additional toll circuits;
(d)  expansion of the rural telephone system to 500 new rural
communities (public call office service) and 1,200 rural
productive centers (radio systems served by an operator),
together with the corresponding cable and radio links to
connect them to the national network;
1/   Including the equipment of the urban tandem offices in San Jose which
carry also long distance traffic.



- 25 -
(e) provision of public mobile telephone services to cover
the country as a whole and connect 300 additional mobile
stations;
(f) expansion of the telex exchange, to cater for 450 new telex
subscribers, and replacement of the old telegraph network
by a combined telephone-gentex message service;
(g) installation of an earth station, providing additional cir-
cuits for international traffic or alternatively a submarine
cable 1/; and
(h)  improvement and expansion of the training facilities to meet
the additional needs of the planned decentralization and to
provide for the growth of the network and the introduction of
new techniques.
5.03      Quantitatively, the number of localities in rural districts in
Costa Rica served by public call offices will increase from 500 at the end
of 1978 to over 1,000 at the end of the project. During this period, the
capacity of the exchanges installed in rural areas will grow from 5,600 to
14,900. Through this expansion the rural population having access to tele-
phone service will grow from about 600,000 to over 900,000.

TOTAL                      275             625         1,003
In the whole of Costa Rica, the number of subscribers with individual con-
nections will increase from 100,300 to 154,800 during the execution of the
project, distributed as follows:
I/   ICE has completed this study and has given a copy of the report to the
Bank. The formal decision will be taken by ICE and RACSA but requires
parliament approval. The Bank will be able to comment on the choice. In
any case the international telecommunication traffic of Costa Rica justi-
fies the installation of its own facility from the economic point of view.

Project Objectives
5.04      As set out in Chapter IV, the main objective of t-  proposed
project is to meet part of the present and projected demand f-or telecommuni-
cation services irn rural as well as in urban areas.  As ex<lained in Chapter
VII, this is a necessary component of the national plan of development
adopted by the Government of Costa Rica,
5.05      In addition to above, ICE intends to modernize its network during
the present program. The first step in this directioon is to introduce new
large exchanges of the electronic or semi-electronic type (see Annex 5.02).
After having discussed with the telephone administrations of Guatemala and
Panama, which have ordered SPC exchanges, and with the suppliers, ICE deter-
mined that for the large exchanges this type of equipment would be competi-
tive with the crossbar technique, and would allow ICE to economically offer
on a large scale new services in the future (first keyboard telephones and
centrex services), which appear profitable. Furthermore, since SPC systems
require less space for the same capacity, a serious problem of buildings will
be avoided in San Jose, Discussions with the suppliers has led to a pre-
selection of five of them, and tenders shall be called at the beginning of
1978.
5.06      In parallel with the modernization of its network, ICE intends to
develop new types of services -- the first one, mobile telephones, is under
experiment on some of the vehicles of ICE connected to a master station in
San Pedro. The public mobile service will be offered publicly in July 1978
and the first installation with a capacity of 150 subscribers is expected
to be fully subscribed.  The project provides for 50 new subscribers per
year for this service which interests mostly public services and agricultural
and civil work enterprises.
5.07      To expand its international links, ICE is planning also the in-
stallation of a modern satellite station or as an alternative a submarine
cable to the US, if this latter solution appears more attractive; a study
comparing both solutions has been completed and communicated to the Bank
1/   In Costa Rica, the number of telephones is approximately 1.5 times the
number ofr DELs.
2/   The metropolitan area of San Jose includes the town of San Jose itself
and the nearby towns up to a distance of 20 kilometers. The increase of
telephone equipment in this area will benefit primarily the small towns
around San Jose where the amount of exchange equipment will be doubled
during the project while in the town of San Jose itself the increase will
be only 38%.

(see footnote para. 5.02). ICE is prepared to call for bids in 1978, and have
the equipment in operation in 1980.
5.08      To prepare for the longer term needs of the Government, the banks
and other large enterprises, ICE is studying the realization of a basic data
network.  A first step of this project is the training of ICE's staff by
foreign specialists, in assessing the needs and designing the network. ICE
expects to have an experimental working system at the end of the project.
Project Cost
5.09      The project's cost is estimated at US$94.1 million including a
foreign exchange expenditure of US$53.3 million. The proposed Bank loan of
US$10.6 million would finance part of the foreign costs of the project.

5.11      The project costs reflect estimated December 1976 prices, based
on ICE's experience with recent contracts relating to ongoing works, with
adjustments to bring them up to date to the end of 1977. The project esti-
mates are reasonable. ICE is exempt from payment of customs duties on
imported goods.
Contingencies
5.12      Price contingencies for project costs amount to 22% of the base
and physical costs (distributed as 29% of local and 17% of foreign expendi-
tures). They result from the year by year estimated local cost increase 1/
of 12% from 1978 to 1982; and year by year estimated foreign cost increases
of 1978 through 1982 - 8% annually. The foreign cost increases are applied
as of the date of the contract since in this sector such contracts are made
on a fixed price basis. The annual percentage cost increases are those used
by ICE for its projections, and are based on its past experience, and dis-
cussions with the prospective suppliers; they reflect a weighted average
made between the quantities of different types of equipment included in the
project.
5.13      Provision of local and long distance exchange lines, telephones,
microwave radio equipment and multiplex terminal channels proposed to be
procured and installed under the project are based on detailed forecasts
and detailed engineering. In view of this, the quantities are not expected
to change significantly, with perhaps one exception, which concerns the
external plant for urban as well as rural areas. In this domain the use
of broad quantities based on ratios derived from past experience gives only
estimates of the equipment needed to service subscribers. Therefore, physical
contingencies of about 10% have been applied to local and foreign costs of
external plant, amounting to US$0.9 million of local currency and US$1.4
million of foreign currency.
Items for Bank Financing
5.14      The items to be financed out of the proceeds of the US$10.6 million
proposed Bank loan are as follows:
1/   The local cost increase of 12% per year shown here is higher than the
average cost increase expected in Costa Rica for the next few years.
However, it is based on ICE's experience during the past two years, and
explained by the rapid increase in salaries for specialized technician
and engineers in the telecommunicaion field. These salaries represent
a large percentage of the local cost of the construction project.

Bank financing will only cover 20% of the foreign cost of the project. It
would be associated with an IDB loan of US$12.2 million and with various
export and suppliers' credit (US$28.7 million). ICE would finance the local
costs (US$46 million) and a limited amount of foreign costs (US$2.8 million).
IDB's appraisal mission of a rural component of the project has been completed
and the IDB loan approved. Negotiations are being conducted with export
credit institutions of supplier nations and firm offers have been received
which constitute a satisfactory financing for all items not covered by the
Bank and IDB loan.

Ii  All local costs are met by ICE.
Note: The above table is a condensed presentation of table from paragraph
5.10 to which has been added the sources of financing for equipment.
Procurement
5.15      All goods to be obtained under the project by Bank financing would
be procured through international competitive bids in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines: Up to US$3.4 million of goods to be financed from the Bank
loan, principally cables and accessories, poles and PVC ducts, are likely
to be offered in ICB by manufacturers in the Central American Common Market,
including Costa Rica 2/. Costa Rica is a member of the Central American Common
2/   While manufacturers in Costa Rica may bid through ICB for goods up to
$3.4 million, principally cables and accessories, it is quite uncertain
as to the extent Costa Rican suppliers will be successful in being
awarded the contract. Because the chances are not considered significant,
the whole of $3.4 million has been shown as foreign costs in the above
table.

countries. Suppliers from Central American countries would be allowed a
preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or 50 percent
of the import duties, whichever is lower.
5.16      In respect of other items not financed by the Bank, ICE would
obtain:
(a) the new electronic exchanges through limited international
competitive bidding from firms which have been pre-qualified
by ICE based on the suitability of equipment to meet its
needs, and availability of export credit on terms agreed to
with ICE;
(b) procurement of additional quantities in respect of items
awarded after international competition by extension of
existing contracts;
(c) extensions to existing equipment through negotiations
with suppliers of the original equipment for reasons of
standardization and efficiency; and
(d) small miscellaneous items available on the local market
through local bidding, advertised locally.
Project Implementation
5.17      The proposed schedule for the execution of the project is set out
in Annex 5.02, and is considered realistic. ICE's staff has begun work on
engineering designs and preparation of bid documents. ICE has the capability
to carry out evaluations of the offers. Most of the civil works will be
contracted to local firms for execution. ICE will install all extensions to
existing equipment and request support from the supplier only for installation
of new type of equipment, mainly electronic exchanges and the possible earth
satellite station. ICE would carry out the acceptance testing of all installed
equipment. ICE's management is sufficiently experienced and is capable of
managing the above work satisfactorily. The project is expected to be com-
pleted by December 31, 1981, with a slight uncertainty about two components:
the program of installation of the electronic exchanges has many elements
which FCE will be facing for the first time and the supplier has also to adapt
his software to the local conditions with the result that the installations
could take longer than scheduled; and the rural telephone expansion which
requires scattered installations over a wide area and could also be somewhat
delayed.
Disbursements
5.18      Estimate of loan disbursements is set out in Annex 5.03.  Disburse-
ments would be made for 100% of foreign expenditures on goods including the
foreign exchange component of installation costs, and for 95% of the ex-factory
costs on any locally awarded contract for goods specified under the loan. The



- 32 -
latter would be mainly for the Bank-financed part of external plant for the
local network. The amount earmarked from the proposed Bank loan is US$6.8
million, of which suppliers from the Central American countries are expected
to bid for contracts which may amount to about US$3.4 million (see footnote
para. 5.15). The closing date of the loan would be June 30 1982.
Risk
5.19      The project offers limited risk, the principal one being the pos-
sibility of delay in a few works due to unforeseen circumstances. In tele-
communications projects, which comprise a large number of works, delay in
the completion of a few works does not generally prevent the use of other
newly created assets.

6.02      The Government and ICE agreed to a tariff increase in October 1974.
However, because of the opposition from the Central Bank to asset revaluation,
this was not approved by the Economic Council until January 1975; the cost of
the basic impulse was then increased from ¢0.10 to ¢0.13; a reduction of the
duration of the basic impulse from five to three minutes was also sought but,
because of the Government anti-inflationary policy, this was not granted
until August 15, 1975; inflation in Costa Rica was about 31% in 1974 and 18%
in 1975.  A third tariff increase was granted in March 1976; this raised the
cost of the basic impulse for local calls (varying according to the area of
the country) to an average of 0O.196. Demand decreased after the 1975
tariff increase largely because of depressed general economic activity; how-
ever it rebounded again in 1976.

6.03      During 1975 and 1976, ICE installed about 11,000 direct exchange
lines in each year. With the additional lines and increased tariffs, total
operating revenues (¢266 million) in 1976 were more than double the 1974
figures. The 1975 tariff increase did not permit ICE to achieve in that year
a rate of return of 12% as stipulated in the Loan Agreement 1006-CR, but only
in 1976 when the rate of return was 17.7%.

ICE's requirements during the three-year period 1974-76 was ¢95 million or
20% above the appraisal forecast; this was due to higher working capital
needs, partly to cover increases in advance payments for plant and materials
due to inflation. Fixed investment was some 8% lower than forecast. The
failure to attain the income targets in 1974 and 1975 resulted in lower than
expected internal cash generation which was down ¢60 million or 36%; miscel-
laneous income was up 033 million. ICE covered the gap with additional
borrowings.

ICE's financial position was satisfactory. Debt/equity ratio was 60/40,
current ratio 1.9; liquidity was adequate.
Asset Revaluation
6.06      During the 1973-75 period, the Costa Rican economy suffered severe
problems originating from inflation. In 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976, the
internal price level increased by 16%, 31%, 18% and 4% respectively 1/. In
addition, although there was no devaluation of the Costa Rica colon with
respect to the dollar ICE was affected by several devaluations, explicit or
not, of the dollar in 1975 and 1976, in relation to other international
currencies, which resulted in a considerable increase (20% in 1975) in its
debt service obligations.
6.07      The Loan Agreement of Loan 1006-CR required ICE to revalue its
assets before October 1, 1974. However, because of the opposition from the
Central Bank, which was later overcome, revaluation was performed for the
first time in 1975 and incorporated in the 1974 balance sheet. The revalu-
ation, using appropriate indices for local and foreign components, resulted
in an increase of about one-third of ICE's assets as of December 1974. A
second revaluation of about 10% was incorporated in the 1975 accounts.
However, because of the low inflation rate, and after consultation with the
Bank, ICE's assets were not revalued in 1976. Revaluation will be carried
out as of the end of 1977, and annually thereafter. The proposed Loan Agree-
ment repeats the provision of Loan 1006-CR for annual revaluation of ICE's
assets.
6.08      The long-term debt to IBRD, CABEI and IDB is readjusted at the
end of each year for the exchange rate variations of the currencies of the
loans. The adjustment is not considered as a charge (or profit) and incor-
porated into the income statement, but registered in a temporary balance
account as deferred exchange rate difference, which is distributed along
with the revaluation on property, plant and equipment to be made in the
next year, thus amounting to a deferred allocation of the revaluation
differences to the corresponding assets.

cost of living index.

Receivables
6.09      ICE's receivables position for private subscribers is good; however,
it has been recently deteriorating in the case of Government accounts. On
June 30, 1977, the total receivables amounted to 027.5 million; unpaid Govern-
ment bills, included in this figure, amounted to 0l2 million, or 17 months'
Government billings. Private receivables remain at the very satisfactory
level of three weeks' billings. Under Loan 1006-CR, the Government agreed to
settle its outstanding arrears by November 1976, and all its future accounts
within four months after the date of billing. The Government has failed to
meet this obligation, but has however begun to take measures to resolve this
matter within the 1978 budget in which, for the first time, funds are specifi-
cally appropriated to pay current ICE's telecommunications bills. It has
agreed to pay all bills after the date of the Loan Areement within 90 days of
the billing date (Section 3.03(a) of the proposed Guarantee Agreement). It
has also budgeted for 1978 the payment of about US$0.4 million to pay past-due
bills. In order to completely clear up outstanding bills the Government has
agreed, as a condition of effectiveness, to budget sufficient funds to pay 65%
of outstanding telecommunications debts as of the date of the Loan Agreement.
These bills will be paid prior to December 31, 1978, and the remaining 35%
will be budgeted in 1979 and paid prior to June 30, 1979.

6.11      For the 1978-82 period, the internal cash generation, net of debt
service, is expected to contribute 58% of the total requirements. The Bank's
contribution will be made in the form of the proposed Bank loan, US$10.6 mil-
lion, assumed to have a term of 17 years including a four-year grace period
and carrying a 7.45% interest plus the usual commitment fee, and US$7e6
million balance from Loan 1006-CR. The rest of the borrowing will come from
a US$12.2 million IDB loan from special funds (2% for 30 years including
an eight-year grace period); from CABEI (US$1.9 million, 9.25%, nine years
including a three-year grace period); and from suppliers' credit (US$34.0
million).
6.12      Each year the Central Bank fixes the total maximum amount of bonds
which can be issued by Government enterprises and public corporations, in-
cluding the maximum bond issue by ICE and the related interest rate. Given
ICE's excellent credit rating, its bonds are absorbed without difficulty
on the local market. ICE bonds, which have a maturity of 20 years and carry
12% interest if the bearer holds them more than 36 months and 8% otherwise,
are negotiated at par value while Government bonds are traded between 60% and
70% of par. To increase the attractiveness of its bonds to local investors,
ICE has entered into repurchase agreement obligating it to redeem them after
30 day's notice. While ICE has had no redemption problems in the past, in
order to reduce its exposure to unpredictable demands in the future, the
proposed Loan Agreement repeats the provision of Loan 1006-CR limiting the
principal amount of bonds outstanding under repurchase agreements to no more
than 30% of the total outstanding bonds. ICE has complied with this covenant,
as at the beginning of 1978 the percentage was 12%. Commercial loans are
negotiated with the authorization of the Central Bank. For long-term loans,
the rate obtained by ICE is from 1-1/4% to 1.3/4% over the London interbank
rate.
6.13      Projected financial statements for i977-82 and comments are given
in Annexes 6.01 to 6.04. A summary is given below:

6.14      Because of the heavy investment program, and the lag between
investment and full utilization of facilities, ICE's financial rate of
return is expected to decline from a high 17.7% in 1977 to slightly below
12% in 1981 and 1982. It was agreed with ICE to repeat in the proposed
Loan Agreement the covenant of loan 1006-CR, which requires ICE to earn a
rate of return of not less than 12% on revalued net fixed assets. On the
basis of the present forecast, it is possible that a moderate tariff increase
may be needed in 1981 or 1982 to reach this target.
6.15      The projected 1977-82 balance sheets (see Annex 6.03) indicate that
ICE's financial position will remain sound. Cash position may be tight during
the period of the program, however, this would present no problem since ICE
has adequate overdraft facilities. From 1977 to 1982, the debt/equity ratio
will decrease from 54/46 to 31/69.
6.16      Debt service coverage by internal cash generation will increase
from 1.9 to 2,9 betwen 1977 and 1982. As under Loan 1006-CR, MCE agreed that
NTS will not incur any long-term debt without the Bank's prior approval,
unless the preceding 12 months' internal cash generation would cover maximum
future debt service by at least 1.5 times.
6.17      Indicators which will help monitor ICE's perfor-mance are given in
Annex 6.05.  ICE will calculate them annually and submit them to the Bank
for review.
Insurance
6.18      ICE has an insurance coverage for year 1976 of 9I79 million against
fire, strikes, civil war, earthquake, etc., in the Instittao Nacional de
Seguros de Costa Rica; this figure is to be compared with a value of plant in
operation of e554 million before depreciation. The assets covered are the
main switching and long distance transmission plant in addition to buildings.
Due to the geographical dispersion of the equipment, and the large number of
independent items that constitute the network, it is acceptable that only
the largest of these be insured; the risks being spread out in respect of
other assets present only a relatively small liability in the event of damage
and loss.
National Electric System
6.19      Earnings and financial position of ICE's electricity operations con-
tinue to be satisfactory. ICE's 1976 energy sales were practically the same
as the appraisal forecasts of Loan 1126-CR. During 1976 iCE was granted a
2.6% monthly increase in its tariffs which enabled it to earn a rate of
return of 11.4% on average revalued fixed assets, compared to 9% as required



- 45 -
in the loan agreement. A further 6% tariff adjustment was granted in 1977
which brought the average 1977 tariff to a level about 150% higher than those
of 1974 and would raise NES' rate of return to about 13% in 1977 (see details
in Annex 6.06). The tariff increases in 1976 and 1977 should be sufficient to
permit ICE to earn a rate of return of 11.6% in 1978. ICE has estimated that
a further tariff adjustment of about 18% will be needed in 1979 in order to
earn the covenanted 9% return in that year.
6.20      As shown in Annex 6.07, ICE was able to self-finance 19%  of its
electricity construction program in 1976 and about 17% in 1977 (as compared
with 12% and 19% respectively estimated during Loan 1126-CR appraisal). Al-
though this self-financing is low by comparison with other utilities, it is
reasonable since ICE's 1975-79 electricity construction program is very large.
6.21      ICE's revised construction program for 1976-79 includes several
projects which have been added since appraisal of Loan 1126-CR. The most
important of these are a rural electrification program for which IDB has made
a US$13.5 million loan, an interconnection with Nicaragua to be partly financed
from a pending US$8 million loan from CABEI and geothermal studies being
financed from a US$4.1 million grant/loan from IDB.
6.22      To provide the remainder of the financing for these projects in 1977
as well as to cover higher than expected local costs for the Arenal project,
ICE has requested Bank authorization to issue 020 million local bonds (in
addition to 40 million authorized in September 1976) as well as to borrow US$5
million from commercial banks (in addition to US$15 million previously author-
ized). The bonds would be for a term of 20 years and would have an annual
interest rate of 12%. Terms of the commercial bank loan are expected to be
seven years including two years of grace and annual interest rate of 1-3/4%
above LIBOR.

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
A.   Income Statements
1.        The projection of the income for the years 1977 to 1982 inclusive
has been made while considering that the tariffs will be kept constant at the
present level.
2.        Installation charges have been calculated by weighing each type of
connection fee (varying from 0400 for multiparty lines in rural communities
to ¢2,000 for public telephones installed on private premises) by the per-
centage of customers having this service; and multiplying this average by
the number of new subscribers to be connected during this year; to this
amount has to be added connection fees for the mobile telephone service
(t20,O0O presently). The average of the subscription fee is about 01,200
per subscriber.
3.        Rental projections are based on existing tariffs and include a
number of free calls, both of them varying with the type of subscription
and the locality of the subscriber. The weighted average is 048 per month
for the subscription, with the present tariffs.
4.        Metered traffic includes all automatic local and long distance
calls. The revenues have been calculated again by weighing the different
tariffs by the weighted percentage of traffic from each tariff group--this
gives an average of ¢0.196 per pulse.
5.        International revenues have been projected with an increase of 15%
for years 1977 to 1979 and 12% for years 1980 and 1981 corresponding to the
increase in traffic during this period. This assumption is based on a 17%
historical increase of traffic in 1976, after an average increase of 20%
during the previous years.
6.        Various revenues include fines, transfer of subscription, services
through special numbers, installation of additional bells, and telephone books.
These revenues have been projected with an average slightly increasing over
the years corresponding to the expansion of the network.

ANNEX 6.01
Page 5 of 5
7.        The telex/gentex revenues are expected to increase proportionally
to the high rate of expansion of the network over the next years, as the
service is rapidly developing, but the international telegraph is expected
to slowly decrease.
8.        Personnel-related costs are expected to increase in proportion to
the total number of staff and are also indexed at 8% yearly to be consistent
with revaluation estimates.
9.        Materials are taken as 9.21% of the variable costs, indexed at 8%
yearly.
10.       Regulatory expenses are taken as 1.3% of the operating income for
national telephone services.
11.       Institutional costs are projected for 1978 and 1979 at a compounded
2.5% yearly rate for the average expenditure per customer and from 1980 to
1982 at a 5% yearly rate.

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
Balance Sheet
1.        Fixed assets are based on ICE's construction program.  They have
been revalued at a composite rate of 7.22% yearly over the project period.
2.        Plant under construction has been transferred to plant in servi--
at the end of the construction period separately for each component of the
project according to a detailed timetable. Goods in transit have been treated
as plant under construction.
3.        Private receivables for services rendered are expected to equal
about six weeks' billing for private customers.
4.        Government account is expected to increase for 1977 in proportion
to its 1976 increase. Thereafter, it is kept equal to two months' of billing.
5.        Maintenance equipment inventories are expected to increase in
proportion to total fixed assets.
6.        Other liabilities will increase in proportion to personnel expendi-
tures.
7.        Long-term debt is described in Annex 6.04.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
7.01      The objectives of the telecommunications program are closely linked
to the objectives of the National Development Plan for 1978-1982. The pro-
posed telecommunications program is designed to help achieve the four general
objectives of the National Plan: fostering continuous economic development
in all regions; helping small enterprises particularly in the provinces;
improving the efficiency of government administration; and controlling public
and para-public expenses.
7.02      To assist in attaining the National Development Plan objectives,
increased communication facilities will be required particularly to permit
easy and rapid exchange of information among the various groups and agencies
engaged in the industrial, agricultural, and commeercial activities distri-
buted throughout the country, and between them and government. Since govern-
ment administration will continue to be centralized in San Jose, the special
need for the increased communication between San Jose and the sometimes
mountainous provincial and rural areas can in many instances be met more
efficiently through telecommunications rather than by resorting to physical
travel or other more costly means of communication. Given this, government
has directed ICE to provide increased links to the rural areas and provincial
towns.
Distribution of Benefits
7.03      The distribution of benefits for ICE's five-year (1978-82) telecom-
munications investment program is spread over the entire economy and will
reach all income groups. The rural component of the program is designed to
significantly increase the penetration of telephone service into the more
backward areas. During the program period approximately 13,000 additional
exchange lines will be installed in small rural communities (most with less
than 2,000 inhabitants) and 1,200 rural productive centers will receive
operator served radio links. The number of localities served by rural public
call offices (PCO's) will be increased from 500 in 1978 to over 1,000 at the
end of the program thereby bringing improved communication access to an addi-
tional 300,000 rural inhabitants, bringing the total number of rural inhabi-
tants with some form of telecommunications access to an estimated 900,000.
In choosing communities for PCO's, priority-allocation has been given to
localities where "Puestos de Salud" are installed in order to enhance the
efficiency of these nutrition and medical care posts (service to 25% of the
posts in 1976 will be increased to 80% by 1981).
7.04      Sample surveys of rural villages conducted by the University of
Costa Rica with the assistance of ICE and the World Bank have shown that,
in those rural communities which currently have PCO service, people from
all income groups make use of the telephone, and PCO usage is not gener-
ally dominated by any single subgroup of the population. For example, in
the surveyed villages, almost 80% of the PCO callers made only one or two
calls a week and approximately 90% made four calls or less. Also, while a
high proportion of the calls from rural PCO's were made by people who lived
within two kilometers of the telephone, those who were making calls for



- 59 -
agricultural or industry related purposes or for emergency or health rea-
sons tended to travel significantly farther than average distances to use
the telephone.
7.05      Development of the urban network is also of significant importance
in meeting the needs of agriculture, business and industry, and for facili-
tating effective government administration and the operation of essential
social services. In Costa Rica with its limited entrepreneurship and ex-
pertise, the capital city of San Jose is the primary economic and govern-
mental service center for the country. Consequently, given the high calling
rates into and out of San Jose, telephone traffic congestion and limited
access to service in San Jose would significantly affect the efficiency of
the entire economy. Additionally, since rural telephone facilities usually
provide low profitability during the initial years, such investment must be
compensated by ICE's development of urban facilities, long distance service,
mobile telephones, telex, international operations and other new service.
The expansion of the telex network in addition to meeting the increased
demand from the highly productive and important business sector is also
designed to rationalize and improve telegraph services, with reduced costs
of operation and expansion of facilities into new areas.
Least Cost Solution
7.06      The least cost solution to the provision of telecommunications
depends on (a) having made the correct technical and economic decisions
initially when the networks were planned, and (b) following the optimum
path in the design, dimensioning and timing of the many installations which
comprise continuing system expansion.
7.07      Given the existing network and traffic patterns, the dimensioning
and timing of the works under the program, of which the project is an in-
tegral part, are based on individual engineering studies by ICE designed to
determine the least cost means for improving service to existing subscribers,
meeting new demands, and expanding into previously unserved areas.
Return on Investment
7.08      The internal rate of return on the investment program, defined as
the discounted rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues (stated
in terms of 1977 constant prices) attributable to the program with capital
and operating costs (at 1977 price level) is 12% (Annex 7.01). Sensitivity
analysis shows that under the most unfavorable combinations of main parameters
(increase of 10% each in capital and operating costs, 10% decrease in revenue
and two year delay in project completion) the rate of return would not be
less than 7%.
7.09      The rate of return based on observed willingness to pay existing
tariffs is an underestimate of program benefits since it does not include
consumer surplus, a complete estimate of the value of time saved through a
reduction in the proportion of unsuccessful call attempts, and many of the



- 60 -
benefits incurred by receivers of calls, by existing subscribers when new
subscribers join the system, and by those who benefit indirectly through
the better administration of regional development, health, transport, and
agricultural programs, and increased urban and regional business and govern-
ment efficiency.
7.10      Benefits are also underestimated because, while the costs included
in calculating the internal rate of return are those for extending and upgrad-
ing the network and providing facilities in the newly served rural areas now,
the full benefits are not included because the available capacity of various
components of equipment will only be fully utilized when additional invest-
ment is made in the future. Thus, the costs incurred during the 1978-82
period will generate additional untabulated benefits during the period fol-
lowing 1982.

1.        Benefit period.  The benefit period of the program extends from
1978 to 2000, when on average the equipment provided under the program is
expected to have completed its useful life.
2.        Capital expenditures.  Preinvestment for the 1982-86 program is
excluded; but payments made for ongoing works during the first years of the
program are included. All price contingencies and interest during construc-
tion have been deducted from the estimated total capital expenditures for
the program. Capital expenditures do not include expected price increase-
of foreign costs of 8% per annum during 1978-82 nor the projected price
increases in local expenditures of 12% per year in 1978-82.
3.        Operating costs and revenues have been deflated with expected
local price increases of 12% per annum in 1978-82, to bring them to 1977
purchasing power and make them comparable with the capital expenditures at
that time. As from 1982, incremental revenues assigned to the program are
primarily based on expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and
traffic brought about by the program, and decrease in operational cost due
to gain in efficiency related to improvement and expansion of the operations.
Other revenues, such as the reduction of the operating expenses of the tele-
graph by Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones for instance are not included.
Incremental operational costs exclude depreciation and interest and are based
on additional assets and traffic generated under the program.
4.        Net benefits.  A summary of the program's costs and benefits
streams of the program 1978-82 at the cost level of 1977 follows:

VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      It has been agreed with ICE that:
(a) ICE's charges for use of telephone and telex lines by the
"Junta Nacional de Communicaciones" will be adequate to
cover the cost of providing such services (para. 2.03);
(b) beginning fiscal year 1978, and at least annually thereafter,
ICE will allocate administrative costs between the Power and
Telecommunications Directorates, and further between construc-
tion and operations in each Directorate, using methods of
allocation satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.09);
(c) ICE will revalue its assets annually in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank (para. 6.07);
(d) in case ICE should issue bonds, the aggregate amount of bonds
subject to repurchase should not exceed 30% of all bonds of the
Borrower then outstanding (para. 6.12);
(e) tariffs will be maintained to achieve a rate of return of not
less than 12% on annually net revalued assets (para. 6.14);
(f) NTS will not incur any long-term debt without the Bank's approval
unless NTS's most recent 12-month internal cash generation is at
least 1.5 times NTS's maximum debt service requirement (para.
6.16); and
(g) ICE will annually calculate the actual value of the performance
indicators presented in Annex 6.05, and submit them to the
Bank for review (para. 6.17).
Note: Agreements (c) to (g) above are continuation of similar covenants
of Loan Agreement 1006-CR.
8.02      It has been agreed with the Government that:
(a) a budgetary allocation be made sufficient to pay 65% of
Government telecommunications debts outstanding at the date
of the Loan Agreement (as a special condition of effectiveness),
and these debts will be paid prior to December 31, 1978; funds
to pay the remaining 35% will be budgeted for 1979 and will be
paid prior to June 30, 1979 (para. 6.09); and
(b) the Government will pay all outstanding telecommunications
debts, dated after the date of the Loan Agreement, within 90
days after the date of billing (para. 6.09).
8.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$10.6 million, for a term of 17 years including a four-year grace
period at an interest rate of 7.45% plus the usual commitment fee.
