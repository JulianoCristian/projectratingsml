It\n            consists of Stage V of ICE's expansion program\n            comprising an increase in exchange capacity of about 65,000\n            lines; an expansion of long distance lines and facilities;\n            an increase in the number of rural communities receiving\n            telephone service from 500 at the end 1978 to 1,000 by the\n            end of 1980; installation of either an earth satellite\n            station or a submarine cable; expansion of telex and mobile\n            telephone service and the improvement and expansion of\n            training facilities. The project faces no special risks\n            although there is the possibility of delay in installation\n            of electronic exchanges with which ICE has had limited\n            experience and which have to be adapted to the existing\n            network, and in completion of widely scattered rural\n            telephone systems."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
