FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE)
Guarantor:          Republic of Costa Rica
Amount:             US$10.6 million
Terms:              17 years including 4 years of grace at interest of
7.45 percent per annum.
Project
Description:        The objectives of the project are to meet part of anti-
cipated demands for local, long distance and international
services in San Jose and other localities and maintain the
present good quality of service. It consists of Stage V
of ICE's expansion program comprising an increase in
exchange capacity of about 65,000 lines; an expansion of
long distance lines and facilities; an increase in the
number of rural communities receiving telephone service
from 500 at the end 1978 to 1,000 by the end of 1980;
installation of either an earth satellite station or a
submarine cable; expansion of telex and mobile telephone
service and the improvement and expansion of training
facilities. The project faces no special risks although
there is the possibility of delay in installation of
electronic exchanges with which ICE has had limited
experience and which have to be adapted to the existing
network, and in completion of widely scattered rural
telephone systems.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPME1NT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA
FOR A FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
loan to the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad with the guarantee of the
Republic of Costa Rica for the equivalent of US$10.6 million for a Fifth
Telecommunications Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including
a grace period of 4 years, with interest at 7.45 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Costa Rica"
(No. 1666-CR) was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 11, 1977.
This President's Report includes information on the economy obtained subse-
quent to the circulation of that report by a recent mission. While a coalition
of opposition parties won the recent (February 1978) presidential elections,
no substantial change in the direction of social and economic policies is
expected. Annex I summarizes the main economic and social indicators.
3.         Costa Rica provides an example among developing countries of how
high per capita income growth may be achieved without an undue concentration
of development benefits in the upper income groups. A high level of invest-
ment and rapid export growth allowed real output to grow at about 5.9 percent
yearly between 1960 and 1976, while family planning and rising educational and
income levels contributed to a sharp decline in the population growth rate.
The fast growth of output facilitated the absorption of the rapidly growing
labor force and the unemployment rate has remained at about 7 percent during
the last fifteen years. Real output per capita grew at 2.6 percent per year
during 1960-76 and per capita GNP in 1976 reached US$1,040 (World Bank Atlas).
4.        Agriculture continues to be an important sector of the economy,
generating about 20% of GDP and accounting for about 36 percent of total
employment. Agricultural output growth has been among the highest in Latin
America in recent years, especially as a result of the production and export
expansion of bananas and beef. Four products (coffee, bananas, beef and
sugar) made up about two-thirds of merchandise export earnings in 1973-75
while 20 years earlier only two commodities - coffee and bananas - accounted
for 85 percent of exports. Rapid industrial growth was made possible as a
result of the creation of the Central American Common Market (CACM) and the
growth of effective domestic demand that resulted from buoyant growth combined



with a relatively widespread distribution of its benefits. Industrial exports,
largely to the CACM and Panama, have grown from about 10 percent of all
merchandise exports in the early 1960s to about a third currently.
5.        Costa Rica's economy is very open and the country's exports and
imports are highly concentrated. In 1971-76, exports constituted about
30 percent of domestic production, and imports absorbed nearly 39 percent of
aggregate expenditure; while two thirds of exports were in agricultural
commodities, over 70 percent of imports were capital and intermediate goods.
This level of openness and degree of concentration make the economy quite
vulnerable to adverse external price movements. The economy's growth has thus
been puncutated by periodic balance of payments difficulties, where the
originating impulse is most often to be found in a deterioration in the terms
of trade. Financial strains, moreover, have occasionally been pronounced as
the Government has, in these periods of difficulty, initiated countervailing
expansions of expenditure and credit. Rapid increases in exports in the past,
however, have usually facilitated swift recovery from downturns in economic
activity and, in consequence, the process of development has been fairly
continuously sustained.
6.        Recent economic history well exemplifies these cyclical pressures.
In 1974 the rate of growth declined to 5.5 percent (from an average 7.6 percent
in 1970-73), following a sharp decline in the terms of trade and a poor agri-
cultural crop year. To maintain the level of domestic incomes, the Government
embarked upon an expansionary monetary program which, albeit underwriting a
higher than expected investment growth, added to pressures on the balance of
payments. The current account deficit rose to $270 million or the equivalent
of 17 percent of GDP, and reserves at the end of the year stood at less than
three weeks' impo;rts. As a result, various demand control measures were
introduced, including the raising of interest rates, the raising of consump-
tion and sales taxes, and the imposition of credit restrictions for selected
categories of consumer spending. These measures facilitated an improvement
in the balance of payments in 1975, when the current deficit declined to
11.3 percent of GDP and reserves increased to the equivalent of one month
of imports. The continuing world recession continued to have a negative
impact upon export prices and demand, however, and overall economic growth
declined to 2.1 percent.
7.        In 1976 and 1977 the economy has been recovering from the sudden
downturn of economic activity of 1974-75. This recovery has been led by
a rapid increase in the value of the country's two major export commodities,
coffee and bananas. Real growth in the economy was estimated at 4.3 percent
in 1976 and was probably about 6.3 percent in 1977. The usual indications of
buoyancy - investment levels, capacity utilization, employment rates, etc. -
all display continuing improvement; the national savings rate, moreover, has
returned to a more healthy level of about 17.0 percent of GDP in 1976-77 after
declining to about 12 percent in 1974-75. Bank staff estimate that inflation
in 1977, measured by changes in the consumer prices, was probably about
4-5 percent higher than the 4.4 percent of 1976, but well below the high mark
of 30 percent in 1974.



-3-
8.        While Costa Rica has recovered remarkably from the downturn in
economic activity of 1974-75, certain elements have emerged in 1977 which
might disturb the expansion of activity in the short term. Concomitant
with the rapid growth of exports has been a very rapid growth of imports,
which expanded nearly 28 percent in current terms in 1977. Although the
current deficit in 1977, therefore, was probably somewhat higher in absolute
terms than in 1976, the country has nevertheless been able substantially to
augment its reserve levels - to more than two months' equivalent of imports.
For the most part this has been the result of high levels of private borrowing
and inflows of short-term capital reflecting investor confidence in the
economy. The Government has attempted, with mixed success, to sterilize the
large money inflows (both from the record export revenues and other capital
flows) through local bond issues. Finally, at the same time as the high
export revenues have boosted private domestic demand, the Government in a
pre-election year, may have added to excess demand through accelerated
spending. There is, therefore, a case to be made for reducing excess demand
pressures on the economy. The newly elected Government has publicly indicated
its commitment to measures which will serve this end.
9.        The public sector has long played an important role in Costa Rica's
development process. The Government has given substantial attention in recent
years to improving the country's basic infrastructure such as highways, feeder
roads and the development of the hydroelectric potential of the country.
Substantial emphasis is placed on the opening up of new areas for settlement
and cultivation. At the same time, the Government has provided a wide range
of public services. More than 45 percent of all expenditures of the Central
Government have traditionally been in education, health, nutrition and other
social sectors. Health and nutrition programs have been an important factor
in reducing mortality rates from 11 per thousand in the early 1960s to the
present 6 per thousand. Life expectancy at birth has risen to 69 years. At
the same time, general development, higher educational standards and active
birth control related programs reduced birth rates so that the natural rate of
population increase fell from 3.7 percent in 1960 to 2.6 percent by 1975.
Moreover, by spending almost a third of its budget on education, the Central
Government has been able to improve coverage and quality of primary and
secondary schools, reduce illiteracy to a minimum -- the adult literacy rate
was 89 percent in 1973 -- and provide a good quality university education.
Costa Rica has no standing army and the share of Central Government expendi-
tures devoted to security - about 2 percent - has long been one of the lowest
in the world.
10.       Costa Rica's income distribution is one of the most equitable
in Latin America, and the principal beneficiary of the development process in
the last decade has been the middle class. An initiative enacted by the
Government in 1975 is the "Family Welfare Program" which is designed to
increase the living standards of the poorest rural families representing about
one fourth of the population. The program includes, among others, rural
health, sanitation, housing and education projects, as well as nutrition
programs for pre-school and school-age children and is financed primarily
through a recently passed payroll tax and an increase in the sales tax rate.



- 4 -
On the whole, the program's impact on the distribution of income and on rural
living levels is significant: currently, roughly 1.5 percent of GDP is being
redistributed to the poorest 20 percent of the population.
11.       The policy of maintaining high levels of public services and invest-
ment has from time to time been accompanied by serious financial difficulties.
The tax system is income inelastic, pricing policies by some state enterprises,
such as the water supply agency, have been inadequate to generate sufficient
revenues and several new autonomous agencies have become increasingly reliant
on the Central Government for finance. Large budget deficits have emerged,
which were then periodically reduced through the introduction of new taxes and
increases in tax rates. Thus, in 1974, when several new taxes were introduced,
the improvement in public sector finances was reflected in a public sector
deficit equivalent to only 1.4 percent of GDP down from close to 5 percent
during 1971-73. Since then, expenditure growth has outstripped revenue growth
and the public sector deficit during 1975 and 1976 was again equal to about
5 percent of GDP. It is estimated that the public sector deficit remained
at about 5 percent of GDP during 1977.
12.       The prospects for the Costa Rican economy in the medium term are
quite good, provided the Government stimulates export growth and follows
prudent demand management policies. This need is underscored by the expecta-
tion that the terms of trade will continuously decline over the next few
years (coffee prices, for instance, are expected to decline by some 14 percent
in 1978). Assuming that the rate of growth of imports in 1978 will return to
the average of 1970-76, that this more moderate import growth can thereafter
be maintained, and that the efforts underway to diversify and strengthen the
export sector will be felt by 1981, then the economy's rate of output growth
is expected to average 5.3 percent in 1978-85, or slightly higher than the 4.6
percent of 1973-77.
13.       Over the longer term a substantial effort towards industrialization
through export diversification would be necessary if Costa Rica is to continue
its high GDP growth rate while strengthening its balance-of-payments. Some
important steps in this direction have already been taken. Thus, a major
effort towards export promotion has been initiated. Currently exports of
non-traditional products to countries outside the Central American Common
Market are promoted through a tax rebate scheme equivalent to 15 percent of
f.o.b. value; marketing outlets are being established in several countries
in the Caribbean; an export and tourism promotion fund has been created and
special credit facilities are accorded to production for export. Also, a
substantial expansion of hotel facilities is taking place to promote the
tourism industry. The country has good potential to expand existing and
develop new export lines and the experience thus far has been satisfactory.
Despite depressed world market conditions, nontraditional exports grew at
7 percent yearly in real terms between 1974 and 1976.
14.       Assuming that the efforts to diversify and strengthen the export
sector over the longer term are successful, Costa Rica will remain credit-
worthy for the foreign borrowing required for continued satisfactory develop-
ment. The public debt service ratio has fluctuated around 10 percent during



the last several years and is estimated at 10.2 percent for 1977. Assuming a
gradual decline in coffee prices to more normal levels by 1980, but a parallel
and successful implementation of export promotion policies, the public debt
service ratio is projected to rise to a still manageable level, averaging 15
percent in the early 1980's.
External Assistance
15.       As of December 31, 1976, the.Bank Group held 21.2 percent of the
US$932.6 million external public debt outstanding--including undisbursed--
repayable in foreign currency. This share is likely to decrease somewhat by
1980 because of an expected increase in the activity of other external lenders.
The Bank Group share of total public debt service in 1976 was 15.8 percent,
and it is projected to decline by 1980. Of the other major lenders to Costa
Rica, the IDB holds 13.9 percent of external public debt outstanding, includ-
ing undisbursed, CABEI 13.1 percent, the U.S. Government 9.4 percent, Venezuela
3.9 percent, other bilateral lenders 6.6 percent and private lenders 30.6
percent.
16.       In terms of the sectoral thrust of the lending by the principal
external agencies, apart from the Bank, USAID has concentrated on agriculture,
and health, the IDB on power, irrigation, health and education, and CABEI on
transport, power and urban development. These agencies are likely to continue
in the same areas in the future except that USAID is expected to be more
active in urban development and CABEI's activities in this area will be
reduced. The lending of the four principal agencies during the past 10 years
is summarized as follows:

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       Costa Rica has received to date 21 Bank loans and one IDA credit
totaling $267.1 million net of cancellations. The last operation, a loan
for a San Jose Urban Transport Project amounting to US$16.5 million, was
signed on November 4, 1977. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of December 31, 1977, and notes on
the execution of on-going projects.
18.       Since other lenders have been able to provide Costa Rica with
substantial amounts of concessional lending which the Government prefers
to use for its socially oriented investments, the main thrust of the Bank's
past lending has been to help develop basic infrastructure, such as power,
telecommunications and highways. However, the Bank has also supported
efforts to increase and diversify exports through lending for agricultural
credit, and has helped make educational programs more consistent with
manpower objectives through a loan for secondary and vocational education.
19.       In future lending to Costa Rica, we intend to continue to provide
some support for power, in view of the continuing need for substantial amounts
of external financing and our long-standing involvement in this sector which
gives us a special ability to foster institutional development. We are
planning, however, to increase Bank lending in other areas, particularly
agriculture, industry and rural development to provide support for productive
investment and export diversification and to provide assistance to the rural
poor. The agricultural credit loan signed June 2, 1977 is financing pre-
paration of a rural development project, and an industrial credit project to
stimulate industrial growth is now being prepared. We are also, at the
Government's request, exploring the possibility of projects in forestry and
irrigation, and identification missions in these areas will visit Costa Rica
during 1978. In addition, in order to help provide a new source of foreign
exchange earnings, the Bank is considering participation in the financing of,
and in helping to mobilize additional external resources for, the large Boruca
hydroelectric project which is designed primarily to supply the power require-
ments of a proposed aluminum complex.
20.       In our lending activities in Costa Rica, we will continue to coor-
dinate closely with IDB, USAID and CABEI not only with a view to improving the
effectiveness of lending by major external agencies at the national level, but
also to help assure that Government programs are developed in a manner
consistent with Central American priorities.
21        IFC has made two investments in Costa Rica, both to Productos de
Concreto, S.A. A portion of these investments, which total $590 thousand,
have been sold and the balance repaid. IFC is presently considering a loan
of $2.5 million to Scott Paper Company de Costa Rica, S.A., which is scheduled
to be presented to the Executive Directors during March 1978. IFC is also
exploring the possibility of participating in the financing of the proposed
aluminum project and a secondary mortgage finance institution.



PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR
Organization and Existing Facilities
22.       The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) and its wholly
owned subsidiary Radiografica Costarricense, S.A. (RACSA), which provides
most international service, are together responsible for all public services
in the telecommunications sector, except for the public telegraph service
which is operated by Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones, a government agency.
23.       The existing exchange and long distance network in Costa Rica is
shown in the map attached to this Report. The telecommunication system as of
December 31, 1976 consisted of:
(a) Local Telephone Services; Local services are provided
via 50 local exchanges with a total capacity of 111,400
lines. Of these, 87,183 are in operation, almost all
of which are connected to automatic exchanges.
(b). Long Distance Services: Long distance services are provided
by radio and cable links with multiplex equipment. Facilities
for dialing of long distance calls are available to nearly
all subscribers on the automatic exchange network.
(c) Telex and Telegraph Facilities: San Jose is connected by
telex/gentex to 20 traffic centers. A telex exchange is
operated by RACSA serving 516 telex and 34 gentex subscribers
in mid-1977. The Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones operates a
telegraph network with 570 offices.
(d) International Facilities: Costa Rica has good international
telecommunications facilities. Direct dialing is available
to the Central American countries, the USA, and Europe.
Quality and Availability of Service
24.       Costa Rica's telephone density of 5.61 per 100 population is in
the medium range when compared with other Latin American countries (Panama -
8.52; Mexico - 4.76; Colombia - 5.45; El Salvador - 1.39); all these other
countries, however, have longer waiting lists of applicants for telephone
service. Access to telephone service is much better in urban areas than in
rural areas. Metropolitan San Jose has a density of 16.1 (compared with
Mexico City - 13.0; Bogota - 10.6; Santo Domingo - 8.9). Telephone densities
in the other provinces of Costa Rica vary between 1.70 to 0.40. Of the
communities with 2,000 or more inhabitants about 50 have telephone exchanges
with telephone connections in business or residential premises while the
others have only public telephone facilities. As of July 1977 there were
93,657 subscribers in Costa Rica, distributed as follows:



-8-
No. of        Percent of       Percent of
Subscribers      Subscribers     Population
San Jose metropolitan area          71,112             76               28
Rest of the country                 22,545             24               72
25.       In the past, both demand for telephone connections in the urban
centers and long distance traffic were consistently above ICE forecasts.
With Stage IV of its expansion program for the 1974-77 period ICE has now
begun to meet unfilled demand and provide good quality service. However,
because of the projected steady growth of demand for telephone connections
(11 percent on average from 1978 to 1981) and of long distance traffic (14
percent on average), service will deteriorate rapidly if the expansion of
the network is allowed to slow down for any length of time. Also, while
the quality of service offered by the existing rural public telephones is
good, such service, as noted, is limited.
26.       In order to acquire a telephone, a potential subscriber must register
on an official waiting list. Such waiting lists are maintained only in
communities with telephone exchanges. Based on these lists, unfilled demand
is about 7,000 and the average waiting time for telephone installation is
about 11 months. In the other communities equipped only with public tele-
phones and in 162 rural districts where no telephone service was provided as
of July 1976, the demand can only be roughly estimated. Overall, unfilled
telephone demand is currently estimated at 10,000, and is expected to increase
to 15,000 by 1981 after completion of the Stage V expansion, since ICE does not
have the financial and administrative capacity to execute a project designed
to fully meet demand. In addition, there is a demand for service by small
enterprises which are located in isolated places (e.g. tourism, mining and
forest enterprises). This demand is estimated at about 1,200 and can, at
present, be met by installation of radio telephones -- served by operators --
which offer limited service.
27.       The telex-gentex service was greatly improved with the installation
in 1974 of an electronic exchange, serving initially 326 subscribers, and
expanded in 1976 to serve up to 800 subscribers. But, as has been the case
with telephones, the increase in demand has been underestimated, and the
exchange will soon be fully subcribed. Ninety-seven percent of the telex
traffic is international, and the service is good.
Telephone Service Usage
28.       Telephone subscribers in Costa Rica are categorized according to
five classes: two-party, residential 1/, commercial, private branch exchange
(PBX) (for large enterprises and most government use) and public telephones.
With regard to the actual usage of telephones in the San Jose metropolitan
area, traffic originating in the PBXs accounts for 19 percent, commercial
1/   An undetermined amount of small business use is included in this
category.



traffic for 33 percent, and residential traffic for 48 percent of the traffic
during peak hours. In smaller towns the respective figures are estimated at
17 percent for PBXs, 47 percent for commercial traffic and 36 percent for
residential traffic.
29.       The pattern of national long distance telephone traffic reflects
the dominance of the San Jose metropolitan area as the commercial and admin-
istrative center serving the country's economy. In small communities from
60 percent to 80 percent of the calls are made to the San Jose metropolitan
area, against 50 percent to 60 percent in the larger towns.
Sector Institutions and Issues
30.       ICE is a government-owned autonomous institution responsible for
telecommunications and electric power development in the country. Both well-
managed and financially strong, ICE is administered by a seven-member Board
of Directors, all government appointed for eight year terms on a staggered
basis, with the exception of the Chairman of the Board who has a four-year
mandate corresponding to the term of office of the Costa Rican President.
Originally established in 1949 to plan and carry out a national electri-
fication program, ICE was authorized in 1963 to provide telecommunications
services within the country. Approval of tariffs and bond issues for both
energy and telecommunications, must be granted by the Servicio Nacional de
Electricidad (SNE), the regulatory authority, and reviewed by the Government.
31.       ICE has a general manager and three deputy managers:  one each for
the power and telecommunications directorates, and one for administrative
services, which provides administrative, financial and personnel services for
the two operational directorates. ICE's telecommunications directorate is
divided into four divisions: engineering, which in addition to system design
and engineering has responsibility for economic studies and planning,
including financial planning; construction; international services; and
operations. This organization appears adequate for ICE's present needs.
ICE has a well trained and qualified staff at all levels. A strict recruit-
ment policy has succeeded in keeping the ratio of the number of staff in
operations to a low 16 per thousand telephones in 1977.
32.       In the past ICE, RACSA and Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones did not
fully take advantage of the possibilities for sharing facilities and developing
joint operating arrangements in order to reduce costs. Steps have been and
are being taken to remove these deficiencies. ICE has transferred telex and
gentex service to RACSA and has taken over from RACSA responsibility for all
international telephone service. Also, plans are now being made to have the
Junta utilize the national telephone and telex network to transmit telegraphs.
33.       As an outgrowth of the centralization of administrative and economic
activities in San Jose, all ICE's and RACSA's management, maintenance and
installation teams are now centralized in San Jose. Also they have concen-
trated efforts on meeting demand where profits were greatest, particularly in
the absence of Government directives in the past to extend services to all
parts of the country. This centralization has hindered development in the



- 10 -
provinces. This is now changing, however, and for the last few years Govern-
ment policy has emphasized telecommunication development throughout the
country.
34.       As an immediate step to improve the level and quality of service
ICE will decentralize part of its maintenance and commercial activities by
creating 12 centers to handle repairs as well as requests for providing
telephone connections.
Sector Objectives
35.       ICE must expand its telecommunications system rapidly to meet the
needs of a growing economy and, in line with government policy, to provide
service to rural areas and lower income groups. Specifically its principal
objectives are to:
(a) meet part of anticipated demands for local, long distance and
international service in San Jose and some 80 other localities
and maintain the present good quality of service;
(b). increase access to telephone service in rural areas by
installing public call offices to bring the number of serviced
communities from about 500 at the end of 1978 to about
1,000, covering about 70 percent of rural population, by the
end of 1981;
(c) phase out the existing archaic telegraph system and replace
it with the telex and telephone networks;
(d) introduce electronic switching and other modern technologies; and
(e) increase operational efficiency through improvements in the
quality of its staff and management.
The Bank Role
36.       The Bank has made four loans to ICE for telecommunications develop-
ment 1/, the first of which was in 1963 when the telephone system consisted
of 10,000 lines mostly connected to manual exchanges. The projects for the
expansion of the system financed by the first two loans were successfully
completed, and the Project Performance Audit Memorandum for the second project
concludes that it was a well conceived and executed project. The third loan,
which included US$17.7 million for telecommunications development, has just
been completed. This was the first loan which included financing for rural
telephone expansion, and it helped ICE initiate this program. It incurred a
one-year delay, partly because of the need to increase the size of the project
during execution to adapt it to higher traffic than earlier forecast, and
1/   Loans 376 CR of 1963, 632-CR of 1969 and 801-CR of 1972 which were for
both power and telecommunications, and loan 1006-CR of 1974.



partly because of problems in implementing the rural telephone component due
to the physical difficulties encountered in reaching isolated rural communi-
ties. The fourth loan, 1006-CR, of US$23.5 million effective November 19,
1974, which finances Stage IV of ICE's telecommunications development program,
is progressing satisfactorily, and is expected to be completed at the end of
1978. It consists of expansion of the telephone network by 56,300 exchange
lines (from 65,000 lines in mid-1974), the long distance networks by 2,500
trunk circuits and the rural telephone system to serve 90 additional communities.
37.       Through its loans, the Bank has helped finance training programs and
technical assistance in organization and management, and has suggested financial
policies that have greatly strengthened ICE's telecommunications operations.
As a result of the difficulties experienced in designing the third project,
ICE with assistance from a consulting firm, has modernized its planning
activities. The effort made in the preparation of the present project (ten
man-years of engineering and three man-years of economic analysis) marks a
significant improvement in project planning for ICE. Financial projection
work, however, has not yet attained the same degree of refinement, and better
coordination is required between the financial planning and the accounting
units of ICE.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report - Costa Rica Fifth
Telecommunications Project" (No. 1799-CR) dated February 27, 1978 is
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The history of
project preparation, special implementation activities and special condi-
tions are summarized in Annex III. Negotiations were held February 13-16,
1978. The principal representative for the borrower was Mr. Alex Murray,
Executive President.
Objectives
39.       The Stage V project, which the proposed loan will help finance,
will expand the telecommunications system to meet growing demand, and it will
substantially increase access of the rural population to telephone service.
One of the Bank's principal objectives in the Third and Fourth Loans was to
help ICE begin to provide telephone access to a substantial part of the rural
population, and this will in large measure be realized through the Stage V
project. The cables and telephone instruments to be financed by the proposed
Bank loan will be utilized to increase rural as well as urban telephone
capacity. The Bank loan will also finance new long distance installations to
provide service to small towns and rural areas. During the project period,
the capacity of the exchanges installed in rural areas will grow to 14,900.
Through this expansion the rural population having access to telephone service
will grow from about 600,000 to over 900,000 or 70% of total rural population,
and many of those to receive service through the project live in communities
of under 2000 population.

40.       Important Bank institutional goals for ICE telecommunications
operations have been achieved during previous projects, and ICE is today a
financially strong and well-managed institution; however, Bank assistance can
play an important role in enabling ICE to continue to improve its performance.
Technical assistance will be provided by Bank supervision missions in improving
financial planning, in acquiring and operating of new types of equipment such
as the new electronic exchange it will be purchasing to modernize its network,
and for expansion of training programs for its staff.
Stage V Project
40.       ICE's proposed Stage V expansion project will consist of:
(a) an increase in exchange line capacity by about 65,000 lines, of
which 54,000 would be connected to electronic exchanges (about
13,000 lines will serve small localities, most of which have less
than 2,000 inhabitants);
(b) expansion of long distance facilities to provide an additional
1,600 long distance circuits in the national network, of which
200 will be on new routes;
(c) installation of three new long distance exchanges (one of which
will be electronic), and expansion of the existing ones to provide
1,900 new circuit terminations to accommodate the additional long
distance circuits;
(d) expansion of the rural telephone system to about 500 new rural
communities through public call office service, and about
1,200 small enterprises, in rural areas through radio systems
served by an operator, together with the corresponding cable
and radio links to connect them to the national network;
(e) provision of public mobile telephone services to cover the
country as a whole and connect 300 additional subscribers;
(f) expansion of the telex exchange, to provide for 450 new
telex subscribers, and progressive replacement of the old
telegraph network by a combined telephone-gentex message
service;
(g) installation of an earth station, providing additional
circuits for international traffic, or alternatively a
submarine cable; 1/ and
1/   ICE is now completing a study of these two alternatives and will provide
the Bank with a copy of the report. The decision by ICE and RACSA
requires congressional approval. The Bank would be given the opportunity
to comment on the choice (Section 3.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).

(h) improvement and expansion of ICE training facilities to
provide for the planned decentralization and for the growth
of the network and the introduction of new techniques.
Project Cost and Financing
41.       Total project cost is estimated at US$94.1 million of which
US$53.3 million represents foreign costs. In addition, interest during
construction amounts to US$6.2 milliork of which US$1.0 milion represents
foreign costs. The project cost breakdown and financing plan are shown in the
Loan and Project Summary at the beginning of this Report.  Cost estimates are
based on contract prices for ongoing ICE works, adjusted to end 1977 price
levels. Price contingencies amount to 22 percent of base costs based on
annual price increase estimated at 12 percent for local costs and 8 percent
for foreign costs. Since the equipment needs of the project are based on
detailed forecasts and engineering, no physical contingencies have been
provided except in the case of external plant in the local network where a 10
percent contingency has been provided to allow for variations in quantities.
42.       Bank financing would cover 20 percent of the foreign cost of the
project. It would be associated with a recently approved IDB loan of US$12.2
million from its Fund for Special Operations (two percent interest for 30
years, including 8 years' grace) primarily for rural exchanges, and with
various export and suppliers' credits for which firm offers have been received.
ICE would finance the local costs (US$46 million) and a small portion of
foreign costs (US$2.8 million) out of internally generated funds. The items
to be financed by source of financing are as follows:
(US$ millions)

Proiect Execution and Organization
43.       ICE would implement the proposed project which is expected to be
completed by December 31, 1981. Its staff has begun work on engineering
designs and preparation of bid documents, and has the capability to carry out
evaluations of the offers. Most of the civil works will be contracted to
local firms for execution. ICE will install all extensions to existing
equipment, and request support from the supplier only for installation of new
types of equipment, mainly electronic exchanges and the earth satellite
station, if constructed. ICE would carry out the acceptance testing of all
installed equipment.
44.       ICE would carry out the training program through its training
department which now provides courses at all levels. The number of students
who received training in 1976 represented nearly 20 percent of the total staff
for telecommunications. Past Bank loans supported the training program by
financing equipment and foreign instructors; the present Bank loan would
finance equipment to further assist expansion of ICE's training efforts
particularly in regard to the new techniques related to the operation and
maintenance of new electronic exchanges, the possible introduction of a data
transmission network to serve the needs of the Government, banks and private
industry and for the decentralization of rural operations.
Procurement and Disbursements
45.       All goods to be financed by the Bank would be procured through
international,Sompetitive bids (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
Up to US$3.4 million of goods to be financed from the Bank loan, principally
cables and accessories, poles and ducts, might be supplied by manufacturers in
the Central American Common Market, including Costa Rica, and a regional
preference of 15 percent of the c.i.f. landed price or 50 percent of the import
duties, whichever is lower, is provided for such manufacturers.
46.       In respect of items not financed by the Bank, ICE would obtain:
(a) the new electronic exchanges through limited international
competitive bidding i.e. by firms which have been pre-qualified
by ICE based on the suitability of equipment to meet its needs,
and the presentation of proposed export credit financing, the
terms of which will be taken into account in bid evaluation;
(b) procurement of additional quantities in respect of items
awarded after international competition by extension of existing
contracts;
(c) additions to existing equipment through negotiations with
suppliers of the original equipment for reasons of
standardization and efficiency; and
(d) small miscellaneous items which are available on the local
market through local competitive bidding, advertised locally.



- 15 -
47.       Disbursements would be made for 100 percent of foreign expenditures
on goods including, where applicable, installation costs, and for 95 percent
of the ex-factory costs on contracts awarded locally under international
competitive bidding.
Risks
48.       The project faces no special risks, although there is the possibility
of delay in installation of electronic exchanges with which ICE has limited
experience and which have to be adapted to the existing network, and in
completion of rural telephone exchanges. In past projects, installation
problems with rural telephone systems located in isolated and rugged areas
have caused unpredictable delays.
Financial Analysis
49.       ICE's past operating results for telecommunications have been satis-
factory and its financial position is sound. At the end of 1976, ICE had
a debt-equity ratio of 60/40, a current ratio of 1.9 and debt service coverage
of 1.9. As stipulated in the Loan Agreement for the Fourth Project, ICE has
revalued its assets each year since 1974 (except in 1976 when, because of the
low rate of inflation, the Bank agreed to a postponement of the annual
revaluation to 1977), and it has been agreed that annual revaluation will be
continued (Section 5.07 of the draft Loan Agreement). Also, ICE should apply
a satisfactory method for allocating administrative costs between its opera-
tional divisions and between operations and construction, and it has been
agreed that they will do so in a manner satisfactory to the Bank beginning in
their fiscal year 1978, and annually thereafter (Section 5.08(b) of the draft
Loan Agreement).
50.       Tariff increases, implemented in 1975 and 1976, helped to raise
ICE's financial rate of return on revalued telecommunication assets from 7.7
percent in 1974 to 17.7 percent in 1976. Financial forecasts for 1978-82,
assuming no change in current tariffs, indicate a rate of return on revalued
assets declining to 11.6 percent, an operating ratio rising from 0.58 to 0.62,
a debt-equity ratio decreasing from 49/51 to 31/69 and debt service coverage
increasing from 2.0 to 2.9. Although these ratios are satisfactory, in order
to maintain a rate of return of not less than 12 percent (a rate which would
assure an adequate contribution - 58 percent - to expansion) a minor tariff
increase is expected to be necessary beginning about 1981. It has been agreed
that tariffs will be increased as may be required to maintain at least a
12 percent annual rate of return (Sections 5.05 and 3.02 of the draft Loan and
Guarantee Agreements, respectively).
51.       It has been agreed that, as in previous agreements, ICE would not
increase long-term debt without Bank's prior approval unless the preceding 12
months' internal cash generation would cover maximum future debt service at
least 1.5 times (Section 5.04(a) of the draft Loan Agreement). In addition,
ICE will be issuing bonds in the future which may contain repurchase provisions.
In order to protect ICE's current position, it has been agreed that, as under
previous loan agreements, the amount of ICE bonds subject to repurchase will
not exceed 30 percent of the principal of all ICE bonds outstanding (Section
5.04(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 16 -
52.       On June 30, 1977 total receivables amounted to US$3.2 million;
of this the Government receivables were US$1.4 million, or 17 months' billings,
compared with US$0.9 million the year before, although under the previous loan
agreement the Government had agreed to settle its outstanding bills and future
accounts within four months of the date of billing. Receivables from private
customers, however, remain at a very satisfactory level of three weeks' billings.
The Government has begun, in the 1978 budget, to take measures to resolve the
problem of overdue receivables. It has adopted the procedure of appropriating
funds specifically for payment of current ICE telecommunications bills, and
it has agreed to pay all bills incurred after the date of the Loan Agreement
within 90 days of the billing date (Section 3.03(a) of the draft Guarantee
Agreement).  It has also budgeted for 1978 the payment of about US$0.4 million
of past-due bills. In order completely to clear up outstanding bills the
Government has agreed, as a condition of effectiveness, to budget additional
funds during 1978 which, together with the US$0.4 million, would be sufficient
to pay 65 percent of telecommunications debts outstanding as of the date of the
Loan Agreement. These bills will be paid prior to December 31, 1978, and the
remaining 35 percent will be budgeted in 1979 and paid prior to June 30, 1979
(Sections 7.01 of the draft Loan Agreement and Sections 3.03(b) and (c) of the
draft Guarantee Agreement).
53.       ICE will in the future be providing telephone and telex lines to the
Junta Nacional de Communicaciones as the existing telegraph network is phased
out, and it has been agreed that ICE's charges for the use of these lines will
be adequate to cover the additional costs incurred by ICE in providing such
service (Section 5.08(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Economic Justification and Distribution of Benefits
54.       This project is part of the least cost solution for providing
a substantial increase in telecommunications services in Costa Rica. Its
projected internal rate of return is 12 percent. This is, however, a signifi-
cant understatement of total program benefits since it is based only on the
current observed willingness of subscribers to pay ICE for telecommunications
services. Thus, it does not take into account the fact that some consumers in
Costa Rica have in the past demonstrated that they are willing to pay signifi-
cantly higher prices for telecommunications services than they are currently
being asked to pay. The rate of return also is significantly understated
because it does not include an estimate of the value of time saved through
a reduction in the proportion of unsuccessful call attempts, nor all of the
benefits incurred by receivers of calls and by those who benefit indirectly
through the better administration of regional development, health, transport,
and agricultural programs, and increased urban and regional business and
government efficiency.
55.       Sensitivity analysis shows that under the most unfavorable combina-
tions of parameters (increase of 10 percent each in capital and operating
costs, 10 percent decrease in revenue and two years delay in project comple-
tion), the rate of return would not be less than 7 percent.



- 17 -
56.       The rural component of the project is designed to significantly
improve service by doubling the number of rural communities served, thus
extending access to telephones to about an additional 300,000 inhabitants.
Sample surveys of rural villages conducted by the University of Costa Rica
with the assistance of ICE and the World Bank have shown that, in those
rural communities which currently have public call office (PCO) service,
no specific class of customers tends to predominate. For example, in the
surveyed villages, almost 80% of the PCO callers made only one or two calls a
week and approximately 90% made four calls or less. Also, while a high propor-
tion of the calls from rural PCO's were made by people who lived within two
kilometers of the telephone, those who were making calls for agricultural or
industry related purposes or for emergency or health reasons, tended to travel
significantly farther than average distances to use the telephone.
57.       Development of the urban network is also of significant importance
in meeting the needs of agriculture, business and industry, and for facili-
tating effective government administration and the operation of essential
social services. In Costa Rica, with its limited entrepreneurship and
expertise, the capital city of San Jose is the primary economic and govern-
mental service center for the country. Consequently, given the high calling
rates into and out of San Jose, telephone traffic congestion and limited
access to service in San Jose would significantly affect the efficiency of
the entire economy. Additionally, since rural telephone facilities usually
provide low profitability during the initial years, such investment must
be compensated by ICE's development of urban facilities, long distance
service, mobile telephones, telex, international operations and other new
services. The expansion of the telex network in addition to meeting the
increased demand from the highly productive and important business sector
is also designed to rationalize and improve telegraph services, with reduced
costs of operation and expansion of facilities into new areas.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Loan Agreement between ICE and the Bank, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Costa Rica and the Bank, and the
Recommendations of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern of loans for
telecommunications projects and their more important features have been in-
cluded in Part IV and summarized in Section III of Annex III of this report.
There is one special condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement: that
the Government will allocate budgetary funds sufficient to pay 65 percent of
its telecommunication debts outstanding as of the date of the Loan Agreement.
59.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
60.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

1972: Effective Date: June 2, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.

standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Date: December 27, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The project is about 20 months behind schedule -- partly because of

Effective Date: July 30, 1976; Closing Date: October 31, 1980.
