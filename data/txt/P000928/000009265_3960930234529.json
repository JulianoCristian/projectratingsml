The project components include:\n            (a) research management development which will include the\n            establishment of a National Agricultural Research Committee\n            to set research priorities; the development of a National\n            Agricultural Research Plan; and the improvement of\n            management systems at national, institute and program\n            levels; (b) human resources development which will provide\n            for in-country and foreign post-graduate and technical\n            training; (c) rehabilitation of research facilities through\n            rehabilitation of existing buildings, and the supply of\n            vehicles and equipment; (d) improvement of library and\n            information systems; and (e) research program support for\n            the implementation of the National Agricultural Plan and\n            selected research programs, the establishment of a research\n            grants scheme, and the development of research/extension\n            linkages through on-farm adaptive research programs."}, "docdt": "1991-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
