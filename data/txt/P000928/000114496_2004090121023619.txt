Dear Mr. Peprah:
              Amendment:  Development Credit Agreement
         (National Agricultural Research Project, Credit No. 2247-GH)
     We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (National Agricultural
Research Project), dated June 10, 1991, between the International
Development Association (the Association) and the Republic of Ghana (the
Borrower) and the amendments to the Development Credit Agreement
effective February 22, 1993 and February 15, 1995.  Further to the
discussions held with the representatives of the Borrower during the mid-
term review in September 1995 and to your letter of May 15, 1996
requesting IDA to increase the financing ratios for Civil Works, Operating
Costs, and Research Grants Scheme, we are pleased to inform you that the
Association hereby agrees that the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to
the Credit Agreement shall be amended and revised as indicated in the
attached Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Credit.  You may wish to note
that we are only able to raise the financing percentage to 90% (to take
account of local taxation) for local expenditures under Category (5)
Research Grants Scheme.
     Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing by countersigning
and dating the form of confirmation of this letter and returning one
countersigned copy to us.  This amendment shall become effective as of
the date of receipt by the Association of this letter duly countersigned.
                             Sincerely,
                          Charles Humphreys
