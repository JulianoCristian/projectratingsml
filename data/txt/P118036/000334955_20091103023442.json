Gains for Economic\n            Recovery (SSGER) Program Development Policy Loan (DPL) will\n            assist the Government of El Salvador (GoES) to undertake\n            immediate measures in the anti-crisis plan to protect the\n            poor, while supporting the process of economic recovery\n            through the design of new initiatives and institutional\n            strengthening in the social sectors. Apart from providing a\n            part of the financing for the anti-crisis plan, the DPL will\n            also enable the Bank to provide technical assistance in the\n            area of institutional strengthening and policy development\n            to a new Government with limited experience in the executive\n            branch. The SSGER DPL will contribute to building a fiscally\n            sustainable medium term development policy and serve as a\n            platform for dialogue with the GoES, opposition parties and\n            civil society on the reform agenda. The DPL is structured\n            around three pillars: a) protecting fiscal space for social\n            expenditures. The DPL will help to protect non-personnel\n            recurrent spending and essential investments that are\n            required to sustain the quality of education and health\n            services, while generating resources from the reduction of\n            the transport subsidy; b) protecting income and consumption\n            of the vulnerable populations. The DPL will support the\n            launch of essential social programs including the protection\n            and extension of access to basic health and education\n            services and the provision of temporary income support to\n            unemployed persons in poor municipalities; and c)\n            strengthening institutional capacity for policy formulation\n            and implementation in the social sectors for economic\n            recovery. The DPL will support specific actions to build the\n            capacity of the Ministries of Education and Health, as well\n            as the Technical Secretariat of the President (Secretaria\n            Tknica de la Presidencia - STP), which is in charge of\n            coordinating and monitoring the implementation of social policy."}, "docdt": "2009-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
