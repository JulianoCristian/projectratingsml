ImplementingAgency:    Ministryof Economy andFinance
Description:           The Government of Peru (GoP) has requested a
                       programmatic structural adjustment operation to assist in
                       the decentralization of public functions and resources and
                       to support its competitive enhancementprogram, intandem
                       with measures to help ensure continued sound public
                       finances and economic growth. This i s the second of three
                       single-tranche loans using a Programmatic Structural
                       Adjustment Loan instrument to support short- and medium-
                       term reforms that advance decentralization and economic
                       competitiveness. In light of the significant progress
                       achieved under the first loan, this second proposed loan
                       continues to support the ongoing efforts of the GoP with
                       three specific objectives: (i)to protect fiscal sustainability
                       during Peru's transition to a more decentralized state; (ii)
                                                                                  to
                       assist in strengthening management and fiscal capacity at
                       sub-national levels for progressive assumption of service
                       responsibilities; and (iii)to support the creation of a better
                       regulatory and investment environment for increasing
                       Peru's competitiveness, with a strong regional focus. In
                       particular, the third objective of the loan will support a set
                       of microeconomic and institutional reforms that will
                       enhance competitiveness and foster sustainable and
                       equitable growth by favoring capital accumulation and
                       productivity gains inPeru. The proposed loan will achieve
                       these competitiveness objectives by supporting efforts to:
                       (i)institutionalize the Competitiveness Agenda and
                       implement its regional components; (ii)     promote exports
                       andtrade facilitation; (iii)improveproductivity andthe mix
                       and quality of Peruvian products; (iv) reducelogistics costs
                       and improve public services in infrastructure; and (v)


                                   i

                       improve the investment climate by reducing the cost of
                       doing business.     The subsequent and final loan of the
                       program will dependon the progressof the reforms.
                       The underlying objective of the proposed Loan is to enrich
                       and extend the Government's overall program of
                       accelerated reforms, underway over the past three years.
                       This has been facilitated by the country's recent track
                       record of prudent macroeconomic management, which i s
                       supported by an IMF Stand-By Arrangement (approved by
                       the IMF Board in June 2004). Peru's GDP growth of 3.8
                       percent in 2003 was among the highest in LAC, and its
                       inflation rate of 2.5 percent was the lowest in the region.
                       The overall deficit of the combined public sector declined
                       for the fourth consecutive year, to 1.8 percent of GDP in
                       2003 from 2.2 percent in 2002. In addition, the country's
                       currency is stable and the current account deficit i s low.
                       These accomplishments and other measures have enabled a
                       steady improvement inthe economy. The proposedLoani s
                       intended to support further reforms aimed at sustaining a
                       sound macroeconomic environment and enhancing the
                       basis for strong andbroad-basedgrowth.
Risks and Benefits:    Benefits. The Government's decentralization process will
                       have the twin benefits of promoting sustained, broad-based
                       economic growth and improving the quality of and access
                       to government services by all citizens. These benefits, in
                       turn, will contribute to the reduction of poverty and will
                       address equity imbalances in Peru, particularly in rural
                       areas where the impact of decentralization would be felt
                       most strongly.
                       In particular, the loan would help ensure compliance with
                       macroeconomic targets by sub-national governments, and
                       ensure a hardbudget constraint by supporting the design of
                       the    decentralized   revenue,  expenditure   and inter-
                       governmental      transfer  framework    for   sub-national
                       governments, as well as helping monitor and control sub-
                       national debt.       It will   also promote institutional
                       development by helping control the wage bill, support a
                       framework      for   the   accreditation  of   sub-national
                       governments andhelping monitor andevaluate sub-national
                       investment.     To ensure greater sustainability of the
                       decentralization process, the loan will also promote
                       participatory    approaches     and     change-management
                       mechanisms.
                       The proposed secondDECSALloan will help reinforce and
                       deepen linkages between the Government decentralization

andcompetitivenessprograms. It will help acceleratePeru's
economic growth by enhancing the competitiveness of
regions, non-traditional economic sectors andfirms.
The second DECSAL loan aims to support Peru's overall
competitiveness agenda by facilitating four key outcomes.
First, the loanwill help improve the quality of products and
production practices, andto strengthenoverall portfolio and
value of Peruvian products capable of competing in export
markets. Second, under the program, the Government will
aim to reduce currently onerous logistical costs for firms
through an improved sector policy framework, better
management of road and port networks, increased private
participation and the enhancedquality of logistics services.
Third, the loan will support enhanced domestic and foreign
private investment by improving the overall investment
climate, reducing administrative barriers and enabling
transparent contract enforcement. Fourth, the Government
will aim to increase exports through improved trade
facilitation andexport promotion services.
Overall, the program would promote increasedgrowth and
regional competitiveness, free additional resources for
social sector investment and enhance the Government's
capacity to effectively design and deliver public services in
a manner that should particularly benefit the poor and
vulnerable.
Risks. When the first DECSAL loan was discussedby the
Board three key risks were identified: (i)    economic and
financial risks associated with the Government's program
of accelerated reforms, from both external and internal
sources; (ii)  Peru's vulnerability to external interest rates
and exchange rates fluctuations, stemming from its public
debt composition and the extensive dollarization of its
financial sector; and (iii)  political risks and insufficient
institutional coordination between the MEF, CNC and
CND which make it difficult to develop a unified strategy
for the implementation of the decentralization and
competitiveness program. Other risks arise from the high
concentration of economic activity in the primary sector,
which makes the country highly vulnerable to natural
disasters, and from the relatively narrow export base
(mostly dependent on commodities) that increases the
economy' s exposure to terms-of-trade shocks. While those
risks persist, some steps have been taken to mitigate them.
Peru has shown an excellent macroeconomic management
of its economy. Medium-termprospects for Peru are good
in terms of growth and macroeconomic stability. Peru's

                           recent robust growth in non-traditional exports and the
                           signing of a free trade agreement with the US         might
                           diminish those risks. Also, production from the Camisea
                           natural-gas project will provide a further boost to growth
                           andexternal accounts.
                           The country's main weaknesses include low support for
                           President Toledo, isolated but growing regional unrest,
                           continued low levels of public investment, and uncertainty
                           surrounding the 2006 presidential elections, the approach of
                           which is also prompting opposition leaders to put pressure
                           on the Government to increase expenditure. The proposed
                           decentralization reforms, includingthe formation of macro-
                           regions and accreditation of sub-national governments, are
                           politically sensitive. The design and management of these
                           mechanismscould cause distortions in fiscal andfunctional
                           assignments at the sub-national level, with negative
                           consequences for fiscal sustainability and the overall
                           credibility of the decentralization process. This exacerbates
                           one of the most serious risks for DECSAL IT, which i s the
                           possible dominance of political over technical criteria as
                           the country moves towards presidentialelections.
                           Nevertheless, while substantial progress has been made
                           with reforms, the remaining agenda is still long and the
                           Government faces        important    challenges ahead,     in
                           implementation. Greater consensus between key actors at
                           the central-government level will be needed to ensure
                           greater sustainability for the decentralization process. This
                           includes the need for a change-management strategy,
                           including a communications strategy to address the
                           unrealistic expectations about decentralization shared by
                           large parts of the population and many sub-national
                           governments. Reforms will need to heighten the level of
                           transparency, including at sub-national levels of public
                           administration.
                           To its credit, the government has managed to implement
                           difficult reforms while facing political andsocial tension.

                                       I.INTRODUCTION

1. Peru has been going through rapid political transformation in recent years. The return to full
democracy after the Fujimori administration hasbrought a drive for greater transparency and less
corruption. Congress, courts, political parties, the media and civil society have taken advantage
of the new political environment to participate actively in policy making and have trained a
vigilant eye on public management. Until as recently as 2002, Peru was one of the most
centralized countries in Latin America, with more than 97 percent of tax revenues collected by
the national government. Consequently, regional and local expenditureswere heavily dependent
on transfers from the center. Regional authorities were appointed by the national government,
while only local authorities were elected. Furthermore, economic activity remainscentralized in
Peru, with the greater Lima-Calla0 area accounting for a dominant 60 percent of both national
industrialandservice sector GDP.
2. In recent years, Peru has benefited from a strong economic performance, including average
GDP growth of 4 percent and healthy increases in export earnings. Export growth has been
driven by both traditional and non-traditional sectors - albeit assisted by strong commodity
prices. However, steady economic performance has not led to a reduction in poverty, increased
employment or less inequality.        Poverty has increased in both rural and urban areas and
unemployment remains high in Lima and throughout the country.             Regional disparities in
growth, poverty andemployment conditions remainsevere despite economic growth. Inthe new
political environment, Peruvian citizens have vociferously demandedthat the benefits of growth
include more employment, less poverty and improvements in regional economic disparities. As
a means to achieve greater prosperity, Peruvians have also called for the reduction in the
concentration of state power by decentralizing public functions and resources to lower levels of
government andcommunities.
3, In response, the Toledo Administration has made two reinforcing themes - decentralization
and competitiveness - key priorities to secure sustainable and broad growth and alleviate
poverty. The Toledo government startedprograms in those two areas in 2002, which the World
Bank was asked to support through three programmatic loans - Decentralization and
Competitiveness Structural Adjustment Loans (DECSALs). A first DECSAL loan went forward
in2003.
4. Major reforms have taken place since 2002 and through the first year of the DECSAL
program, several of which have been enactedby the Congress. Major laws have been passed to
create regional governments, facilitate gradual decentralization, enhance fiscal responsibility,
establish accreditation criteria, introduce participatory local budgeting and initiate public sector
reform. Additional reforms with supporting regulations are being prepared as well. In total,
these reforms are changing how Peru's public sector operates.
5. The decentralization of key functions and the increased policy making and fiscal capacity of
regional governments are critical steps in improving the competitiveness of poor regions. To
complement and reinforce the decentralization program, and to secure economic and social
objectives, the GoP in 2002 also set up an ambitious competitiveness program with a clear
emphasis on reaching and assisting regions in increasing their competitiveness. The program
focused mainly on institution-building for competitiveness, improving productivity and the mix
and quality of Peruvian products, reducing logistics costs, upgrading infrastructure services,



                                                   I

enhancing the investment climate and facilitating exports. Since the start of the program and
particularly since DECSAL I, laws, institutions and programs have been created. These
                                       major
include setting up a National Competitiveness Council, developing Regional Plans, launching an
aggressive second phase of the concessioning of infrastructure program, passing a modern
 Science and Technology Law, creating twelve Centers for Technological Innovation primarily in
the regions, advancing on e-government, establishing specialized commercial courts for the
quick resolution of commercial disputes and institutingmulti-regional centers for assistance on
investment and export promotion-all            with significant regional implications.
6. Overall, substantial progress has been secured on the two fronts-decentralization and
competitiveness-in          the first year of the DECSAL program, and the Peruvian Government
remains committed to continuing widespread and integrated programs, thus triggering the
implementation of the secondloanof the DECSALProgram, here presented.
 Box 1. Decentralization and Competitiveness: Two Critical and Complementary Ingredients
Decentralization should meet certain requirements if it is to enhance competitiveness.           Fiscally sustainable
decentralization is an essential condition for a sound investment climate.    Poor medium-term fiscal and financial
planning leads to unexpected fiscal imbalances, unpaid floating debt or accumulation of contingencies. Governments
that fail to meet their contractual commitments in a timely manner distort the procurement system by reducing the
number of suppliers or otherwise stimulating price markups when these deal with the government. Alternatively,
regional or local governments that lack adequate tax bases or sufficient transfers to deliver decentralized services
resort to charging fees for government services or otherwise introduce charges that add transaction costs to doing
businessat the local or regional levels.
           Peru's model of decentralization gives regional and macro-regional governments a mandate to stimulate
investment, competitiveness and growth.      Fulfillment of this broad mandate has two essential prerequisites: (i)
strengthened fiscal and financial management capacity; and (ii) adequate legal framework supported by proper
                                                                   an
signals from the central government. For instance, regional and local governments committed to competitiveness
enhancement must improve the efficiency and quality of public expenditure. Excessive payroll or, more broadly,
operational costs, create rigidities and inefficiencies that reduce the quality of service and threaten fiscal
sustainability.   Poor investment planning and misallocation of capital expenditures will result in reduced
opportunities for investment. Lack of modern accounting and good asset management lead to the unproductive use
of public resources that would otherwise benefit from alternative management arrangements involving partnerships
with the private sector. Tax privileges distort relative prices and rarely enhance competitiveness and investment
subsidies need to be targeted and cost-effective.      The design of regional or local investment incentives needs
guidance and evaluation by the central government and private sector.

           Decentralization can indeed be a powerful instrument to secure social, political and economic objectives.
The decentralization system will only be sustainable if based on economic realities, with regions and municipalities
buildingup their own growth potential through focused private sector development strategies. The ultimate success
of decentralization in Peru will be measured not as much by laws, procedures and processes but rather by the extent
to which regional economic growth and employment are catalyzed. Regions must improve their competitiveness
position to attract private investment and increase economic activity. Enhanced competitiveness requires: adequate
and well maintained infrastructure; low production and logisticscosts; better access for regional products to domestic
and foreign markets; improved productivity in regional firms; a better mix o f regional products; the adoption of
quality standards; greater technological capabilities and innovation; enhanced export assistance and trade facilitation;
and improved overall regional investment climates.
           The two key challenges for Peru are to make the decentralization process work administratively and to
create the economic foundations for decentralized economic development through an improved investment climate,
better market access and the development o f internationally competitive industries. In order for regions to be the
engines of increased growth, employment and reduced poverty, an effective decentralization process must be
complemented with a regional and local competitiveness program. This is the rationale for the subject choice of the
DECSAL project.

7. Additionally Kfw, the German Development Bank, is also supporting the Government of
Peru's decentralization and competitiveness program. As a result of the Bank Donor Initiative
for Decentralization establishedlast year underthe FirstDECSAL andthe correspondinginterest
of the German Financial Cooperation to intensify its engagement in supporting the Peruvian
decentralization process, KfW plansto co-finance the proposed loan to the amount of 12million
Euros. The co-financing arrangement serves as an important step to deepen donor coordination
in Peru. The government will benefit by accessing additional resources, coordinated technical
assistance and reduced transaction costs through the use of common monitoring and reporting
mechanisms.


              11. RECENTPOLITICALANDECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

A. CurrentPoliticalContext

8. After a decade of the Fujimori regime and a short transitional government, PresidentToledo
was elected to office amid an economic recession. Beginning its term in July 2001, the new
government received support from the international community at the Madrid Consultative
Group Meeting in October 2001 and signed a two-year Stand-by Agreement with the IMF in
February 2002. Though the economy is stable and growing, the government's agenda continues
to face major political challenges. The government lacks a majority in Congress and there have
been four Prime Ministers and five cabinets in less than three years. InFebruary 2004, half of
the ministers were reshuffled, with Carlos Ferrero continuing as Prime Minister and Pedro Pablo
Kuczynski returning as Minister of Economy andFinance.
9. A National Agreement (AcuerdoNucionul) to catalyze consensusbetweenthe major political
actors, parties, religious groups, unions andcivil society was signedinJuly 2002 - a model since
replicated in other parts of Latin America.      The Agreement contains 29 policies aimed at
accomplishing four objectives: (i)    Democracy and the Rule of Law; (ii) and Social
                                                                               Equity
Justice; (iii)Competitiveness; and (iv) Efficiency, Transparency and Decentralization. After a
period in which the activity and effectiveness of the National Agreement as a forum for
consensus building waned, the new Ferrero cabinet has revived it and the main opposition
politicalparty, APRA, has rejoined the forum.
10.Seekingsupport for keeping the reformprogram on track, the presentPrimeMinisterrecently
put forward a Road Map (Hoju de Rutu, 2004) to highlight the government's policy objectives
and agenda for the next two years. This document comprises about 180 new or existing
governmental programs, including actions, standards and regulations, and projects aligned with
eight major policies.      Those are: (i)safeguarding macroeconomic stability and increasing
national production and employment; (ii)     encouraging private investment and competitiveness;
(iii)promoting state reform through decentralization, tax reform, andraisingthe quality of public
expenditure; (iv) fighting corruption; (v) supportingFree Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations;
(vi) overcoming poverty by enhancing the quality of public social expenditure, particularly on
health, education, employment, housing, and basic sanitation; (vi) giving priority to education,
agriculture, andpublic safety; and (viii) strengtheningdemocratic institutions, the rule of law and
humanrights.
11.These comprehensive short-term plans were broadly welcomed as a new approach to
launching needed reforms, but did generate some disappointment among the public and



                                                 3

opposition political parties due mainly to the lack of clear or sufficiently specified
implementation arrangements.              Thus far, little progress has been achieved towards the
implementation of the actions and projects announced in the R~ad                  Map. However, it remains
prematureto fully assess its effects.

B. RecentEconomicDevelopmentsand Competitiveness

 12. Since the previous DECSAL 1, Peru's macroeconomic performance has been robust and
 vulnerabilities have been further reduced. The deceleration period between 1998 and 2002,
ended when growth reboundedto 4.9 percent in 2002. Growth has since remained steady and
 authorities have recently revised the real GDP growth projection up to 4.2 percent for 2004 from
4.0 percent. The economic programunderthe Toledo administration has focused on maintaining
 macroeconomic stability, including moderate fiscal adjustment, with the aim of supporting a
 sustained recovery in economic activity and employment, while maintaining low inflation,
 limiting external vulnerability, and laying the bases for a markedreduction in poverty over the
 medium-term. Sound macroeconomic fundamentals have provided a cushion against external
 shocks, includingweak global growth andregional financial turmoil. International marketshave
 reacted favorably to Peru's economic stability, and since its return to international markets in
 January 2002, the Government of Peru has successfully placed seven bond issues at favorable
 terms.

13. Based on successful compliance with the 2002-2003 IMF agreement that ended inFebruary
2004, the Government has negotiated a new US$442.8 million precautionary IMF Stand-by
Agreement covering the period June 2WAugust 2006. The new agreement aims to reduce
Peru's primary vulnerabilities associated with high debt stock and financial dollarization and to
lower poverty and raise employment, in the context of prudent macroeconomic policy and the
strengthening of structural reforms. The agreement projects average real GDP growth of 4.5
percent for 2004-06, average annual inflation of around 2.5 percent and high international
reserves. Key fiscal targets under the agreement include gradual combined fiscal deficit
reduction from the current 1.7 percent to 1percentover the final two years of the agreement.
14. Peru's economy has seemingly defied continual political turmoil. However, strong growth
performance and prudent macroeconomic management have had limited impact on employment
and poverty levels. Economic growth has averaged 4.5 percent a year for the period 2002-03,
while employment grew by a mere 1percent during the same period and more than half of the
population remains below the poverty line. Poverty has increasedsignificantly, from 43 percent
to 54 percent between 1997 and 2002. Moreover, the accumulated rate of per capita GDP
growth since 1997has been negative (-0.24 percent). The decline i s even more pronouncedwhen
considering output growth relative to the potential labor force rather than total population. At the
same time, employment gains in leading sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and retail
have lagged and have been mostly concentrated in Lima. Continuing political turbulence and
stressful social conditions reflect widespread discontent, amid a slow recovery in per-capita
income, which still has not overcome lossessuffered in 1998-2001.
15. Peru's continued commitment to macroeconomic policy discipline in 2003 and 2004 has
resulted in low inflation and a stable exchange rate, rapid growth of exports, high official
reserves, a rising trade surplus and a declining current account deficit, and a well-capitalized
banking system. GDP real growth in 2003 was led by private investment (5.4 percent) and
exports (5.9 percent) and to a lesser extent by public investment (5.0 percent). It is projected to
grow at 4.2 percent in 2004, driven by private investment and export demand.                 Private
investment has been boosted by the Camisea pipeline, a natural gas project that has come on
stream inAugust 2004.
16. Exports grew strongly - aided by the surge in commodity prices - in 2003, 16.4 percent in
dollar terms, reaching US$8.9 billion. They are on track to reach a record US$11 billion in
2004. While Peru's exports are heavily dominated by mining and other traditional exports (70
percent of the total), non-traditional exports have also been vibrant and a key engine to regional
growth. The dollar value of non-traditional exports grew by 15 percent year-on-year in 2003,
against 3 percent in 2002. Non-traditional exports performance has continued to improve
markedly in 2004, driven by a supportive global growth backdrop andthe improvement inPeru's
terms of trade. The number of firms exporting andthe number of exported products continue to
increase significantly. During the first half of 2004, non-traditional exports have grown by 29
percent in dollar terms. Agro-industrial goods and textiles have led non-traditional export
growth, on the heels of the 2002 ratificationof the U.S. ATPDEA (Andean Trade Promotion and
Drug Eradication Act). As a result, a trade surplus of US$731 million was reached in 2003,
compared with US$306 million in 2002. The current account deficit narrowed to 1.8 percent of
GDP in 2003, from 2.0 percent of GDP in 2002, and is projected to continue declining to a
record-low 0.6 percent of GDP. Peru's external position is likely to improve further in the next
years, contingent on a favorable external environment.

17. The authorities are committed to further integrating Peru into the global economy and are
currently in the process of negotiating free trade agreements (FTA) with several countries,
including the United States, the European Union, Thailand and others. The potential FTAs
would considerably improve the exporting potential of Peruvian regions that produce non-
traditional agricultural products. Nevertheless, a sustained revival in investment is critical if
Peru i s to return to a higher growth path and make inroads against its high levels of poverty and
unemployment.       Overcapacity, regulatory uncertainties, infrastructure shortcomings, limited
progress with second-generationreforms, andpolitical turmoil may be undermining non-primary
sector investment at the margin, especially in the absence of a clear investment-friendly stance
on the part of the government.
18. Inflation has been at its lowest level in 40 years.           Supported by the inflation-targeting
framework adopted in 2002, inflation remained at 2.5 percent during 2003. Interventions in the
foreign exchangerate market by the Central Bank have helped stabilize the exchangerate against
the U.S. dollar. The Peruvianbankingsystem has been gradually strengthenedon the basis of a
steady consolidation since 1998, recent asset quality improvement, and reforms to the financial
regulation and supervision framework.            The declining trend in credit to the private sector
reversed in 2002 and 2003. Likewise, Peru's international liquidity position has improved
significantly since the 2002 CAS, with 2002 and 2003 financial vulnerability indicators more
favorable than the ones projected. Standard & Poor's upgraded the sovereign debt of Peru to
BB. Despite all these positive developments, Peru's sovereign rating is still below investment
grade. The rating is mostly constrainedby a relativelylarge public debt (47 percentof GDP) and
a political environment that has limitedprogressinstructural reforms.
19. Fiscal policy has been prudent,
leading to a steady improvement in           Figure 5: NonFinancialPublic Sector Primary Balance
public accounts.       The combined                              (In percent of GDP)
public sector deficit narrowed from
2.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to 1.7
percent of GDP in 2003. Fiscal
figures so far for 2004 suggest that
the 1.4 percent of GDPfiscal deficit
target will be met comfortably. The
Government intends to further
reduce the fiscal deficit, and has
established a 1 percent of GDP

modern economic history, the fiscal
deficit will have fallen for five consecutive years without jeopardizing growth. In Septemberof
2003, with the objective of gradually raisingtax revenues to 14 percent of GDP in 2005 and 16
percent of GDP in the medium-term,' Congress gave executive decree powers to the
administration for 90 days to pushthrough tax reforms. It also passedthe fiscal decentralization
law which mandates gradual elimination of regional value-added tax (VAT) exemptions. New

tax collection procedures? an increaseinthe rate of VAT, andcontinued solid economic growth
have contributed to increase tax revenue collection from 12 percent of GDP in 2002 to 13
percent in 2003, with 13.3 percent projected for 2004. Despite strong spending pressures, a
small primary surplus was achieved in 2003 for the first time since 1998, as revenues rose at a
faster pace than expenditures. The surplus is projected to grow further in 2004 to reach 0.6
percent of GDP. However, the decline in public investment that started in 2001 has not been
reversed, with the total reaching only 2.6 percent of GDP in 2003, its lowest level since the
1980s. The Government is exploring options for fostering public and private investment in
infrastructure-such      as private-public partnerships-while      preserving macroeconomic stability.
The Government has agreedto participate in a pilot case study examining the linkages between
public investment and fiscal policy, which will be conducted with the IMF, World Bank and
IADB.Nevertheless, fiscal consolidation in the coming years will continue to be challenged by
expanding social needs, legislative opposition and political pressures as the election year gets
closer.
20. Despite strong economic growth, sound macroeconomic management and advances in the
Peruvian Competitiveness program, the Peruvian economy compares poorly within Latin
America according to competitiveness ranking indexes. In 2003-04 Peru came 78th of 95
countries in the World Economic Forum business competitiveness ranking. Moreover there is
highvariancebetweenPeruvianregions oncompetitiveness.
21. Relatively robust recent export performance in Peru i s tempered by the fact that the export
sector continues to compare poorly with other countries in the region.                      In 2003 exports
represented only 17 percent of GDP, the second lowest in Latin America and far below Chile
(34.6 percent), Mexico (29.6 percent), Colombia (23.2 percent) and Bolivia (21.9 percent).
Similarly, exports per capita in Peru, at approximately US$347 in 2003, are amongst the lowest
inthe LAC region. Incomparison, Mexico andChilehave export per-capita levels of US$1,719
and US$1,476 respectively. Peru's comparatively poor export performance is particularly
surprising given the country's strong potential in mining, agriculture, fisheries and related
sectors.
22. Evidence suggests that Peruhas beenunable to exploit its export potential insectors where it
has a comparative advantage.              For example, as of 2003, fruit exports from Peru are
approximately US$90 million, far behind Colombia (US$800m), Ecuador (US$600m) and Chile
(US$1.4b). Similarly, Peru compares poorly to regional competitors in the textile and apparel
sector exporting only USW5 per capita to the United States. In comparison, Guatemala,
Honduras andCostaRica export roughly US$300 per capita inthe sector.

C. Poverty andInequality

23. After the economic crisis of the late 1 9 9 0 ~Peru enjoyed a period of sustained and, more
                                                         ~
recently, fairly strong GDP growth. However, GDP per capita growth during this same period
was much more modest and benefited rich households disproportionately. This was due to the
fact that growth was initially concentrated in sectors with high capital-to-labor ratios (biased


2. The Peruvian tax collection agency's (SUNAT) decision to reassign responsibility for collection of VAT to the
    country's largest companies on their purchases from smaller firms (including those in the informal sector)
    broadened the tax base and increased tax revenue.

growth), and, when it later expanded to the rest of the economy, failed to generate new jobs or
investments (non-inclusive growth) that translated into higher income for poor families.
24. As a result, recent economic growth has not been accompaniedby a decline inpoverty. After
the increase caused by the 1998/99 economic crisis, the poverty rate remained stable between
2001 and 2003, at around 55 percent, while the extreme poverty rate declined from 24.4 to 21.6
during this same period. This implies that, due to population growth, the number of poor
increasedby 400,000 people, while the number of extremepoor fell by 550,000 people3.

3. Due to improvements in the ENAHO's sampling framework in 2000, a consistent poverty series cannot be
    constructed for 1997-2003. Instead we present two sets of poverty numbers: one for 1997-2002, where the
    figures for 2001 and 2002 have been adjusted to make them comparable to those of 1997-2000; and one for
    2001-2003.Althoughthe level of poverty varies across series, poverty trendsare similar.

25. In 2003, the latest year for which data is available, rural poverty rates in Peru were
significantly higher than thoseinurbanareas. In2003/04 the ruralheadcountpoverty rate almost
doubled the rate for urban areas, and the extreme poverty rate in rural areas i s five times higher
than in urban areas. More than threequarters of Peru's ruralpopulation lives in poverty and46
percent lives in extreme poverty. InMetropolitan Lima, 36.5 percent of the population is poor,
andthe rategoes upto 48.5 percentfor the remainingurbanareas. Extreme poverty for Lima and
other rural areas i s much lower, at 1.8 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Nevertheless, since
approximately 72.2 percent of the population is urban, a majority of the poor live inurban areas.
The incidence of poverty varies significantly across the different regions of the country. Poverty
rates on the coast, where near half of the Peruvian population lives, are much lower than in the
sierra (highlands) or the selva(jungle). Extreme poverty is also more severe inthese areas, where
around 40 percent of the population consume less than what is defined by the extreme poverty
line.
26. Inequality in Peru continues to be relatively high by international standards. Between 1997
and 2002, inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient for per capita consumption) remained
almost unchanged, reflecting the weak growth in GDP per capita during the whole period.
Inequality within urban areas is still substantially greater than in rural areas (with Gini
coefficients of 0.34 and0.30, respectively). Limai s the most unequalregion inthe country (0.40)
andthe ruralareas inthe Coast andSierrahavethe lowest amount of inequality (0.26).
27. Access to services in Peru, however, has improved considerably. The proportion of
households with household water connections rose from 54.8 percent in 1997 to 66.1 percent in
2002. Moreover, the fraction of households with electricity rose from 69.2 percent to 71.8
percent in the same period. Finally, 53.1 percent of the households were connected to the
sewerage system in 2002, up from 45.6 percent in 1997. The poor population benefited most
from the expansioninthe access to these services.
28. In2000, the infant mortality rate in Peru was 33 per thousand; 185 mothers died in every
10,ooO births; 25 percent of children were suffering from malnutrition; and only 51.3 percent of
children were at the age-appropriate level in grade 6. As part of its medium term program, the
government adopted a set of goals for these indicators, to be achieved by 2006. Infant mortality
rate is expected to decline to 26 per thousand, maternal mortality rate to 160 in 100,OOO live
births, chronic malnutrition rate to 20 percent, and the percentage of children who are at age-
appropriate level in grade 6 to 55. While there is no recent survey data available to assess the
advance towards these goals (a National Demographic and Health Survey was carried out in
2004, but its results will not be published until early 2005), some indirect indicators show that
there may have been some improvements in recent years. The proportion of poor households
with access to nutrition and feeding programs among the poor grew significantly in several
regions (in rural areas grew more than 10 percentage points between 2001 and 2003), and the
proportion of births attendedby qualified personnel went from 43 percent in 2000 to 60 percent
in 2003. Finally, estimates for maternal mortality indicate a decline of nearly 100 points froin
2000 to 2003.

              111. Peru's Decentralizationand CompetitivenessReformProgram

A. Decentralizationand CompetitivenessinPeru: Guiding Principles

29. Peru's decentralization and competitiveness enhancement program is on course to improve
governance and economic performance by facilitating demand-responsiveness in the local
provision of public goods and improving regional economic performance. Decentralization will
facilitate greater prosperity and well-being across all regions by supporting efficient taxation,
stable expenditures and a proper schedule of transfers of service delivery in the social and basic
infrastructure sectors. Similarly, the competitiveness enhancement agenda will also strengthen
economic performance overall-and           particularly in lagging regions-by     improving core
infrastructure, targeting key regional investment opportunities and catalyzing sectors with export
potential.
30. However, decentralization andcompetitivenessenhancement programs are not without risks,
including the disruption of services, fragmentation of public interventions, unevendistribution of
public resources and over-indebtedness, disparities inaccess to public services and deepeningof
regional economic inequalities.        Peru examined the decentralization and competitiveness
enhancement experiences of other countries and reflected the lessons learnt in its own program.
Building on that experience, Peruhas adoptedaprogrambasedon three basic principles:

         0  Decentralization should be fiscally neutral, meaning that the decentralization process
            should not create an additional fiscal burden on the public sector, thanks to a pari
            passu reduction innational government expenditures as responsibilities andresources
            are transferred to regional and local entities, combined with ceilings on borrowingby
            regional or localgovernment.
            Decentralization should be gradual, with transfers of resources and responsibilities
            takingplacebyphases andrestrictedto thoseentities that have demonstratedeffective
            capabilities, particularly through the accreditation process.

         0  Decentralization should complement economic competitivenessefforts by enabling
            local and regional governments to facilitate and undertake growth-enhancing
            investments, target potential growth sectors andmobilize private sector resources.
31.The Government's decentralization program and key related reforms supported under this
programmatic loan include:

         0  Macroeconomic Framework: This component will support the Government's efforts
            towards fiscal consolidation by expanding revenues through tax policy and
            administration reform (especially at the regional and local levels) and creating a
            systemof tax sharingcriteria that reflects economic activity andpoverty incidence.

         0  Fiscal Sustainability and Decentralization: This component will continue the support
            reform of the system of intergovernmental transfers with a view to ensuring adequate
            financing and tax effort incentives at each level of government. As it had been
            anticipated, Congress paved the way for the agglomeration of departments (regional
            governments) into larger regions that can fully take advantage of economies of scale
            for the larger infrastructure projects required to enhance regional competitiveness.
            This project will reinforce guiding principles that reconcile fiscal neutrality with
            fiscal and financial incentives for the planned formation of newly authorized and



                                                   10

         larger regions. This component will also strengthen public debt sustainability by
         supporting the regulation of decentralized borrowing. It marks a distinct shift away
         from the ex-ante emphasis of the first phase of decentralization. The component will
          support ex-post conditions including the implementation of a centralized (MEF-
         based) public expenditure evaluation system. The system aims to effectively monitor,
         coordinate and assess public expenditure at all levels of government, enhance the
          quality of budget decisions and ensure efficient and targeted service delivery. This
          element also strengthens budget management by introducing a budget formulation
          module for regional andlocal governments inSIAF.

       0  Institutional Capacity for Decentralization: This component supports institutional
          reforms related to the decentralization process, which helps to ensure fiscal
          sustainability.   Among the reforms are the following: consolidation of the
          accreditation system and the promotion of performance management contracts with
          regional and local governments, civil service reform, improvement of the public
          investment system, and the expansion of participatory approaches at the central,
          regional andlocal levels of government.
32. Key social reforms that are linked to the decentralization process and are currently
supportedby the Programmatic Social ReformLoans are:

       0  Developing apolicy of budgetaryprotection for priority social programs (PSPs).

       0  Merging social protection programsin the food assistance, social, basic infrastructure
          and employment generation areas under the Ministry of Women and Social
          Development (MIMDES), and gradually transferring them to local governments,
          supportedby managementagreements.

       0  Supporting the implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system for social
          programs to be decentralizedto regional andlocal governments.
33. The Government competitiveness program supported by the DECSAL project has five
pillarsanda strongregionalfocus:

       0  Institutionalize the Competitiveness Agenda and Design and Implement Regional
          Initiatives: This will strengtheninstitutions to provide leadership and coordination in
          order to advance the overall competitivenessprogram.

       0  Facilitate Exports and Trade:This seeks to facilitate increasesinexports, particularly
          non-traditional ones, and to improve trade facilities in the regions. Since trade has
          been identifiedas a key engine of economic growth, this component will identify and
          open markets for Peruvian products, assist firms to export, and reduce trade related
          costs.
          Improve the Mix and Quality of Peruvian Products and Increase Productivity: This
          component will address the relative low quality, value-added, and technology and
          innovation intensity of Peruvian products and increase the human capital of the labor
          force.

       0  Reduce Logistics Cost and Improve Public Services in Infrastructure: This
           component will address the issue of high logistics costs in Peru, which significantly
          hamper its competitiveness, and the low efficiency of Peru's public infrastructure
           services.



                                                11

             Improve the Investment Climate: This seeks to reduce the cost of doing business, by
             supporting the reduction of administrative barriers and strengthening commercial
             dispute resolutionpracticesas a meansto improve the businessenvironment.
             Enhance the Regional Focus of the Competitiveness Program and Assistance to
             Regions: The program has a strong regional focus to facilitate increased economic
             activity and employment in the regions and provide them with capacity needed to
             implement regional programs.
34. The components of the Government competitiveness program are complementary and
reinforcing. Exports can and should be a powerful engine for growth inPeru, particularly in the
regions, andwill be further strengthenedby the free trade agreementscurrently being negotiated.
However, strong export performancewill require a series of additional measures. Peruwill need
to develop a robust mix of highquality products, and an adequate provision of associatedexport
products in the regions, while also lowering the costs of economic activity by eliminating
administrative barriers and logistic bottlenecks. The Government program aims to facilitate a
surge in exports from the regions and to build on regional comparative advantages and latent
export potential.
35. This Bank-supported competitiveness program is a subset of a broader Government
competitiveness andgrowth agenda.4 The rationale for selecting adiscrete subset of the program
i s to ensure that the Bank's assistance has a coherent and sharper focus. The selection of the
supported components was made on the basis of complementarities with the decentralization
program, relevance andhighpotential impact, focus on direct productive effect and feasibility of
short-term improvements.
36. Specific prior actions, triggers andindicators for the Government Programto be supportedby
the proposed Second and Third DECSAL loans are included in Annex I.A description of the
complete Government Programi s provided inAnnex II.


B. Evaluationof DECSALITriggers
37. The GoP has made considerable advances in its decentralization and competitiveness
program. The DECSAL Iestablished a series of progress triggers for the preparation of the
proposed DECSAL II.The status of these triggers i s presented in Table 2 below. Overall the
Government has demonstrated significant progress anddemonstratesa continued commitment to
the program agreed under DECSAL I. Of the twenty-one triggers, fifteen have been fully
accomplished, three are only partially fulfilled, two have beenreformulated andone has not been
accomplished.
38. The Government of Peru has also made considerable advances on the decentralization and
competitiveness program, far beyond the parameters of the agreed triggers. For example, the
GoP is in the midst of an ambitious infrastructure concessionprogram involving roads, airports,
water, electricity, gas and ports; it has enacted a new Law on Science and Technology and the
Law on the newly authorized Macro-Regions; it has established seven commercial courts to
improve commercial disputes; it is defining regional competitiveness indicators to evaluate
progress at regional level; it has issuedthe initialregulations for the launching of the MEF-based

public expenditure evaluation system; the census of public employees for identification and
control has been finalized, setting the basis for future payroll control and the provision of
benefits, essential for the decentralization of public services; a comprehensive legal framework
for civil service reform i s being developed; the pension reform has gained the first round of
approval by Congress to Pension Reform; and an evaluation of the financial situation of the
municipalities has beencarriedout with Bank assistance.

 [. MACROECONOMICFRAMEWORK AND OVERALL PROGRAM

 I.  The macroeconomic framework is consistent i. Accomplished: The economy continues to demonstrate
 with the objectivesof the program.                stronggrowth - real GDP has increasedby 4.2 percentyear-on-
                                                   year in the first four months of 2004. The government's goal is

C. Pillarsofthe GovernmentProgram

40. The Government's efforts in implementing growth-enhancing structural reforms and
stabilizing the economy have produced substantial results.                  The proposed DECSAL I1 will
support these efforts, as described in Annex I,around three key pillars - decentralization and
fiscal sustainability; institutional capacity for decentralization; and regional competitiveness
enhancement.
41. In particular, in the area of fiscal decentralization the proposed loan will assist the
Government to further strengthen the existing legal and institutional framework for fiscal
decentralization. This will include: improved control over regional and local borrowing; the



                                                         15

design and initial implementation of medium-term fiscal planning at regional and local levels,
and monitoring and evaluation systems for investment and other regional and local government
expenditure programs. Triggers for DECSAL IIIwill include other pending aspects of the
Government reform agenda that the Government intends to accomplish in the coming months,
including regulations for the Law of Fiscal Decentralization, the Law on Accreditation and the
newly created and larger regions and the general laws on Public Debt, Budget and Treasury.
Additionally, the Government intends, in the ensuing year, to make further advances and
achievementsin the implementation of accreditation, participatory budgeting, regional and local
tax effort andthe sanctioning of excess regional and local borrowing.
42. Peru has taken important steps with the first generation of reforms for decentralization (see
Box 2), particularly inrelation to financial andcontrol measures that support fiscal andfinancial
discipline at all levels of government. The Government is developing and implementing a legal
framework for a gradual and fiscally neutral decentralization process that ensures delivery of
essentialpublic services. Inthis regard, the basic fiscal framework i s already inplace andserves
as the first step in a longer-term effort to decentralize public functions and resources to lower
levels of governments and communities. The Government is currently focused on ensuring
smooth implementation of the basic framework by strengthening regional and local fiscal and
financial planning, monitoring and evaluation capacity. Inparallel, an intense effort has been
launchedby the Ministry of Economy andFinance (MEF) to reinforce the proposedaccreditation
mechanism with tools geared to stimulate, monitor and evaluate the efficiency of regional and
local expenditure.

1 Box 2 Peru-Legal         Framework for Decentralization: Progressand Challenges
I Existing  Framework: The basic legal framework on decentralizationnow inplace includes:
  (i)A constitutional amendment mandated the creation of regional governments.                 The Organic Framework
  Decentralization Law (OFDL) approved in July 2002 is a pivotal piece of legislation on decentralization. OFDL
  established the guiding principles of the decentralization process, institutions, functions, transfers and stages of
  implementation. As this was aframework law, additional implementing legislation was needed.
  (ii)Organiclawsforregionalgovernments(November2002)andmunicipalities(March2003),whichdefinethebroad
  responsibilitiesof these regional andlocal governments.
  (iii) Responsibility andTransparencyLaw (LRTF- May2003) includesfiscal rulesfor regionalandlocal
        Fiscal
  governments. This law establishedthe following: subnational governments require central government guarantees to
  contractexternaldebt; limits for the ratio of debt revenueand annualdebt service to currentrevenuemust be below 100
  and25 percentrespectively; the 3 year averageprimary balance of subnationalgovernmentsmustbe positive; access to
  regional and municipal funds will be denied to delinquentsubnationalgovernments; andthe central governmenthas the
  authority to interveneinthe operationsof regional governments that endanger the country's fiscal sustainability.
  (iv) The Law on Participatory Budgeting, supplemented by regulations which provide a framework for civil society
  participation inthe budgetarydecision-makingprocessat the local and regional levels.
  (v) The Fiscal DecentralizationLaw (LDF- February2W), which specifiesthe mechanismsto be usedfor transfersto
   regions and identifies the tax-sharing and tax administration arrangements between the central government and the
 i regions at a later stage of the decentralizationprocess (when the current regions are merged in line with the macro-
 I region incentives law, as discussed below). The LFD also reinforces constraints, established in the restructuredfiscal
 1 responsibility law, on regional and local governmentborrowing inorder to expandexpenditure.
    (vi) The Law on Promotion of Decentralized Investment, which established a framework for fostering private
   investmentinthe regions.
   (vii) The Accreditation System Law for Regional and Local Governments, approved in July 2004, which establishes a
   system for the certification of minimumcapacity standards needed for regional and local governmentsto qualify for the
   transfer of functions and the correspondingresources. The Law's regulations will be ready by the end of 2004.
   (viii) The Law on Incentives for Integration and Creation of Regions, designed to create conditions, incentives and
   instruments for the voluntary merger of regional governments (via referendum) in order to obtain an optimum number
   of economically viable regions.
   (ix) The Framework Law for Public Employment, which sets the overall framework for civil service reforms and the
   payroll census (ubono en cuentu). This law will be complemented by a number of civil service laws with important
   implications for the managementof the civil serviceboth at the central and regional and local levels.

   Pending Framework Some important legal measures and regulations are still pending in order to complete the
   framework for intergovernmentalfiscal arrangements. These include four bills alreadydiscussedinCongress:
   (i) constitutionalreformtoallowregionstocreateandmodifynon-taxcontributionsbyregions,andtoprovideequal
       A
   treatmentamonglocal governments(Congress has approvedit in the first vote, but needs a second approvalin the next
   congressionalsession); and
   (ii) SectoralDecentralizationLaws, such as for educationand health.

   Inaddition, the following regulationsandlawswillbeissuedby theendof2004 or early2005:
   (iii) LawoftheExecutivePower;

43. The Government has signaled its commitment and determination to maintain policy
consistency since the approval of DECSAL Iwith the three guiding principles of the Peiuvian
decentralization model. The principle of fiscal neutrality in relation to the newly formed
regions has been maintainedinthe budget approved for 2004, the budget bill submitted for 2
and inbudget execution so far in2004. The issuance of the Law of FiscalDecentralization early
in2004 andthe proposedregulations for the revampedLaw of FiscalResponsibility andthe Law
on Accreditation of regional and local governments are designed to keep an adequate balance
between fiscal transfers and expenditure responsibilities in parallel with reinforcing the
restrictions onborrowing and strengtheningmanagementcapacity for service delivery at regional
andlocallevels of government.
44. Likewise, with the principle of a gradual decentralization, the Government has opted to
consolidate - rather than expand at an acceleratedpace - the transfer of service responsibilities
during the present year. While this implies a slowdown in the Government's decentralization
calendar, the consolidation is prudent given the need to further strengthen regional and local
managementcapacity before decentralizing complex social or infrastructure functions, adding to
the already significant responsibilities transferred to regional and local governments. The
Government's consolidation efforts during 2004 have included strengthening common
accounting, budgeting and reporting standards and improving asset and human resource
management at the three mainlevels of government. Inparticular, the Contuduriu General de la
Nucidn is regularly collecting, cleaning, and analyzing, in harmony with the MEF-SIAF system,
financial statements and budget execution by more than 97% of Peruvian municipalities. The
Law of Accreditation that was recently issued seeks to further reinforce phases in
decentralization following capacity building, and will be strengthened by management
agreements between different levels of government. A recently concluded joint MEF-World
Bank in-depth study of 43 municipalities documented weaknesses in, and called for
strengtheningof, municipal accounting andreporting systems.
45. The Government's competitiveness agenda aims to enable and strengthen new regional
governments to act as catalysts in regional economic development and to address key
bottlenecks. Implementation of the Government's decentralization reform program has followed
the principle of enhancement of regional competitiveness. Competitiveness promotion was
included among four long-term national policy priorities in the Acuerdo Nacional signed in July
2002 by leading political parties and civil society representatives. In 2003 the Government
initiated the Foro de Competitividad to bring together public, private and academic sectors to
discuss key obstacles to productivity growth and competitiveness. The dialogue culminated in
November 2003 with the articulation of 10 key guidelines for the formulation of a National
Competitiveness             Competitiveness promotion continues to occupy a prominent role in
government policy.      In February 2004, the Government outlined to Congress a two-year

development.  F

the ten themes or guidelines already identifiedwith strongemphasis on the regions. The work of
these groups will build upon diagnostic work and recommendations from the Foro de
Competitividudandculminate inthe formulation in2005 of specific programs andmeasureswith
short or medium-term impact, together with a longer-term competitiveness strategy. Yet the
Government is not waiting for the outcome of those groups and, as described here, has already
startedto implement significant reforms and initiatives to improve competitiveness.

1. DECENTRALIZATIONAND FISCALSUSTAINABILITY

47. Progress on the Government's related decentralization program has been broadly positive in
the areas of fiscal consolidation and decentralization. A central element of this Programmatic
Loan i s to support the Government's efforts in maintaining fiscal sustainability during the
transition to a more decentralized state. Moreover, keeping decentralization fiscally neutral is
one of the dominant principles of the Government's reform program. Fiscal decentralization has
proceeded in a gradual manner rooted in a sound legal framework, without creating additional
fiscal pressures. Peru has followed a one-to-one rule by which any new resource transfer to a
regional and local government should be accompanied by a corresponding cut at the central
level. This rule has helped to protect fiscal sustainability and has not distorted vertical fiscal
balances.
48. Five areas for reform are being supportedunder the decentralization and fiscal sustainability
theme of the DECSAL program. These include: 1. Tax Policy and Administration; 2. Fiscal
Transfers; 3. Regional and Local Borrowing and Financial Management; 4. Legal and
Regulatory Framework for the Consolidation of Regional Jurisdictions; and 5. Expenditure
Managementand Planning.

1.1 TAXPOLICYANDADMINISTRATION
49. Diagnosis and Relevance: The government has reiterated its intention to further reduce the
fiscal deficit, from 1.8 percent of GDP in 2003, to 1.4 percent in 2004, to 1percent in 2005, and
to less than 1percent in the following years, in line with the revamped LRTF." Increasing tax
revenuehasbeen a key objective of the current administration's economic program in support of
fiscal consolidation. One of Peru's more important vulnerabilities is its highlevel of public debt
(47 percent of GDP and, more importantly, 269 percent of general government revenues). This
significantly limits the ability to pursue counter cyclical fiscal policy which, given the lack of
roomto cut current expenditures, affects public investment on infrastructure that could otherwise
strengthen competitiveness. Tax policy and administration reforms, therefore, remain critical
areas for governmentpolicy action.
50. Government Program and Progress under DECSAL I Under the DECSAL I, tax                       several
measures7 were introduced. These measures, in combination with strong GDP growth and
favorable exports prices, have supportedthe current fiscal consolidation. Tax measures included
increasesinthe VAT andexcise rates, a hike inthe personalincome tax rate, an introduction of a
financial transactions tax (FTT), abroadening of the base of the income tax, tariff reductions and
the elimination of corporate income tax exemptions. In parallel, tax administration measures


7. During late 2003, the Congress gave the Executive branch special powers to approve a set of tax reforms that
    were announcedinJuly of 2003.


                                                     19

were introduced to fight tax evasion. These measures included extending the coverage of the
VAT withholding schemes to imports and large taxpayers and strengthening supervision and
enforcement. These reform efforts have led to an improved tax ratietax revenue collection
rose to 13.3 percent of GDP in 2003 from 12.4 percent in 2002 (See Table 3). As a result, a
smallfiscal surpluswas achievedin2003 for the first time since 1998.
51. A number of tax exemptions have been eliminated since DECSAL I.Early in 2003 the
Government eliminated the zero rateof income tax for agricultural unitswith annual sales of less
than 50 UITs, or approximately US$50,000. Additionally, in 2004, a charge on future capital
gains from a second residence was approved, reducing the tax exemption on capital gains that
prevails inthe Peruvian system. Certain tax exemptions that expired at the end of 2002 and 2003
were also extended in 2004. However, new tax exemptions have been introduced this year-
including a broadening of tax exemptions linkedto printed materials and editing of books, the
reintroduction of the VAT exemption on inter-city transport, the introduction of a 20 percent
returnof the excise tax paidon diesel by inter-city transport's enterprises, andthe introduction of
a special tax rate of 4 percent on rice (although it is not based on value added and hence not
subject to credit, ithas an element of subsidy).

52. The Government has had difficulties in achieving progress in the elimination of sectoral and
regional tax exemptions-of which the elimination of sectoral tax exemptions was a trigger
under DECSAL I.The opportunity to comply with this action was missed as the special powers
grantedby Congress to the Executive elapsed before consensus was reached.* The Government
has subsequently had difficulties with congressional support for the elimination of these
exemptions. The potential fiscal cost of tax exemptions is estimated (by SUNAT) to be 2
percent of GDP, but in practice even the elimination of the most critical of them will probably
yield much lower results, due mainly to the informality of the Peruvian ec~nomy.~                       In addition,
much of the gains will need to be somehow compensated for through explicit subsidies or
increases in expenditures. Gains will be achieved principally through the elimination of
distortions and loopholes, as well as the reduction of evasion and the development of a more
solid tax system.



8.  In June 2003, the Executive submitted to Congress a group of bills which included one proposing a
    rationalization of tax incentives and exonerations, with a gradual reduction of both sectoral and regional tax
    expenditures(the last with the participation of the regional authorities) and the imposition of limits and general
    rules for the approval of new tax exceptions. However, this proposal was not approvedby Congress. Early in
    2004, the Ministry of Economy and Finance presented to the Executive cabinet for approval a proposal to
    implementelements of the earlier proposalwithin the tax faculties provided to the Executive by Congress. The
    proposalwas, however, rejectedby the cabinet.
 9. Apoyo Consultoriaestimates that the effective yield of a comprehensive elimination of tax expenditureswill be
    about half of the potential fiscal cost. See Apoyo Consultoria, Ana'lisis de las exoneraciones e incentivos
    tribiatariosy propuesta de estrategiapara su eliminacio'n,2003.


                                                         20

53. The Ministry of Economy and Finance has recognized that there is not adequate political
space to proceedwith a rationalization of tax expenditures. Nevertheless, MEFhas expressedits
determination to continue working with Congresstoward the early passage of legislation phasing
out exemptions in at least three regions. In 2003, two Amazon regions (Amazonas and San
Martin) requested the elimination of three regional tax exemptions in conjunction with a
commitment to provide additional transfers from the central government for infrastructure
expenditures in an amount equivalent to the eliminated tax expenditure costs (30 million soles
annually)."     The requests are pending approval in Congress. Moreover, the letter of intent
agreed with the IMF, released recently, mention the intention to               ` b . ..reinforce efsorts to improve
the eficiency and equity of the tax system by strengthening tax administration and eliminating
distortionary taxes; and phase out sectoral and regional tax exemptions to generate additional
resourcesneededfor theprovision of infrastructure and social services in the regions                    "."
54. Challenges under DECSAL II The proposed DECSAL I1 loan will support the
Government's tax reform objectives in two key areas: (i)               strengtheningthe tax bases of regional
and local governments or the associationbetween revenue sharing and tax collections in each
regionaljurisdiction; and (ii)      phasing out selected sectoral and regional tax exemptions. First, it
i s important to strengthenthe tax bases of regional and localgovernments, for decentralization to
be effective. The traditional dilemma of ensuring that the jurisdiction in which spending takes
place is the one that raises the revenue must be solved within the intergovernmental transfer
system. For Municipalities, DECSALI1supports strengtheningof cadastre and valuation for the
purposes of property taxation. The challenge for municipal taxation differs sharply from the
challenge at the regional level. Municipalities have potentially dynamic, yet largely under-
utilized, tax bases and need adequate incentives to mobilize their own tax revenues. The
Government's priority agenda with respect to municipal taxation i s to provide country-wide
support for updating and facilitating access to the real estate cadastre. To strengthen the
nationwide cadastresystems "Fondos de Apoyo a1Plan Catastral Distrital" will be introduced in
every provincialmunicipality during 2005-2006. This will be financed by a share of the property
tax collected in the districts. On the national level a "Sistema Naciond Zntegrado de Catastro"
has been createdthat will be connectedprogressively with the national register of property. The
objective is to have by 2011 a full functionally working national system of cadastre. Further
steps are necessary to increase the significance of property tax and to expand the cadastre
systems. A handful of innovative examples on how municipalities can increase their own
revenues already exist including independent tax collecting agencies, tax incentives and
outsourcing of the construction and maintenance of cadastre systems. The introduction of the
SIAF-GL cadastre module and the development of the SIAF collection module are first steps in
the right direction. One further possibility would be to introduce optional arrangementsbetween
territorial entities and SUNAT permitting the former to participate in administration of national
taxes. Some steps have been taken in this area. The Executive -based on authority grantedby
Congress - approved modifications to the legal framework for local government taxation to
facilitate improved tax collection and administration of sub-national entities.                **

10. The requests include the elimination of tax exceptions on the rate of the VAT on imports, fiscal credit and tax
     reimbursement on VAT operations with enterprises outside the region. But the requests did not include the
     other tax expenditures, more substantial in fiscal terms: the tax exception on VAT on internal operations and
     on the excise tax on oil derivatives, and on the lower rate on income tax.

55.     However, the Peruvian Constitution does not yet authorize regional level taxation
because it i s a unitary state inwhich the Congressexclusively exercisestax authority. Inview of
this constraint, tax management at the regional level can be accomplished by linking revenue
sharingwith both the revenue collected and the economic activity ineach region. The guiding
principle for revenue sharing ensures some connection between regional tax effort and regional
fiscal revenues. The Government intends to follow this approach as outlined in the proposed
Fiscal Decentralization Law. All regional governments that increasetheir collection will receive
half of the increase. Furthermore, new formed regions will receive 50 percent of national taxes
(VAT, excise and personal income taxes) collected in the region. It would also be desirable to
devolve some tax authority to regional levels rather than creating new tax bases. Moreover, the
Law authorizes SUNAT, the Peruvian national tax administration authority, to enter into
agreements with regional governments so that the latter can participate infiscalization and other
critical tax administration activities.
56. Second, it remains extremely important to rationalize tax exemptions in the future to
maintainfiscal sustainability. The current increaseintax revenuesreflects some non-permanent
elements. Despite the political difficulty of comprehensively phasing out tax exemptions,
DECSAL IIsupports two policy actions that can be included in the remainder of the program.
The first is a commitment by the executive administration not to present further initiatives for
sectoralor regional tax exemptions. This should not be interpreted as saying that inthe medium-
term the regional governments should not be assigned their own taxes or surcharges. On the
contrary, it should be recommendedthat they receive part of the tax revenues generated in their
localities (although not concentratedon natural resources as i s currently the case), and that they
have some discretionary power to modify the rates. This processshould be gradual [for instance,
following the Spanish approach established in the Ley Orgdnica de Finunciacio'n de Zas
Comunidudes Auto'nomas, especially articles 4, 10 and 113. Second, the budget distribution of
transfers should be clearly in favor of those regions and municipalities on which no tax
exemptions are present.

1.2 FISCAL   TRANSFERS
57. Diagnosisand Relevance:The golden rule for the Government's reform of fiscal transfers to
regional and municipal governments is to keep total public expenditure within current limits, in
line with the principle of fiscal neutrality. In addition, a clear medium-term picture of the
resourcesavailable to regional andlocal governments, including transfers and own tax revenues,
would benefit the investment climate by reducing uncertainties causedby rulechanges.
58. Government Program and Advances under DECSAL I: The Government has created four
specific categoriesof transfers to fundregional governments:

         0   Fifty percent of national taxes collected inthe newly authorized largeregions - if and
             when they are created through popular referendums that approve the merger of
             smaller territorial jurisdictions - will be transferred to those regional governments.
             Lima and El Callao are exempted from this transfer due to the high revenue potential
             from fee collections for public services. Since nearly 85% of total central government
             tax revenues are currently collected in Lima and El Callao, this new fiscal transfer
             should not seriously threatenthe principle of fiscal neutrality.




                                                  22

          0    Under the FONCOR, proceedsfrom the privatization or concessionof national assets
               located in the regions, funds will be transferred to the regions. The fund is
               supplemented30% of the revenuegeneratedby privatization or concessions.

          0   Twenty-five percent of royalties derived from oil, mining and other natural resources
               will be transferred to the regions. The Canon Law was reformed in 2004 to ensure
               better distribution across regions.

          0    Finally, the national government is committed to bridgingthe gap between regional
               government spending and income, within strict limits establishedby the LRTF. The
               law of fiscal decentralization (LFD), approved early this year, establishes that,
               together with the transfer of responsibilities to the regions, the required transfers of
              resources will be provided using estimates to be established by the Ministry of
               Economy and Finance in coordination with the CND. These direct transfers will
               constitute the bulk of the resources available for the regions in the first stages of
               decentralization. The LFDestablishes that only in a "second stage" could the newly
               formed regions be provided directly with the above-mentioned 50 percent of the tax
               revenues generated in the corresponding region linked to the VAT, excise taxes and
               personal income tax.13           For this second stage to start the regions should be
               consolidated (unification of two or more depurtumenfoos) and the laws on
               accreditations and incentives on the consolidation of regions should have been
               approved (as they have indeed been recently approved). It should be noted that the
               yearly planto transfer competencies, approved inMay 2004, does not create pressure
               for additional transfer nor does it affect current vertical fiscal balancesto a significant
               e~tent.'~
59. The inter-government fiscal transfer system that is emerging out of the above reforms
conforms with the guiding decentralization principles of fiscal neutrality, phased-in
decentralization and enhanced competitiveness at regional and local levels. Nonetheless, the
Government will still need to address the complementary risk of excessive withholding of
transfers that have been given as collateral of regional and local debt by the corresponding
jurisdiction. DECSAL 11supports corrections to these problems. Solutions include establishing
specific limitsto andmakingtransparentwithholding of transfers.
60. Challenges under DECSAL IZ Through modifications to the Municipal Tax and Canon
Law, the distribution of FONCOMUN and Canon to municipalities will be based on poverty, tax
efforts and investment priorities criteria, inter alia. Looking forward the government should
define the criteria for Canon distribution in natural resource exploited areas, located in one or
various jurisdictions. Finally, the DECSAL is supporting the set up of a formal system that will
allow the Bunco de la Nucidn have a framework that regulates lending and withholding policies;
and ceilings for loans directed to regional and local governments. The objective is to support
gradual transfer of resources that compensate the gap between own revenue and expenditure
needs and to ensure a resource flow to local and regional government that is in line with a
continuous service delivery.

~~    ~




 13. Currently, the local and regional governments receive 50 percent of the corporate income tax collected from
       the use of naturalresources, as well as half of the royalties on hydrocarbons. The project of law, approved by
       congress (but which the executive will probably revise), on mineral royalties establishes that almost all of its
       revenues will be transfer to regional and local governments.

1.3 REGIONALANDLOCAL        BORROWING     ANDFINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT
61. Diagnosis and Relevance: In contrast with other Latin American countries, Peru's
management of regional and local public finances has not adversely affected the country's
financial sector or macroeconomic stability. However, the Government will need to make a
more concerted effort to manage regional and local finances given that regional governments
have won the authority to contract debt. Additionally, there is evidence of excess floating and
contingency debt, and debt inarrears ina number of the largest municipalities. The Government
had already put in place, under DECSAL I,      substantial regulatory and legal protection against
excessive regional and local borrowing. Additional reforms to address moral hazard problems
and demandsfor bailouts are expectedinthe next two years.
62. Government Program and Progress under DECSAL Z:               Peru continues expanding and
consolidating SIAF - the country's integrated financial management system - which has been
gradually built up over the last eight years. The system currently covers approximately 800 of
the total of 1,828 district municipalities of the country with basic modules for accounting,
budgeting, commitments, disbursements and, for just 17 pilot municipalities, a special local tax
module. The SIAF is the most advanced nationwide system covering national and regional and
local governments in the entire LAC region and i s progressively controlling and improving the
quality of data. It is also expected to launch a municipal and regional debt module during2005-
2006 (see Annex VI).
63. Challengesunder DECSALZZ: The proposedDECSALI1loan will support the extensionof
SIAFto cover all regional andprovincial governments and95 percent or more of Peru's district
municipalities with existing accounting, budget and reporting modules. The proposed loan will
also support the extension of the tax module to a growing number of municipalities, and the
creation, piloting and replication of the planned municipal debt module. This module should
advance the information link that already connects the National Accounting Office with SIAF
information, and which will be gradually used by the Contruloriu General de la Reptiblicu. It
will also support the use of the SIAF system for the implementation of the recently approved
accreditation law.
64. During 2004, the Government continued preparing the ground for the orderly access of
regional andlocal governments to fresh investment resources. The Peruvian government intends
to proceed with extreme care and draw lessons from other countries' best practices, given that
access to investment finances has contributed to the derailment of decentralization processes in
other LAC countries. The Law of Public Credit, due to be approved shortly, introduced the
mechanism of credit rating agencies to measure indebtedness capacity.           As supported by
DECSAL I,    market-driven mechanisms that reduce moral hazard and transfer the risk of non-
payment to creditors will coexist with and complement the regulations and restrictions already
includedinthe Law of Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency and supplementary norms.
65. The Law of Fiscal Decentralization, and corresponding regulations issued in 2004, further
reinforce debt monitoring and control. The SIAF will soon introduce, in conjunction with the
National Accounting Office, a new module on municipal and regional debt that includes
reporting on floating and contingency debt. The new module links debt needs and debt situation
to municipal fiscal planning, budget, disbursement and commitments. The TAL-DECSAL has




                                                 24

supported strengthening of the SIAF to expand and deepen the system's coverage of
municipalities.
66.In 2004 the Government and the World Bank, with the support of the National Accounting
Office and the Banco de la Nacibn, completed a study on debt stock, debt flows and the debt
service capacity of Peruvian municipalities. The study included, for the first time inthe country,
estimatesof floating debt andcontingent liabilities.
67.Accounting standardsfor monitoring and control of local debt. The Contaduria General de
la Nacibn is aware of the needto keep on line, reliable fiscal and financial data for all Peruvian
municipalities. To this effect, the Contaduriais currently working in close cooperation with the
SIAF-GL to make use of the new SIAF module, geared to regularly producing and making
available on the SIAF web-page data on stock and flows of municipal debt, including floating
debt andcontingent liabilities. DECSAL11will support the design, piloting and extension of the
new municipal debt module in the SIAF-GL, together with uses of this module by the
ContaduriaGeneralde la Nacibn for purposesof Peru's CuentaPBblica.
68. Consistent with the recently approved Fiscal Decentralization Law, controls on accounting,
reporting, spending and borrowing by regional and local governments should be strengthened
and their administrative capacity improved. A legal framework that addresses these objectives,
with emphasis oncommon and rigorous accounting standards, will ensure that decentralization i s
implemented in a fiscally neutral manner. DECSAL I1 will support Government efforts to
strengthen the existing regulatory framework for regional and local borrowing. This operation
will specifically support: (i) requirements to include provisions on trust-guarantees within the
total debt subject to debt ratios (ceilings); (ii)
                                                inclusion of indirect or contingent debt, including
trusts andconcessioncontracts, within the forthcoming regulations of the LRTFand/or FDL;(iii)
the use of revenue transfers as collateral should be limited in order to reduce moral hazard; and
(iv) similarly, auniform debt concept for accounting, planning, budgeting andreportingpurposes
should be developedto ensure consistencyindebt reporting for the purposeof applying the strict
borrowing ceilings established by the LRTF, the LFD and the forthcoming Law on the Public
Debt System.

1.4    LEGAL     AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THE CONSOLIDATION OF REGIONAL
                                                     FOR
JURISDICTIONS
69. By mid-2004, a new phase of the decentralization process had started with the approval by
Congress of the Law on Incentives for Integration and Creation of Regional Jurisdictions (Law
No. 28274).      This Law has the objective of gradually reducing the number of regional
governments from the current 25 to between 9 and 12 starting 2005 and also to promote
economic integration. The decentralization process was initiated by converting the existing 25
departmentsinto regional governments, maintaining the old political-territorial division. Box 3
presents a description of the current multiple layers of regional-level government.            It is
anticipated that regional governments will be progressively replaced by the larger, recently
authorizedregions.
70. The new regions will be better placed to take advantage of economies of scale and promote
regional development projects.      This integration strategy has three distinctive features: (i)
integration is a voluntary decision which results from the merger of regional governments andi s
confirmed through popular referenda; (ii) process i s gradual, and starts with the formation of
                                             the



                                                 25

Juntas de Coordinacio'n Interregional, i.e. associations of two or more neighboring regional
governments, with the goal of fostering infrastructure investment; and (iii)             it includes financial
incentives for regional integration.
71. The Law is principally concernedwith fostering improved regional competitiveness. To this
effect, it introduces fiscal transfers and other incentives, mostly financial, that do not pose any
serious threat to the principle of fiscal neutrality. Most of the financial incentives envisioned
will require government (MEF) approval to becomeeffective. The mainsuch provision is for 50
percent generalrevenuesharingfor regions other than Lima andCallao. Since these two account
for more than 85 percent of total central government tax revenues, it does seem that the new
incentive transfer for the constitution of larger regions can be easily digested by the central
government before the new regionsenter into operation -which will not happenbefore 2007.

72. The proposed DECSAL I1operation, in its decentralization component, seeks to support the
streamlining of the legal framework for macro-regions to create incentives and send the
necessary fiscal responsibility, expenditure efficiency and cost-benefit signals to participating
regional governments. Regulations issued in accordance with the law should contribute to: (i)
better focusing and phasing in incentives; (ii)       introducing proper monitoring and evaluation
systems to condition new transfers and incentives to goals intended by the law; and (iii)               ensuring
compatibility of transfers and incentives with the existing legal and institutional framework,
including medium-term fiscal planning, LRTF, FDL, regional and local borrowing laws, tax
laws, the national investment system, the SIAF, the Accreditation Law and monitoring,
evaluation andcontrol rules.

1.5     EXPENDITURE       MANAGElMENT AND PLANNING
73.Diugnosis and Relevance: The Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance, MEF," is
committed to developing aManagementControl andEvaluation System (referred to below as the
M&E system) geared to enhancing the quality of public expenditures through improving the
quality of government programs and of information needed to take budget decisions. The
proposed system i s intended to cover all levels of government expenditures. The Bank has
strongly recommendedthe adoption of the new system, as it has proven to be the most powerful
instrument to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of government programs at the central and
decentralized govemment levels.              Bank recommendations have been supported by best
international practice, including Chile and most OECD countries. To this effect, the Bank and
the MEF have jointly organized international seminars and study tours, with the support of the
Bank TAL-DECSAL (Institutional Capacity for SustainableFiscal Decentralization) project for
the designphaseof the new system. The Bankhas suggestedthe use of a SWAP as an instrument
intended to support the first, pilot phase of implementation of the new systemthat will consist of
desk and impact evaluation of some key government programs covering social andinfrastructure
sectors. Taken together, Bank support through the TAL, this programmatic DECSAL and the
SWAP under preparation should ensure proper policy adoption and initialimplementation of the
new system.
74.Challenges under DECSAL 11: MEF has had for some time an ex-ante evaluation system
for public investment projects at all levels of government, the SNIP. The MEFis now interested
in developing a supplementaryex-post M&Esystem. This new systemwill potentially apply to
all govemment spendingprograms and will include both current and capital expenditures. The
interest in developing a new M&E system is based on the MEF's responsibility for fiscal
sustainability and expenditure quality in the country - a responsibility that has become more
acute after the most recent decentralization of resources andresponsibilities. The President and
the entire cabinethave endorsedthis MEFinitiative andthe government has issuedguidelines for
launching the new system.
75.DECSAL IIfurther supports this initiative by ensuring that the Government does enact the
proposed policy and initiates the systematic collection and production of budget performance
indicators for all sectors and all levels of government. Budget performance indicators are an
essential input for the new MEF M & E system. However, a system capable of using and
demandingimprovement of those indicators will also needto be established. Support for a pilot
phase of such a system could be included in the SWAP instrument that has been recommended
by the Bank.
76. The new M&E system will contribute to fiscal sustainability on two fronts: by ensuring the
country meets the macro-fiscal and financial targets of the Murco Mucroecondmico Multiunuul
(MMM),andbyprotectingthe efficiency andeffectivenessof public expenditure through closely
linking budget amounts with results. These two fronts are inseparable and mutually dependent
since fiscal sustainability cannot be guaranteedunless a certain minimumlevelof public services
i s provided on a regular basis. Additionally, fiscal sustainability requires that the new priorities
of the country can be financed and that the MEF finds the necessary fiscal space for these
investments, without threatening the sustainability of public finances. Creating the necessary


15. This initiative is currently being developed by two key units of the the MEF: the Direccidn General de Asuntos
      Econdmicos y Sociales and the Direccidn Nacionul de Presupuesto Pu'blico,DNPP.



                                                        27

fiscal space without disrupting ongoing priorities ordinarily implies raising the efficiency of
current government programs through evaluation, definition of sector and government priorities,
andalignment of objectives throughout government.
77. Peru i s not alone in pursuing improved monitoring and control of the quality of public
expenditures for purposes of budget formation and overall macro sustainability.           Similar
initiatives have been implemented to varying degrees in Australia, Canada, Chile, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Additionally, other LAC countries including Brazil, Colombia
and Mexico, are currently in the early phases of similar developments, either in the context of
multi-year planning and budgeting or as part of medium-term fiscal planning, including the
Medium-TermExpenditureFramework promotedby the World Bank.
78. The objectives of the new ex-post M&Esystem are: (i) enhancement andimproving
                                                              program
overall public sector management, (ii)     contributing to policy making, (iii)monitoring and
control; and (iv) to inform budgetdecisions. The four proposed objectives all aimto enhance the
effectiveness andefficiency of public expenditure.
79.It may require 5-8 years of uninterrupted government support to bring the system to full
maturity, after which point it will likely require ongoing expansion, adjustment and
improvement. Fortunately, Peru is not new to medium-term institutional development projects,
as demonstrated by the country's sustained commitment to developing STAF, an integrated
financial management system, over several political administrations. The first two steps toward
buildingPeru's centralized budget evaluation system for all levels of government expenditure
will be: (i)to begin developing budget performance management indicators and strategic
indicators during the next few years, and (ii)    to introduce pilot reorganization of government
expendituresinterms of governmentprograms.
80. DECSAL will support the design and initial implementation of the system. The DECSAL-
TAL is currently supporting the designof aninitial set of institutional performance management
indicators for projects and activities. This initialset will be supplementedinlater years by other
sector performance indicators until the country has developed indicators and data bases that
cover a substantial part of the administration. Indicators supported will be primarily input
(cost/product) ratios geared to strengthening resource allocation decisions at agency level and
providing cost-based standards for budget preparation purposes.            These indicators have
applications at national, regional and local levels. Beginning with DECSAL 11, the DECSAL
programmatic project will support the Government policy towards buildingan MEF-based M&E
system, with initial results defined in the program matrix of government commitments. Put
together, the two Bank projects, the DECSAL programmatic and the DECSAL-TAL,, combined
with the recommendedSWAP, appear to provide sufficient support to the efforts of the Peruvian
National Government to gradually consolidate a MEF-basedbudget processfocused on results.


2.       INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR DECENTRALIZATION

81. Three key elements to be addressed to secure the appropriate institutional capacity for
decentralization are: 1. Participatory Budgeting; 2. Accreditation; and 3. Civil Service Reform.
These three elements are central to institutionality, one of the key pillars of the government's
developmentpolicy, supportedby the CAS andits progressreport.



                                                  28

2.1     PARTICIPATORYBUDGETING
82. Diagnosis and Relevance:         Many countries have built participatory processes and
instruments into decentralization programsto maximize citizen ownership, increasetransparency
and improve the sustainability of regional and local policymaking. Civil society participation in
the planningandbudgeting processis a key participatory instrument being usedindecentralizing
developing countries. Participatory budgeting - pioneered in Brazil and elsewhere in the LAC
region - can help increase allocative efficiency by orienting expenditure towards local needs,
improving the quality and transparency of expenditure and generating greater local voice and
empowerment, while increasing support for decentralization.           However, poorly designed
participatory budgeting mechanisms can also end up supporting a range of fragmented, low-
quality and inefficient investments that are unsustainableand fail to reduce poverty. The risk of
such adverse outcomes i s enhancedif the process i s capturedby local elites or partisan interests.
This can lead to frustration for civil society participants and regional and local governments and
ultimately discredit the decentralization process.
83. Government Program and Progress under DECSAL I: Participatory budgeting reflects
Peru's emphasis on increased democratization as well as a strong participatory focus in the
decentralization program. Inthe 1990s, several local governments pioneered diverse forms of
participatory budgeting processes, which were integrated into the decentralization process.
Participatory budgeting has now become a key mechanism of the decentralization process-a
sign of hope for citizens that decentralization will be responsive to their needs. In 2003,
participatory budgeting exerciseswere successfully carried out inregional, provincialanddistrict
governments, as part of the 2004 budget formulationprocess. However, problems with the flow
of information, a top-down process and limited citizen involvement have curbed the potential
impact of participatory budgeting. The major challenges this year will be to mainstream these
initialefforts, avoid fueling unrealistic expectations and disseminate informationand strengthen
capacity for bothregional andlocal governments andcivil society.
 84. There has been substantial progress in advancing the legal framework and mainstreaming
participatory budgeting. The regulations of the Framework Law of Participatory Budgeting
 (Law No.28056) have been approved by Supreme Decree 171-2003-EF. These regulations
incorporate the inputsfrom an international workshop organizedby the project team for the MEF
to compile the international, national and local lessons learnedby representativesof central and
 regional and local governments, civil society and academia as well as national and international
 experts. The resultingsuggestions significantly enhancedthe quality of the regulations.
 85. In addition, another legal norm has been approved, specifying further details of the
 regulations.16 This norm establishes in more operational detail the stages and requirements of
 the participatory budgeting process, the linkages betweenparticipatory plans andbudgeting, and
 betweendifferent levels of government. The participatory budgeting processhas now startedfor
 the 2005 budget. Progress is taking place, but is still slow and many departments and
 municipalities are starting to fall behind in the schedule established by the legal framework.
 According to the MEF, all regions and more than 50 percent of municipalities largerthan 40,000
 inhabitants are preparing the FY05 budget based on participatory budgeting rules. In these
 municipalities, at least 10 percent of investment expenditures are expected to be allocated
 according to citizens' preferences. However, there are still quite unrealistic expectations about

                                                  29

the amount of funding available, the kind of projects to be funded and the respective roles of
civil society andregional and local governments. The government has launched multiple efforts
to increase awareness by disseminating information from MEF to regional and local
governments and capacity-building workshops which are showing initial results. The process is
being undertaken in a significant number of regional and local governments and the quality of
participation i s also improving. The Government will need to subsequently do more interms of
dissemination andfurther capacity-strengtheningfor such an ambitious process.
86. Challenges under DECSAL ZZ While the government has met the DECSAL Itriggers for
participatory budgeting, additional work is required beyond establishing a legal framework and
increasing the absolute number of participatory budgets. The challenge is twofold: expanding
substantially the number of regional and local governments undertaking this process and
enhancing significantly the quality of the process. In the medium-term, a major challenge will
be to improve the quality of the participatory budgeting process and its outcomes. It will be
important to enhance the flow of information between different levels of government and
between government and civil society. The government will need to make clearer the level of
resources that can be allocated through participatory budgeting, specific spending ceilings,
requiredprocedures and mandatedtime horizons. Many of these issues are specified inthe legal
framework but have not been sufficiently disseminated at the regional and local levels.
Therefore, greater information-sharing between the central government, regional and local
 governments and civil society is needed, along with specific capacity-strengthening measures.
The extensive legal framework at the national level will also need to be incorporated at the
 regional andlocal levels, accompaniedby capacity-building measures.Inparticular, the potential
 role of the Regional andLocalCoordination Councils (CCR and CCL) inparticipatory budgeting
 and monitoring of the process and investments, is not being taken advantage of and should be
 strengthened.
 87. The participatory budgeting process does pose the risk of financing low quality,
 unsustainable and non-transparentregional and local investments. In order to mitigate this risk
 the Government will need to improve the linkages between the participatory budgeting, SIAF
 and SNIP instruments. This calls for a greater streamliningof participatory budgeting andSNIP
 rules. The development of a special software program on participatory budgeting compatible
 with the SIAF and SNIP systems would alsobe useful.
 88. A further important challenge involves finding ways to expand the participation of civil
 society in regional and local policymaking and in its monitoring beyond budget formulation.
 Peru has in the past pioneeredseveral social accountability mechanismswhich havebecome best
 practice inLAC. The decentralization processoffers the opportunity to buildon lessons learned
 from these experiences. Prominent examples of such mechanisms include a national network of
 forums for public dialogue (Mesas de Coordinacidn de Lucha contra la Pobreza), the use of
 citizen scorecards and the participation of community groups in social fund projects and other
 social programs. It i s recommendedthat the government further institutionalize and mainstream
 such participatory practices at the regional and local levels. The government remains generally
 quite committed to participatory approaches and the MEF i s taking an unusually strong role in
 promoting greater citizen participation andexpanding citizen participation to other mechanisms.
 89. Participatory budgeting i s not only key for institutional capacity, but also for other program
 pillars as it combines two of the guiding principles of the decentralization process in Peru -
 participation and competitiveness. The process of participatory budgeting is closely linked to


                                                 30

regional and local competitiveness plans and institutions.         For example, the participatory
budgeting process includes an evaluation of the level, planor the strategy for regional and local
competitiveness. The competitiveness diagnosis, for example on the basis of the map of
potentialities and the multi-annualstrategic plan, offers an opportunity to influence regional and
local competitiveness initiatives and their financing. Participatory budgeting is designed to
enhance regional and local competitiveness, but for many regional and local governments, it is
not always clear exactly how the instrument can complement competitiveness objectives. It is
therefore important to strengthen the capacity of both regional and local governments and civil
society to identify appropriate projects that do not lead to fragmented expenditure, but are
integrated in a long-term strategic vision of how to improve competitiveness at the respective
level of government, especially at the regional level. Moreover, a few other issues related to
participatory budgeting can have an important impact on competitiveness objectives. These
include: (i)   the development and integration of productive chains at the regional level; (ii) the
support given to transportation infrastructure, such as assistance in the construction and
maintenanceof regional roads; and(iii) development andthe support of regional export plans
                                            the
andstrategies.

2.2      ACCREDITATION
90.Diagnosisand Relevance: The effective transfer of responsibilities andresourcesto regional
and local levels of government can be the most important challenge in designing and
implementing an effective decentralization model.           In designing inter-governmental fiscal
relations, and in particular the transfer system, the principles of subsidiarity, economies of scale
and of scope and institutional and fiscal capacity should be balanced. International experience
indicates that a strategy is neededto mitigate key risks such as (i) asymmetriesbetween assigned
responsibilities, revenues and expendituresthat could lead to potential duplication, inefficiencies
and fiscal deficits; (ii)   deterioration of service delivery; (iii) accountability due to a
                                                                   limited
mismatch between transferred responsibilities and resources; and (iv) politization of the transfer
process in which political interestsprevail over technical and fiscal criteria, therebyjeopardizing
the.sustainability of the decentralization process.
91. GovernmentProgram and Progress under DECSALI Peru has chosen an innovative path
for the transfer of responsibilities and resources. Regional and local governments will qualify
for transfers after having met certain accreditation criteria that validate the availability of
 sufficient management capacity to assume the transferred functions. The orderly nature of the
 accreditation and transfer system reflects a commitment to a gradual decentralization process -
 the first pillar of the Government of Peru's decentralization program. This gradual approachalso
 mitigates against potential risks to fiscal sustainability thereby reinforcing the second guiding
 principle of Peru's decentralization process - fiscal neutrality. The system also emphasizes the
 importance       of   competitiveness enhancement        thereby  reinforcing    the  Government
 decentralization program's thirdpillar - promotion of regional andlocalcompetitiveness.
 92.The government began by implementing a simplified provisional system for accreditation,
 given the absence of a pre-existing system. The system applies only to the decentralization of
 social programs-the      first stage of the transfer process. By July 2004, 67 provinces had been
 accredited for the transfer of food programs and 241 for the transfer of social infrastructure
 programs.




                                                    31

93. The Accreditation Law was approved by Congress in July 2004 after long delays. The law
establishesthe legal framework for accreditation across sectors, startingwith this year's transfer
plan. It reflects the consensus reached on numerous highly diverging issues. The law
understandsaccreditation as a processthat includes: the demandfor the transfer of resources; the
fulfillment of the accreditationrequirements;the accreditation itself; the transfer of functions and
resources; conflict resolution; and the possible signing of cooperation agreements between
parties. The Accreditation Law aims to certify the management capacity of regional and local
governments prior to the decentralization of sector responsibilities and revenues on the basis of
technical and transparent criteria and to create a management information system for
decentralized public management. To be accredited, both regional and local governments need
to fulfill certain sectoral, fiscal and management requirements. These include a number of
mainly institutional and administrative conditions requiring, for example, development pIans,
institutional development plans, participatory plans and budgets, and compliance with fiscal
transparency rules. These conditions are simplified for poor municipalities. The criteria for
elaborating management indicators are quite broad and weak, stretching from management
capacity to fiscal and economic management, competitiveness and transparency as well as
participation. While the law gives the CND a leading role in the design, execution and
monitoringof the accreditation process, the government may choose to outsource the evaluation
regarding the compliance with accreditation requirements. While there i s no link between the
law and management contracts or other specific M&E arrangements, the law foresees the
possibility of medium-term framework agreementsfor the transfer of resources.
94.Challengesunder DECSAL11. The Accreditation Law partiallymeets the 2004 triggers by
providing objective criteria for accreditation and by allowing for the possibility of assessment by
a non-government agency, albeit on a voluntary basis. The two triggers for establishing
objective criteria for SIAF verification and achieving public disclosure of accreditation
assessments, however, have not yet been met. These triggers will be achieved within the
regulations of the Accreditation Law to be approved by the end of 2004. Some relevant norms
will also be included inthe Budget Law.
95.DECSAL 11seeks to support the completion of the legal and regulatory framework for the
accreditation mechanism. Inthis regard, DECSAL11supports the issuance of regulations for the
public disclosure of accreditation assessments.
96.For greater transparency, public disclosure of the accreditation assessments should be made
obligatory (including, for example through MEF's Consultu Amiguble). This could include
publication of the requirements of the accreditation system and progress achieved by accredited
regional and local governments. The process of public disclosure of accreditation results could
be further strengthened through the issuance of a legal norm including either a ministerial
resolution or supremedecree.
97. DECSAL 11also supports supplementing the accreditation mechanism with management
 agreements - the Convenios de Cooperacidn (CdC) established in the Law, which should also
 include Convenios de Gesticin (CdG) or Convenios de Administrucio'n por Resultados (CAR) -
 that reinforce accreditation processandensure the efficiency and effectiveness of transfers
 98. A well-designed and implemented accreditation system for regional and local governments
 will be crucial not only for decentralization, but also for competitiveness, generating important
 synergies between the decentralization process and competitiveness objectives. The design of



                                                 32

appropriate indicators for accreditation canhelp establishpositive incentives to enhanceregional
and local competitiveness and spur economic growth. Accreditation should also be linked to
regional and local competitiveness plans and indicators. The accreditation process can also have
an important impact on the transfer of competitiveness programs to regions through the sighing
of management agreements with regional entities. Moreover, it should be brought in line with
the certification of private regional entities and the certification of subcontractors of regional
providers.

2.3     CIVIL SERVICE REFORM
99.Diagnosis and Relevance: Civil service reform, often considered one of the most difficult
reforms in public administration, i s even more complex when implemented in conjunction with
an ambitious decentralization program. Both reform programs aim to catalyze fundamental
changes in the role of the state. Objectives of civil service reform that is the goals of having a
professional, merit-based, efficient and modem civil service, have to reconciled with the reality
of limitedcapacity, shrinkingfiscal space andpoliticizationwithin the civil service.
100. GovernmentProgram and Progress under DECSAL I: Peru engaged in civil service
reform during the 1990s with the objective of containing the wage bill. However, the success of
these reforms has gradually eroded due to political pressures in the second half of the Fujimori
regime, resulting in further fragmentation of the service and resultant fiscal risks. The most
recent civil service census indicates that the total number of civil servants is well above the
baselinenumber at the outset of these reforms.
101. The current administration is now engaged in a major effort to reform the civil service
based on the lessons of earlier reform efforts. The current reform agenda aims not so much to
reduce the number of civil servants but rather to catalyze structural changes and improved
performanceby re-engineering the role of the state. Fiscal control of the wage bill is a concern,
but a preliminaryfocus is now on establishing a broader legal and institutional framework for
civil service reform. This includes a revision of the extremely fragmented civil service regimes.
At the same time, reforms aim at designing and implementing mechanisms that allow the total
number of civil servants to be registered, including at the regional and local levels, and cross-
check some basic civil service data, including civil servants' identities and salaries. At the
regional and local levels, reforms aim at establishing competitive and transparent selection
processes for senior level civil servants and at enhancing their accountability towards regional
governments andthe central government.
102.    Significant progress has been made especially in the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
An automatic electronic transfer payment system (uhono en cuentu) has been developed and
expandedrapidly within the government apparatus. By September 2004,7 1percentof executing
unitsinPeruwere usingthis electronic transfer payment system, with information cross-checked,
and 1.1 million civil servants covered. System expansion in executing units in Ancash, Puno,
and La Libertad has encountered logistical problems including the availability of electronic
signatures andmissing national identity card numbers. These obstacles should be resolvedinthe
short-term.
103.    The government is also advancing on the design of the legal framework for the civil
service. Congress approved the General Law of Public Employment on January 28, 2004. Since
this i s a framework law, its passing constitutes a major advance in defining the legal and



                                                 33

institutional framework. Further civil service laws are now being developed, based on the
General Law, including the Law of the Civil Service Career, the Law of Public Servants, the
Civil Service Management Law and the Law of Incompatibilities and Responsibilities. These
laws have now been submitted to Congress. In most regions, greater transparency in civil
service is also demonstrated through the selection of sectoral regional directors using a
competitive and transparent process which has started being extended to other civil servants as
well.
104. As envisaged under DECSAL I, trigger restricting current expenditures by regional
                                           the
governments was planned to be included in the by-law for the LRTF. The LRTF, published in
February of 2003, limits General Government's (which includes regional governments) non-
financial expenditures to increase by 3 percent real. The limit on the increase of non-financial
expendituresby regional governmentswas later specified inthe LDFissuedinFebruary of 2004.
Article 29 of this Law indicates that the annual increase of non-financial expenditure (current
plus capital expenditure) should not exceed3 percent inreal terms. Since regional governments
have two years to adapt to these new fiscal rules, in strict sense, this trigger can only be verified
by end 2006.         Estimations of current expenditures by regional governments, adjusting by
transfers, are well in line with the 3 percent real growth, as of September of 2004. If this trend
continues, regional governments' expenditureswill remain moderate.
105.     Challengesunder DECSALZZ:         The passingof the legal and institutional framework for
civil service reform remains an important step toward institutional reform, particularly for
decentralization and fiscal management. These laws should promote a professional, merit-based
andclient-oriented civil service which streamlinesthe fragmentedexisting regimes, makingthem
fiscally sustainable, and ensures that the transparency and accountability of civil servants is
established.
106.     I t i s also recommendedthat the Government consider expanding the electronic transfer
payment system beyond the National Bank, which is currently the bankinginstitutionconnected
to the system. Currently more than 400,000 civil servants receive their payments through the
National Bank. It is recommendedthat the government work with the Association of Banks to
incorporate the other 17 banks in Peru into the system, so that an additional 500,000 accounts
can be connected. Since this procedure already exists for providers, it should technically be
feasible to do it within a short period. To further consolidate the electronic transfer systemit will
be critical to connect the 10percent of civil servants not currently in the national identity cards
database. An agreement between the MEF and the National Registry of Persons could facilitate
expansion of the system to the remaining 250, mostly remote, municipalities. For the current or
ensuing year it i s also advisable to include judicial payments and payments to third parties,
including providers and family members, within the electronic transfer payment system. The
unified payment system is expectedto be developed significantly. Finally, given the impact of
decentralization on civiI service reform, it is important that the government develop and
implement a plan ensuring an adequate transfer of human resources to regional and local
governments, includinga reduction incivil servants andcosts at the central level as civil servants
are transferred or recruited at regional and local levels.
 107.    Civil Service and Competitiveness: Controlling the wage bill and creating a more merit-
based, professional civil service will free additional resources for use in investment and
competitiveness promotion initiatives. It is therefore important that the emerging legal and
institutional framework promote and harmonize the following civil service and competitiveness


                                                 34

issues: (i)  incentives for greater competitiveness in civil service management and greater
openness to private sector promotion through the civil service; (ii)       linkages with the MIPE law
which establishes a special labor regime for micro and small enterprises; (iii) possibility of
                                                                                       the
introducing unemployment insurance; (iv) the extension of the special labor regime; (v)
improvement of the training regime to tailor it more to the needs of the private sector; and (vi)
the accreditation of international labor through special training centers.


3. COMPETITIVENESS

108.      The third pillar of the Government's decentralization reform program and second
component of the DECSAL program is the enhancement of Peru's overall competitiveness and
productivity position, focusing on five key themes: (i)agenda and institution-building for
competitiveness; (ii)   exports and trade facilitation; (iii) improving productivity and the mix and
quality of Peruvian products; (iv) reducing logistics costs and upgrading infrastructure services;
and(v) improvingthe investment climate.

3.1       COMPETITIVENESSAGENDA AND INSTITUTIONALITY
 109.     Diagnosis and Relevance: While the Peruvian economy is characterized by strong
overall growth performance and macroeconomic stability, it lags behind regional comparators in
key competitiveness indicators, including exports, technological innovation, productivity,
logistical costs and administrative barriers to business activity. In2003, Peru ranked 71'' of 80
countries in the Global Business Competitiveness Index rankings, falling from the 66thposition
in a comparable sample of countries in2Oo2.l7 Considerable variations in competitiveness also
exist between regions within Peru. The domestic economy has a sharply dual structure with a
relatively modern sector on the coastalplains andan isolated subsistence sector inthe interior.
 110. GovernmentProgramand Progress under DECSAL I Inrecent years, the Government
of Peru, under the stewardship of the office of the Prime Minister, has committed itself to
 developing a comprehensive competitiveness program at the national and regional levels.
 Evidence is that competitiveness was one the four key national policy priorities in the Acuerdo
NucionaE. A broad dialogue with public, private, non-government organizations and academic
 sectors, culminated in November 2003 with the articulation of ten key guidelines for the
 formulation of a National Competitiveness Plan.18 InFebruary 2004, the Government outlined
 to the Congress a two-year development program, with considerable emphasis on facilitating
 private investment andregional development.l9          An inter-ministerial and public-private National
 Competitive Council (CNC) was established in April 2002 to implement the competitiveness
 agenda.
 111. The development of the National Competitiveness Plan is a relevant instrument in the
 DECSAL Program. At the national level, the CNC, and in coordination with the relevant line
 ministries-which are part of the CNC- plans to establish working groups around each of the ten
 themes or guidelines already outlined.           The work of these groups will culminate in the
 formulation, in 2005, of specific programs and measures with short or medium-term impact,

together with a longer term competitiveness strategy. Yet, some of the line ministries, such as
MINCETUR and PRODUCE, have already began to advance the agenda and began developing
andimplementing programsto promoteregional competitiveness. An example are the Regional
Export plans.     Eight regional export plans have been published with a strong orientation
towards competitiveness promotion at the regional level. These planshave beendrafted inclose
collaboration between the regional governments, MINCETUR andthe private sector.
112.   Also, along with PROINVERSION, MINCETUR and PROMPYME,PROMPEX is also
well advanced in the establishment of multi-regional offices to promote increased exports,
improved product quality and enhancedthe variety of exporting goods. They will also facilitate
access of Peruvian SMEs to exporting productive chains and promote private investment in the
regions. So far, the north-west multi-regional office (providing services to Tumbes, Piura,
Lambayeque, La Libertad, Cajamarca, Amazonas and San Martin) is operating from Chiclayo;
and the center and south-west offices are about to open in Iquitos and Arequipa. Next year, the
south-east will also have an export promotion office operating.         Finally PRODUCE i s
aggressively advancing technological support to SMEs in the regions through the CITES'
program.
113.   Challengesunder DECSAL II The Government's overarching competitiveness agenda
has gained momentum during the period, but is not moving as quickly as expected. CNC must
strengthen its leadership and capacity inthe coming months, when it is due to receive increased
financial and staff support. In the short term the Government must finalize the National
Competitiveness Plan. The ability of Peru to improve its weak global competitiveness position
will depend on the implementation of the concrete government actions that will be specified in
the Plan.
 114.  The competitiveness agenda seeks to concurrently catalyze new, employment generating
economic activities in lagging regions, while facilitating further growth and productivity
enhancements for firms in leading economic regions. The Government should enable and
strengthennew regional governments to act as catalysts in regional economic development since
they are closer to beneficiaries and hence better able to track regional economic performance,
diagnose key barriers, consult the local private sector and subsequently implement targeted
reforms and investments to improve competitiveness. The Government may consider
strengtheningthe capacity of regional councils to participate in the competitiveness planning
process andto enhancethe CNC's ability to provide support inthis respect inclose collaboration
with the ConsejoNacional de Descentralizacibn.
 115.   An effort should also be made to integrate strategies and activities identified in the
Regional Export Plans into the legally mandated Regional Development Plans (Planes
 Concertudos de DesarroZZo Regional). These Plans - which often have competitiveness
promotion as one of their pillars - should be reviewed according to recent guidelines issued by
MEFto ensure quality standards and consistency. It will also be essential to focus the regional
competitiveness agenda and evaluate progress by defining key competitiveness indicators at the
regional level, which allow progress evaluation and benchmarking. Finally the Government
 should continue to de-concentrate competitiveness, investment and export assistance services to
 the regions to increase regional capacity to implement competitiveness plans and agendas.
 DECSAL IIwill support these efforts.

3.2     TRADEFACILITATIONANDEXPORTPROMOTION
116.    Diagnosis and Relevance: Trade liberalization and complementary economic reforms
have led to increased export performance over the past decade, as shown in Table 4. Exports
have continued to grow at a higher rate since 2000, reaching US$8,863 million in 2003, an
increase of 15.6 percent from the previous year. However, despite this relatively strong recent
export performance, Peru's export sector compares poorly with regional competitors. In2003,
exports representedonly 17 percent of GDP, the second lowest in Latin America and far below
Chile (34.6 percent), Mexico (29.6 percent), Colombia (23.2 percent) and Bolivia (21.9 percent).
Similarly, exports per-capitainPeruwere at approximately US$347 in2003, amongst the lowest
inthe LACregion. Incomparison, MexicoandChilehaveexportsper-capita levels ofUS$1,7 19
andUS$1,476 respectively (See Annex X).
117.     Peru's comparatively poor export performance is particularly surprising given the
country's robust potential intraditional and non-traditional sectors including mining, agriculture,
fisheries, agro-industry, andsome manufacturing andrelated sectors. Infact, exports inPeru are
concentrated in the low-growth and highly volatile traditional primary sector, with mining,
fishery, agriculture and petroleum products accounting for over 70 percent of all exports. In
2000, manufacturing exports representedonly 21 percent of total exports in Peru, far below the
average of 58 percent for the Latin American region. Nevertheless, this trend appears to be
changing. During the first half of 2004 non-traditional agricultural exports, such as fresh
products, like mandarins, asparagus (where Peru has become the leading exporter country) and
paprika, increased 29 percent while the traditional ones grew 17 percent, as shown in Table 5
below.

 118.    Peru's exports are also highly concentratedin a small number of firms and in a     ry few
international markets. Evidence suggests that not only has Peru been unable to exploit export
potential in sectors where it has a comparative advantage - including the fruits and vegetables,
textiles and apparel sectors - but also that exports are absorbed by modest number of trading
partners. Infact, the UnitedStates andthe EUremain Peru's largest trading partners, accounting
for over 50 percent of all exports. However, this is beginning to change as we see significant

recent increases in the number of exporting firms, exported products and new markets for non-
traditional exports.

119. A lack of adequate infrastructure and trade facilities in the regions increases costs for
regional exports as products have to be shipped through Lima.                        Table 6 shows that a
disproportionate volume of exportable production originating outside Lima is shipped through
the capital. Over 64 percent of all exports are channeled through the Lima Region, with only
modest amountsthrough other regions. Incontrast, only 35.5 percent of all Peruvianexports are
produced in the Lima Region. Apart from Lima-Callao, only the South-Western region of the
country exports a large proportion (71%) of its exportable products through facilities located in
the region (see Figure 6). The ability of regions to access and compete in export markets
depends considerably on parallel Government efforts to improve relevant infrastructure -roads,
ports andterminals-, andreduce logistics costs and administrative barriers.
120.     Difficult access to financial marketsremains a further constraint on firms participating in
the export sector. Despite recent structural changes inPeruvian markets, so far only a few large
exporters have access to working capital loans and other structured export finance products.
Nonetheless, such trends also seem to be changing. Recent data demonstrates that credit for
foreign trade has been growing since February 2004 and the use of cartas de crkdito has also
beenexpandingsince October 2003.

 121.    Government Program and Progress under DECSAL I Several actions have been
implemented to achieve the Government's trade facilitation and export promotion goal of
doubling current export levels. A series of market-friendly reforms, including the signing of


                                                      38

bilateral and multilateral agreements and other specific competitiveness-enhancing initiatives,
have been implemented, and others are being finalized. The institutional framework has been
revised: the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism (MINCETUR) was created and the
.Ministries of Industry and Fisheries were merged under a single Ministry of Production
 (PRODUCE). Similarly, agencies engaged in market research, privatization, concessions and
FDI promotion were merged into PROINVERSION. The Commission for the Promotion of
 Peruvian Exports (PROMPEX) within MINCETUR was strengthened and its functions were
 enhanced so as to better coordinate the different institutions engaged in export promotion and
 trade facilitation.
 122.     In 2002, the Government established a Multi-Sectoral Standing Commission, including
 principal private and public institutions to coordinate private and public export promotion
 initiatives.   In March 2003, the Government launched the National Strategic Exports Plan
 (PENX). This ambitious plancontains 20 distinct export promotion strategies and 108 specific
 measures to be implementedin 2003-13. PENX was formulated through consultation between
 public and private institutions engaged in trade promotion and includes four strategic pillars
 aimed at: (i)   developing a portfolio of high quality, value-added and diversified exportable
 products; (ii)  accessingtargetedforeign markets; (iii)strengthening the legal framework for trade
 promotion; and (iv) developing an export-oriented culture. A second phase of the PENX is
 currently underway with the objective of enhancing the export promotion strategy. The Plan
 Maestro de Facilitacidn de Comercio Exterior, launched in April 2004, focuses more acutely on
 operational strategiestargeting specific sectors, regions, and final markets. Key sectors included
 in the plan are textiles, jewelry, aquaculture and fisheries. These plans, prepared with the
 support of multilateral institutions, will require for their implementation the involvement of
 regional governmentsandchambers of commerce.

  123.     A key constraint to developing effective regional export strategies is the lack of adequate
  analytical work. A new department, Direccidn Nacional de Descentralizacidn de Comercio y
  Czdtura Exportudora, (DND) has been formed within MINCETUR to improve the quality of
  analysis that informs the government's trade and export strategies.           In March 2003, the



                                                   39

Government launched an initiative to increase and diversify the regional mix of exportable
products and prepare Regional Export Plans in close collaboration with regional governments
and the private sector. To date, eight regional export plans have published, for Cajamarca, La
Libertad, Lambayeque,Piura, Ancash, Arequipa, IcaandLoreto.
124.    The Government has recognized the need to further integrate regional governments'
export strategies to enable optimal coordination and the efficient use of resources. Six broad
areas, composed of severalregions, have been identifiedto coordinate export promotion efforts,
design promotion initiatives in accordance with the Trade Decentralization Plan and extend
support and training to implement a national export culture program. These areas will be
assistedby multi-regional offices. The success of these regional export promotioninitiatives will
depend upon effective coordination between local and regional governments, the private sector
and central government ministries and upon agencies including MINCETUR, PROMPEX,
PROMPYME and PROINVERSIONprovidingdecentralized assistance inimplementation.
125.    New export-oriented financial instruments have been launched by the Government,
targeting small and medium-sized firms with export potential. The SEPYMEX initiative, for
example, provides a US$50 million reserve fund allocated by MEF to COFTDE to cover 50
percent of the value of pre-export financing operations offered by commercial banks to export
businesses with firm purchase orders. Approximately US$9.5 million of the fund has been
assigned as of March 2004. A similar financial instrument, FIXr (Programa de Financiamiento
Integral para el Sector Exportador) had assigned US$155.9 million by March 2004, to
operations of foreign trade, investment andhuman capital. Banks have subsequently used these
resourcesto finance small and mediumexporters. Lastly, the Government has created a new risk
capital fund (Foado TransandinoPerd) endowed with US$15 million to support export oriented
small and medium firms.       Both PROMPYME and PCM, in collaboration with MEF, plan to
conduct studies to identify key bottlenecks which affect access to credit by small and medium-
sizedcompaniesto better informthe design of export-oriented financial instruments.
126.    Challenges under DECSAL 11 The Government i s planninga series of further actions
to improve overall andregional export performance. First, the Government aims to develop and
monitor an inventory of barriers to external trade to evaluate progress. Second, regional export
plans will need to be developed and implemented to enhance regional export performance.
Third, the multi-regional offices initiative should be resourced and extended to enable the
decentralization of export promotion, quality certification and customs services, with careful
identification of the institutional partners that will help guarantee their sustainability. At least
four new offices should start operation in the next twelve months with well defined targets.
Fourth, an evaluation of existing export financial instruments-COFIDE        for example-should
be performed to assess their effectiveness as part of an overarching approach to improve access
to export finance. Lastly, the Government would need to facilitate drawback recovery and
develop an integratedforeign trade informationsystem.


3.3     PRODUCTIONAND PRODUCTIVITYENHANCEMENT
127.    Diagnosis and Relevance:          The competitiveness of the Peruvian economy in
international markets requires improvements inthe mix and qualityof products, productivity and
overall productive innovation. It has been widely acceptedthat these factors are key bottlenecks
for the competitivenessof the Peruvian economy (see Annex E).



                                                  40

128.    Peruvian industries posses neither an awareness of the growing significance of quality
management nor the supportive quality infrastructure system necessary to access international
markets. A majority of domestic products do not comply with standards and technical norms
and, incontrast with many other countries, exporters are not driving the certification process in
Peru. As of December 2002 only 270 Peruvian enterprises have been awarded I S 0 9000
certification.20 Colombia andBrazil, incomparison have seven and 30 times as many I S 0 9000
certified firms respectively.         Peru lacks an integrated quality management and quality
infrastructure system and has neither a public nor a private institution to champion a quality
agenda.
129.    The international competitiveness of Peruvian products i s further constrained by an
inability to catalyze andmanage technological change andinnovation. Peru's overall technology
performance lags behind many Latin American and international competitors. According to
World Economic Forum2003 data, Peru ranks 7gthout of 102countries infirm-level technology
absorption and 67thin technological sophistication, trailing significant regional competitors
including Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico andBrazil?'
130.    The lack of significant public andprivate sector research anddevelopment investments i s
a key factor in Peru's poor innovation performance. While OECD countries spend between 1
percent and 4 percent of GNP on R&D and the averageR&D expenditure inLatin American and
Caribbean countries i s close to 0.6 percent, Peru invested only 0.11 percent of its GDP in
researchanddevelopment in2001. PeruvianR&D spendingis one of the lowest inthe region, as
shown in Table 7, close to Ecuador and well below Brazil (1.05 percent), Chile (0.56 percent)
and Costa Rica (0.35 percent). Approximately 65 percent of these efforts focused on basic
research while only 25 percent involvedproductive research.22 In addition, the share of private
sector investment i s also quite small, at around20 percent. The national systemfor innovation in
Peru is both highly fragmented and ineffective. In recent years R&D spending has not been
governed by clear strategic priorities or a results orientation. Public agencies engaged in R&D
have no incentives to orient their activities towards applied research or to respond more directly
to industry needs. Peruvian firms, industrial firms and university research centers also rarely
cooperateinR&Dventures.
131.    The lack of private sector collaboration in innovation is exacerbated by the weak
integration of productive chains, which would otherwise confer benefits in the form of
economies of scale, knowledge spillovers and joint learning through innovation, lower
transactioncosts, andforward andbackward supply linkages. Moreover, firms producing similar
or complementary products have weak links to industrial associations and rarely aggregate
effectively to reduce costs andincreaseproductivity.
132.    Finally, the scarcity of certified and skilledlabor is a constraint for achieving the desired
productivity increases. Over 60 percent of the workforce have not received formal occupational
training contributing to low levels of worker productivity in the country. The availability of
training services is not, however, the primary problem. The inferior quality, heterogeneity, poor

demand-responsiveness and asymmetrical information associated with training services are the
most urgent obstacles.

133.    GovernmentProgram and Progress under DECSALI: The Government hasdeveloped
a program, supported by the DECSAL project, for the promotion of product and productivity
enhancement focusing on several areas identified by prior studies as key obstacles to
productivity andeconomic activity.23 The government program is focused on four broad areas -
quality management, technology innovation, productive chain integration and labor force
development. A more detailed description of these issuedis provided inAnnex E.
 134.   a) Developing norms, standards and quality awareness. The Peruvian Government is
moving quickly to address critical gaps in technical norms issuance, revision and adoption - a
trigger for DECSAL 11. The Ministry of Production is implementing the Plan Nucionul de
NonnaZizaci6n Productiva, aimed at coordinating with INDECOPI the issuance of industrial
norms, the registration of institutions accredited to certify compliance and the mechanisms to
inspect their fulfillment inthe case of compulsory norms (Figure 7).

135.    The quality promotion agenda is beendevelopedto deepenawarenessof technical norms
and quality standardsthrough several programs includingExporta Perli, Compruleal Ped and
Denominaciones de Origen which provide a quality seal to enterprises that are able to meet
certain manufacturing and marketing standards.
136.     To strengthen the infrastructure for testing and quality certification, the current
Government program is moving along three lines: (i)         equipment upgrading of both SENASA
and DIGESA laboratories and modernization of procedures and performance evaluation; (ii)
creation of new laboratories and international accreditation of existing ones in sector oriented
Centers of Technological Innovation (CITES); and (iii)         technical assistance and training to
facilitate accreditation of private laboratories andcertification entities.

 137.    Further Challenges under DECSAL ZZ. Challengesfocus on three areas:

         0  Developing an integrated National Quality System by: coordinating information
            about norms issued at different instances; better delimiting the roles of SENASA and
            DIGESA; andcentralizing the Registry of accreditedinstitutions. The creation of the
            National Councilof Quality couldbe an importantstep inthis direction.

         0  Increasing awareness of the international importance of quality management by
            developing a quality culture andpromoting quality standardadoption among SMEs.
            Building testing and certification capacity, properly accredited according to
             international standards by: providing incentives for accreditation and quality service
            provision; developing a program for international mutualrecognition of accreditation
             entities; and collaborating with regional governments to ensure ample regional
             coverageof quality services.




                                                   43

  138.   b) Easing technological absorption and innovation. Technology support services in
  Peru are mostly provided by centers for technological innovation (Centroos de Znnovucidn
  Tecnoldgica, CITEs), which have ample regional coverage.24 Currently, there are twelve public
  andprivate CITEs operatingindifferent regions- Ica, Tacna, Ayacucho, Arequipa, Loreto, Lima
  and Pucallpa - mainly focused on specific sectors such as leather and shoes, agro-based
  industries, wood, textiles, machine tools, and vine production (see Figure 8). Four and a half
  years after the launching of this initiative, the portfolio of CITEs clients seems to be growing,
  some centers are in the process of expansion to accommodate more technologically advanced
  servicei and some are reaching a level of self-financing close to 40 percent. The medium-term
  government strategy is to expand, with the collaboration of regional and local authorities, the
  numberof CITEs operatedprivately or through public-private partnerships ineachregion.

'  139.   Further orientation towards innovation amongst public R&D agencies and collaboration
  between these entities and stakeholders in universities and the private sector is also required.
  The GoPhasrecently passedanew Science, Technology andInnovation Law to address multiple
   concerns inthis area. According to the newly approvedLaw, Ley Marc0 de Cienciu, Tecnokogah
   e Znnovucidn Tecaokdgicu, CONCYTEC will be in charge of the coordination of these efforts
   and the definition of strategic and systematic plans and programs to promote technology
   adoption andinnovation. Along these lines, a Program on Science and Technology is also being
   developed.     The program will provide financial incentives to institutions that demonstrate
   linkages andcounterpart fundingfrom the private sector for R&Dactivities.




   24. CITESare publicly-privately funded centers that provide technological support to firms in specific productive
        chains. They were institutionalized in Peru in 1999 by Law 27267. Typically, they offer technological
        services, testing and certification, technical training, knowledge dissenlination, and assistance in commercial
        and marketing strategies.


                                                              44

Figure 8: Decentralized CITE Network




140. Further Challengesunder DECSAL ZZ. The three mainchallenges may be summarized
as follows:

        0  Facilitating improved technological adaptation and innovation practices by:
           evaluating the performance of the ClTEs network; strengthening their capacities to
           provide more technical assistance and to conduct technological development and
           applied research; and identifying new initiatives at the regional level to fully exploit
           export potential.

        0  Increasing the effectiveness of public R&D by improving incentives for technology
           transfer from the public to the private sector and allocating additional public funds in
           programs that foster innovation in SMEs incollaboration with other actors.

        0  Implementing a coherent National Innovation System by developing the regulations
           for the new Law and enacting the complementary R&D Incentive Law with
           incentives that promote applied research, technology transfer and linkages among
           private and public institutions ininnovation.




                                                45

141.    c) Facilitating enhancedfirm collaborationand integration of productive chains. The
Government program to support SME association (Programa de Conglomerados) aims to
strengthen productive chains in target sectors and regions by coordinating activities across
business support agencies, identifying a lead public or private sector institution to champion
cluster promotion andestablishing transparentfunding mechanisms to develop linkages between
firms operating in the network. Additionally, PRODUCE is leading the National Suppliers
Program to promote the development and accreditation of suppliers to anchor firms. The
program aims to form local program centers in association with local chambers of commerce,
which will facilitate supply chain linkages between national large and medium-sized companies
and local SME suppliers. Suppliers receive technical assistance to improve management and
quality control practices.
142.    Further Challenges under DECSAL ZZ. So far, the programs have advanced in the
identification of targeted sectors and regions and in the general design of incentives with main
stakeholders. The key challenges are to achieve the coordination among the different ministerial
programs, as well as a quick progression towards identification of successful initiatives or
specific actions beyond diagnostics, aligning incentives so as to secure a strong response from
the private sector and implementing strategic competitiveness agreements with the regional
authorities.
143.    d) Zmproving human capital. The Government labor force skills development agenda
includes two programs, BonoPyme and BonoEmprende that specially target youth and the SME
sector. BonoPyme provides vouchers to small and medium enterprises which can be redeemed
for public or privately provided worker training courses while BonoEmprende provides training
to youth in small enterprisedevelopment. The Government is also engagedina series of reforms
to reduce informational asymmetries that affect workforce mobility.             In particular, an
institutional accreditation system for the Institutos Superiores Tecnoldgicos and Institutos
Superiores Pedagdgicos i s being implemented as well as a pilot certification system for textile
workers which will provide objective parameters to measure job competency in relation to
performance levels required by specific occupations.
144.    Further Challenges under DECSAL ZZ. The three principal challenges are to improve
the quality of public training services; to design training mechanisms to reach workers in the
informal sector or in targeted population groups; and facilitate better informed decisions on the
supply and demand side of the training services market. Regional governments, empowered
with local economic policy making functions, can be very effective in facilitating targeted
businesssupport or demand-driven labor force training programs.
145.    The specific actions supported under these loans and the triggers for the third
Programmatic Loan are listed in the Bank-Supported Government Decentralization and
CompetitivenessProgramMatrix inAnnex I.

3.4      LOGISTICSCOSTSAND DECENTRALIZEDINFRASTRUCTUREDEVELOPMENT
 146.    Logistics costs account for a large share of the total operating costs faced by Peruvian
firms. According to a 2001 survey, average logistics costs accounted for 27.8 percent of
Peruvian firms' revenue and 34.4 percent of their operating costs, far exceeding levels among
regional and international comparators (See Annex XI). The level and composition of logistics
costs in Peru points to deficiencies in transport infrastructure and services. Transport costs, of



                                                46

which 17.8 percent relate to port operations and 14 percent to roads and railways, account for
31.8 percent of all logistical costs. Other logistics costs include administrative procedures (20.5
percent), warehousing (9 percent) andinventories andfinancial costs (18.7 percent).
147.    The high cost of transportation - and its large share within logistics costs - reflects the
poor state of the country's transport infrastructure and services.             Indeed, inadequate
infrastructure was ranked among the most problematic factors for doing business in Peru in the
latest opinion survey of the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR). According to the same
survey, the quality of transport infrastructure in Peru ranks among the lowest in Latin America
and compares unfavorably with other countries in the APEC region. Peruvian firms also view
the quality of transport infrastructure as a factor that discourages Foreign Direct Investment
PI).
148.    Actions aimed at improving the quality of road and port infrastructure and related
services can have a large impact in reducing the logistics costs of Peruvian firms. Maritime
transport i s the most utilizedmethodof transportation for exports interms of value (73.5 percent)
andinterms of volume (97.5 percent). Onthe other hand, a survey conductedas part of arecent
study by the Bank indicated that 97 percent of all sales and nearly all exports, traveled by road
prior to air or maritime transport. Therefore, most of the actions identifiedrelate to port androad
infrastructure. The Government i s well aware of the problem and of the urgent need to improve
its infrastructure services.   As a consequence, it has launched an aggressive infrastructure
improvement programthroughprivate sectorparticipation.

3.4.1 Port InfrastructureandServices

149.    Diagnosis and Relevance: Despite reductions in port tariffs and higher levels of
efficiency in port operations in recent years, the performance of Peruvian ports remains poor by
international standards. The Global Competitiveness Report 2003-04 ranks Peru 84th in the
quality of maritime andfluvial port infrastructure, only above the landlocked countries of Bolivia
andParaguayinthe SouthAmerican region.
 150.   The poor performance of Peruvian ports is mainly the result of an investment deficit in
port facilities and equipment and regulatory deficiencies that result in higher costs for port
services. Peruvian ports are first-generation facilities with inadequate infrastructure for handling
the increasing level of containerized cargo. These deficiencies result in costs per container
between 30 percent and 70 percent higher than the world average. Port administration has been
controlled largely by a public entity, Empresa NacionaE de Puertos S A (ENAPU), which has
been unable to address problems of low investment and inefficiency in the sector.               The
disorganization and multiplicity of agents and regulatory entities involved in port operations
contributes to the increasedcost of maritime transport.
 151. The port of Calla0 handlesmost of the Peruvian cargo that i s mobilized by sea. Despite
 its importance, the efficiency and competitiveness of this port i s low compared to international
 standards and other ports in the region. The lack of gantry cranes i s a major impediment to
higher efficiency levels. Ships use their own cranes to load and unload containers resulting in
 turnaround rates of about 12 to 14 containers per hour, half of what couldbe unloadedby gantry
 cranes.




                                                  47

152.    Private investment has been delayed in anticipation of the enactment of the Ports Law.
Although the process of privatization of ENAPUwas formally initiatedin 1992 and concessions
for seven ports were opened in 1998 (Paita, Salaverry, Chimbote, Callao, General San Martin,
Matarani and Ilo), all port terminals, except Matarani, remain under public jurisdiction. As a
result, port infrastructure and associated logistical centers have not developed at the same pace
as inother countriesinthe region.
153.    The experience with the concession of the port of Matarani shows that improvements in
port services brought about by the introduction of greater efficiency in port operations and the
upgrading of facilities an&equipment have a large impact on the competitiveness of exporters. It
i s envisioned that the development of regional ports will improve the quality of services and
reduce the logistics costs of producers outside of Lima. Furthermore, the development of fluvial
ports in Iquitos, Yurimaguas and Pucallpa could also contribute to boost economic activity in
isolatedregions and facilitate trade along IIRSA's multimodalAmazon corridors.
154.    On the other hand, the establishment of logistics centers close to major gateways is
important as it serves as an engine for improving the competitiveness of exporters. The Callao
area, where the prime national port and airport are located, constitutes a clear opportunity to
develop a logistics center (ZAL-Zona de Actividudes Logisticus). The development of internal
multimodalterminals able to consolidate and transfer containers along the territory is also a tool
to spur regionaldevelopmentthrough the reduction of transportation and other logistics costs.
155.    Government Program and Advances under DECSAL I: The Government has made
significant advances in improving the policy framework for delivering more effective port
services. InMarch 2003, Congress approved the Ports Law. The Law constitutes an important
initial step as it achieved the separation of policy setting and operating functions that were
previously mixed under ENAPU, and set the conditions for private sector participation in the
sector. The Government program is based on the principles and guidelines established in this
Law and its regulations, and aims at consolidating port sector reform by improving planning
capacity and increasing private investment. The program is being carried out by the recently
createdNationalPort Authority (APN). The APN priorities are to give shape to the institutional
changes introduced by the reform; and consequently it has issued               the National Port
Development Plan (PNDP), which establishes technical parameters for port operations, and
defines specific modalities for the promotion of private sector participation and investment. On
the other hand, once they are in place, Regional Port Authorities (APRs) will elaborate and
execute development plans for individual ports and for those within the particular region under
their jurisdiction, where efforts are most neededto reducethe logistic costs of exports.
 156.   With respect to DECSAL Itriggers, consistent progress has been achieved in the sector
reform process, although at a slower pace than expected. The regulations of the Ports Law were
issued effectively, but the concession of ports has been delayed because the procedures
establishedby the regulations made approval from the PNDPa precondition for issuing any call
for bids for private participation in ports. Nonetheless, the GoP has demonstrated progress
towards implementing the institutional reforms set forth in the new Ports Law by issuing its
regulations, appointing the president and board members of the APN and issuing the PNDP.
This planwill later be complemented with regional plans and more specific strategies. The GoP
has also, through the container security initiative, secured compliance by its six main ports -
Callao, Paita, Salaverry, Chimbote, Ilo and Matarani (the ISPS code). Regardingthe feasibility
study for a modern logistics terminal in El Callao, terms of reference were prepared under the


                                                  48

guidelines establishedin the Trade Facilitation Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) and the study
is expectedto be completed during2005.
157.    Challenges under DECSAL11: The government needs to consolidate port sector reform
through the: (i)implementation of scheduledinstitutional reforms; and (ii) execution of other
                                                                             the
actions that can be carried out immediately to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the
port system and freight terminals. Withrespect to institutional reform measures, the GoP should
focus on strengthening the APN and increasing its resources, completing the PNDP, including
clear guidelines for policy and investment planning in the sector and effectively establishing
APRs. Other measures to enhance sector competitiveness that do not require previous approval
of the PNDP include promoting private participation and competition in the market for port
services, establishing a Logistic Activities Zone (ZAL) in the port of Callao and planning and
issuing regulations for the implementation of inner freight terminals.      The development of a
logistical center (ZAL) in Callao is also a critical priority for the sector. Therefore, the Bank
program will support the improvement on the policy and regulatory port framework, as means to
increase the quality of transport services and reduce logistics costs. Finally, the Government i s
planning an aggressive program for private participation in the provision of ports services in
Callao and inthe regional ports, as establishedinthe National Ports Development Plan.

3.4.2 RoadInfrastructure

158.    Diagnosis and Relevance: Despite important improvements in the last decade, the road
network in Peru remains in a deficient state. Only 13 percent of roads are paved, compared to
the South American average of 17 percent, and road density i s one of the lowest in South
America, only above the levels of 3olivia and Paraguay. Moreover, Peru is also one of the
countries with the fewest paved roads per million inhabitants (See Annex XI). Over 90 percent
of all cargo is mobilized on Peru's national pavedroad network, of which 77 percent is in either
mediocre or bad condition. Most regional networks, through which agricultural production
centers link to national roads, are also in mediocre or bad condition, which can diminish the
value of agricultural commodities at destination.
 159.   The poor state of the roads in Peru is mainly the result of insufficient investment in
construction and maintenance. The growing investment deficit has been exacerbatedby delays
in the execution of the road concession program and the overall reduced fiscal space of GoP.
Furthermore, funding for road maintenance is insufficient for the preservation of road assets due
to the lack of a coherent financing strategy, tariffs that do not reflect the true cost of road
maintenance and the possible evasion of tolls and diversion of toll revenues to cover emergency
and reconstruction expenditures. Additionally, the management of the regional road network is
being devolved to regional governments by the Ministry of Transport and Communications
 (MTC) without a clear delineation of responsibilities betweenregional government agencies, de-
concentratedpublic entities andMTC agencies.
 160.   The competitivenessof firms located inregions outsideLima dependsingreat part on the
quality of the road network connecting the capital and the port of Callao with the rest of the
country. Firms in the country's interior receive a large proportion of inputs from Lima and
Callao. Similarly, the Lima region accounts for on average 20 percent of all sales for firms in
other parts of the country. Given the low quality of the road network and ground transportation
 services, firms located outside Lima suffer losses from long travel times, product and input



                                                49

breakage and theft or spoilage during transport at twice the magnitude as those incurred by
comparators inLima.
161.   Targeted interventions in road infrastructure and adequate maintenance can enhance the
competitiveness of producers in the regions outside of Lima and promote economic integration
with neighboring countries. In this respect, projects such as the concession of IIRSA's North
and Central Amazon corridors are expected to have an impact on economic activity in border
regions through the promotion of commercial activities in their areas of influence and of greater
physical integration with Brazil.
162.    Government Program and Advances under DECSAL I: By the end of 2003, the
Government had outlined a pipeline of private participation projects inroad infrastructure. At the
same time, MTC presented an initial plan for devolving the transport planning and execution
functions to regional and local governments. The plan specified basic responsibilities and a list
of projects to be transferred to regional entities, established eligibility criteria for such entities
andoutlined programs for institutional strengthening. The transfer of ruralroad management to
local governments startedin2002 and will continue during 2004 and2005.
163.    The Government program seeks to capitalize on these advancesby continuing to promote
private sector participation in the sector and advancing in the decentralization of road asset
management. The current road concession program is underway and the GoP expects to award
five projects over the 2004-05 period. Projects in the pipeline include the concessions of Road
Networks 1,4 and 6, and of WSA's North and Central Amazon corridors inthe near term, and
other road networks - the Costa-Sierraproject, linking the coast with the sierra - in the medium
to long term. The Government has issued calls for bids and is undertaking the required
preparation activities for the three most advancedroad concessionprojects. The most advanced
project amongst these i s the concessionof the IIRSA North corridor and Road Network 6, which
the COPexpects to award before the end of 2004. Many of those projects are bound to have
significant environmental and social impacts, that need to be handled properly. The current
Peruvian safeguard framework needs to be strengthened andthe World Bank will be assisting in
that task through a project on a GuaranteeFacilitycurrently under preparation.
 164. On the other hand, the GoP is committed to the gradual transfer of road asset
management responsibilities to regional and local governments. Inthis respect, the Government
has established a Multi-sector Commission, consisting of representatives from the National
Decentralization Council (NDC), MEF, MTC, and the agency currently in charge of the regional
road network, PROVZAS Depurtumental (PVD), with the purpose of ensuring a smooth transfer
of functions. Additionally, regional governments have developed participatory regional road
plans.
 165.   Challenges under DECSAL 11: The main challenge consists of increasing capital
investment in the roads sector at both the National and Regional levels without sacrificing the
maintenanceof existing infrastructure assets. To face this challenge, it i s recommendedthat the
GoP deepens reforms in the sector by: (i)    strengthening road maintenance; (ii) a solid
                                                                                      creating
framework for the decentralized management of road assets; and (iii)strengthening its
environmental and social evaluation safeguards.
 166.   The current capital investment needs of the national road network are estimated at
US$2.7 billion. It i s estimated that given this amount and current budget allocations for capital
investment on the national road network, it would take about 16 years to fully upgrade it. As a


                                                 50

result, the development of the sector will require the leveraging of limited public resources
through private sector participation. However, even after successful completion of the road
concessions program, a substantial portion of the road network will remain under public
management. Therefore, it remains critical to work on improving road maintenance. Specific
efforts and reforms inthis area include: establishing a framework for the adequate programming
and funding of maintenance activities on the national network; reorienting the allocation of
expendituresto meet the rehabilitation needs of the regional network; andreducing the financing
gap in the sector by adjusting toll tariffs and optimizing revenue collection mechanisms.
Additionally, as regional governments assume greater responsibility for road management, the
GoP will need to further clarify the division of responsibilities between levels of government,
and strengthen the capacity of responsible regional and local institutions, with an emphasis on
private sector participation in road rehabilitation and maintenance activities.    The Bank is
currently preparing a project to assist the GoP in the execution of its road decentralization
process.

3.4.3   Decentralized Infrastructure Development

167.    Diagnosis and Relevance:       Investment has been concentrated historically in the
metropolitan region of Lima. In 2002, Lima accounted for more than 40 percent of total
investment and42 percent of private investment. Moreover, most of private investment outside
Lima is concentrated on the exploitation of extractive industries in a few areas of the country.
As a result, there has been a considerable deficit in the quantity and quality of infrastructure
services inthe regions, which has inturntranslatedinto further economic and social isolation.
168.    The availability of adequate infrastructure oriented towards the development of key
productive activities is fundamental for restoring the value of human and natural resources that
have not been fully utilized, enhancing competitiveness and creating regional economic and
social development synergies. Closing the infrastructure gap demands leveraging limitedpublic
resources by promoting the participation of the private sector in the provision of services and
ensuring that increased private investment translates into improved services for the targeted
populations.
169.    Government Program and Advances under DECSAL I: During 2003, the National
government signed agreements with regional governments for the promotion of private sector
participation in the provision of infrastructure services and carried out the studies required to
structure specific projects. InJune 2004, the NDC presentedthe NationalPlanfor Decentralized
Investment 2005-2014. The plan defines economic corridors and integration and development
hubs, on the basis of which decentralized investment in infrastructure will be planned and
executed.    Concurrently, the GoP has launched an ambitious concession program in
infrastructure services to support private investment in the regions. The concession of the
electricity generation project of Yuncan was carried out in 2004. The GoP has also started to
prepare concession projects including three packages of regional airports, starting with the
Northern ones; and the concession for water and sewerage services in two medium-size
municipalities: Tumbes and Piura. Finally, with the forthcoming concession of the Bambas and
Bayobar projects, the Government i s moving forward with a private participation program inthe
mining sector as well.




                                                51

170.    The GoP has requested assistance from the World Bank in supporting its efforts to
improve infrastructure services through the grantingof partial guarantees. As a result, the World
Bank is in the process of preparing a GuaranteeFacility Project to address that request. Inthat
context, the Banki s also assistingthe Government by strengthening the environmental and social
evaluation units of PROINVERSION, so as to comply with Bank standardsfor the areas where
support will be provided.
171.    Challenges under DECSAL ZZ:            The overall challenge i s to increase infrastructure
investment in the regions, as a means to improve the coverage and quality of services. Facing
this challenge will require: (i)  establishing a clear framework for the transfer of infrastructure
assets; and (ii)strengtheningregional governments' capacity to identify, formulate, regulate and
supervise infrastructure projects. The National Government should continue to prepare the
projects that are in the pipeline, provide the required assistance to regional governments in the
preparation and promotion of projects critical for regional development, account for
environmental and social impacts and ensure that safeguards are in place as well as implement
consultation and communications strategies to improve project design and ensure that projects
are not affected by social instability.

3.5     INVESTMENT CLIMATE: ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS AND CONTRACT
ENFORCEMENT
172.    There are many facets of the investment climate which can affect investment, growth and
job creation. These include infrastructure, technology adoption and supply chain integration, as
observedinearlier chapters. However, two areas that canhave large effects on transactions costs
- administrative barriers (Le. the level and application of regulation) and the efficiency of
contract enforcement mechanisms - are often overlooked. Aside from provision of public
infrastructure these are one of the most important areas of interaction between the public and
private sectors and are critical in determining the attractiveness of a given country or region for
investment, whether foreign or domestic.


3.5.1 Administrative Barriers
 173.   Diagnostic and relevance: The level and lack of transparency of re lations for the
private sector have been shown to have a negative relationship to firm growth.2911Thus efforts to
reduce red tape and increase transparency in public administration facilitate investment through
reducing transactions costs, barriers to entry and regulatory compliance costs, as well as
eliminating opportunities for corruption.       Increasingly it i s becoming clear that without a
reduction in complex and onerous business regulation it is much less likely that increasing trade
openness will lead to widespread growth. A recent study has shown that trade liberalization,
such as the free trade agreements that Peru is currently pursuing, may not result in economic
growth if the economy continues to be heavily regulated.26 All of this suggests a large and
critical agenda of reforms that are needed to take advantage of current opportunities and ensure
that the potential benefits are realizedby a large segment of the population.

174.      Complex, lengthy and redundant procedures imposed by a range of central and local
agencies pose significant costs to firms andreduce foreign investors' interest inPeru. Firms face
the most burdensome administrative processes during the start-up (securing registration and
permits) andsite-development (land, utilities and construction) phases of investments. Obtaining
an operating license in Peru from local municipalities is by far the most cumbersome process
duringregistration, accounting for over one third of the total time to register, or about 34 days.27
Micro-enterprises find the process particularly onerous, spending significantly more time than
other firms to obtain licenses. Perucompares unfavorably with regional and global competitors
with respect to business formation, far surpassing Thailand, China, Morocco and India both in
number of days and cost of registering a firm. It ranks amongst the worst performers in Latin
America.

among micro, small andmedium-sized enterprisesFigures 9 and lo). The most recent estimate
175.      Extensive red tape in Peru has been linked to high levels of informality, particularly

puts informality at over 60 percent of GDP in Peru, among the highest in Latin America.28
Given the current IGV tax rate of 19 percent, this level of informality is equivalent to 11.3
percentof GDPof taxes forgone by the government. Reducing informality to 30 percent of GDP
(a level similar to Mexico or the Dominican Republic) would increase tax collections by over 5
percent of GDP andhave largeeffects on public spending andthe needfor publicborrowing.

 176.     The secondimportant areaof regulation is that of public procurement. InPeruthe state is
by far the largest single buyer inthe domestic market (government purchases were equivalent to
US$5.6 billion in 2003) and i s especially important in many of the regional markets. Regional
and local governments will purchase an estimated $US1.35 billion in 2004. A large part of the
total procurement budget (an estimated40 percent) will be spent in small contracts (cumprus de
menor ~ u a n t i a ) .There have been reports of a lack of transparency in some of these contracts,
                                      ~ ~
particularly at the local and regional levels. Available evidence suggests that this lack of

transparency is particularly onerous for micro- and small firms.30              Many small firms that would
otherwise formalize, in order to have access to this market opportunity at the municipal level,
may not bother if they see the exercise as unlikely to lead to new contracts because they are not
transparently allocated.
177.     Finally, in a market economy it is critical to be able to efficiently close a firm as this can
reduce unnecessary costs and the wasteful use (or non-use) of scarce productive capacity. The
Ley Concursal governing the closure of firms was reformed several times between 1993 and
2001 in an effort to improve the bankruptcy processes.                     Many observers had noted that
INDECOPI's Comisidn de Pi-ocedimientos Concursales, in charge of bankruptcy declaration,
followed slow and cumbersome procedures and frequently took eight years or more to close a
business at a cost of more than US$50,000 per year, while INDECOPIrulings could be reversed
arbitrarily byjudges.
178.     Local-level simplification is even more important than central govemment reform for
regional competitiveness since the vast majority of complaints are about municipal level
regulati~n.~'Approximately two-thirds of all complaints have to do with taxes or fees that are
assessedby municipal governmentsand, as INDECOPI's numbers show, a large number of these
have no legal basis. This is symptomatic of municipalities struggling to increase their budgets,
but it is a shortsighted strategy and will have serious repercussions on regional development if
left unchecked.
179.     A few municipalities such a Piura have begun simplification projects to increase local
government efficiency and reduce costs. Infact, the Piura reform team estimates that they were
losing 3.5 million soles (approximately US $1 million) due to administrative costs being well
above service charges. Better service for residents and improved municipal finances can be a
powerful argument for reform. Regional governments implementing competitiveness strategies
might be well placed to convince and assist their municipalities to pursue such a strategy and
help channel available technical assistanceto reformers. Simplification can have large positive
fiscal effects, given that uncollected taxes are estimated at over 10 percent of GDP. To the
extent that simplification can facilitate the entry of currently informal activity into the formal
sector this will increasethe tax base andraise tax collection which inturn should allow for lower
tax rates, less governmentborrowingor both.
 180.    Government Program Advances under DECSAL I: The government program on
administrative barriers reduction includes a series of interrelated measures to simplify and
integrate the processing of administrative procedures, promote e-governance, improve public
procurement and strengthen INDECOPI's role in removing administrative barriers as well as
improve bankruptcy procedures through the new 2ey concursal. Several municipal governments
have begun to simplify and re-engineer their internal processes to reduce the time and costs of
registration and operation to make their areas more attractive investment destinations. At the
moment this is unconnectedwith central government programs.

 31.  In 2003, INDECOPI's Market Access Commission, reported that 74 percent of all cases involved onerous
      regulations at the municipal level, an additional 12percent involved regional governments andjust 14 percent
      involved the central government. The Commission found the municipal regulations in question were illegal or
      irrational in75 percent of these cases.

181. The Government has two major initiatives to increase transparency, improve public
procurement and reduce corruption and red tape. These include an integrated system for
government procurement - Sistemu Electronico de Adquisiciones y Contrutuciones del Estudo
(SEACE) - and a system for the reduction of administrative barriers to firm creation - Sistemu
de Infomzucidn y Monitoreo de Trdmites Administrutivos (SIMTA). Both systems will initially
use the existing integrated financial management system (SIAF) as a base to interconnect
municipalities across Peru, apply integrated procurement rules and make key forms and
requirements available on-line.         This can facilitate the use of common information already
contained in identification codes presently used in the system.32 However the program needs to
assure that this information is readily available to all systems and that the new forms reflect this
fact rather than continuing to ask for information that is already present inthe system.
182.    The government has been rolling out the integrated procurement system (SEACE) which
i s connected with the SIAF and allows regional and municipal government procurement to be
enteredinto the online systemandto be monitored for transparency inthe selectionprocess. The
Government will begin implementing the new system beginning with the small contracts
(comprus de menor cuuntiu). About 800 municipal governments will be connected to SIAF by
the endof 2004. The use of SEACE by local governments is expectedto be gradual, with about
20 regional andlocalentities usingitby the endof 2004.
183.    The Government has initiatedthe first stage of the Sistemu de Informucidn y Mopzitoreo
de TrcimitesAdministrutivos (SIMTA) which will serve as a one-stop electronic portal to access
information andprocess applications for a wide array of administrative procedures. Inthe initial
stage, the system will include 24 different procedures across six central government agencies.
The implementation planwas agreedinNovember 2003, the guidelines (Zineumientos)havebeen
issued. Meanwhile the core PCM team has been working with the SIAF team to design the
backbone of the integrated system and this has advanced considerably. The system is now able
to integrate information between entities such as SUNAT (taxes) and SUNARP and RENlEC
(registries), Customs, Social Security and the Ministry of Work and will be able to reduce the
amount of time and the redundancy of information requested in a number of transactions.
However, the first stage of the system is to put forms on-line to be downloaded for use. Key
forms of SUNAT andSUNARPwill be on-line by October 2004.
 184.    As part of its broader program to promote e-governance as a means to increase
transparency and reduce administrative barriers to firm growth, the Government is currently
developing a national strategy for the use of ICT in the public sector and a multi-sectoral
Commission for the Development of an Information Society (CODESI) is preparing an ICT
strategy and action plan to improve the regulatory framework for ICT. The government has
already put in place a framework to ensure a safe cyber-environment, including laws on the use
of electronic signatures, authentication andcertification mechanisms, electronic invoicing, cyber-
crime and privacy, and data protection. Now the government, with the help of CODESI, needs
to prepare and adopt regulations to makethese laws effective.
 185.    Outside the SIMTA process a number of municipalities have begun the process of
 simplification at the municipal level. Some, like Piura, have done this on their own, while
 others, such as the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima and some participating district


 32.  For example, it will now be possible to exchange information across many entities using the DNI (personal
      national identity number) or the RUC (single tax code).

municipalities, havejoined a program incollaboration with the Bank, FIAS, IFC's SME Facility
and PROINVERSION, still others are workingwith USAID'SCrecer project.
186.    Lastly, the Government program has been working to strengthen
bankruptcy agency and to control and reduce unnecessary red tape. The Government restored
INDECOPI's authority to remove irrational and illegal barriers to the private sector (see Annex
XI1for more details) and to deal with the deficiencies seen in the bankruptcy process. A new
bankruptcy law (Ley Concursal) was passed in 2002 and during 2003 new regulations were put
in place to streamline the process and reduce incentives and opportunities for abuse of the
system.
187.    ChalZenges under DECSALZ I The Government is now in a position to begin making
real progress toward increasing transparency and access in public procurement, reducing
administrative barriers and facilitating improved dispute resolution.               However, additional
reforms are required to consolidate gains and further improve the investment climate. For
example, despite the development of SIMTA, there does not seem to be a clear strategy to
persuade and assist municipal governments to diagnose and simplify local requirements. This is
critical since the current SIMTA reforms will not affect the municipal red tape that currently
accounts for over 30 percent of the total time to open a firm. It would be a desirable first step,
for example, to begin to routinely collect informationon time andcost of key businessregulatory
requirements across important municipalities in order to measure the size of the cost more
effectively as well as to have a baseline against which to measure progress. A strategy to
overcomethis lack of municipal engagement should include:
        Extending SIMTA to cover complete firm registration, including municipal forms in at
        least four municipalities by 2005 (two outside metropolitan Lima).
        Ensuringthat INDECOPI, in conjunction with other relevant institutions, publishes and
        annually monitors the time and cost of getting key registrations, permits or other
        requirements for the private sector (e.g., licencia defuncionamientu, registro de salud,
        us0 del suelo,pemziso de construccibn, etc.) for all municipalities.
        Creating an integrated program to channel technical assistance to municipalities that
        helps to improve administration of existing municipal sources of income (principally
        through modernizing the municipal tax cadastres and their administration) while, at the
        same time eliminating outdated and unnecessary bureaucratic procedures.                     Such a
        program      might      be    channeled     through       regional  governments       implementing
        competitiveness strategies as these may be best placed to convince and assist their
        municipalities to pursue such a strategy and help channel available technical assistanceto
        reformers.
        The current difficulties for poor municipalities causedby the requirement to publish all
        TUPA33(Text0 Unico de Procedimiento Administrutivu) in a national newspaper could
        be circumvented through a change in the law to allow municipalities to publish their
        TUPAs on awebpage (like INDECOPI's) or some other low-cost outlet.
        Finally, in the fight against creeping red tape, one deficiency noted with the current
        system is that INDECOPI has no review role in government regulation prior to

~




 33. The TUPA is a standardizedform detailing the requirementsand costs for eachadministrativeprocedurethat is
     requiredby law to be filled out and publishedby all public entities.


                                                       56

       publication.   Allowing INDECOPI to review economic regulations at the central
       government level (as COFEMER does inMexico) could be very useful.
188.   Lastly, while the changes to bankruptcy procedures have been accompaniedby a sharp
drop in the number of bankruptcies, this may have more to do with the end of a recession and
resumption of growth than actual improvements in the bankruptcy system. It i s too early to
evaluate whether the new procedures are working better than the old. However, such an
evaluation should be carried out inthe next year.

3.5.2  Contract Enforcement and Dispute Resolution

189.   Diagnostic and relevance: The ability of firms to enforce contracts rapidly and at
reasonablecost through judicial or alternative means i s a critical element in competitiveness, as
it reduces non-payment risk and facilitates increasedlevels of transactions. This is particularly
important when attempting to increase trade. However, contract enforcement in Peru is more
complex andburdensome thanin neighboring countries, even controlling for income level. Peru
ranks extremely low on the procedural complexity index, in contract-enforcement costs and in
the number of days taken to complete thejudicial resolution of a dispute (Doing Business, 2004).

190.    In Peru, judges are not specialized in commercial law. Numerous surveys and studies
have demonstrated that firms incur considerable costs as a result of inadequate contract
enforcementmechanisms. Approximately 85 percent of businessmenbelieve the judicial system
negatively affects the economy while 41 percent cite specific losses to their firms.34 Some
countries have created specialized commercial courts to deal with business-related disputes,
However, no such institutions exist in Peru. Commercial disputes are addressedby the 61 civil
courts in the country. A series of studies over the last five years has shown that a key problem
with the Peruvian court system is in the difficulties of enforcing ajudicial decision3' (see Figure


34. "El impact0 del Poder Judicial en las decisiones empresariales en el Peri," Documento de Trabajo, Instituto
     Apoyo, 1998.
35. See Hammergren(2002), Elena, Herrero and Henderson(2004).

11). Hammergren (2002) and World Bank (1997) both suggest that making the process more
automatic, allowing self-enforcement in the repossession of assets in more cases, improved
property and asset registries and additional work-out procedures for temporarily insolvent or
illiquiddebtors wouldbeuseful.
191.    Peru has sanctioned the use of arbitration and conciliation as dispute resolution
mechanisms and has established public and private centers to facilitate these processes.
Conciliation became obligatory prior to going to court in 1997, which led to an explosion of
cases in conciliation. However, strong doubts exist about the efficacy of obligatory conciliation
incases of businessdisputes, andtherehavebeencalls to removethis requirement from boththe
private sector and legal experts. Available statistics show that around 70 percent of all civil
cases entering the conciliation process fail to reach agreement, due in large part to the fact that
one or both parties fails to attend the conciliation. Such high levels of non-attendance suggests
that conciliation is not a highly effective measure in many disputes. However, Ministry of
Justice authorities do report highrates of success infamily disputes. These figures suggest that a
more thorough analysis of the success rates of conciliationof businessdisputes, not possible with
existing data, would be useful in considering how to improve the process and make it more
attractive to businesses.
192.    The arbitration system, in contrast to conciliation, is almost solely for business disputes
butis not widely used. For example, the LimaChamber of Commerce, one of the largestdispute
centers in the country, recorded an average of 131 cases a year from 1998-2003, and i s used
mainly by large firms, with the average dispute value at just over $900,000 in the same period
(see Figure 12). Experts in arbitration agree that the process as it i s currently offered in the
market i s overly formal and too costly for SMEs. However they also agree that wider use could
be achievedby employing a simplified and less costly processthat would be attractive to smaller
firms.
193.    To achieve this, it will be necessary to increase knowledge of arbitration as a binding
resolution mechanism. This will require a publicity campaign as well as increasedinstitutional
support such as greater training for judges and minimum accreditation of the arbitration
chambers.36 Similar support was given to conciliation processwhich has now expandedto cover
all regions of Peru whereas arbitration is supportedby only a few formal arbitration centers in
selectedregional capitals.
 194.   One way to reduceboth the number of disputes, as well as the time needed to adjudicate
them, is to improve the functioning and use of public registries to clarify property rights. While
the government has been working on improving registries for landtitles, the problem of titles for
movable property has remained unresolved. Registries for assets, particularly moveable assets
that can be used as collateral, are very importantfor developing and deepeningfinancial markets.
In Peru, moveable assets are estimated to make up two thirds of most firms capital
Therefore, if firms cannot use these assets as collateral, they have only one third of their assets
available to generate financing. Although these registries exist in Peru, as in much of Latin
America, they do not fulfill the role that they should because of the way that they function. In


 36. Arbitration agreements are legally binding and canbe subject to court enforcement if parties do not voluntarily
     comply with the ruling.

Peru, according to Cantuarias (2002) there are no less than 17 registries for different asset
categories. However, there are several problems with the current registry system as Cantuarias
points out. The registries were created under different laws (cddigo civil, cddigo de comercio,
ley general de industrias, to name a few) and each has separate rules and regulations. Most of
the registries are not interconnected, so a lender must search all possible registries before
accepting a moveable asset and there are no overarching laws to establish orders of precedence
between claims filed in different registries. The result is that valuable assets cannot be used as
collateral for much neededfinancing.
195.        Reforms in dispute resolution should have two main effects. Firstly, trade should be
increased if unknown parties are more willing to contract with each other because the
enforcement of dispute resolution is credible. Secondly, improved alternative disputeresolution
mechanisms andjudicial processes should reduce congestion inregional and local courts. From
a fiscal standpoint, these reforms should help expand the tax base and reduce expenditures on
courts over the medium-term.

 196.       Government Program Advances under DECSAL I The Government program includes
 efforts to create commercial courts and strengthen alternative commercial dispute resolution
 mechanisms. Commercial courts will be piloted in Lima in conjunction with improvedtraining
 for commercial judges and increasingly specialized courts, to improve the speed and quality of
judgments. At the same time the Government plans to provide more information on conciliation
 and arbitration mechanisms to the SME sector. Lastly, the government wants to pass a new
 registries law to improve registry management.
  197.      After studying the question of how to improvejudicial services for the private sector, the
 ComisibndeMagistrados issuedareport recommending the creation of commercial courts. This
 recommendation was considered and approved first by the Executive Council of the Judicial
 Branch (Consejo Ejecutivo del Poder Judicial) and finally by the full Supreme Court (Sala
 Plena), which then issued an administrative resolution creating the sub-specialty of commercial


                                                   59

law inaccordancewith power conferred on it by the Organic Law of Judiciary (Ley Orga'nic~del
Poder Judicial). Work is now underway to set up the first seven courtrooms, with one appellate
chamber in Lima.       Following the decision to increase information on alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms the government i s planningto launch a communications campaign that
will include basic information on services, performance data for each dispute resolution center
(conciliation or arbitration) and a series of conferences coordinated by the Ministry of Justice.
The governmenthas also initiatedwork on registries for movable assets andhas prepareda draft
law of registries (Anteproyectode Ley de Garantius). This law i s now inthe committee stage in
Congress.
198.    Challengesunder DECSAL ZZ: The Government has made progress toward launching
commercial courts, as recommended by the Comisidn de Magistrados, which should help to
reducethe time neededto resolve a case as well as enhance the quality of the service received by
firms. This experience needs to be monitored and expanded to jurisdictions outside of Lima.
The current planis to expandinLima andCallao over the next year basedon demand. However,
as a number of studies have pointed out, the key problem in Peru has been the lack of execution
of judicial decisions. This lack of execution has great negative effects on private contract
enforcement since firms have difficulty in gaining restitution even when they obtain a positive
decision. Therefore, enforcement should be made a central part of this reformprocess. This will
require, at least, simplification of the law and the legal process for enforcement, increasing
accountability of judges for seeing their decisions enforced, training of judges and a review of
the role of courts and police in the enforcement process. There are various proposals and
experiences, such as extending the ability for self-enforcement or through reform of certified
agents (e.g. bailiffsor private regulated enforcement) to ensure decisions are implemented.
 199.   Recently there have been reports of judges allowing cases that have been settled in
arbitration into their courts. Obviously such a practice defeats the purpose of arbitration. In
general, this practice appears to have occurred due to unfamiliarity with arbitration and a lack of
training amongthe judges. Giventhe effort that the Ministry of Justice is puttinginto expanding
the role of arbitration, it i s very important to ensure that the judges dealing with commercial
 cases receive trainingin alternative disputeresolution mechanismsas well.
 200.    Reform of moveable asset registries appears to be stuck in the committee stage in
 Congress and informed observers are critical of changes to the initial draft which they feel
 protect bureaucratic interests and may not lead to needed reforms. One of the main issues at
 stake is whether the registry will continue to be administered directly by the government
 (through SUNARP) or whether SUNARPwould maintainan oversight role while contracting out
 administration of the registry. The government needs to ensure a coherent integrated systemthat
 allows the identification of other claims, establishespriority of claims and facilitates rapid, low-
 cost registration, searches of claims and reclamation of assets by all parties, not only banks. An
 efficient, well functioning asset registry combined with streamlined debt collection procedures
 will transform credit markets inPeru and allow for new instruments that can reach smaller firms
 to be created. This in turn will free up a large fixed asset class (machinery and equipment) that
 currently is not eligible for collateralization for most borrowers, particularly small and medium-
 sized enterprises. These measures are summarizedbelow:

         0   Monitor progress and expand coverage of commercial courts outside Lima;




                                                    60

           Open dialog on improvements in enforcement and agree on measures to improve
           enforcement ofjudicial decisionsincommercial courts;
              crease training for judges with a focus on enforcement issues and alternative
           dispute resolution mechanisms; and
           Reform movable property registries to ensure a single, integrated on-line systemwith
           simple, low-cost registration andsearchcapabilities.

A. LinkswiththeBank's CountryAssistanceStrategy

201.   The central objective of the CAS i s the reduction of poverty. It states three key
mechanisms for achieving that objective: (i)     competitiveness and employment generation; (ii)
greater equity and socialjustice, includingaccess to health, education, culture andbasic services;
and (iii)creating a more efficient, transparent and decentralized state, with active private sector
and civil society participation.38 Accordingly, the CAS - as well as the CAS update under
preparation - call for greater emphasis in the areas of competitiveness and public sector
management. In line with the institutionality pillar of the government development policy, it
also proposesdeepeningpolicy dialogues on decentralization, fightingcorruption, and increasing
private participation in infrastructure, as well as expanding and a series of programmatic and
technical assistance loans. Thus there i s a clear rationale for the DECSAL project in pursuing
the CAS objective.


B. Linksto OtherBankOperations
202.    The proposedsecondDECSALloan fits into a seriesof Bankoperations that complement
the Government of Peru's decentralization and competitiveness reform program. The second
DECSAL loan i s complemented by the Institutional Capacity for Sustainable Fiscal
Decentralization and the Trade Facilitation and Productivity Improvement TALs. The Fiscal
Decentralization TAL aims to help the Government to: (i)         improve fiscal planning and the
monitoring capacity of regional and local governments; (ii)          enhance public expenditure
efficiency; and (iii)strengthen decentralized public investment and asset management capacity.
In parallel, the Trade Facilitation TAL is supporting the Government efforts to: (i) an develop
improved and effective policy framework for the promotion of non-traditional exports; (ii)
improve the quality of the infrastructure system; (iii) infrastructure and reduce logistics
                                                          improve
costs; and(iv) designandimplement programs for the integration of SMEs into the export sector.
203.    The Bank is also preparing a Guarantees Facility Project that will provide the
Government with an envelope of guarantee funds to be used for infrastructure project
concessions. The facility will provide guarantee funds to backstop Government payments for
projects where the Government is providing a financial contribution, and will strengthen the
environmental and social evaluation units and ensure that proper safeguards are in place. The
Facility closely complements the Government's regional competitiveness and development

agenda as it will be used to support critical regional'infrastructure, including regional airports,
north and central Amazonian road networks and municipal water and sanitation infrastructure.
Similarly, the Bank has begun to prepare a multi-sector SWAP in support of the pilot phase of
implementation of the new M& Esystembasedinthe MEF.
204.    In addition to these operations, the Bank is also supporting the Government
decentralization program in the social sectors through the complementary Programmatic Social
Reform Loans (PSRLs) and an Accountability for Decentralization in the Social Sectors TAL.
The operationsaimto improve andincrease:

        0    the anti-poverty focus of public social expenditure through reorienting Government
             spending on the poor, protecting priority social programs, targeting workfare
             programs, andreforming foodprograms andpensions;

        0    the access to quality of health andeducation services; and

        0    the participation andtransparency, includingthe establishmentof an M&E system.
205.    The PSRL IV currently under preparation closely complements the decentralization
objectives of the proposedDECSAL I1loan. It addresses the decentralization of social programs
in the context of their monitoring under the SIAF, the accreditation of provincial and district
governmentsfor the transfer of theseprograms andthe respectivemanagement contractsfor their
management.       It also addresses the decentralization of education and health, through the
elaboration of a legal framework, management contracts and sectoral management
improvements, such as teacher pay management.             Finally, it promotes participation and
transparency at the regional andlocal levels through strengthenedM&E.
206.     Inaddition, the Bankis also supportingthe strengtheningof the decentralization process
through two lending operations in the areas of rural development and governance.               The
Agricultural Research and Extension Project (LNCAGRO) strengthens and expands the
decentralized and private sector-led agricultural technology innovation system. The Justice
 Services Improvement technical assistanceloan, approvedinMarch 2004 and inits initialstages,
 seeks to enhance quality andtimeliness of thejudicial process in addition to improving access to
justice for the country's most economically and socially disadvantaged groups.
 207.    The Bank is also supporting infrastructure development in Lima and Calla0 through the
 LIMABUS investment operation. The loan will finance the development of a Bus RapidTransit
 (BRT) with the objective of improving mobility within the metropolitan area of Lima. In
 parallel, the Bank is currently providing technical assistance to the MetropolitanMunicipality of
 Lima to develop a city poverty strategy. The initiative aims to develop an integrated medium-
 term reform and investment strategy for the city. Innovative aspects of the program include
 technical cooperation with the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) to conduct a study
 on municipal-level administrative barriers and the development of a barriers reduction program
 within the municipality.
 208.    Finally, the operation responds to the recommendations made in key analytical work
 undertaken by the Bank, including the PER, the CPAR, the CFAA, the Investment Climate
 Assessment and the Social Sector Expenditure Review for Decentralization Study (currently
 underpreparation).

C. Co-FinancingArrangements

209.     The Bank has deepened partnership arrangementsestablished for the first programmatic
loan. As a result of the BankDonor Initiativefor Decentralization establishedlast year under the
First DECSAL and the corresponding interest of German Financial Cooperation to intensify its
engagementinsupporting the Peruvian decentralization process, KfW, the GermanDevelopment
Bank, plans to co-finance the proposed loan to the amount of 12 million Euros. After initial
coordination meetingsinWashington, KfWparticipatedinPre-Appraisal and Appraisal missions
and worked with the Bank and the GoP to develop agreed policy-matrix. Bank team members
have also presented the proposed program to the KfW decentralization network in Frankfurt.
The co-financing arrangement serves as an important step in improving donor-cooperation in
Peru. KfW is preparing a program evaluation report for the German government which will
makethe final decision on co-financing DECSAL 11. A financial agreement will subsequently
be signed between the GoP and KfW and the loan will be disbursed in a single tranche
concurrently with the Bank's disbursement. The Bank and KfW plan to continue with joint
program monitoring activities after the disbursements. The partnership with KfW serves as a
stronginitialstep to potential further donor cooperation inPeru.
210.     DECSAL serves as platform and instrument to achieve a coordinated, open policy
dialogue between government and donors. This strategy builds upon experience in other Latin
American countries in that coordination for decentralization creates win-win situations for all
parties involved. The Bolivia Programmatic Structural Adjustment Program (PSAC) may be
exemplary in this regard. Donor coordination will lead, in a gradual fashion, towards an agreed
 sectorpolicy framework for decentralization with a strong focus on results. The governmentwill
 gain by accessing additional resources, coordinated technical advice and reduced transaction
 costs as the Bank and KfW will use a common policy matrix andjoint monitoring and evaluation
 mechanisms. Ultimately, the Bank will gain through this by being able to scale up its leverage
 vis-a-vis the Government, inbothtechnical andfinancial terms.
 211.     In addition, the Bank has been working closely with other donors to advance the
 preparation of this loan, including JBIC, IADB, EU, DFlD and GTZ, as part of the donor
 decentralization group and other coordination mechanisms that helped refine the analysis of this
 document. A detailed matrix of donor-supported decentralization and competitiveness programs
 i s included inAnnex XIII.

 D. ProgramObjectives

 212.     OVERALL OBJECTIVE.        The proposed loan is closely tailored to key governments
 demands in decentralization and competitiveness. The Government's overall decentralization
 program is comprehensive and includes many areas for action. The objectives of the program
 are threefold: (i) fiscal sustainability during Peru's transition to a more decentralized
                    protect
 state; (ii)enhance expenditure efficiency and assist in the strengthening of management and
 fiscal capacity at regional and local levels for the progressive assumption of service
 responsibilities; and (iii) national and regional competitiveness through improved
                            support
 competitiveness planning, quality management, logistics costs reduction andexport promotion.
 213.     The first DECSAL loan stressed fiscal sustainability, establishing a new fiscal
 decentralization framework and ensuring a hard budget constraint alongside a series of related



                                                63

competitiveness measures. This second DECSAL loan reflects an expansion in the overall
program to include a heavier emphasis on supporting the Government of Peru's competitiveness
agenda. The loan will also move towards measures that enhance efficiency and quality inservice
delivery.
214.   The program hinges on significant policy making, legal reform and administrative actions
to: (i)improve budget accounting and reporting at all levels of government; (ii)          strengthen
monitoring and evaluation capacity, especially at the national level; (iii)  mobilize greater public
andprivate resources andparticipation; and (iv) enhance the efficiency and effectivenessof key
government institutions. Through a focus on results and a change in the incentives framework,
the loan aims to ensure the necessary structural changes that allow long-term sustainable
reforms. It is basedon a clearly focused approachthat targets those key reforms areas which are
most vulnerable at the early stage of the decentralization process and the competitiveness
reforms crucial at the start of the FTA negotiations. An incremental approach, based on careful
sequencing in line with key government principles, ensures the identification of the most
important entry points for sustainable reforms that promise visible anddurable results. Reforms
are based on the guiding principle of gradualism to ensure a careful transfer of responsibilities
and resources while avoiding duplication at different levels of government. Additionally,
reforms will also address the guiding principle of fiscal neutralityinthe decentralization process,
while enabling a focus on regional competitiveness. This sequencing strategy responds to
government demands and will also be reflected in a different mix of decentralization and
competitivenessreforms for the upcoming DECSAL IIIloan. Key fiscal and economic reforms
are combined with participatory approaches and change management that allow for greater
consensus andsustainability of these reforms.
215.   Finally, most reform objectives are being supported by the underlying fiscal and
competitivenessreforms inthe TALs andcanthus be supportedby a continuous and close policy
dialogue reinforcing the SAL reforms.
216.    SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES. proposedsecond DECSALLoan would support the following
                                 The
key aims of the overall Government'sreformprogram over the next year:
Decentralizationand Fiscal Sustainability
            Ensurefiscal sustainability inthe newly decentralized context;
            Expandthe tax base and strengthentax administrations;
            Finance regional and local governments in direct proportion to their abilities to
             dischargethe responsibilities they will assume;
            Ensurehardbudget constraints at regional andlocal levels by, among other measures,
             establishing a new regime for regional and local borrowing, enforce accounting
             standards for monitoring and control of local debt, and effectively apply sanctions
             when needed;
             Ensure gradual transfer for resources and responsibilities following a rigorous
             accreditation processof fiscal andmanagementcapacities; and
             Promote a centralized, ex-post monitoring and evaluation system to enhance the
             quality of public expenditure andfiscal sustainability at all levels of government.

         0 Reinforce budgeting, accounting and reporting standards at all levels of government
           for improvedmonitoring, evaluation andplanning;

         0 Institutionalize community andprivate sector participation and reinforce transparency
           inthe interest of democraticbenefits andhigher allocation efficiency; and

Competitivenessand Economic Growth
           Promotenational andregional competitivenessplanningandimplementation;
           Promote andfacilitate export development;
           Improve the quality and mix of Peruvian products, through comprehensive quality
            and innovation programs in collaboration with the private sector, and the integration
            of smalland medium-sized enterprisesinto export supply chains;
           Reduce logistics costs through improvedpolicy frameworks and service provision at
            ports andon the roadnetworks, as well as the facilitation of improvedtransit services;
            Improve the businessenvironment andinvestment climate; and
            Assist   the regions in developing capabilities to develop and implement
            competitiveness and investment programs and to strengthen the regional business
            environment. The Competitiveness Program i s designed so as to support further
            decentralization. Practically all of the program's actions and triggers for the DECSAL
            111 have strong decentralization components and effects, such as extending the
            SEACE and SlMTA to municipalities, placing CITESand laboratories inthe regions,
            requiring credit ratings for municipalities, issuing competitiveness indicators for
            regions, etc.
 217.    The proposedDECSAL I1LegalMatrix, triggers for the preparation of the DECSAL 111,
 as well as a comprehensive and rich set of indicators, both outcome and process, for the third
 loan are shown inAnnex Ibelow.

 E. Environment

 218.    As a structural adjustment program, the proposed operation does not trigger OP 4.01,
 and, as a consequence, does not require an environmental rating. OD 8.60 applies in order to
 ensure due diligence on the application of the `do not harm' principle.                In case that
 decentralization entails lower capacity at the regional and local levels to identify and mitigate
 environmental impacts of reforms, especially regarding resource management and oversight of
 investment projects, this capacity will be closely evaluated. The World Bank, through its
 Guarantee Facility Project, will assist to strengthen that capacity and the overall Peruvian
 safeguardframework.
 F. Procurement
 219.    Significant progress has been achieved in the design and development of a database for
 the advertisement of bidding opportunities, documents and other relevant related-procurement



                                                   65

information. Nonetheless, increased access to the webpage by more procuring entities for
advertisement purposes requires the expansion of the CONSUCODE Portal's current hardware
capacity. This initiative is part of the implementation of a e-Government procurement system
(SEACE) and will be assisted with funds from an IADB loan once the feasibility study is
completedby CONSUCODE and approvedby MEF. No additional progressi s foreseenuntilthe
full development and gradual implementation of SEACE achieved by a consulting firm by the
endof December2005.
220.    Approximately 884 public agencies (100percent of public entities mandatedto advertise)
are publishing their procurement plans through the internet. Approximately 262 public entities -
or 9 percent of 2850 agencies - are advertising procurement notices, bidding documents,
appointments of bidding committee members, evaluation report results, and contract awards.
This group using the internet may account for approximately 30 percent of the total public
investment inpublic contracting. As of July 1,2004, the advertisement of bidding opportunities
and procurement documents on the CONSUCODE web page became mandatory for all public
agencies.
221.     As per Ministerial Decree No. 142-2004-PCM, the Government will start implementing
shortly a procurement information system (Mcidulode Ejecucibn de Procesos),developedunder
SIAF with the capability to record procurement transactions and report progress in the
managementof biddingprocessesby public entities.
222.     A joint technical committee, made up of CGR and CONSUCODE staff, works on the
preparation of supervision standards and control in public procurement. Progress achieved to
date i s approximately 90 percent andcompletion of the manual is expectedin mid-August 2004,
 includingpublication inthe official newspaperand CONSUCODEweb-page.
 223.    Lastly, approximately 60 percent of national government institutions, 30 percent of
 regional government institutions and 10percent of local government institutions of will publish
 information regardingits procurementsprocessesthrough the CONSUCODE web-page.

 G. FinancialManagement

 224.    The Government has been committed to improving transparency and access to
 information, as well as promoting better governance and administration of public finances.
 225.    The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted in2001 concluded
 that the financial tools at the disposal of Congress and the executive branch included: (i)
                                                                                           robust
 financial administration legislation; (ii) highly dedicated staff; and (iii) effective integrated
                                                                           an
 financial managementsystem (SIAF).
 226.    SIAF was implemented in 1998 as a mandatory internet-based system for recording data
 related to expenditures and revenues for the national budget. SIAF i s a powerful repository of
 details on financial transactions.     At Central Government level, there are four modules:
 treasuryhdget execution, accounting, financial statements generation and debt management.
 Budget classifications are integrated into the chart of accounts and information generated is
 being utilizedby MEF and spending agencies. The implementation of the system has promoted
 effective control, optimum cash management and informed decision making. The SIAF is also
 used by some bank-financed projects, and financial reports, satisfactory to the Bank, are
 generateddirectly from the government's system.

227.   Major recommendations of the CFAA include: (i) effective oversight by Congress
                                                            more
of the budget process and review of the allocations of available funding; (ii)  more detailed and
frequent reporting on expenditures to Congress; and (iii) unfettered surveillance and reportingby
the Controller Generalof the acts andreports of the executive.
228.   Three indispensable elements of a sound fiduciary framework were built into the CAS
and policy framework for the PSRL II.These include: (i)           strengthening of congressional
oversight of the use of public funds; (ii) increased independence of the Controller General; and
(iii)expansionof the scope andcoverageof the integratedfinancial managementsystem SIAF.

CurrentStateofFinancialManagementReforms
229.    StrengthenedLegal Framework National Control Law No 27785 was approved on July
22, 2002.     It ensures functional autonomy of the Controller General's Office (CGR), in
accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The CGR i s now exercising ex-post control,
according to its legal mandate, over the finances of the Ministry of Defense and other security
services, and a special audit has beencarried out.
230.    Financial and Economic Reporting: MEF is regularly publishing on its web-site (Portal
de Transparencia Econdmica and Ventana Amigable), semi-annual reports on progress against
benchmarksof the Multi-AnnualMacro-Economic Framework, as well as monthly and quarterly
reports on budget execution and data on the timing and amount of transfers to the municipalities.
These reports are very comprehensive and easily accessible.          Monthly reports of budget
execution data have been publishedfor all central and decentralized government entities. The
extension of the SIAF-11to the Ministry of Defense and other civilian ministries has strengthened
the control environment. SIAF is implemented in 42 operating units of the central government
anddecentralizedagencies.
231. Municipal Governments:The development of the SIAF-GL for municipalgovernments is
being completed.       The budget execution module has been installed in 21 provincial
municipalities and at least 1,700 district municipalities.     Extensive user training has been
provided. Due to the absence of modems, the systems in some municipalities are not yet
functional.   These technical issues are being resolved. The original target for provincial
 municipalities was 100 and it is expectedthat the systems will be implemented in an additional
 38 provincial governments inthe second semester.
 232.   Financial Reporting: The National Accounts are comprehensive and include central,
 regional and local governments as well as state owned enterprises, quasi-state companies and the
 central bank. The accounts for the fiscal year ended 2002 have been prepared and submitted to
 the Controller General (CG) for auditing, inaccordance with the constitution.
 233.   Accounting Standards: The Accountant General's Office (AG) has played an important
 role in the region, participating in the translation and dissemination of the International Public
 Sector Accounting Standards in Spanish. The Strategic Planfor 2002-06 for the AG's Office is
 under implementation and focuses on: (i)       conforming local accounting standards with the
 International Accounting Standards issuedby the International Accounting Standards Board; (ii)
 improvement inthe quality of financial reporting; and (iii) in-depth analysis andevaluation
                                                             more
 of results. Given the momentum in decentralization, the AG has issued guidance to municipal
 governments to facilitate the transfer of accounting informationto the new municipal authorities.

234.   New RegulationsRequired to Implement and Support the National Control Law: During
2003,two important regulations were issuedto support the ControlLaw issuedthe previous year.
The first regulation institutionalizes the role and function of the internal auditor at all levels of
government (central, regional, local) and the second regulates the designation of eligibility of
private audit firms to perform financial and operations audits of public entities, including of the
procedures for registration, evaluation, designation, public competition and ex-post quality
controlby the CG.
235.   Risks:    Given the accelerated scheme of fiscal decentralization, careful consideration
should be given to detailed prioritization, sequencing andpermanent training on the use of SIAF,
both at central and municipal levels, to ensure on-going capacity for public financial
administration. Also, there is a needto ensure that the authorities with overall responsibility for
accounting, financial reporting and external control keep abreast of the decentralization effort
andhave adequate institutional arrangementsinplace to dischargetheir various roles.

Perspectives for FutureReforms under DECSALI1
236.   The MEF will continue the expansion of SIAF at the municipal-level in at least an
additional 30 major cities, 100 provincial municipalities and at least 90 percent of all
municipalities. In addition to the modules implemented during 2004, the debt management and
cadastralmodules will be rolledout.
237.    Inthe quarterly reportsonbudgetexecution, theMEFwillprovidesummaryinformation
on corrective actions taken to bring budget execution in line, as well as justifications for budget
reallocations and explanationsof spendingon expenditures.
238.    At the municipal level, the MEF will introduce performance indicators to track the
implementation of decentralized policies and include new modules for regional governments,
includingthose for electronic payroll, accounting, debt managementandrevenuecollection. The
MEFwill alsoinitiate thepilotphaseof impact evaluationfor key governmentprograms.
239.    Audit Arrangements.         Disbursement arrangements would follow the simplified
procedures for SALS/SECALs approved by the Boardon February 1, 1996. The Borrower will
open an account inPeru'sCentral Bank (Banco de la Reserva). Once the Bank formally notifies
the borrower that a tranche i s available for withdrawal, the borrower may submit a simplified
withdrawal application so that the proceeds of the tranche are deposited by the Bank in this
account for use in accordance with the Loan Agreement. Disbursements will not be linked to
specific purchases, and supporting evidence for disbursements is therefore not required. The
proceeds of the loan may not be used to finance expenditures typically excluded under the Loan
Agreement. Although a routine audit of the deposit account would not be required, the Bank
reserves the right to request that an audit be conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing, by an independent firm acceptable to the Bank. If requested, the audit
would be performedin accordancewith terms of reference(TORS)approvedby the Bank.


H. BenefitsandRisks
240.    Bene@.     The proposed loan would help reduce poverty by supporting the design and
implementation of a fiscally sustainable decentralization process and a competitiveness program
to supporteconomic growth and improved service-delivery.


                                                  68

241.    The decentralization component would help improve fiscal sustainability in the early
stages of the decentralization process by promoting fiscal consolidation and helping support the
institutional development neededto ensure the sustainability of the decentralization process. In
particular, the loan would help ensure compliance with macroeconomic targets by regional and
local governments, and ensure a hard budget constraint by supporting the design of the
decentralized revenue, expenditure and intergovernmental transfer framework for regional and
local governments, as well as helpingmonitor and control regional and local debt. It will also
promote institutional development by controlling the wage bill, supporting a framework for the
accreditation of regional andlocal governments andhelping to monitor andevaluateregional and
local investment towards a phased improvement of service delivery at regional and local levels.
In order to ensure greater sustainability of the decentralization process, the loan will also
promote participatory approachesandchange management mechanisms. The loan will thus help
establish appropriatefiscal and institutional incentives that promote competitiveness and growth
while protecting service-delivery at the regional andlocal levels.
242.     The Government's decentralization process will have the complementary benefits of
promoting broad-based and fiscally sustainable economic growth and improving the quality of
and access to government servicesby all citizens. These benefits, inturn, will contribute to the
long-term reduction of poverty inPeru. The proposed second DECSAL loan will help reinforce
anddeepen linkagesbetweenthe Government's decentralization andcompetitivenessprograms.
243.     Primarily, the loan will support the Government in further developing a coherent
framework for the implementation of decentralization, with a focus on the most appropriate
sequencing of actions, clearly defined responsibilities and the fiscal neutrality of the entire
process. More specifically, the proposedLoan will help to (i)    protect fiscal sustainability during
Peru's transition to a more decentralized state; (ii)enhance the quality of expenditure and
 strengthen management, fiscal and institutional capacity at regional and local levels for the
progressive assumption of service responsibilities; and (iii) the creation of a better
                                                                 support
 regulatory andinvestment environment for improvingPeru's competitiveness position.
 24.4.   Secondly, the loan will help accelerate Peru's economic growth by enhancing the
 competitiveness of regions, non-traditional economic sectors and firms. The second DECSAL
 loan aims to support Peru's overall competitiveness agenda by facilitating four key outcomes.
 First, the loan will help improve the quality of products and production practices, and to
 strengthen the overall portfolio and value of Peruvian products capable of competing in export
 markets. Second, under the program, the Government will aim to reduce currently onerous
 logistical cost for firms through an improvedpolicy framework for the provisionof infrastructure
 services which will facilitate increased investments, better management of road and port
 networks, and enhanced quality of logistics services. Third, the loan will support increased
 domestic and foreign private investment by improving the overall investment climate, reducing
 administrative barriers and enabling transparent contract enforcement. Fourth, the Government
 will aim through the program to increase exports by improving trade facilitation and export
 promotion services.
 245.    Overall, the program would promote increased growth and regional competitiveness, free
 additional resources for social sector investment and enhance the Government's capacity to
 effectively design and deliver public services in a way that should particularly benefit the poor
 and vulnerable.

246.    Risks. When the first DECSAL loan was discussed by the Board, three key risks were
identified: (i)economic and financial risks associated with the Government's program of
acceleratedreforms, from bothexternal andinternalsources; (ii)             Peru's vulnerability to external
interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations, stemming from its public debt composition and the
extensive dollarization of its financial sector;       and (iii)   political risks and typical institutional
coordination issues among the MEF,PCM, CNC and CND, which make it difficult to develop a
unified strategy for the implementation of the decentralization and competitiveness program.
Other relevant risks arise from the highconcentration of economic activity inthe primary sector,
which makes the country highly vulnerable to natural disasters, and also from the relatively
narrow export base (mostly dependent on commodities) since it increases the economy's
exposure to terms-of-trade shocks. While those risks remain valid, some steps have been taken
to mitigate them. Peru has shown an excellent macroeconomic management of its economy.
Medium-term prospects for Peru are good, interms of growth and macroeconomic stability. The
expected continuation of recent trends of very strong growth of non-traditional exports will
broaden the export base. Mega-projects such as the Camisea gas pipeline and Las Bambas
mining (copper and gold) project will contribute to sustaining growth in the coming years.
Production from the Camisea natural-gas project will begin by mid-2004 and will provide a
further boost to growth andtheexternal accounts.
247.    Additionally, the prospect of signing a free trade agreementwith the UnitedStates favors
further export growth and will boost investment climate as ATPDEA benefits become
permanent. An important step to help maintain fiscal sustainability in the medium-term i s the
plannedamendment of the Constitution to end the expensive Cedula Vivapublic sector pension
system. A second vote is required for amending the Constitution, which is planned before year-
end. Fiscal savings from the reform will be limited in the short-term. But in the long-mn
savings will be significant, at US$9 billion in NPV terms. In the meantime, a controversial
royalty on miningwas approved, affecting Peru's competitive position among mineralexporting
countries. Peru's Congress has approved a plan that would charge royalties varying from 1
percent to 3 percent on mining sales, but the project must be approved by the President to
become law. The royalty is strongly opposed by mining companies and other private sector
representativeswho arguedthat the royalty would discourageinvestment inthe sector.
248.    The country's main weaknesses include low support for President Toledo, isolated but
 growing regional unrest, continued low levels of public investment, and uncertainty surrounding
the 2006 presidentialelections, which is also promptingopposition leadersto put pressure on the
 government to increase expenditure. The President's approval ratings have been weakening
 throughout his administration amid political scandals.                 In addition, social demands and
 corruption cases have escalated in recent month?' and this could place additional pressure on
 weak public finances at a time when decentralization i s underway.                            The proposed
 decentralization reforms, includingthe formation of macro-regions and accreditation of regional


 39. Since taking office, the Toledo government has faced cycles of damaging political protest against some of its
     key policies. The Arequipa riots, in June 2002, were a response to efforts to privatize state-run energy
     companies in southern Peru. These demonstrationsresulted in virtual cessation of privatization in 2002 and
     2003. In 2003, the government faced similar protests by coca workers, which were only resolved after
     promises were made that went largely unfulfilled. The government also faced a damaging strike by teachers,
     which forced it to offer a wage increase. Social unrest continued in 2004 and escalated in April 2004, when
     the mayor of the small town of Ilave, in the department of Puno, was accused of corruption and killed by a
     crowd.

and local governments are politically sensitive.       The design and management of these
mechanismscould cause distortions infiscal andfunctional assignments at the regional andlocal
levels, with negative consequences for fiscal sustainability and the overall credibility of the
decentralization process. This exacerbates one of the most serious risks for DECSAL 11, which
i s the risk of the dominance of political over technical criteria, as the country moves towards
presidential elections. Greater pressures for expenditure, or even the possibility of bailouts of
regional and local governments or political favoritism in transferring assets or resources, could
seriously weakenthe fiscal sustainability of the decentralization process.
249.    Diverging views on the goals, instruments and methodologies of decentralization
between key actors at the central level could further limit the progress and sustainability of the
decentralization process. In a highly unequal society, such as Peru, opposition from vested
political or economic interest groups might also reduceprogram progress or, depending on social
movementsand the next administration, reverse some reforms. This is compounded by growing
support for the opposition, which is likely to take over the Congress, and a Presidency with low
and declining support. Substantial progress has been made with reforms, yet the remaining
agenda i s still long and the government faces important challenges ahead in implementing it.
Greater consensus between key decentralization actors at the central government level will be
neededto ensure greater sustainability of the decentralization process. This includes the needfor
a change management, including a communication strategy to address the unrealistic
expectations about decentralization shared by large parts of the population and many regional
andlocalgovernments. Reforms shouldraise the levelof transparency, includingat regional and
local levels of public administration.
250.     To its credit, the government has managed to implement difficult reforms while facing
political and social tension. However, moving ahead with structural reforms has consumed
considerableresourcesandpolitical capital, posing a serious threat to the investment climate.
251.     The Bank has been working very closely with different stakeholders to ensure program
progress and sustainability. These entities include the National Decentralization Council, the
Office of the Prime Minister, line ministries, Congress and regional and local governments. As
part of the first DECSAL, a close dialogue with civil society was established and has been
deepened under this loan preparation. Likewise, regularly meetings with private sector have
helped build greater support and consensus on needed reforms. In particular, the Bank has
worked with the government in a close dialogue to establish the necessary legal framework for
the program, including the fiscal decentralization law and its regulations, which are currently
being elaborated. The framework includes placing the necessary controls on regional and local
expenditure, transfers and debt to ensure fiscal sustainability. As the elections approach, and in
light of the emerging political pressuresto compromise fiscal discipline, the Bank is committed
to engage in a policy-dialogue that emphasizes the irreversibility of key decentralization and
competitiveness reforms under the DECSAL Program. The dialogue promotes the inclusion in
the legal framework of the necessary controls on regional andlocal debt and tax policy as well as
the design and implementation of mechanisms to minimize vulnerability to such pressures. In
 addition, international workshops have been organized on different parts of the program, such as
participatory budgeting and regional and local debt to advise the government on policy design
 andto generategreater consensus. Lastly, a close dialogue is beingheldwith other stakeholders,
 such as PCM, CND, Congress and other actors, including the private sector and civil society to




                                                 71

improve coordination. This will be further strengthened through change management as an
overall risk mitigation strategy, to reduceresistanceand enhance program sustainability.

I.InstitutionalCoordinationandPartnerships
252.     Given the multi-sectoral nature of both decentralization and competitiveness, the
Ministry of Economy andFinance has establishedcoordination mechanismsto improve effective
policymaking and implementation inthese areas. Indecentralization, the Ministry is engagedin
a dialogue with the National Decentralization Council, particularly on the question of
intergovernmental transfers, accreditation and regional competitiveness. For the multi-sector,
ex-post M & E, the MEF i s developing synergies between sector evaluation programs at other
ministries and the new, MEF-based, M&E. A close dialogue has been built up during the last
year with regional andlocal governments, which i s strongly supportedby capacity-strengthening
program implemented by MEF officials and other government and private actors, on budgeting
(including participatory budgeting), public investment, financial management, etc. Finally, the
MEFis collaborating actively with other key actors such as the PCMandCongresson important
initiatives for fiscal decentralization, administrative decentralization, civil service reform and
accreditation. Together with the TAL, this loan is supporting a series of change management
mechanisms to ensure greater consensus and greater support for reforms both at the central and
regional andlocallevels of government.
253.     The dialogue with civil society, established last year, has also been further expanded
under the preparation of this loan. Regular meetings are being heldwith representativesof civil
society and mission members, which have provided important suggestions on project design,
such as on intergovernmental transfers, accreditation, participatory budgeting, the SIAF and the
national public investment system.
254.     The loan complements a series of donor interventions that aim to assist the Government
inadvancingthe competitiveness agenda. Primarily, the IADBapproved aUS$300 millionloan
in December 2003 to support a series of competitiveness reforms, and has two technical
assistance loans in different stages of execution, supporting institutional building for
MINCETUR.         Similarly, USAID has approved two related technical assistance and grant
programs (CRECER andPRA) that aim to improve the legal andinstitutionalframework andthe
trade framework, and enhance infrastructure development and regulation.            A third parallel
investment by the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) is a hybrid budget support and
investment project that, amongst other components, will provide US$5 million to support TA
associatedwith the implementation of the Government's competitiveness strategy. CAFhas also
extendedtwo additional technical assistanceprograms focusing on cluster development and trade
facilitation. The EuropeanUnion has begun to preparea technical assistanceprogram for Peruin
the general area of competitiveness. Preparation of DECSAL LI includedextensive consultations
with the IADB, CAF, USAID, and EU to ensure adequate coordination and complementary
design.
255.     A detailed matrix of donor-supported decentralization and competitiveness programs is
includedinAnnex XIII.

J. Coordinationwith the IMF
256.    The World Bank andthe IMFhave engagedin an interactive and continuous dialogue on
the World Bank's country assistance implementation, as well on the subsequent programmatic
loans, Social Reforms Loans and Decentralization and Competitiveness Loan. The DECSAL 11
Program has been coordinated with the IMF at all stages. The dialogue has concentratedon the
macroeconomic background, setting of triggers, overall loan conditionality, and risks and
estimation of fiscal implications of Bank's operations. On issues related to decentralization, the
IMFhastaken the leadinassistinginthe designof tax reform, the Bankhastakenthe leadon the
design and implementation of decentralization of the social sectors and pro-poor spending
policies, and on the area of monitoring and evaluation of public expenditures. Joint work in
particular continues in the area of fiscal decentralization and competitiveness. The Bank has
contributed together with the Fund on drafting laws and regulations for fiscal decentralization.
In addition, ajoint IMF-World Bank-IADB mission has taken place in September 2004 for a
pilot study on Public Investment andFiscalPolicy.
257.    At the requestof the Peruvianauthorities, the IMFExecutiveBoardapproveda26-month
Stand-By Arrangement on June 9, 2004 (see Annex W),which the authorities are treating as
precautionary (Peru has not made any drawings under IMFarrangements since 1997 and intends
not to do so under this arrangement). The program for 2004-06 aims at consolidating
macroeconomic stability, fortifying confidence, and strengthening the basis for sustainable
growth and employment creation so as to reduce poverty. It focuses on the consistent
implementation of the authorities' inflation-targeting framework and on fiscal consolidation,
with a view to continue reducing vulnerabilities associated with public debt and financial
dollarization, while increasing the scope for priority social and infrastructure investment.
Discussions of the first review under the Stand-by Arrangement were held on September 2004.
The IMFstaffs initial assessment notes that the economy has continued to perform well in 2004
and that the medium term outlook remainsfavorable. The political situation i s viewed as a main
risk to the program, but this is tempered by an apparent political consensus for prudent
macroeconomicpolicies and certain structural reforms. To help achieve the program objectives,
the staff has indicated that further structural progress needs to be made, including inthe areas of
competitiveness and fiscal decentralization. Both issues are being addressedby the Government
with the support of the proposedDECSAL II.

Reference: Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan for Decentralization and
             Competitiveness11

Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,

Thisis to inform you that the Government of President Alejandro Toledohas continued
the implementation of the process of decentralizationof responsibilities, authority and
resources from the National Governmentto the Regional and Local Governmentlevels,
as well as the promotion of a favorable environment for the development of
competitivenessin the country, withthese objectives:

    Withrespect to decentralization:assigningthe responsibility for public services to the
    governmentlevels that are close to consumers, and facilitating civicparticipationin
    the design,elaboration,application and supervisionof public policies,
    With respect to competitiveness: raising firms' productivity, in order to generate
    more value-added in production; increasing the quantity, variety and quality of
    products, principally those oriented to international markets; expanding markets;
    and fosteringa favorableinvestmentclimate,
As such, in continuation with the "Decentralizationand competitiveness Program with "
the WorldBank specificreforms are being developed in the followingareas:
7 ,Decentralizationand fiscal sustainability
2. Institutional developmentfor decentralization
3. Competitivenessand economic growth.

In order to have abetter understandingof the actions to carried out, this document will
describe:
a.      The macroeconomic context explained in the Multiannual Macroeconomic
        Framework 2005-2007, which covers fiscal, external, exchange rate and
        monetarypolicies.
6.      The institutional and management framework where the processes of
        decentralization and Competitiveness are set out. This framework will be
        presented followingthesequenceof the threepoints indicated above.


1.      Background

7 . 7   The World Bank has been supporting the Peruvian Government in promoting
        decentralization and competitivenessreforms, with the followingobjectives:
     To make the decentralization process effective, without affecting the quality and
     timeliness of services and responsibilities to be transferred, and without altering the
     prudenceof the fiscal managementof the economy; and
     To accelerate the development of competitiveness in the country, both from the
     implementation of reforms at the institutional level and in the implementation of
     specificpolicies in this field.
7.2     In the case of the decentralization process, the development of the regulatory
        frameworkhas continued. It aims to promote fiscal responsibility, strengthen tax
        administration, create a system of accreditation, incentive the formation and
        integration of regions, and includes:
            Fiscal Decentralization (legislative Decree No955): establishesthe regulations
            for the allocation of resources to Regional and Locai Governments,
            management mechanisms and incentives for fiscal effort and rules on fiscal
            responsibility, among other measures.

            Municipal Taxafion (legislative Decree No 952): stipulates mechanisms for
            improving the tax collection of Local Governments and broadening the tax
            base, among other measures.

            Accreditation System (law No28273): establishesprovisions to guarantee the
            efficienttransfer of responsibilities, functions, authority and resources from the
            National Government to the Regional and Local Governments, and to
            optimize the qualityof public services.

            lncenfivesfor fhe formationand integration of regions (lawNo28274):sets out
            the incentives for Regional Governments to take actions toward physical,
            economic,cultural and social integration, for the formation of Regions.
 7,3    With respect to the competitiveness process, the National Competitiveness
        Council(CNC) was created. TheNational CompetitivenessPlan is in the process
        of elaboration, with the purpose of articulating policies, taking into account the



                                                112

7.4  different government levels. This process will contemplate maintaining a solid
     and stable macroeconomic context; securing optimal levels of efficiency in the
     provision of public services and infrastructure; improving the business
     environment to reduce the costs of economic activity; promoting investmentin
     science and technology,particularly applied to the improvement of productive
     processes, among other elements.


II.  Macreoconomicpolicyframework

7.5  Compared with its past performance and current developments in the world
     economy, the performance of the Peruvian economy in the last three years has
     been satisfactory. Inflation evolves within the range predicted by the monetary
     authority; the level of the net international reserves of the Central Reserve Bank
     ofPeru (BCRP)is thehighestin its history; and theindicators ofeconomic activity,
     such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment and the past-due loan
     portfolio show that we are moving from the phase of stabilization to that of
     economic growth.
7.6  Unlikeother periods of increasingproductive activity, the currentgrowth episode
     has not been driven by fiscalpolicy-the fiscal deficithas been decreasingsince
     2000- but by exports and private investment, whichportends a period of long-
     lasting economic growth. likewise, the international financial markets'
     perceptions of our economy, expressed in country risk indicators, has improved
     remarkably, contributing with monetary policy to reducing domestic interest
     rates.
1,7  Moreover, the current international context, reflected by the level of
     international rates as well as by the evolution of world GDPand theprices of our
     main exports, is favorable to our country. In line with this, according to the
     InternationalMonetary Fund, average economic growth expected for 2004 and
     2005is 4.5per cent, againstthe3-4per centregisteredin 2002and 2003
7,8  Finally, several recentlyimplementedbig investmentprojects-among which the
     CamiseaGasProject and the Las Bambas Mining Projectstand out- guarantee
     a minimum level of growth in the coming years, even in the case that the
     internationalenvironmentchanges.
 7.9 In sum, the fundamental conditions are in place at present for a sustained
     increasein production, which wili allow the seriousproblems of employmentand
     poverty thatsociety faces tobe solvedgradually.
 7.70 Despite recent macroeconomic achievements, the country still faces major
     problems to solve: the level of our GDP per capita is similar to that of 30 years
     ago, poverty affects more than half of the population, and total public debt
     represents 47.4 per cent of GDP. Consequently, we must apply efficient
      economic management that should continue to guarantee macroeconomic
     stability and that, at the same time, should promote aset of reforms that lead to
      sustainedeconomic growth for the coming years.



                                          113

7 . 7 7 Thus, monetary policy must continue to set inflation around an annual 2.5 per
        cent, in line with the system of explicit inflation goals that the BCRP has been
        applying since the beginning of 2002. With regard to the fiscal stance, priority
        should be given to the sustainabilityof the public finances, primarily through the
        sustained reduction of the fiscal deficit in accordance with the Fiscal
        Responsibility and Transparency Law (LRTF). Meanwhile, trade policy should
        continue opening our economy to internationalcompetition and promoting the
        expansionof internationalmarketsfor local production.
7.72 In order to reinforce the effects that these policy outlines will have for the
        recovery of private investment and sustained economic growfh, it will be
        necessary to consolidate them through the implementation of pending reforms.
        Hence, given the objective of guaranteeing the sustainability of public finances
        and preserving the efficiencyand rationalityof public expenditure,the following
        are key requirements:continue with the Reform of the State, especially focused
        on the Modernizationof the Stateand the strengtheningof the Decentralization
        process,' consolidateasimple and general TaxSystem that allows tax pressure to
        increase; and implement a Reform of the PensionSystem to make it less onerous
        and more equitable.
7.73 Moreover, in order to take greater advantage of the benefits of our increasing
        integration into the international economy through the bilateral and multilateral
        agreements in process-such as the Free TradeAgreement- is it indispensable
        toincreasethe competitivenessof our economy,In thisendeavor,it is necessary
        to puf in motion a set of reformsin the area of infrastructuredevelopment and
        carry outpolitical and institutionaladjustmentsthat ensuretheimplementationof
        reforms,among other measures.


111.    Structuralreformsassociatedto the Program


A.      Decenfrakzafionand fiscal susfainabilify
7,14 Background and previous initiatives.TheGovernmenthas maintained a prudent
        and responsible management of economic policy, as stipulated in the
        Multiannual Macroeconomic Framework. This relates to policy and tax
        administration measures, including the strengthening of municipal fax
        administration, control of the indebtednessof Regional and Local Governments,
        and the transfer of resourcesto thesegovernments.
7.75 Regarding tax policy and administration, in the context of the tax reform
        undertaken in the last quarter of 2003 and completed in early 2004, the
        Government had the following objectives: modify the Tax Code in order to
        improve the procedures for determining the tax debt tax refunds and the
        infraction and sanction regime; broaden the base of Income Tax through the
        modificationof the deductionssystem among other elements; and establishnew
        mechanisms for the tax administration to monitor the transactionsof tax debtors
        withthirdparties, so as to take the appropriate measures tosecure the collection
        of pending taxdebts.


                                             114

1.76 Likewise, the Municipal Tax Law was modified with the purpose of simplifvingthe
      application of municipal taxes, thus improving their administration, in order to
      broaden the tax base. The application of the proposed measures will allow the
      municipalitiesto obtainincreasesin the collectionof tax revenues.Someof these
      measures are:
      -    Property tax: introduction of reforms in the determination of the tax rate,
           rationalization of tax benefits and mechanisms for the elaboration of a
           CadastrePlan.
      -    Vehicle tax: improvement in the determination of the taxable base and
           administration.
      -    Tax on property sales: modification of the taxable base, administration and

      -    timely collection,
           Municipal Compensation Fund (FONCOMUN):modification of indicators and
           distributioncriteria, minimum allocation of 8 TaxationUnits(UIT).
7.77 With respect to control of the indebtedness of Regional and Local
       Governments-with the objective of complementing the agreement under the
       Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (LRTF) on fiscal rules for
       indebtedness- the Government issued the Law of Fiscal Decentralization. This
      law establishes provisions that complement the agreement under the LRTF
      regarding the future of indebtedness, the creditworthiness, and the limits,
       among other elements. Similarly, the Regulation of the LRTF, to be approved in
       the nexf few days, establishes that the Regional and Local Governments that
       engage in transactions for indebtedness greater than a specified amount-
       determined annually in the Law of Public Sector Indebtedness- will be required
       to have a favorable credit assessment conducted by a recognized risk rating
       agency as evidenceof creditworthiness.
7 . 18 Regarding the issue of fiscal transfers, the modifications to the Municipal Taxand
       Canon Laws established that the distribution of FONCOMUN and of the canon
       be carried out based on poverfy, demography and geographic criteria, income
       generation and priorization of investment expenditure, and basic unsatisfied
       needs.
7,79 Policy reformsproposed for thesector program. Theobjectiveof theseproposals
       is to continuestrengthening the policy and tax administration, the control of the
       indebtedness of Regional and Local Governments and the fiscal transfers to
       these Governments.
7.20 With the objective of improving the fiscal effort-defined as the existing relation
       between the effective collection and the collection goals disaggregated b y
       regions- the National Government will determine the methodology for annual
       calculation of the collection goals that will be used b y the National
       Superintendencyof TaxAdministration(SUNAT),
7.21   Likewise, with the purpose of complementing the measures on the strengthening
       of municipal tax collection and administration, the National Government will
       continue supporting the implementation of the Integrated System of Financial
       Administration for Local Governments (SIAF-GL), mainly in regard to the
       development of the cadastre collection module. The implementation of an


                                             115

          efficient cadastre system will enable Local Governments to reinforce their tax
          collection capacity and increase their tax revenues. It is important to note that
          this will include a training program to improve the management and
          administrativeaspects of these Governments.
7.22 With regard to issues of the indebtedness of Regional and Local Governments,
          continued reinforcement is foreseen for the regulatory framework, including the
          standardization of concepts; limits on the valueof guaranteesand/or similar and
          the form of accounting for theseguarantees, other banking and trusteeships.
7.23 Likewise, the normative framework linked to fiscal transfers will continue to be
          reinforced.In thiscontext the regulationof theLaw that modifies the CanonLaw
          will establish the definition of the distribution criteria in areas of exploitation of
          natural resources as well as the procedures for the allocation of resources in
          productive investment projects in the communities located in the exploitation
          areas.
6.        lnsfifufionaldevelopmenf for decentralization
 7.24 Background and previous inifiafives. In order to guarantee the institutionalization
          of the decentralization process, the Government has undertaken actions that:
          guarantee an optimum transfer of responsibilities and resources from the
          National Government to the Regional and Local Governments; ensure the
          participation                of civil society and improve expenditure planning and
          administration; and enforce the certification criteria of the management and
          administrative capacify of Regional and Local Governments to provide public
          services effectively and to consolidate a gradual, prudent and neutral
          decentralizationprocess.
 7.25 In this context the Law of the Accreditation System of the Regional and Local
          Governments waspublished in July, TheSystem comprises the training, technical
          assistance and the set of criteria, instruments,procedures and rules necessary to
          determine the management capacity of the Regional and Local Governments,
          to receive and execute the functions related to fiscal transfers. The said Law
          establishes aspects including the requirements of the accreditation process, the
          members and responsibilities of the System, criteria for the elaboration of
          managementindicators,cooperationagreements, third-padyenforcement,
 7 26     In relation to the participatory budget process, in November of 2003 the
          Regulation of the Legal Framework of the Participatory Budget was published.
          This establishes provisions to identify the participatory agents, develop
          workshops, technically evaluate priorities, and formalize agreements and the
          way in which accountability will be exercised. while the National Government
          has to establish the guidelines, rules and directives' that allow Regional and
          Local Governments to program their budgets in a participatory manner
          according to their Agreed Development Plans, the responsibility for elaborating

`  In order to contribute to the successof theprocess, theMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF), through the National Direction of Public
Budget (DNPP), has put at the disposal of Regional and Local Governmentsa web-based information applicationfor thepa~iciputoryprocess to
accompany theprogression of event.?step by step. Whileprogressing towurds increasingly transpurent manugemnt, this allows citizens to be
informed about the agreements reached in each of thephases of thisprocess, as the infomtion is readily accesible to citizens through MEF's
webpage.



                                                                      116

    these budgets in a participatory way corresponds to the Local Governments.In
    this regard, it is worth noting that, as of October of 2003, all regions and the 70%
    of the municipalities with more than forty thousand inhabitants prepared their
    budget for the fiscal year 2005 followingtherules of thepadicipatory budget.
7.27 Likewise, with the aim of improving the control and planning of public
    expenditure and investments, the National Government continued with the
    implementationprocess of the financial administration and investments systems
    such as the case of SIAF-GL and the National Public InvestmentSystem, among
     others.
7.28 The above is complemented with the development of a Follow-up and
     Evaluation System of public expenditure being built b y the Ministry of Economy
     and Finance (MEF). To date, the Government has established the technical
    guidelines for the initiation of data entry for an adequate and progressive
     implementationof thisSystem at the national level.
1.29 Policy reforms proposed for the sector program. Theobjective of theseproposals
     is to support the consolidation of the different systems linked to accreditation,
     participatorybudgeting, and follow-upand evaluationof public expenditure.
7.30 withrespect to theAccreditationSystem, the correspondingRegulationspecifies
     that the Integrated System of Financial Administration be used as a means of
     verification of information, and that the results of the accreditation process be
     published, The latter will allow to the homogenization of the sources of
     information andstrengthen the transparency of theprocess.
7.37 In the case of the process of the participatory budget, the role of the Regional
     and Local Coordination Councils will be strengthened according to what is
     established in the current legislation, as leaders of this process and of the
     relationshipof theprocess withtheAgreed Development Plans.
7.32 Likewise, with the objective of improving the quality of public expenditure, the
     Government plans to continue subscribing Results-based Management
     Agreements with theRegional Governments.Thiswillbe done according to what
     has been established in the bill of the General Law of the National System of
     Expenditure, and b y implementing the System of Follow-up and Evaluation of
     public expenditure.In the case of the latter, the initial value of theperformance
     indicators for the main activities and projects will be selected, analyzed and
     determined. At the level of the Regional Governments, the performance
     indicatorsthat willbe used willbeproposed.
7.33  On the other hand, with the purpose of controlling and monitoring current
      expenditure, the National Government will continue with the extension of the
     direct deposit ("abono en cuenta") process not only with Banco de la Nacicin
     but also throughprivate banks.
C.    Competitivenessand economicgrowth
7,34 Background and previous initiatives. The National Government has undertaken
      different actions, from institutionalizingthe competitiveness process through the
      recently created National Competitiveness Council (CNC), to developing
      mechanisms for the improvement of firms' productivity, While the development


                                            117

    of these actions has slowed down, the Government expects to progressively
    continue with the implementationof the measures set out.Some of these will be
     financed with resources from the TechnicalAssistance Project for Improving the
    Productive Supply and Facilitating Exfernal Trade, will be agreed with the WorM
    Bank and executed by the Presidency of the Councilof Ministers.
7.35 From an institutional point of view, the Government has undertaken actions to
    strengthen the role of the CNC. Likewise, the Government has approved the
     guidelines for the National Competitiveness Strategy. Currently, Consultative
     Groups are being formed with the objective of creating a discussion forum with
     theparticipation of public, private and academic actors, in order to deepen the
    guidelines' definition of the Strategy in issues related to firm articulation,
     technology, education, institutionalism, the economy and financial markets,
     infrastructureand logistics, and the environment.
1.36 In relation to exports promotion, the Government has developed the National
     Strategic Export Plan (PENX)and the Regional Strategic Export Plans (PERX) of
     Piura, Cajamarca, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Ancash, Ica,Arequipa and Loreto.
     Theobjective behind these plans is to sustainably increase exports of goods and
     services and promote Peru's image as an exporting country, The PERX have
     been implemented by the regions with the support of the National Government;
     they describe the advantages and potentialities of the regions, of selected
     products, strategic lines, networks, and so on. Likewise, the Government has
     supported the implementation of Business Promotion Offices in the regions to
     allow the general public, including exporters, to find in a single place both
     attention and answers thatshould be provided to strategic partners b y the head
     offices of these Offices(PROMPEX, PROMPYME,PROINVERSION and MINCETUR).
7.37 With respect to the area of technological innovation, the National Government
     is aware that investmentin research and scientific-technologicaldevelopment is
     very limited; allocation of expenditure in this area should be improved, and
     technology should be linked to the productive sector, For this reason, MEF is
     facilitating the development of Centers of Technological Innovation, with
     significant presence in the regions, developing a monitoring and evaluation
     system for the impact of expenditures, which initially would be applied to the
     technological research institutes with public financing, as a mechanism for the
     measurementof its performance and the correspondingallocation of resources.
     In parallel, in July of 2004 the Government published the Legal Framework of
     Science, Technology and Technological Innovation, which created Funds to
     finance technology initiatives in productive projects-which will be executed
     according to competition criteria-as well as initiatives that stimulate university-
     businesslinks for the developmentof projects for productiveinnovation.
7.38 On the subjects of private investment and infrastructure development the
     Government has continued with its commitment to improving the provision of
     public infrastructure services, through public and private investment and a
     program of guarantees.Similarly, with respect to infrastructure, the Government
     has elaborated the legal and technical framework necessary for the initiation of
     the concession of port terminals: the Governmenthas published the Regulation
     of the Law of the National Port System; it has designated the National Port


                                          118

     Authority and has elaborated the project of the National Port Development Plan,
     currently under review by civil society groups.
7.39 On the other hand, in relation to the reduction of bureaucratic barriers and the
     improvement of several dispute settlement, the National Government has
     initiated a process of Simplification of Administrative Proceedings for the
     incorporation of companies. This process is being coordinated with several local
     Governments.likewise, the Judiciary created the trade specialization within the
     civic service, which will allow there to be courts specialized in issues related to
     securities, finance,insurance,and mercantile topics, among others.
7.40 Policy reforms proposed for the sector program. The objectives of the reform
     proposals are: consolidating the institutionalization of the competitiveness
     process; promoting exports, particularly at the regional level; improving
     production and productivity; contributing to the reduction of logistics costs and
     to the development of infrastructure;and improving the businessclimate.
7.47 With respect to the institutionalization of the competitiveness process, the
     development of regional indicators of competitivenessis envisaged, to conduct
     an effective follow-up and monitoring of the process, in order to identify and
     take action on issues that could be critical. Besides defining these indicators,
     information sources and the type of monitoring system to be used shall be
     determined.
7.42 Similarly, in order to facilitate the implementation of the PfRX, the Government
      will continue supporting the creation of Business Promotion Offices in strategic
      areas of the country that will allow the private sector to obtain the necessary
      information to export, such as strategic partners, markets, products, inputs, and
      so on.
7.43 Regarding technological innovation, the necessary regulatory framework and
      mechanisms to promote the design and implementation of technological
      projects related to the productive sector are to be developed, as well as the
      competition for resources to be allocated. The Government will continue
      developing technical standards and promoting the accreditation process of
      accreditation to make Peruvian products more competitive, both on domestic
      and foreignmarkets.
7.44 Aiming to reduce logistics costs and promote infrastructure development in the
      country, the process of improvement of roads, ports, airports, logistic routes, and
      terminals, among others will continue to be driven forward; and a planning and
      financing strategy for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network
      shall be prepared under thejurisdiction of the National Government as will the
      Plan of lntermodal TransportInfrastructurefor the next 20 years.
7 -45 Finally, in order to improve the business climate, the registration of selection
      processes through the Nectronic System of Acquisitions and Contracting of the
      State(SEACE)will be implemented, as well as the Simplification of Administrative
      Procedures(SIMTA)at both National Governmentand Loca1Government levels.
       This will facilitate purchasingprocesses and reduce the time for the incorporation
       of a company. At the same time, complementarily, the implementation of trade



                                            119

       courts withspecific measures for improving the executionofjudicial decisions will
       be supported.
IV.    Conclusion
It follows from the above that the Peruvian Government continues underfaking
important actions for implementing a decentralization process that complies with the
objectives of achieving greater efficiency in the allocation of public resources and
strengthening civic participation, in the context of fiscal management based on
responsibility and transparency. Likewise, with regards to competitiveness, in
coordination with the private sector, the Government has been making progress in
building an institutional framework favorable to business development, as well as in the
design and implementation of specificpolicies aiming for thesame objective.
TheGovernmentcommits itself to continue making progress in these areas, for whichit
requires to continuecountingon thesupportof the WorldBank in the above areas.
By virtue of the foregoing, b y means of this document, the Peruvian Government
requests the approval of the "Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan for
Decentralization and Competitiveness".

         IMFApproves26-monthUS$422.8MillionStand-ByArrangementfor Peru

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 26-month
SDR 287.3 million (about US$422.8 million) Stand-By Arrangemeot for Peru to support the
country's economic program through mid-2006. The approval enables the release of a first
drawing of SDR 80 million (about US$118 million) under the arrangement. However, the
authorities have indicated their intention to treat this arrangement as precautionary.

Following the Executive Board discussion, on Peru, Rodrigo de Rato, Managing Director and
Chairman of the Board, said:

"Peru's recent economic performance has been favorable, with solid growth and low inflation.
Substantial buffers, including a high level of international reserves and a well-capitalized
banking system, have been built up to further 'reduce vulnerabilities associated with high
dollarization and public debt, and there has been progress with structural reforms. The
authorities' program for 2004-06 aims at consolidating macroeconomic stability, fortifying
confidence, strengthening the basis for sustainable growth and employment creation so as to
reduce poverty, and further reducing financial vulnerabilities. It focuses on the consistent
implementation of their inflation-targeting framework and on fiscal consolidation, with a view to
continue improving public debt dynamics and increasing the scope for priority social and
infrastructure investment.

"The program also includes a broad set of growth-enhancing reforms aimed at reducing the high
levels of unemployment andpoverty. In2004, the authorities plan to foster private investment by
establishing commercial courts and improving collateral registries. They also plan to grant
operating concessions to the private sector and enter into targeted public-private partnerships
(PPPs), which will be implemented in a prudent manner and accounted for transparently in the
budget. The reform program will also improve public resource management, modify public
pension regimes-including the preferential Ckdula Viva-reduce labor costs, and strengthen bank
supervision andthe legal framework for fiscal decentralization.

"The authorities' firm commitment to implementing prudent economic polices in the context of a
challenging political and social environment i s commendable. Strengthening political consensus
for critical reforms will be crucial to press forward with the reform momentum of recent years
and reduce the vulnerabilities facing the economy and reinforce confidence in the continuity of
prudent policies. This will help boost broad-based and sustainable growth and employment and
reduce poverty, while strengthening the basis for Peru's successful exit from the series of Fund-
supportedprograms," the Managing Director said.

Recent economic developments
Peru made progress in stabilizing its economy and adopting growth-enhancing structural
reforms, under the 2002-03 Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. Economic growth averaged
4.5 percent a year, inflation remained low under the inflation targeting framework of the central
bank, and substantial buffers were built to mitigate financial vulnerabilities. These buffers
included a high level of international reserves and a well-capitalized banking system. Progress
was also made in structural reforms, including in the areas of decentralization, pension reform,
clarifying fiscal rules, strengthening the financial system, and reorienting the privatization
programtowards granting concessions.

In 2003, Peru's GDP grew by 4 percent in real terms and inflation was limited to 2.5 percent.
Fiscal consolidation was in line with the government's target-the deficit of the combined public
sector was reduced from 2.2 percent of GDP in 2002 to 1.7 percent of GDP. Revenues were
boosted by tax measures introduced in mid 2002 and mid 2003. Peru's external position also
strengthenedin 2003 and financial indicators improved. The external current account deficit fell
from more than 2 percent of GDP in 2002 to about 1.75 percent, driven by commodity export
growth. Private capital inflows remained strong, particularly foreign direct investment in the
natural resource sector. Gross international reserves rose by about US$500 million during 2003
andby afurther US$250 millionduringthe first four months of 2004, to US$10.5 billion at end-
April 2004. The Lima stock exchange index surgedby 75 percent during 2003, reflecting higher
mineralproductprices.Peru's sovereignspreadcontinues to be amongthe lowest inthe region.

Program summary
The objectives of the program for 2004-2006 are to maintain macroeconomic stability, foster
robust growth and employment, further reduce vulnerabilities, and diminish poverty. The
program aims at enhancingthe basis for strong economic growth, which is projected to average
about 4.5 percent a year during 2004-06. It focuses on the continued implementation of the
inflation-targeting framework and on fiscal consolidation, with a view to lowering the debt-to-
GDP ratio from about 47.5 percent in 2003 to about 41 percent in 2006. Successful
implementation of the program will enhancethe basis for defining Peru's exit strategy from Fund
supportedprograms.

The fiscal program i s based on reducing the overall deficit of the combined public sector from
 1.7 percent of GDP in2003 to 1.4 percent in 2004, andto 1percent a year in 2005-06. Over this
period, about one third of the adjustment effort of the central government i s to be achieved
through higher revenue, andthe remainder through a containment incurrent expenditure growth.

Monetary policy will continue to be managed within the inflation-targeting framework. While
preserving its floating in the exchange rate regime, the authorities intend to maintain a solid
cushion of foreign reserves to mitigate potential external shocks and political uncertainties inthe
periodupto the 2006 elections.

Boosting economic growth and employment creation depends critically on the sustained
implementation of a broad set of reforms. The program includes growth enhancing reforms
aimed at strengtheningthe investment climate, including the establishment of commercial courts
to speedup contract enforcement andimprovements inthe functioning of collateral registries. To



                                                122

bolster infrastructure investment, the authorities plan to grant operating concessions to the
private sector and enter into Public-Private Partnerships in a fiscally prudent and transparent
manner. Also, the authorities intend to improve resource management in the public sector,
modify public pension regimes, reduce labor costs, and strengthen the legal framework for
decentralization. The program includes efforts aimed at further strengthening the regulation and
supervisionof financial intermediaries.

Perujoined the IMF on December 31, 1945, and its current quota is SDR 638.4 million (about
US$939 million). Its outstanding use of IMFfinancing currently totals SDR 80.3 million (about
US$118 million).

                        Annex V: Fiscal Restraint and Decentralization

        The Peruvian Government has placed great emphasis on fiscal responsibility in general
and in relation to the decentralization roccss. Primarily, the government at
has committed itself to reduce the deficit of the non-financial public sector to 1percent of GDP
or less beginning in 2005, in line with the amended fiscal responsibility law approved last year
by Congress. Secondly, since the start of the decentralization process in early 2002 the legal
framework issued by both the Executive and Congress has emphasized the importance of a
fiscally neutraldecentralization process.
        The concernfor fiscal sustainability is fullyjustified takinginto account that:

    e   Peru is a highly indebted country with public sector debt accounting for 47.4 percent of
        GDP at the end of 2003 and representing 2.7 times the current revenues of the general
        government. In addition, almost 85 percent of this debt i s denominated in foreign
        currencies. A consistent fiscal consolidation will allow more roomfor a counter-cyclical
        fiscal policy over the medium-term.

    0   Peru-a late-comer to decentralization -has to date successfully avoided the pitfalls that
        other Latin American decentralization processes have encountered. In particular, the
        Government has avoided large increasesinboth public expenditures and the fiscal deficit
        commonly associatedwith decentralization processes.

        The decentralization framework is examined below followed by an analysis of important
pendingrules and actions andrecommendations.

Current Legal Framework
        Since the inception of decentralization in 2002, the government has emphasized the
importance of fiscal sustainability and the need to minimize the risks of decentralization. An
extensivelegal framework for decentralization reflecting these priorities hasbeenapproved.
        The law that lays the foundations for the decentralization process (Ley de Bases de la
Descentralizacihz) provides the basic guidelines for the intended process, stressing the need for
hardbudget constraints and a fiscally neutral process. In particular, it specifies that the fiscal
decentralization should: (i)  involve an orderly transfer of functions - avoiding the transfer of
resources without a corresponding transfer of responsibility; (ii)  establish limits (through fiscal
rules) on indebtedness and on increases in public expenditures of the regional and local
governments; (iii)  impose restrictions on borrowing abroad and prohibit the central government
from covering non-guaranteed debts of the regional and local entities; (iv) put in place a clear
demarcation of competence to enable improved accountability; and (v) introduce mechanisms
that increasetransparency andpredictability.
    In June 2003, the fiscal responsibility law (FRTL) was modified. The revised version has
retained its central principle - to attain a fiscal equilibrium or surplus on average over the
business cycle. Additionally, the modified law has maintained fiscal rules on the deficit, the
growth of non-financial general government expenditure andpractically all the norms associated




                                                 124

with transparency.6s However, the amendment has improved the law by its coverage by
broadening it to cover all regional and local governments and entities, introducing a quarterly
monitoring mechanismfor a prompt policy action inthe case of a revenue shortfall and allowing
a gradual return to the limits of the rules after exceptional emergency circumstances. Most
importantly, fiscal rules were introduced for the regional and local government. Inparticular the
reformulatedlaw:

    (i)      establishes limits on the stock of debt and the debt service - both as a percent of the
             current income of the regional and local government including transfers from the
             central government (Table 1);

    (ii)     requires that the three-year average primary balance be positive or zero for each
             regional andlocal government; and

     (iii)   re-iterates that regional and local government could only borrow from abroad with
             central government guarantee, confiningborrowingto public infrastructure projects.

        Sanctions through the denial of transfers from participatory funds (FONCOR,
FONCOMUN and FIDE) would be imposed on any regional andlocal government that does not
comply with the fiscal rules set out under the law.66 Additionally, the national Executive branch
could intervene inthe operations of a regional government if the budget execution of the regional
and local entity causes a breakdown of the fiscal targets set in the national multiyear budget
framework or any fiscal rule of the fiscal responsibility law.
         InFebruary 2004, the Fiscal Decentralization Law (FDL)was approvedby the Executive
using the authority delegation by Congress. The primary purpose of the law is to outline key
norms related to the sources of funds for regional and local governments. The principal
resources for regional government in the first stage (prior to the merger of regions) will be
discretionary transfers of the central government to be provided through the national budget.67
The law establishes that for the second stage two or more actual regions will need to be
integrated and have demonstrated administrative capacity to provide public services as assessed
by the accreditation process. These macro-regions - which exclude the provinces of Lima and
 Callao- will receive 50 percent of own-source revenuesfrom the domestic VAT, excisetaxes and
personal income tax in addition to discretionary transfers if needed. The law establishes a 3
 percent ceilingon the annual increase in real expenditures for the regional and local government
 in line with the same ceiling required for the aggregate of the general government, specified in


 65.  The limit on the real increase in non-financial expenditures was increased from 2 to 3 percent per annum [now
      to be calculated using the implicit deflator of GDP rather the average consumer price index). The ceiling on
      the fiscal deficit for normal years was maintained in 1 percent of GDP but now beginning in 2005 and the
      ceiling was increased from 2 to 2.5 percent of GDP in recession years. One of the limits on elections years
      was restrained in a scanty manner (restricting the fiscal deficit in the first half o f one of these years to 40
      percent of the annual deficit planned, rather thanthe 50 percent established inthe original law).
 66.   The organic law on regional governments restricts this sanction to a situation in which the region has not
      observe a fiscal rule for two consecutive years and limits the suspension o f transfers to the funds
      corresponding to up to 90 days.
 67.   Currently, the regional and local governments receive in addition a share (generally 50 percent, but in some
      cases more) of the royalties and corporate income tax of natural resources. Local governments in addition
      have a share of the VAT (2 percentage points distributed by population and poverty criteria), recollect some
      small taxes, mainly on property and vehicles (0.3 percent of GDP in2003).

the FRTL. An exception clause does allow for higher expenditures in situations of natural
disasters to enable the reconstruction of public infrastructure and to assist the population
affected. In the final year of each administration the law forbids a compromise of current
expenditure on future years' income, except for pensions. The                      Lalso includes some further
restrictions on borrowing by regional and local entities, on medium-term debt not guaranteedb
the central government and on short term debt includingfloat and presumably possible arrears,6x
which complement those of the fiscal responsibility law (Table 1).                             All medium-term
indebtedness should be used to finance investment projects, approved under the rules of the
SNIP.

          The FDLobliges all the regional andlocal governments (regional and local) to elaborate
 multiyear budget frameworks for their jurisdiction (called Infomze Multianual de Gestih Fiscal)
 to be presentedto the Ministry of Economy and Finance before July 15 of each year. It should
 provide fiscal projections for the next 3 years-including                     actual and prospective debt-
 consistent with the projections provided inthe national government multiyear budget framework
 (Marc0 Macroeconhico Multianual) releasedby end of May of each year. These regional and
 local reports should explain previous year estimates and specify with corrective measures if they
 deviate from the one programmed. Finally, each regional and local government is required to
 monitor fiscal development through quarterly reports.
          On July 9, 2004, a law providing incentives for the merger of actual regions was
 published (together with the law of accreditation). It allows for the integrated regions to contract
 new indebtedness with no guarantee of the central government for up to 40 percent of their
 budgetfor investment. Limits for the actualregions will also apply to the mergedregions.

 PendingIssues
          Despite the advances made so far in the legal framework and the numerous fiscal rules
 that they contain, additional measures associatedwith the decentralization process could ensure
 continued macroeconomic stability. The discussionof these issuesis timely since the by-laws of
 the FRTL and the FDL are still pending                 -together with the General Law on Public Sector
 Indebtedness- andimportantrecommendationsingredients can be incorporated. Additionally, a
  good reporting system established early in the decentralization process would enable timely


  68.   The law, however, admits that each local and regional government needsto elaborate by end of 2005 a special
       budget framework evaluating the current situation and establishing the necessary measures that could be
       neededto fulfill with all the requirements established in the law in a two year period. This clause presumably
       tries to deal with the high debt and arrears of some local governments.

analysis andresponseto issues that arise thereby increasing ex-ante andex-post compliance with
the norms established in the legal framework.                     The recommended areas for continued
improvement include the following:
  1.    Provisions that facilitate careful assessment by potential lenders are important.
        Constraints imposed on borrowers are not sufficient. The provisions on lenders would
        strengthen the credibility of the no-bailout commitment of the central government -
        explicitly recognized as a main principle of fiscal decentralization.                       In addition to
        comprehensive and prompt release of all relevant financial information, a third party
        assessment can also help lenders evaluate risk more accurately and avoid excessive
        lending. Inthis respect, it will beuseful that all credit (with andwithout guaranteeof the
        national government) above a certain threshold be required to have been rated by two
        well known rating agen~ies.6~This provision should extend to all type of credit,
        especially to those provided by the domestic financial system and should also include
        securitization of future income with a broad ~overage.~'The bank provisions and the
        risk-basedcapital-assetratio of the banks should reflect the risks involved of the regional
        and local credits (obviously, assuming there will be no bailout). It is crucial that the
        Bunco de la Nucibn (currently the main supplier of formal credit to regional and local
        government) be transparentinits operations with regional and local entities, with precise
        limitsonbothindividualandglobal regionalandlocalentities.
  2.    Strict restrictions should be imposed on guarantees by the national government, in
        addition to a transparent registration and record of these contingency debts of the central
        government.         In particular, it is important that the regional and local government
        demonstrates the capacity for repayment as stipulated by the FRTL. The regulation of
        this law should request that the analysis neededbe basednot only on past behavior of the
         limits of the law and adequate fiscal report system, but also on a prospective cash flow
         analysis based on realistic assumptions consistent with the ones used on the budget
         framework (Murco), and with relevant sensitivity analysis including the actions that the
         regional andlocalwill compromise on these contingent events.
  3.     Regional and local governments depend mainly on discretionary transfers - particularly
         duringthe first stage. Hence, it is important to reinforce measures that guarantee a hard
         budget constraint. The by-law of the FDL should reiterate that in the budget execution
         period no new transfers will be made, limiting the budget augmentation to few
         circumstances, as additional increases in the transfers of functions (which should imply a
         corresponding reduction in central governments expenditures) and exceptional
         circumstances (in line with article 31 of FDL).71Additionally, the central government's


 69. The rating should reflect the credit risk of the borrower, not necessary of the particular credit issued in the case
    that it has a guarantee from the national government.
 70. It should be stressed that the FRTL (art. 15) states that it is prohibited the "creaci6n o existencia de fondos u
    otros que conlleven gastos que no se encuentren enmarcados dentro de las disposiciones de la presente Ley."
    The bylaw of the law should state, at least, that any credit which has a guarantee on future incomes of a
    regional and localentity will be part of the debt o f the respective regional and local government for the purpose
    o f the limits established inboth the FXTLand the FDL.
 71. Other more controversial exemption could be transfers for earmarked expenditure determinate by the central
    government. The most important example is a change in wages on public employees that currently are
    negotiated and approved by the central government (eg, teachers), which if granted and not included in the
    budget will require a corresponding increase in transfers.


                                                           127

   budget should make a provision for contingent events to cover emergency cases
   mentioned above without an increase in the budget or important modification in its
   assignments. The formation of regional stabilization funds proposed indrafts of the FDL
   by-laws are encouragingconsidering that in addition to discrete transfers the revenues of
   regions are limited to royalties and the share on income tax on natural resources - both
   highly volatile. However, it is not clear that the funds could be created by a simple
   regulation of the central government and likely require a higher level norm. As an
   alternative, these transfers linked to revenues should correspond to moving averages, to
   ensure smooth flow of resources and avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policy or the usual `stop
   and go' processespecially ininvestment projects.
4. An adequate fiscal reporting systeminplacefrom the start of the decentralization process
   i s essential. The FDL i s clear on this point. First, it requires quarterly reports for ex-
   post evaluation, requiringcorrective measures if the evaluation reveals a inability to meet
   ex-ante targets. The by-law of this law should detail the concrete procedures for this to
   occur promptly, since if the deviation is protracted it becomes difficult to rectify. The
   adoption of the SIAF system by the local governments will be instrumental for this
   purpose. The central government should provide a good example by also comparing the
   quarterly targets with results and taking prompt actions, inline with the corrective clause
   introduced in the FRTL.         Second, the FDL also obliges the regional and local
   governments to elaborate their own multi-year budget frameworks. A good beginning i s
   crucial for success and the central government should provide technical assistance
   promptly. Froma fiscal point of view, regional and mainlocal governments are the most
   important ones. The FDL by-law should establish minimum requirements for these
   entities. On the other hand, the central government should elaborate a `model' with few
   and standardizedrequirementsto help smaller local governments. Third, the FRTLpoints
   sanctions to delinquent regional and local governments, which need further legal
   elaboration to beeffective.

                                  Annex VI: RegionalandLocalDebt
        Municipal debt constitutes an increasing threat to macroeconomic stability. Between
1998and2003, the growth of municipal debt stock has risenby 127percentinnominal terms. In
1998the debt stock accruedto 1,426 million nuevos soles. Only six years later this increasedto
3,237 million nuevos soles (Figure 1). Such a dramatic increase implies, in the medium-term, a
solvency problem for the government. Although there has been substantial and sustained
economic growth inrecent years, the growth inthe stock of debt has increaseddisproportionately
to the GDP growth rate. In 1998, the debt stock was 0.9 percent GDP and subsequently rose to
1.5 percent GDP in 2003. In the same period the debt stock has doubled in terms of current
revenue - from 0.9 percent to 1.5 percent GDP (Figure 2). The country may therefore be unable
to come upwith the resourcesneededto pay off debt.

       These numbers however disguise the real magnitude of the municipal debt crisis.
Primarily, what exactly constitutes 'debt' i s contested with differing definitions in use..
Secondly, measurement of debt is not uniform across the public sector. Thirdly, preliminary
researchconductedin a sampleof 43 municipalities suggests that unregistereddebt is significant.
Non-standardized municipal accounting practices add to the problem. It i s therefore most likely
that the stock of municipal debt is even higher than the 1.5 percent GDP. The government may
therefore face a problem that is worse than what can be assessed with the limited information
available.
       The current situation is particularly troublesome given that the policy responses foreseen
in the current legal framework are likely to be insufficient. The Law of Fiscal Responsibility
gives the central government a possibility to restrict access to funding to the FONCOMUN,
FIDE, andFONCOR transfers. This sanction, in addition to the fact that it needsto be regulated
and operationalized, is unlikely to constitute a credible threat to fiscally irresponsible local
government, and to prevent a future debt crisis. Currently 90 percent of municipalities break
with at least one of the eight different regional and local debt rules that exist. Intercepting
intergovernmental transfers, which for many municipalities constitutes a financial life-line, may
therefore be extremely difficult to enforce.
        The municipal debt problem i s also worrisome since moral hazard seems to be
particularly high. The lion's share of the debt stock i s highly concentratedin a relatively small
number of municipalities, many of them the most populous local government in the country.
Roughly 45 percent of the debt stock is held by 20 out of 1823 municipalities. The Lima
municipalityalone holds 12 percent of the total debt stock. Similarly high concentration of debt
i s held by the Callao, Chiclayo and other medium-sized municipalities.                         The negative
externalities from municipal insolvency are therefore particularly high. Stoppage of service
delivery may affect a large number of the country's population. To avert this risk, the central
government may be tempted to provide financial assistance, in a worst-case scenario through
bailouts and absorption of municipal debt.
        What adds to the difficult situation is the fact that the central government, or any other
creditor, may have neither the legal mandate nor the leverage to enforce due payment of
municipal liabilities. Not only i s debt in dispute, but a high share of financial obligations relates
to labor debt. This type of debt constitutes47 percent of the total of long-term72debt stock held
by municipalities (Figure 3). That is, 13 percent relate to social benefits (beneficios sociales), 23
percent to employment taxes, and 11percent to pension debt. Solving the labor debt problem
requires a deep reform of the municipal civil service and a change in client list practices-goals
that no country inLatinAmerica has achievedwithin the short term.

 72. This data does not discern between debt that is overdue (deudu en mora) and obligations with a maturity of
      more than one year (deuda de largo plazo). Further research is needed to clarify those two different sources
      and types of debt.

        The type of municipal debt suggests a particular reform approach and policy response
from government. Given the heterogeneous nature of Peruvian municipalities, a uniform
approach is ruled out. Rather, the best way to solve the problem is to design interventions based
on the type of creditor and the particular debt situation in each municipality. While a further
delay in action would be risky, it is also clear that only a gradual approachwill generatea critical
mass of winners among municipalities that realize the benefits of prudent fiscal management.
Whatever the reform program may look like, important measures must be taken so as to
anticipate andstem the risingtide of a growing levelof municipal debt.

     Annex VII: Monitoringand Evaluation of Public Expenditure for Decentralization

Introduction
        The Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance is committed to developing a
Management Control and Evaluation System (referred to as the M&E system) geared to
enhancing the quality of public expenditures by means of improving the uality of government
programs and the quality of information neededto take budget decisions?' This note discusses:
(a) the support of the Bank's DECSAL and DECSAL-TAL decentralization projects for the
design and initial implementation of the system; (b) the particular interest of the MEF in
developing an MEF-based M&E system; (c) the objectives of the MEFM&Eevaluation system;
(d) recommendationsfor aphased-inapproachto developing sucha systemover the ensuingfive
to eight years; and (e) the linkages between the MEF and other government M&E systems,
particularly those managedby sector ministries.

(a) Bank Support for System Design and Implementation through the DECSAL and
DECSAL-TAL projects
        This note i s intended to supplement the analytical basis for the World Bank DECSAL 11
project. The note further develops a previous note preparedinconjunction with the World Bank
Technical Assistance Project, TAL-DECSAL, to support the process of fiscal decentralization in
Peru.    The TAL-DECSAL project is currently supporting the design of an initial set of
institutional performance management indicators for projects and activities. This initial set will
be supplementedinlater years by other sector performance indicators with the aimof developing
indicators and databases that cover a substantialpart of the administration. Indicators supported
by TAL-DECSAL will be primarily input (costlproduct) ratios geared to strengthening resource
allocation decisions at the agency level and to providing cost-based standards for budget
preparation purposes. These indicators have application at national, regional and local levels.
Beginning with DECSAL 11, the DECSAL programmatic project will support the Government
policy towards building an MEF-based M&E system, with initialresults defined in the program
matrix of government commitments. The medium term final objective of the new system i s to
move towards results-based administration and results-based public budgets. Collectively the
two Bank projects, the DECSAL programmatic and the DECSAL-TAL specifically support the
efforts of the Peruvian National Government to gradually consolidate an MEF-based budget
processfocused on results.

(b) MEFInterest inDeveloping MEF-based M&ESystem
         The MEF interest in developing M&E system of its own i s based on this Ministry's
responsibility for fiscal sustainability in the country. This responsibility includes ensuring that
the government meets some macro-fiscal and financial targets and protect the efficiency and
effectiveness of public expenditure through closely linkingbudget amounts with results. These
twin responsibilities are inseparable andmutually dependent since fiscal sustainability cannot be
guaranteedunless a minimum level of public services are provided on a regular and sustainable
basis. Additionally, fiscal sustainability requires that the new priorities of the country can be


73. This initiative i s currently being developed by two key units of the MEF: the Direcci6n General de
     Programaci6n Multianual, DGPM, and the Direcci6n Nacional de PresupuestoPtiblico, DNFP.


                                                    132

financed and that the MEF can find the necessary fiscal space to finance those priorities without
threatening the sustainability of public finances. Creating the necessary fiscal space without
disruption of ongoing priorities requiresincreasedefficiency incurrent government programs.
         Peru is not alone in pursuing improved monitoring and control of the quality of public
expenditures for purposes of budget decisions and overall macroeconomic sustainability.
Systems similar to the MEF-based M&E system have already been implemented - to varying
degrees - in Australia, Canada, Chile, the United Kingdom andthe United States. Additionally,
other LAC countries including Brazil, Colombia and Mexico are currently developing similar
systems either in the context of multi-year planning and budgeting or as part of medium-term
fiscal planning mechanisms like the Medium Term Expenditure Framework promoted by the
World Bank.

(c) The Objectives, Instrumentsand PotentialUsesof the MEF-based M&E system
         The following paragraphs examine specific objectives anduses of the MEF-based M&E
system. The analysis below proposes how the new MEF system might reinforce these core
objectives.
         Program enhancement and improving overall public sector management. The proposed
evaluation system is centered around the concept of government programs -though projects or
 actions are second best options when government expenditures are not properly structured as
programs. Programs are the conceptual tool that best connects intermediate goals with budget
resources, components and activities that are essentially needed to producing those results. In
 this regard, the log frame methodology developed by the World Bank and other bilateral and
 multilateral agencies appears to be a most useful tool for program design and program
 enhancement.
          Evaluation systems managedby ministries of finance generally aim to improve program
 performance. The evaluation uses a log-frame methodology that establishes the logical links
 between budget amounts, actions and results. As illustrated by the example of the Direction of
 Budget in Chile, the amount of resources committed to analyzing and when necessary adjusting
 or reconstructing the existing logframe, agreeing on and closely monitoring actions and
 indicators specifically targeted to program enhancement, and when necessary informing budget
 decisions to support the new logframe and the achievement of the proposed indicators,
 demonstrating that enhancement of government programs is one of the key, if not the key,
 objective of the evaluation system. The concern for program enhancement drives the evaluation
 cycle from beginning to end. From the very start of the evaluation exercise, evaluators are
  oriented towards program enhancement, via construction or reconstruction of the program's
  logframe. The contribution to program enhancement continues through the proposal and
  discussion of the recommendations of the evaluation report, through finance-sector inter-
  governmental performance agreements on commitments and is maintained through budget
  discussionswithin the Executive andwith Congress.
          As an objective, program enhancement appears to be an intermediate result towards the
  achievement of a higher level or final result. Programs are enhancedto either ensure they meet
  their intended goals (effectiveness) or produce those results through a more efficient combination
  of factors --or both. Therefore, efficiency and-above    all-effectiveness in pubic expenditure,
  appear to be final goals of the evaluation system.



                                                  133

        Contribution to policv global change making. M&E systems at ministries of finance can
make-and often do make-a        limited contribution to policy making. Evaluations shed light on
feasibility, costs and effectiveness of current policies. In-depth evaluations are a critical input to
judge whether intended policy results have been achieved or not, whether they need
supplementary or alternative policieslinstruments, or the policy is no longer needed. M&E
systems of ministries of finance do influence each program'swether          strategic planning and
policy implementation; they raise questions and provide recommendations on production
functions. Those questions and recommendations can be taken into account at the time of
assessing such criticalpolicy making factors as the feasibility or the cost-effectivenessof a given
policy implementation strategy. More importantly, the process of program selection i s often
inspired by policy makers and/or by policy making considerations. Moreover, the evaluation
cycle provides significant opportunities for bringing evaluation results to the attention of
policymakers, either at the time of discussing evaluation results and commitments with higher
ministry or service level, at the time of internalbudgetpreparation within the MEF, or at the time
of Executive-Legislative budget discussions.
        Under its current design, influencing policy makingi s one of the initial objectives of the
MEF-based evaluation system. Since the key objective of the evaluation system is quality
 (program) enhancement, the primary sector interlocutors of the evaluation process are program
 managers and program budgeting and other staff at the program level. Higher level policy
 making managers intervene primarily in discussion of the conclusions, recommendations and
 inter-government commitments coming out of the evaluations.
        Monitoring; and control. Monitoring and control of the effectiveness and efficiency of
 government programs i s another objective of the MEF-based evaluation program. However, it i s
 an objective that is essentially at the service of a higher level objective, namely, informing
 budget decisions and enhancing the quality of expenditure. In this sense, the monitoring and
 control function of the MEF system pursues a different purpose, and should be necessarily
 different from the monitoringandcontrol functions of the Contraloria General de la Repdblica or
 the Contaduria.
         Informing; budget decisions. This has to be another explicitly defined objective of the
 MEFevaluation system. Indeed, it is often presentedas two separateobjectives. Dependingon
 the mainuser and the phase of the budget cycle, it can be legitimately <dividedinto the system's
 contribution to budget formulation and the system's contribution to budget discussions idwith
 Congress.
         The MEF evaluation will affect budget decisions primarily by providing information on
 whether a program needs or does not need to be reshaped or should be cancelled.
 Recommendationsfor cancellation do have clear budget consequences. Inthe case of Chile, for
 instance, 12 percent of the programs evaluated were terminated (or not extended in the case of
 pilot or fixed-duration programs) as a result of evaluations.
         It should be noticed, however, that the relationship between evaluation findings and
 budget allocations is far from deterministic. An evaluation that finds substantialshortcomings in
 program designor implementation may lead to increasing budget allocations for that program-
 so as to ensure that the program does indeed deliver its intended objectives-and          vice versa.
 Therefore, the results of the MEF evaluation program should not be measured in terms of
 reductions in budget allocations but in terms of the programs that were recommended to be



                                                  134

cancelled and were cancelled, or the programs that were recommendedto be reformed and were
indeedreformed.
        In sum, the immediate purpose of informing budget decisions is to either cancel or
enhance programs and, if the latter, ensure expenditure effectiveness and efficiency. Inother
words, program enhancement is a higher level objective and quality of expenditure is the final
objective.
        The above analysis leads to the conclusion that the proposed MEF budget-oriented
evaluation system may pursue four objectives that fit the specific mission and primary concerns
of ministries of finance around the world. Those four objectives are: (i)      supporting budget
preparation at MEF; (ii)  informing the discussion of the budget law in Congress; (iii)improving
the managementof public institutions andprograms by the lessons that public officials incharge
of administering and implementing governmental programs and institutions learn from program
evaluation and the analysis of evaluation findings; and (iv) strengthening MEF's capacity to
monitor andcontrol public expenditures.
        The four proposedobjectives have something in common, namely, all of them are meant
to contribuie to "enhancing effectiveness and efficiency in public expenditure." Therefore, the
latter should be acknowledged as the "higher level" or final objective of the system. The final-
if underlying-objective of the MEF-run evaluation system is to enhance the quality of public
expenditureby strengtheningthe government ability to achieve program goals andimproving the
ratio of outputs to inputs. Basedon the experience of countries like Australia or Chile, it can be
expected that the initial emphasis of the new MEF system will be on effectiveness rather than
efficiency. It will gradually switch the balance towards more efficiency considerations as more
sophisticated indicators are developed. Finally, the system will be in a position to more closely
linkprogrameffectivenessandefficiency with sectorandoverall governmentprioritypolicies. It
can take between five andeight years of unintempted government support to bringthe system to
full maturity. Fromthen on the systemwill likely require continuous expansion, adjustment and
improvement. Fortunately, Peru is not new to mediumterm institutional development projects as
demonstrated by the country's sustained support for the building of the integrated financial
managementsystem, SIAF, through several administrations of different politicalcolors.

 (d) Recommendationsfor a phased inapproach to developingsuch a system over the next
 five to eight years.
         Two initial steps can be recommendedon the basis of the very successful experience of
 building Chile's centralized budgetevaluation systemduring the last ten years. Those two steps
 are: (i) developing budget performance management indicators and strategic indicators
          begin
 duringthe next few years, and (ii) introduce pilot reorganization of government expenditures in
 terms of governmentprograms.
         In the case of Peru, budget performance indicators are part of a larger battery of
 mechanismsgearedto enhancingthe quality of public expenditure. Suchabattery includes, inter
 alia, inter-government performance and result agreements (known as CARS) and participatory
 budgeting. This note i s restricted to the analysis of program performance indicators as an
 essential input for the new MEF M&E system. Performance indicators will initially consist of
 inputs (resources, actions) and will gradually evolve towards intermediate and final results. As
 demonstrated by international experience everywhere, developing higher level indicators i s not



                                                135

an easy task. Higher level indicators can only be achieved when budgets and programs are
structured in terms of a logical pyramid that serves as an organizing principle for the entire
public sector.
        The MEF has announced its intention to gradually construct the basis for: Ci)
programmatic budgeting, result indicators and result-informed budget, and ii)strategic program
indicators. Based on the good practices of Australia, Canada and Chile, this note concurs with
the Peruvian authorities in that performance indicators are a sine qua non first step towards
result-informed budget. On the other hand, the note argues that Peru could move to strategic
indicators sooner than the government anticipates. Following the recent experience of Mexico,
the note argues that strategic indicators could be introduced as soon as central governments
agencies, regions or municipalities develop the strategic plansthat are now required by law.
        Peru envisions moving towards programmatic planning and evaluation of results. As a
first step in this direction, the country will introduce performance managementindicators during
the next few years. The country also envisions the development of strategic indicators for key
government plans, at a later time yet to be specified. International goodpractices would support
the phased-in approach selected by the MEF towards gradually building result indicators. By
way of example, it took nearly six years for Chile to move from performance management
indicators to result-basedprogrammatic indicators. On the other hand, the recent experience of
Mexico would support the view that Peru might adopt strategic indicators for sub-national public
expenditure as soon as regional and local governments have adequately prepared strategic plans.
It would not benecessary to wait untilthe country has fully developedperformance management
indicators -or result indicators-for    introducing strategic indicators. The following paragraphs
will discuss inmore depth the proposeddevelopment of performance managementindicators and
program-result indicators
         Performancemanagement indicators. The Peruvian program includes a phased-in design
that starts with improving the production of performance indicators and the use of those
indicators for budget decisions. This section discusses a specific strategy that would increase the
possibility of success for this reform, both for the short and medium term performance
indicators, and for the long term construction of result indicators. The World Bank team
believes that the performance-based budgeting initiative is very important, and that it should
continue. The Ministry of Financeis to be congratulated for its efforts injoining many countries
 around the world indeveloping such a reform. Further, the Ministry should also be proud of its
 significant efforts to draw lessons from international good practices that can serve as reference
 point at this early stage of the reform process.
         Change management for stakeholders' ownership. The World Bank team shares the
 MEF's view that the ultimate test of the success of this reform program will be the extent to
 which budgeting decisions become informedby considerations of the performance of programs.
 This necessitatesmore thanjust the development of better performance measures. Itrequires the
 capacity of various institutions in the government to develop and evaluate performance
 measures, and it requires that decision makers have the incentives to use the measures when
 resource allocation decisions are made. Decision makers' ownership-based         on the benefits of
 performance measurement-is        at least as important as good technical design and elaborate data
 bases.

         The development of an effective measurement system requires that many parts of the
government work together. Sector ministries and sub-national governments must have the
capacity to develop appropriate indicators, the Ministry of Finance must be able to analyze the
appropriateness of those indicators, the President and the Congress must consider
when allocating resources, and audit agencies must be able to evaluateboth the appropriateness
of the indicators and the actual performance of ministries, regions or municipalities relative to
those indicators.
         Phased-in approach. This note endorses the view of the MEF that moving the reform
program to the next (results) level will involve two concurrent and complimentary steps. The
first i s the development of better performance measures and better capacity to produce those
measures throughout the government. The second is to take steps to ensure that the program is a
comprehensive one, involving all important actors in the government, that can be sustainedover
time.
         Training needs. As it is to be expectedfor areformthat is insuch an early stage, there are
indications that substantial capacity-building i s necessary in order to produce better, more
appropriate, indicators. Currently, there is wide variation among the ministries inthe quality of
present indicators, and in the appropriatenessof the goals that those indicators relate to. The
Ministryof Financehas a few staff who have worked hardto improve the quality of indicators,
but it is necessary for more staff to be trained to work initially with the ministries and-
subsequently-with    regional and local governments. This training might follow the precedent
establishedby MEF support for training of investment experts in sector ministries. The Director
of Budget and his staff have made the development of performance indicators a priority, but it is
unclearthe extent to which there is reliable information on which to base fundingdecisions. The
country needs to be prepared to invest on a sustained basis in the development of performance
indicators over the next few years. Identification, pilot testing and evaluation will be needed.
The Congress has historically had neither the staff capacity, the time, or the interest to review
performance indicators. Finally, the Contraloria and the Contaduria have been traditionally
focused on numerical budget control and financial audits, and do not currently have the capacity
to do performance audits. On the other hand, Peru's Integrated Financial Management System
might gradually incorporate performance indicators for purposes of transparency, electronic
filingandcontinuity.
         Actions designed to enhance the quality of indicators in the short run. Given the
importance of the development of better indicators to the success of the reform program, and
since the sustainability of the program requires that the "culture" of performance be present in
line ministries and sub-national governments, the development of the capacity to produce and
analyze performance measure i s a crucial next step. Specifically, it is important that both the
Ministry of Finance and the line ministries develop more technical expertise in developing
performance indicators, from the identification of key mission statements and goals to the
development of measurable indicators of performance.             There are several key actions
recommendedby the World Bank in the interest of developing better indicators in the short run
andincreasingthe probabilityof asustainablesysteminthe longrun.
          While the development of a long-run evaluation culture will take time (as it has in every
other country that has implemented such a system), there are actions that can and should be taken
inthe short runto improve the quality of the measures, which is itself an important factor inthe
developmentof long-run capacity.


                                                 137

(a) Focus on Improving Measures in a Portion of the Government Each Year. Inorder to
    continue the momentum that has already begun, it i s important that the MEF
    communicate to line ministries and sub-national governments the continued importance
    of improving their measurement systems. Considering the limited resources that the
    MEF has to review these indicators, however, we would recommend that internal
    resources be initially devoted to concentrating on a portion of sector ministries and
    regional governments each year, starting with those that have made the most progress to
    date. If the MEF can focus attention on a portion each year (we would recommend one-
    third over each of the next three years), it can target its limited resources to greatest
    effect. In working with sector ministries and regional governments, the MEF should
    focus on rationalizing the relationships between each agency's mission and its
    institutional activities, and developing more appropriate measures to gauge progress in
    meeting goals for each of these activities. Further, the initialset of ministriescanbe used
    as a resourcefor later implementers, and can serve as concreteexamples of the success of
    the program. In this connection, the Bank TAL project will support production of an
    initialset of indicators that canestablishprecedentfor other activities.
(b) Hold Workshops on the Development of a Performance Measurement System. The
    development of greater capacity among the ministries, regional governments and the
    MEF involves training in the development of an appropriate measurement system. To
    this end, the World Bank recommends a one and a half day workshop to: (i)introduce
    staff from the ministries or regional governments and the MEF to the principles of
    performance measurement systems, (ii)     to provide hands-on training in the development
    of mission statements, measurable goals, and performance indicators, and (iii)    to discuss
    other countries' experience in developing similar systems.          The current goals and
    measures for the ministries and regional governments will be used as examples in the
    workshops. The planwould be to divide the ministries andor regional governments into
    three separate groups, and hold three separate workshops. At each of these workshops,
    individuals from the ministries would be matched with staff from the MEF that are
    responsible for the review of that ministry's budget. The MEF and the Bank jointly
     organized the first of these workshops in May 2004, with other workshops to be held in
     early 2005.
 (c) Additional Training for MEF Staff. In addition to these workshops, additional training
     sessions should be scheduled in 2005 for Ministry of Economy and Finance staff. This
     training would be designed to assist staff in the MEF in reviewing the performance
     indicators initially proposed by sectors or included in the budget proposals of ministries'
     or regional governments. This will include, among other things, training on comparative
     metrics, such as benchmarking against other governments, against international
     standards, or against pastperformance.
 (d) Publishing and Emphasizing Performance Indicators for the Fiscal Year 2005 Budget.
                                   -
     The previous actions are designed to improve the quality of measures and the logical
     connection between missions and measures in time for the unveiling of the President's
     budget in mid-November. We would recommend that, beginning FY05, the budget
     highlights the progress that has been made, as a way of building momentum for the
     future. Inaddition, at leasttwice a year (andprobably more frequently inthe future), we
     would recommend that key indicators be highlighted in a report prepared for the



                                              138

       President, the Congress, the rest of government, andthe public. It mightbe convenient to
       differentiate the contents of the proposedreports according to the particular interestof the
       target group.
       From performance to prosam (results) indicators. Looking forward two or three years,
Peru mightbegin movingfrom performance to program-result indicators. The essentialfirst step
towards this level of indicators is to structure the expenditure budget interms of programsrather
than actions or institutions. Perhaps the easiest transition from institutional to programmatic
budgeting is to take the current budget and try to understandto what extent there are programs-
or potential programs- that can be identified and how those identifiable programs fit
requirements for program evaluation (log frame, indicators, etc.). International experience
suggest some notes of caution when examining the traditional budget presentation:

    0  The budget and the SIAF already classify the budget in terms of ministries (more
        specifically a portfolio) and other government agencies. The budget and the SIAF are
        also organized by spending units (unidudes ejecutorus). There are numerous spending
       units, including regional governments.

    0   "Programs" or projects are generally a group of expenditures attached to an agency.
        However, these "programs" do not fit the concept of program for evaluation purposes.
        Besides, the numberof classification digits can also be misleading.
        Strategic indicators. Peru would also like to develop strategic indicators that measure
progressor achievementsof key governmentprograms. This i s a new notionof programs. Under
this heading, "programs" ordinarily correspond to a few ideals or-at       best-goals    that identify
each government's policy emphasis. Typical examples are specific employment, housing or
health goals. "Programs" so defined tend to involve a number of government agencies. Since
these government programs are not formulated with all the conceptual and empirical rigor of a
logical framework, their evaluation can be undertaken while simultaneously advancing the
performancemanagementindicators.
(e) The linkagesbetweenthe MEFand other government M&E systems, particularly those
managedby sector ministries.
        While the development of better indicators is clearly an important factor in developing
long-run capacity, the development of a long-run sustainable system requires other actions that
are designedboth to broaden the mandate for such a system and to increase the incentives for
other parts of the government to develop "ownership" of the system and use performance
measures to makedecisions.
        Reach Out to Other Parts of the Government-Perhaps          the most crucial determinant of
long-term success for the reformprogram will be the development of a "culture" of performance
 across the government. If this culture is to be developed, it is important that the system be
perceived as not just a MEF system, but as part of a comprehensive reform program for the
 Peruvian government. To that end, it is important for the MEFto reach out to other parts of the
 government, particularly those whose support is most important, including the Congress, the
 Office of the President, the audit andcontrol agencies, the statistical agencies, the line ministries,
 the regional governments and the local governments. One of the key goals of this outreach i s to
 develop a system of producing reliable and verifiable indicators on a routine basis, as well as a
 system for reporting those indicators. This outreach should occur as soon as possible, and



                                                   139

concurrently with the development of better indicators for this year's budget process. Certainly
one of the key steps here would be to review the systemof indicators being prepared and/or used
by some sector ministries or regional governments with an eye toward reconciling them with the
indicators usedfor the budget system.
        Draft aPerformanceMeasurementLaw to bePassedbyCongress-A keydeterminantof
sustainability has been the codification of the requirements to develop strategic plans and
performance measures. This would seem to be a desirable step for Peru, to guard against the
system being perceived as either (i)  solely an executive branch system, or (ii)system that is
                                                                                a
associatedonly with this MEF. This law need not be highly detailed, as its main purpose is to
serve as a "motivator" of continued effort. Furthermore, the law proposal should be prepared
after at least one year of experimentation with the new system. Inthis way, the law will reflect
the lessonsfrom pilot testing.
        Think About Necessarv Incentives for the Use of Performance Measures-While
certainly some part of the government may make greater use of performance measures because it
i s "the right thing to do", experience in other governments shows that it i s important to think
through incentives for the use of measures. For example, the line ministries may view either
additional managerial flexibility or additional resources as a "reward' for being held more
accountable for results. Similar questions concerning incentives need to be asked for the
Congressandcontrol agencies, amongothers.
Ifthegoalofthereformprogram,asnotedastheoutset,istheestablishmentofasystemthat
institutionalizes the use of performance information throughout the budget process, it is
important that both capacity and sustainability be pursued and developed concurrently.         In
particular, it seems prudent for the MEFto place itself in a position where it can be preparedto
make a greater substantivecontribution to the debate about government performance by the time
that the next President takes office in 2006. Each of the actions outlined above would seem
consistent with that intermediate goal, as well as the long-term goal of having more decisions
 about allocating resourcesinformedby performance.

                Annex VIII: Accreditation of Regional and Local Governments
        The transfer of responsibilities and resourcesto regional and local levels of governments
can be the most important challenge indesigningand implementing an effective decentralization
model. Within the fiscal federalism model, of the three functions assigned to the public sector,
namely macroeconomic stabilization, income redistribution, and resource allocation, generally
only the last function can be transferred to regional and local governments with the goal of
optimizing allocative efficiency. Indesigning intergovernmental fiscal relations andinparticular
the transfer system, the principles of subsidiarity, economies of scale and scope and institutional
and fiscal capacity need to be balanced. International experience indicates that a strategy is
needed to mitigate key risks including: (i)    asymmetry between assigned responsibilities and
revenues and expenditures, potentially leading to duplication, inefficiencies and macroeconomic
deficits; (ii)deterioration of service delivery; (iii) accountability due to a mismatch
                                                       limited
between transferred responsibilities and resources; and (iv) politicization of the transfer process
by which political interests prevail over technical and fiscal criteria, which can jeopardize the
sustainability of the decentralization process.
        Peru has chosen an unusual and innovative path to the transfer of competences and
resources.    Regional and local governments must meet an accreditation requirement to
demonstrate that they have the sufficient management capacity to exercise the functions and
resources being transferred. The accreditation system aims to ensure an orderly and gradual
transfers process and thereby facilitates gradualism in the decentralization process - one of the
three guiding principles of decentralization in Peru. This emphasis on gradualism also helps to
limitthe risks associatedwith decentralization. Principal amongsttheserisks are the fiscal risks
that endanger the fiscal sustainability of the decentralization process.         As a result that
accreditation system also reinforces the another guiding principle of Peru's decentralization
model, the goal of fiscal neutrality. By making competitiveness an important requirement for
accreditation, the system is based on the third guiding principle, the goal of using the
decentralization process to promote regional and local competitiveness. The accreditation
process can be an important instrument to manage the overall transfer process given the unclear
functional assignment expressed in the existing legal framework where shared, quite general
responsibilities abound.     The threat of political interference is a continuing risk to the
accreditation processthat continuous mitigation.
         Conceptually, we can distinguishbetween two different and mutually reinforcingtypes of
 accreditation over time. Accreditation ex-ante i s designed as an instrument to monitor and
 evaluate regional and local management capacity at a specific point in time after which, if the
 assessment i s positive, resources and responsibilities can be transferred to regional and local
 governments. Accreditation ex-post i s a mechanism to monitor and evaluate management
 capacity over time on the basis of management agreements and with the possibility of
 withdrawing accreditation in extreme cases and allowing for a higher level of government to
 carry out the specific responsibilities on behalf of a lower level of government. Management
 agreements between higher and lower levels of governments thus reinforce accreditation and
 help to ensure the adequate transfer and management of resources and responsibilities. In both
 cases, there i s the need to certify regional and local governments based on their capacity and
 performance, with the first type of accreditation being a more static one referring to a
 managementcapacity at a specific point of time, andthe secondone more dynamic, allowing for
 incentives to improve performanceover time.


                                                  141

        International experience on the transfer of resources and responsibilities is rich.
However, there i s very limited experience on accreditation, let alone accreditation linked to
performance managementcontracts. A few countries have experimented with a type of sectoral
accreditation by establishing certain minimum requirements for the transfer of responsibilities
and resources in a specific sector. Brazil has used such a mechanism in the health sector with
mixed results. Inother regions, the experience has been to condition the transfer of resourcesto
the adequate managementof functions for a limited period of time, coupled with strong capacity-
strengthening. South Africa has used such a model. And in other countries, unlike Peru, that
have a taken a big-bang approach to decentralization no specific accreditation requirements
existed. Lessonslearned from the Colombian experience-the most relevant for the Peruvians-
indicate that a simple, transparent and dynamic system, i s required. The Colombian experience
also demonstratesthe needfor independentand objective implementation of the systemto ensure
that it will be immune from political influence.      However, there are no international best
practices available and only very limited literature relevant to accreditation. As latecomers to
decentralization, Perumay be able to innovate a systemwith important lessonsfor the design and
management of decentralization. On the other hand, there might be reasons why other countries
have so far not attemptedto establish such an ambitious system.
        A simplified and provisional system for accreditation applicable on to the
decentralization of social programs is currently being implemented in Peru given that a
comprehensive system is not yet in place. The decentralization of social programs is the first
stage of the governments transfers system.      For 2003 and 2004 transfers, several regulations
have been approved by MIMDES and the CND that provide the legal framework for this
provisional accreditation system governing the decentralization of social programs. To date 67
provinces have been accredited under this simplified version for the transfer of food programs
and 241 for the transfer of social infrastructure programs. Another group of municipalities is
currently awaiting accreditation -particularly for social fund-type projects.
         The transfer of food programs to municipalities i s now advancing. For 2004, the
proposedbudget for the transfer of food programs to the 67 provincialmunicipalities amounts to
 S/.26,700,000.   Similarly, the budget for the transfer of social fund projects to 241 district
 municipalities i s projected at S/.47,900,000.  In the case of food programs, 64 management
 contracts have been signedbetween the MIMDES and the provincial governments. Another 27
 have been signed between the MIMDES and local governments for the transfer of Social Fund
 resources. These managementcontracts aim to ensure more efficient and effective management
 of resources and guarantee minimumlevels of service-delivery. The contracts specify resources
 transferred, the purpose for which they can be used, targets that need to be complied with and
 monitoring requirements to be submitted periodically to the MIMDES. Another 58 provincial
 municipalities and 165 district municipalities are expected to receive the transfer of the
 respective food and social fund projects later this year.         These transfers will also be
 complemented by management contracts, signed between the MIMDES and these local
 governments, andlinkedto the accreditation process.
         After long delays in the elaboration of the accreditation law, the law has finally been
 approved by Congress on June 16, 2004. The law sets the legal framework for accreditation
 across sectors starting with the current year's transfer plan. The underlying substantial
 divergences on the need for accreditation, the process, methodology and its monitoring have
 resultedina law that is quite diverse inits content and formulation.



                                                 142

        The accreditation law reflects the consensus reachedon various highly diverging issues -
accreditation is understood as the processrangingfrom the demand for the transfer of resources,
the fulfillment of the accreditation requirements, the accreditation itself, the transfer of functions
and resources to conflict resolution and the possible signing of cooperation agreements between
parties. Contrary to earlier views, the law addresses both regional and local governments. It
aims at certifying the management capacity of regional and local governments for
decentralization on the basis of technical and transparent criteria, and to create management
information systems for decentralized public management. To be accredited regional and local
governments need to fulfill certain sectoral, fiscal and management requirements, including a
number of mainly institutional and administrative conditions. These conditions are based on a
formalistic approach for most cases including a development plan, an institutional development
plan, aparticipatory planandbudget, but also the fulfillment of the rules of fiscal transparency -
conditions which are simplified for poor municipalities. The criteria for the elaboration of
management indicators are quite broad and weak stretching from management capacity, fiscal
and economic management, competitivenessand transparency and participation. The CND has
been given the leadership role for the design, execution and monitoring of the accreditation
process yet the possibility of outsourcing the decision on the fulfillment of the accreditation
requirementsexists as well. There i s no linkto the managementcontracts or other specific M&E
arrangements, but the law foreseesthe possibility of medium-term framework agreementsfor the
transfer of resources.

Recommendations
         The accreditation law stipulates the elaboration of respective regulations as a means to
 specify further detail.    The regulations are currently being elaborated by the CND, in
 consultation with the MRF and line ministries. The Government might want to consider
 including the following suggestions into the regulations. Priority should be given to the first two
 beingDECSAL triggers.
         Use of SIAF for accreditation: A greater role for the SIAFmodule inthe verification of
 criteria for accreditation which would include avoiding duplication in management information
 systems and ensuring greater linkages between the information managedbetween the SIAF and
 the proposedsystemby the CND. To ensure an efficient system that avoids any duplication, it i s
 recommended to rely on existing instruments and institutions. This would give the MEF an
 important role in accreditation, in consultation with other relevant actors. It would also call for
 the use of the SIAF as the key instrument for accreditation, instead of creating a parallel
 information systeminother institutions.
          Public disclosure of the accreditation assessments:        For greater transparency, this
 could include publication of the requirementsof the accreditation system, progress achieved, and
 the names and achievement of those regional and local governments already accredited. On a
 website, such as MEF's Consulta Amigable, objectives and indicators of the accreditation
 process could be disseminated and additional information made accessible to citizens on the
 status of accreditation of each regional and local government, specifying where each stands in
 terms of complying with the selected requirements. The example of South Africa regarding
 transparency can serve as a best practice in this area. Transparency of the process could be
 further improved if the accreditation of regional and local governments could also be made
 public through a legal norm, such as a ministerial resolution or a supremedecree.



                                                 143

        Other weaknesses: The regulations could also be an opportunity to address some other
weaknesses of the law:
        Management of the accreditation system: The regulations should emphasize the need
to make the accreditation system as simple, efficient and cost-eflective as possible thereby
avoiding large, lengthy and bureaucratic hurdles. A simple and cost-effective process would
ensure that the transfer of responsibilities takes place ina gradual andfiscally responsivemanner
while maintaining accountability, fiscal discipline and a match between the functions and
financing of service-delivery... The government may want to consider revising the institutional
arrangements, strengthening the outsourcing component and limiting the redesigning
responsibilities of the CND. It is recommended that the government examine whether it is
prudent for the CND to be responsible for designing the system, deciding on the accreditation
and the arbiter for the resolution of conflicts. This also calls for a qualified consensus on the
accreditation process between different institutions to ensure the credibility and viability of the
process.
         Monitoring: The accreditation process needs to be supervised closely. A focus on
monitoring and evaluation needs to be introduced into the regulations, and the system should
allow for the transformation of the accreditation system into a system of monitoring and
evaluation, includingsolid systems of reporting and accounting. A revision of the accreditation
should take place periodically to ensure that any feedback from the M&E can be incorporated
into the process and that potential initial shortcomings can be corrected swiftly. Other essential
rules of the game regarding M&E include strong participatory and transparency components,
includingparticipatory monitoring and wide consultations with civil society. Regulations should
clearly indicate how the monitoring of the accreditation system would be integrated into the
M&Esystemset upatthe MEF. Inthis respect, itis important that the monitoringof fiscal rules
i s an integral part of the accreditation process.
         Link to management agreements: To ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of
transfers, and to promote greater fiscal discipline and to introduce a greater focus on results,
especially in service delivery, the accreditation system should be linked to management by
results. The accreditation system would provide an ex-ante focus and management contracts
would then ensureex-post accreditation, allowingthe transformation of the accreditation process
into an effective system for budgeting, reporting and M&E. Accreditation should thus be linked
bothto the CARSandthe CdGs with the former likely to integrate the latter over time. Elements
of these management contracts therefore need to be integrated in and linkedto the Cooperation
Agreements included in the Law to facilitate the management of the accreditation process ex-
ante and ex-post.
         Sequencing:There is a needto better regulate the link between accreditation-by-demand
based on the requests of regional and local governments and accreditation-by-supply based on
decisionsthrough the annualtransfer line. Inparticular, the link betweenthe annualtransfer plan
 and the accreditation should be reinforced to ensure a match between the responsibilities and
resources transferredand to avoid duplication. Incentives need to be establishedfor regional and
local governments to obtain their accreditation - while making the demand voluntary - and for
the central government to gradually advance with the accreditation process through a carefully
planned offer of functions and programs to be decentralized           Inline with planned change
 management activities, it might be helpful to integrate into the accreditation process some
 elements of change management to reduce resistances and make the transfer process more


                                                   144

sustainable. Inlightof the resistancesalready surrounding accreditation at the regional and local
andeven the central levels, it would be useful to design and carry out a communication strategy
before and during the implementation of the system to ensure that stakeholders can be brought
on board, regional and local governments can be convinced of the need for the accreditation
process, its compatibility with their autonomy and civil society can be made an important ally to
promote the needfor and effectiveness of the accreditation process. Such a strategy should also
communicate the incentives for accreditation and the continued status of accreditation, as the
examples of Colombia and Mexico show regarding the needfor such incentives.
       Continuity of accreditation and linkages to the simplified accreditation process for
social programs: A stronger link with the existing simplified accreditation system for social
programs i s required to ensure the continuity of the process and that those regional and local
governments already accredited do not lose their accreditation. The emphasis on national
minimum sector standards should be emphasized to ensure adequate levels of service-delivery.
The possibility of an intervention similar to the interventions in fiscal decentralization should be
regulated with the possibility of a de-accreditation as a ultimate ratio, similar to the intervention
model in the legal framework for fiscal decentralization. This also calls for greater capacity-
strengthening of regional and local governments to be ready for their accreditation and their
transfer of functions and resources.       Capacity-strengthening, coordinated and particularly
outsourced by the CND and MEF, could play an important role in this regard, building on
existing activities. Similarly, to ensure continuity in the accreditation process, the regulations
should stipulate arrangements for accreditation for the new macro-regions to clarify how an
existing accreditation given to one jurisdiction can be extended to another one. For example,
once departments, possibly partially accredited, merge to regions it will have to be decided if
accreditation is extendedto the newly formedjurisdiction. This also applies-to a lesser extent -
to associationsof municipalities which mightco-finance projects.
       Accreditation requirements and indicators: There are three major types of
accreditation indicators - public management capacity, fiscal discipline and sectoral
requirements. While it might be technically useful to include a broad range of institutional,
fiscal and sectoral requirements - this may make the system more difficult to manage, monitor
and `sell politically'. A complex set of requirements increasesthe risk that the system will be
overburdened and collapse technically or politically. The political risk associated with the
system is sufficient given the resistance from regional and local governments that feel the
accreditation process infringes upon their autonomy. With respect to indicators, it would be
useful to distinguish between process (e.g. participation) and result indicators.               It is
recommended that the indicators selected retain a strong focus on results providing both
minimumstandardsfor outcomes anda gradual `raising of the bar' towards higher performance.
Inthis sense, it can be useful to think of both ex-ante and ex-post indicators. Given the
asymmetries existing between regional and local governments, a decision also needs to be taken
on whether to establish uniform criteria for all criteria or a weighted system that allocates
differential weight to indicators basedon importance. For example, inline with the methodology
established taking into account the heterogeneity of municipalities. International experience
suggests that the system should be simple by avoiding numerous indicators that will be difficult
to verify and monitor. Proposals stemming from sectoral ministries which aim at introducing a
variety of criteria and indicators into the accreditation system should therefore be avoided.
Additionally, the formalistic criteria established for the accreditation process, such as the
elaboration of a multitude of plans for the accreditation, could be simplified to ensure a move


                                                 145

towards results-oriented and operational activities which are more likely to have a substantial
impact inpractice. This is particularly important as regional and local governments are required
to prepare quite a number of these plan, often in short time, without having clear standards or
best practices to model their plan to or on the other side to ensure that they are not uniform
across a given region, but are responsiveto local needs.
        In the ensuing months it will be crucial to provide the following support as the system
will be designedandinitiated:

   0    Design of the regulations of the accreditation law and complementary norms in the
        Budget Law;
   0    Capacity-strengthening at the central level to establish such a system, for example by
        providing support to the MEF-SIAF and in elaborating a sound M&E system for fiscal
        decentralization areas relatedto accreditation;
   0    Capacity-strengthening to regional and local governments to achieve accreditation and
        establish soundbudgeting, reporting andM&Esystems; and
   0    Support to civil society to monitor the transparent design and implementation of the
        systemwhich includes periodic independent reviews.

   Annex IX: Government CompetitivenessAgenda and Product Quality Enhancement

         The objective of this annex i s to provide background information on some of the major
constraints that prevent Peruvian roducts from accessing and competing effectively in new
markets.     The key determinants for a successful supply portfolio are related to quality,
diversification and competitive prices. To address these issues the government is implementing
a battery of policies to improve quality, facilitate technology transfer and innovation, lower costs
through cluster and productive chains promotion, and increase labor productivity. These areas
have been identified by prior studies74as key obstacles to productivity and economic activity in
Peru (see Annex Box 1). Although there have been important advances in some areas, others
still need considerable improvements. Thus the annex will review the government program
focusing inthe four areas, andidentify the mainchallenges ahead.

         The recently created Ministry of Production (PRODUCE) has signed in June 2004 an agreement, the
 Carta Productiva, with the main private sector commerce and industrial chambers and export organizationsin
 Peru, which identifies six strategic guidelines for the sector and several short and medium-term implementation
 measures. The six strategic guidelines are the following:

A. Quality:ImprovingNormComplianceandQualityCertificationof PeruvianProducts

A.l BackgroundandDiagnosis
          Ininternational marketsquality has increasingly become acrucial determinant of success.
Intoday's global economy, akey prerequisitefor access to new markets is product conformance
to recognized international standards demonstrated through testing at qualified (accredited)
laboratories, good practices inprocessingproducts that affect safety or health, and standards that
show that management systems are in place to assure the production process is under control at
all times. Firms without the certification to prove the quality of their products are finding it more
difficult to access markets?'
          The low levels in quality standards adoption and demand for certification and metrology
services are a significant challenge in Peru. Although Peruvian quality norms are largely based
on international standards, there does not appear to be a strong awareness of the significance of
andneedfor quality managementthroughout Peru's industries. Overall, most Peruvian products
show low quality and rarely comply with standards and basic norms required to access world
markets. This is the result of a very inward looking industrial sector that has traditionally
focusedon a relatively smalllocalmarketthat i s highly sensitive to price as opposedto quality.
          As of December 2002, only 270 enterpriseshave beenawardedIS0 9000 certifications7'
Colombia has seven times as many I S 0 9000 enterprises as Peru, while Brazil has 30 times as
many. These figures should take into account that Latin America has proportionately the least
number of certified enterprises. Of the worldwide total of more than 560,000 certified firms in
2002, the Latin America region has 2.9 percent lagging behind other regions such as Australia
andNew Zealand with 5.2 percent andvery close to other regions such as Africa andthe Middle
East with 2.4 percent. Peru's certifications represent less than 2 percent of South and Central
America's total. Still Peru ranks fifth ina sample of 33 Latin American countries inthe number
of I S 0 9000 and is the country that shows the largest rate of growth in this respect in the last
three years.
           These poor results are also confirmed by the 2003 ICA based on a survey of
manufacturing firms.          In the sample less than 12 percent of all firms had some type of
certification (most often HACCP, primarily for food handling). Only 2.6 percent had I S 0
certification. By comparison, 17 percent of Brazilian firms, 31 percent of Malaysian firms and
50 percent of Chinese firms had acquired I S 0 certification as shown in the corresponding ICA
studies.77
           According to INDECOP17', there are three main factors explaining the low participation
of Peruvian firms in the quality system: (i)          the high cost of getting certified due to the lack of
local certification firms internationally accredited; (ii)              the insufficient supply of consulting


75. Standards compliance is usually accomplished through some type of certification scheme administered by
     independent third-party certifying bodies and their assessors. I n turn, the qualifications of certifying bodies are
     verified by nationaland international accreditingorganizations.
76. The IS0 Survey of I S 0 9000 and I S 0 14001Certificates.
77. According to the (non official) Register of the Centro de Desarrollo Industrial (CDI), in July 2004 there were
     approximately200 firms certified with I S 09001:2000 and 25 certified with HACPP.

services for SMEs on technical norms adoption; and (iii) limited access to information about
                                                          the
the benefits of quality managementsystems, such as I S 0 9000.


         The weakness of the Peruvian firms in adopting quality standards partly reflects the
country's lack of an integrated system for quality management at the national level and a major
private or public sector institution to champion the "quality agenda".         Although all the
components of a national metrology normalization, accreditation and certification system
(MNAC) havebeeninplacewith INDECOPIsince 1992,the institutionhas yet to establish itself
as a key player in the promotion of quality standards. Similarly, even though the availability of
calibration services does not appear to be a problem, the credibility of the laboratory
accreditation scheme is questionable given that laboratories are not required to demonstrate their
regular participation to inter-laboratory comparisons (round robin) and proficiency testing as
required by intemational standards. These deficiencies apply in turn to two other government
institutions that are critical for agricultural exports' certification: SENASA for unprocessed
agricultural commodities and DIGESA for processed foods. These institutions, of particular
relevance for the agro-industry sectors, lack capacity and speed of response to the ever
increasing demands of producers for the phyto-sanitary certificates required by international
buyers and need to clarify their respective responsibilities in certain overlapping areas.
Moreover, they have limited institutional reciprocity agreements and programs with other
countries, essentialto facilitate access.

A.2 The Government Program: Norms, Standards andQuality Promotion
         The Government program is seeking to address these shortcomings in the quality system
through improvements in three areas: institutional strengthening and planning, increasing
demandawareness andfostering improvements inquality services supply.

Institutional Strengthening and Planning: A first step towards the initiation of an integrated
system of quality management at a national level will be the creation of a National Quality
Council involvingpublic sector institutions, universities andprivate business associations, under
the coordination of INDECOPI given its role as administrator of the national metrology,
 accreditation andstandardssystems.
         The government is also working on quality norms and standards design and management
 and on the implementation of several other mechanisms to improve coordination among the
 various public sector institutions involved:

         0  DIGESA is inthe processof updating andadoptingnew sanitary norms;
            SENASA is simplifying procedures to improve certification of sanitary norm
            compliance for agricultural processes;
         0  the Ministry of Production is implementing the Plan Nacional de Normalizacidn
            Productiva, aimed at coordinating with INDECOPI the issuance of industrial norms,
            andthe mechanismsto inspecttheir fulfillment inthe caseof compulsory norms; and
         0  INDECOPI continues to develop norms and standards with the support of a large
            number of technical committees, prioritizingsectors with higher export potential (see
            Annex Box 2).




                                                 149

Box2. INDECOPI'sNormalization Activity
         Inthe past years, INDECOPIhas continued to develop norms and standards for industrial sectors with
the help of technical committees, prioritizing those with higher export potential. To cope with the increased
sophistication of many industrial processes, the number of such committees has augmented significantly over
the past few years. They are formed by professional, administrative and academic experts that provide support
in the discussion and definition of new regulations. Even though the number of newhevised technical norms
has not increased drastically (approximately 200/year, out of more than 3,600 industrial norms effective in
2003), the increasedtechnological complexity requires a more detailed and comprehensive regulation. A rough
indicator of this complexity is given by the extension (measured by number of pages) of the new technical
norms. The total number of newhevised norms went from 202 in 2002 to 214 in 2003, a mere 6 percent, while
the extension went fiom 3,510 to 3,940 pages, a 12percent increase.

      Note: (*) Goal
      Source:INDECOPI

          Even though Peruvian firms lag behind in adopting technical standards and quality systems, as shown
in the table, there are some indications that quality awareness (roughly measured by information requests or
sales of norms) has increased over the last years.

          Standardization and improved and verifiable quality have contributed, together with other factors, to
increasedexports ina certain number o f sectors. At the same time, exporting prospects in some sectors provide
incentives for the publication of norms that incorporate international standards.




Increasing Demand Awareness For Eflective Quality Practices:                       Several quality certification
 assistance campaigns targeted at the SME sector to deepen awareness of technical norms and
 quality standards have been launched or are beingupgraded andexpanded. Several government
 departments are involved, for instance, the program Exporta Peru i s hostedby PROMPEX; and
 the program Comprdle a1 Peru and initiative Marcas colectivas or the Ley Marc0 de Consejos
 Reguladores de las Denominaciones de Origen, are hosted by PRODUCE. They provide a
 quality seal to enterprisesthat are able to meet certain manufacturing and marketing standards or
 that are produced in an well defined geographical area using some traditional elaboration
 techniques.

 Fostering Improvements In Quality Services Supply: Peruvian firms face four main problems
 regarding the supply of quality services: (i)         they do not have easily accessible information with
 respect to who provides testing and product and process certification services; (ii)              most quality
 certification providers lack international recognition, that is, they have not being accredited
 according to international standards; (iii)        testing and accreditation services are mostly provided

in the Lima region; and (iv) overall there is insufficient supply of laboratories appropriately
equippedandaccreditedto undertake specializedtesting inaccordanceto internationalstandards.

        The Government is developing several lines of action to strengthenthe supply of quality
certification services:

        0    PRODUCE in coordination with INDECOPI, is implementing a Register of
             institutions accredited to certify compliance with technical norms and regulations.
             This i s one of the main programs of the Plan Nacional de NomzalizacidnProductiva
             recently approved.
        0    A new general regulation has beenissuedinMarch 200479that unifies criteria in the
             National Accreditation systemaccording to international standards.
        0    A technical assistance andtraining scheme will be developed for private laboratories
             andprivate entities providingcertification services to facilitate their accreditation. A
             program of inter-laboratory comparisons at national and international levels will be
             implemented with the objective to foster mutualrecognition agreementsbetweenthe
             various actors, promote best practices and help bring all testing laboratories up to
             standard.
         0   To deal with the insufficient supply of laboratories special efforts will concentrate on
             the equipment upgrading of both SENASA andDIGESA.
         0   Certain productive chains with higher export potential and in particular those related
             to ATPDEA, such as wood, ago-industry, apparel and leather and shoes are in need
             of those services.*'       Since for each of these productive chains there are related
             Centros de Innovaci6n Tecnol6gica (CITEs), a quick and effective impact can be
             attained by concentrating efforts in strengthening and, in some cases helping to
             create, the corresponding sector oriented laboratories and promoting their
             accreditation under the norm I S 0 17025. The actions being considered by the
             government include the provision of specialized equipment for CITEs laboratories;
             professional and technical training in laboratory testing methodology and managerial
             processes, through grants in foreign laboratories with international accreditation; and
             the linkage of each CITE with a laboratories' network of excellence, that will provide
             credibility to their testing in international markets. The objective for the next three
             years i s to have six laboratories accredited with the quality norm IS0 17025,two in
             wood -one in VES-Lima and another in the CITE of hcallpa; two in agro-industry,
             one in textile-garment and the last one in leather-shoes. The services are targetedto
             SMEs inthe selectedproduction chains which are export oriented.*l

 80. At the moment there are few laboratories serving the demands of these sectors. During 2002, 160 laboratory
    tests were done in oenology and 68 more in vine producing. That same year the laboratory of CITEccal in the
    leather and shoe sector met the demands of 441 firms, by performing 7,412 tests. Inagro-industry the supply o f
    accredited laboratory testing is very limited in the regions. Apart from L a Molina Calidad Total laboratory,
    certain specific experiments that can be done by PUCP and UNMSM. In textile-apparel, there is a CITE
    laboratory not yet accredited; a private lab, Certintex, that supplies large firms; and facilities of UNI with
    obsolete equipment and small growth potential. Finally, for the wood sector there is no lab providing quality
    testing for input materials, woodwork or finished products.
 81. Given the rising requirements on the fulfilment of technical norms, it is estimated that laboratory testing will
    represent an increasingly important service demanded from CITEs. Existing programs such as PedEmprende

A.3 Further Challenges for the Quality System inPeru
        Challengesmay be summarizedinthree dimensions:

        0   Developing an integrated National Quality System by: coordinating information
            about norms issued at different instances; better delimitating the respective roles of
            SENASA and DIGESA; and centralizing the Registry of accredited institutions for
            testing and process and product certification, including not only industrial but
            agricultural production. The creation of the National Council of Quality could be an
            important step inthis direction.
        0   Increasing awareness of the international importance of quality management by:
            developing a quality culture; andpromotingquality standards adoption among SMEs.
            INDECOPI should adapt standard quality management procedures to the
            characteristicsof SMES.~~
        0   Building testing and certification capacity properly accredited according to
            international standards by: providing incentives for accreditation and quality service
            provision; developing a program for international mutualrecognition of accreditation
            entities; collaborating with regional governments to ensure ample regional coverage
            of quality services.


B. Innovation andR&D: DevelopingTechnologicalInnovation

B.l BackgroundandDiagnosis
        Developing the capability to generate andmanagetechnological change and innovation i s
one important challenge for Peru inthe coming years. The urgent needto develop technological
innovation and to ensure that firms make productive use of it, is demonstrated by the fact that
Peru's overall performance in technology i s far below all other Latin American countries and
income comparators. According to the World Economic Forum 2003 (WEF)83,out of 102
countries Peru ranks 79 in firm-level technology absorption and 67 in technological
sophistication. Inthe Latin American region only Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay, as well as
three more Central American countries (Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras) rate worse than
Peru inthese technology-related dimensions.
        The findings of the WEF analysis are confirmedby various other data. Peru investment
intechnology andinnovationis extremely low evencomparedto other LatinAmerican countries.
However, the experience of industrialized countries, and even the limited evidence for some
developing countries, show the importance of innovation as the shift to a knowledge-based
economy accelerates andthe globalization processintensifies. OECD countries spendbetween 1
and4 percentof GNPinR&D expenditures, nearly two thirds of which is financed by the private
sector. The US spends approximately 2.7 percent of its GNP on R&D, and Canada around 1.8

    and Fondo INCAGRO, or the new innovation program that is under discussion with IDB, will help stimulate
    the use of these services.
82. The programCERTIpyme is already developing a similaridea. It is runby a consortium formed by COPEME
    (a NGO consortium with high impact among SMEs), Quality Consulting (a consulting firm with experience in
    quality systems for the public and private sector) and CERPER (a private firm accredited as a certifier for
    quality systems).

percent. By contrast, levels of expenditure for bigger Latin American countries (Argentina,
Mexico) are less than 1 percent of their GNP, and get to less than 0.1 percent of GNP in the
smaller countries. Peru invested 0.11 percent of its GDP in research and development in 2000,
which is far below the average of 0.58 percent invested by the Latin American and Caribbean
region during that year.84 This level is one of the lowest in the region, close to Ecuador and well
below Brazil(1.05 percent), Chile (0.56 percent) or CostaRica(0.35 percent).

        Available data indicate that the situation in Peru has drastically deteriorated in the last
decades: total R&D expenditures decreased from US$118.63 million in 198085to US$41.68
million in 1999.86 Inthe decade 75-85 national R&D reached about 0.26 percent of GDP, but
spending collapsed to less than 0.025 percent of GDP in the mid-1990s. The effects still linger
in terms of very low R&D spending, low rates of capital goods imports and of international
licensing activity.
        This sharp reduction not only reflects the dramatic shrinking of the R&D budgets of
public institutions in the last two decades (amounting in 2003 to no more than
US$2lmillion/year), but also the decline in FDI, an important vehicle for technology transfer in
Peru. In the last five years the level of FDI has fallen dramatically from the height of the
privatization of the utility sectors.            In Peru, beyond the immediate benefits of increased
production and employment, foreign companies can facilitate technology transfer and the
adoption of managerial and technical skills by domestic firms.                     Moreover, they can serve as
incubatorsfor small and mediumenterprises associatedto their productive chains.

           Not surprisingly, the Peruvian national innovation system(NIS) is very fragile andhighly
  fragmented. It is mainly made up by universities, research institutes, a relatively low number of
  firms investing in innovation, and governmental agencies in the area, in particular the National
  Council of Science and Technology (CONCYTEC) and the Ministry of Production
  (PRODUCE), with its associatednetwork of technology centres (RedCITES).
           Inthe past years, allocation of the country's science and technology resourceswithin the
  system has not been driven by well specified priorities or has resulted from a competitive
  mechanism among the NIS participants. An important share of the scarce public resources has
  been assigned to various public institutions with no well defined objectives or performance
  evaluation. A major portionof the funding for these institutions i s allocated via budgetary inertia
  and/or earmarking. This is the case for public universities or for the various technological and
  research institutes, most of which are linked to different sector ministries. Very few obtain
  significant revenues from applied projects for the private sector or the sale of their technological
  services, thus their survival depends almost exclusively on public budgets. Overtime these
  institutions have had little incentive to identify, much less respond, to industry demand for
  research and technological services. They remain disconnectedfrom the industry needs, and are
  essentially unaccountable for their expenditures. As a result, investment in R&D is highly
  concentrated in basic research and applied research, two areas where the public sector tends to
  d~nlinate.'~However, only about 13 percent of the total R&D budget i s dedicated to
  experimental development, an important activity that leads to product and processimprovement.




  87. CONCYTED has very limited funds, approximately US$2 million per year, to finance R&D projects, in
        comparisonwith the resources allocatedby universities and other institutions.

        Inindustrialized or the newly industrialized countries, such as USA, Canada and Spain,
Korea, Finland, Ireland, Israel, the highest share of R&D expenditure comes from the private
sector. InPeru, government has remained a dominant source of R&D expenditure, although this
has changed in the past decades. In 1980, firms only contributed with 2.2 percent (Arregui and
Torero, 1991), while by 1999, the participation of firms was 42 percent, universities 30 percent,
andresearchinstitutions 28 percent (CONCYTEC, 2001).

        According to the 2003 ICA survey, for manufacturing Peruvian firms, acquisition of new
machinery or equipment is the most important channel for technology introduction. 47 percent
of them use this method, a percentage quite low when compared to that of 60 percent in
Bangladesh, and above 70 percent observed in Ecuador or other Central American countries.
Other relevant channels to innovate include employment of key personnel and adaptation of
existing technology within the firm-these                       two means being less relevant in Peru than in other
Latin American countries, and especially than in the East Asian economies.                             Technology

licensing, which is a common mean of innovation in East Asian economies, i s not widespread
amongPeruvian firms either. Only 2 percent of them include technology licensing as one of the
three most importantchannels of innovation. In addition, licensing or turnkey operations from
domestic sources are also uncommon.
         These micro data are consistent with the observed low level of imports of capital goods
as a share of GDP and also with the relatively low royalty payments. This suggests that firms are
not investing heavily in either embodied technology (through machinery and equipment) or in
processinnovations through technology transfer agreements.

         In terms of patents, usually an indicator-albeit               imperfect-of the degree of innovative
capacity, Peru ranks low in absolute terms and even when compared to countries with similar
income per capita. While most Latin American countries exhibit rates of innovative activity
 much lower than those of the East Asian economies-Korea                       has 810 patents registered in the
U.S. for every 10 million population, compared to 10.7 for Argentina, Peru's performance i s
 among the lowest of the region with only 1.1 patents per 10million inhabitants, almost six times
 less than the LatinAmerican average.
         Despite recent efforts by PRODUCE and CONCYTEC, Peru is lacking a clear definition
 of science andtechnology policy and increased steady collaboration and coordination among the
 different agents of its fragmented innovation system. Peruvian firms rarely use any form of
 cooperation-with        clients or suppliers, industry associations-to           introduce innovations. Firms'
 weak integration in the productive chain, which i s a common pattern in Central and Latin
 American countries, prevent them (especially MSMEs), from benefiting from economies of
 scale, knowledge spillovers and joint learning and innovation. Not surprisingly, technological
 linkages among firms, universities and other research institutions are also missing in Permg8
 Public-private project collaboration is weak and few universities and labs offer technological
 services to the private sector, since most of these institutions have insufficient capacity and
 obsoleteequipment.

 88.  Interestingly, ICA's findings show that micro and small firms were more than twice as likely as other firms to
      list universities and public sector institutions as sources of technology growth. These firms were concentrated
       inthe wood and furniture sectors.

        Insum, it appears that severalfactors account for the relatively poor position of Peru in
terms of technological competitiveness: extremely low investment in research and development
and poor linkages within firms andbetweenthe public sectorresearchinstitutions andthe private
sector. Other factors that contribute as well to firms' low levels of productivity are the labor
force's low quality of education and technical skills which constrain their capacity to adapt
technology and push innovation, and the weak competitive pressures in the domestic market.
Moreover, high perceptions of uncertainty and instability in public policy have a definite
dampening effect on investment in new technology and on skill upgrading through external
training8'


B.2 The GovernmentProgram: FosteringInnovation by the PrivateSector

         The Govemment program to promote technological innovation in the private sector
includes strengthening the Centers of Technological Innovations (CITE) network, creating
incentives for private sector investment and public-private collaboration on R&D, and linking
the allocation of public R&D resources to performance targets, with emphasis on applied
researchandtechnology transfer.

         Strengtheningthe CITEs Network: While Peru lacks an integrated national system for
product development and process improvement, technology support services are partly provided
by Centers of Technological Innovations (CITEs) coordinated by PRODUCE. CITEs provide
technological support to firms in specific productive chains. Currently, there are twelve CITEs
operating in different regions of the country mainly focused on specific sectors such as leather


89. For the sample of firms in the 2003 ICA it is calculated that the high levels of uncertainty about economic
      policies in Peru can account for a lowering of investment in machinery and equipment equivalent to 17
      percent.


                                                     157

and shoes, agro-basedindustries, wood, textiles and vine production. The network has recently
been expanded to include centers specializing in tropical fruits, medicinal plants, metal
machinery and ET.            These centers typically offer technological services, testing and
certification, technical training, knowledge dissemination, assistance in commercial and
marketing strategies and linkages with investment promotion facilities for SMEs.
        Four and a half years after the launching of this initiative:'        the portfolio of CITEs clients
i s growing, some of the facilities are in the process of expansion to accommodate more
technologically advanced services and some of the centers are reaching levels of self-financing
close to 40 percent.

         The Government has demonstratedcontinued progress inthe promotion of innovation in
the private sector through the development of this kindof technology partners. Efforts are being
 made to consolidate certain technological services, improve laboratory infrastructure and
 international accreditation and to strengthen technical and financial sustainability. It remains
 important, however, to adapt the CITE model to reflect a stronger export promotion orientation
 while also expanding the reach of the CITE network to other regions. In this way, besides
 contributing to the adoption of quality standards and product certification by exporting firms, it
 will also be possible-through         larger scale, higher value added (design, finishing), higher
 productivity, lower costs, proper packaging and commercial support-to                 overcome difficulties
 sharedby many of the CITEs clients.
         Inthe next few years, the new model will be implemented in several existing CITEs and
 at least two new CITEs will be created." The medium-term government strategy is to expand,

      by DS 027-2000-MITINCI. The first three centers (CITEccal, CITEmaderaand CITEvid) were created in the
      period 1999-2001with funding from PRODUCE and AECI, the cooperationagency in Spain. The rest date
      from 2002-2003 and areprivately funded.

        CreatingIncentivesfor Private Sector Investment and Public-Private Collaborationon
R&D: An initiativedirectly designedto promote private investment inresearch, its technological
application and innovation, is the Program on Science and Technology that the Government of
Peru, with the support of the IDB, is currently preparing. This program-run             jointly by the
National Council for Science and Technology (CONCYTEC) and PRODUCE and coordinated
from PCM-will       provide financial incentives to institutions that demonstrate linkages and
counterpart funding from the private sector for R&D activities. I t will be implemented through
several activity lines that will direct most resourcesto certain strategic areas or sectors selected
according to criteria such as the sector's actual and potential contribution to growth and exports,
its ability to provide especial niches for technological development, and its potential for public-
private-academic collaboration. The different activities under the Project's umbrella will be
demand oriented and designed and run in close collaboration with the private sector, whose
participation in specific projects will require co-financing, thus allowing to multiply the global
resources dedicated to S&T. Resources will be obtained through a competitive process where
eligibility and evaluation will follow well specified and transparent criteria. Special attention
will be paidto the rules regarding the intellectual property of innovations, and a mechanism will
be put in place to facilitate the appearance of venture capital, an activity not developed in Peru
and almost non-existent in most of the Latin American countries.
        In addition, to improve the existing allokation of public resources for S&T, the GoP is
assessing the performance of the technological and research public institutes in order to ensure
their accountability and relevance. The diagnostic will allow to modify the current inertia-based
budget allocation methodology and introduce, for at least a portion of the public funds, allocation
criteria basedon performance and pertinenceof researchactivities.

Strengtheningand Articulating the National Innovation System: Even though CONCYTEC's
main mandate is to promote the country's scientific and technological development, and to
contribute to the formulation of the innovation system's policies, so far the coordination of
policy formulation betweenstakeholdersinthe science and technology sector has beenweak.

         Inthepast years, CONCYTEChasestablishedaforum, the so calledForo de Innovacidn
y Descentralizacidn, which tries to identify opportunities and strategic alliances with local
counterparts for the promotion of innovation. Although it has developed strong links with the
scientific and university community, it still lacks credibility among the private sector. With the
newly approved Ley Marco de Ciencia, Tecnologiu e Innovaci6n~*CONCYTEC will be in
charge of the coordination of these efforts and the definition of strategic and systematic plan and
programs to promote technology adoption and innovation. This coordination role will be favored
by the change of ministerial dependence, from the Ministry of Education to the office of the
Prime Minister.      However, this Law will not represent a significant advance unless it i s
accompanied by more resources, a transparent and effective incentives framework and a
mechanism for evaluating the performance of public technological and research institutions. In

the next three months an accompanyinglaw should be drafted to define mechanisms to allocate
public resources to research institutions based on performance, and to orient their activities
towards applied researchandthe provision of technology transfer services.

B.3 Further challengeswith respectto the innovation systeminPeru

        Challenges may be summarizedinthree dimensions:

        0    Facilitating improved technological adaptation and innovation practices by:
             evaluating the performance of the CITESnetwork; strengthening their capacities to
             provide more technical assistance and to perform technological development and
             applied research; and identifying new initiatives at the regional level to fully exploit
             export potential.
         0   Increasing the effectiveness of public R&D by: improving incentives for technology
             transfer from the public to the private sector; andallocating additional public funds in
             programsthat foster innovation in SMEs, incollaboration with other agents.
         0   Implementing a coherent National Innovation System by: developing the regulation
             of the new Law; enacting the complementary R&D Incentive Law, with provisions
             for incentives that promote applied research, technology transfer and linkages among
             private andpublic institutions ininnovation.

C. Productivechains:IntegrationofProductive Chains, Especiallyfor SMEs

C.l Backgroundand Diagnosis

         Competitiveness studies93frequently conclude that supply in Peru is very fragmented,
especially in the nontraditional product sectors, and production chains are rarely integrated,
showing weak links between firms in similar activities or with supporting industries and
institutions. Knowledge is limited, and its diffusion low as a result of limited forward and
backward linkages. Furthermore, for the few cluster programs that exist, monitoring and
evaluation systems have not being put in place. As a result, technological development in
Peruvian products is reduced. Yet, given the prevalence of micro, small and medium enterprises
inthe Peruvian economy, increasedintegration of these producers, through chains of production
and clusters, can have an important effect on the competitivenessof enterprises.

C.2    The Government Program: Facilitating Development and Integration of Supply
Chainsat RegionalLevels

         Several actionsthat promote enterprise linkages, especially for SMEs, are currently being
developed by the Peruvian government. One of them under the sponsorship of the IDB, focuses
on cluster implementation following the experience of other countries such as Chile or Mexico.
The main features of this cluster program (conglomeradosor esquemas asociativos) include the
coordination between the different agencies currently supporting enterprise development; the
 identification of a public or private institutionthat will leader the cluster support efforts; and the

establishmentof a transparent fundingmechanismto support activities that lead to greater social
capital in clusters. Training on cluster development for key individuals from the public and
private sectors andacademiais also provided.
       Furthermore, the Ministry of Production (PRODUCE) is leading a national program to
promote the development of local supply chains (National Suppliers Program), with the
collaboration of the World Bank. The first step is to identify high potential productive sectors
and geographical areas for the creation of Suppliers Program Centers. These centers will be
implemented in association with the local chambers of commerce and will promote contracting
opportunities among national large and medium sized companies demanding products and/or
services, from small and mid-sized local companies. To assure contracting sustainability,
technical assistance in managementtechniques and quality principles to participating companies
will be provided. Moreover, in order to promote chain expansion, pilot coordinating groups
around selected productive chains will be formed so as to facilitate agreements among key
players within eachchain.
C.3 FurtherChallengeswithRespecttothe IntegrationofProductiveChains
        So far, the programs have advanced in the identification of targeted sectors and regions
and inthe generaldesign of incentives with mainstakeholders. The key challenges are:
           the coordination among the different ministerial programs;
           the seriousinvolvement and commitment of private sectorparticipants;
           the quick progression towards identification of successful initiatives or specific
           actionsbeyond diagnostics;
           the implementation of strategic competitiveness agreements with the regional
           authorities; and
           the definition of monitoringsystemsthat measurethe programs' effectiveness.

D. Labor Training:ImprovingLaborForceQualification

D.l BackgroundandDiagnosis

        The Peruvian labor market is characterized by very low levels of worker productivity,
which is reflected in low salaries. The available evidence indicates that more than 60 percent of
the work force has not received occupational training. Training is currently limited to those who
can afford the fees charged by private training institutions or to a limited number of formal-
sector workers benefiting from employer-funded training programs. Publicly funded training
programs are almost nonexistent, with the exception of Progrumu Projoven, a publicly-funded
but privately delivered training program providing classroom training, on-the-job training and
job search assistance for youth.
        The very low level of investment in training partly reflects the serious deficiencies of
occupational training institutes, which offer highly differentiated but overall very low quality
training. Moreover, the labor market is characterized by pronounced information asymmetries
betweenfirms and workers. No informationis easily available on the characteristics of different
levels of the labor force. This causes many firms to invest heavily in staff selection and
recruitment processes. Meanwhile, individuals who in the course of their working career have
 acquired skills useful for their jobs, find it impossible to be accredited for these competencies.



                                                  161

These asymmetries lead to inequity, the under-utilization of human resources and economic
losses.

D.2 The GovernmentProgram: ImprovingLaborForce Skillsandthe Quality ofTraining

        Resources are beingchanneled into demand-oriented training programs that are tailored
to the specific needs and characteristics of the target group, designed with employer feedback
and subject to continuing impact evaluation. Specifically the government has recently started
two new training programs: BonoPyme and BonoEmprende. The first one is aimed at training
workers and owners of micro and small firms with the objective of improvingthe productivity of
their workers. Vouchers are supplied to firms, enabling them to select the public or private
training operator of their choice.      The program provides each firm with information on
accredited operators and technical assistance on a cost-sharing basis tailored to the specific needs
of each firm. BonoEmpren.de is aimed at training youth on how to start up their enterprises. A
similar voucher-based delivery mechanism is used and training is supplemented with business
counseling.
        In order to reduce informational asymmetries that affect the horizontal and vertical
mobility of the work force, accreditation and competencies certification systems will also be
designed.    In particular, an institutional accreditation system for the Znstitutos Superiores
Tecnoldgicos and Znstitutos Superiores Pedagdgicos will be implemented as well as a pilot
competencies certification system for workers in the textile sector. The pilot competencies
certification system will provide objective parametersfor measuring levels ofjob competency in
relation to performance levels required by specific occupations. The system will also provide
practical guidance to businesses, the public sector, training agencies and the work force in
general, on pertinent information relating to the labor force. It is expected that these initiatives
will also serve to improve the quality of training.
D.3 Further Challengeswith RespecttoLabor TraininginPeru

        Three main challenges can be identified to address in the near future:

        0   to improve the quality of the public training services;
        0   to design training mechanisms to reach workers in the informal sector or in targeted
            population groups; and
        0   to facilitate better informed decisions on the supply and demand side of the training
            services market. Regional governments, empowered with local economic policy
            making functions, can be very effective in facilitating targeted business support or
            demanddriven labor force training programs.

                      Annex X: Trade Facilitationand Export Promotion

I.BackgroundandDiagnosis

        The Peruvian foreign trade regime has been traditionally very protective against imports.
The new economic program implemented after 1990 included a series of positive reforms of the
foreign trade regime including a significant reduction of foreign exchange controls. As a result,
the average tariff fell from 66 percentin 1990to 10.2 percentin 2004 and, even more relevantly,
the dispersion in the tariff structure was drastically reduced from 25 to 6.2. Additional reforms
have also since been implemented.              For example, a `temporary admission' policy was
implemented through which no tariffs are paid on imported inputs for exports and certain trade
agreements were signed.94 Additionally, the Government aims to complete negotiations to sign
the TLC by the endof 2004.
        These market-oriented economic policies adopted by successive Peruvian
governmentshave yielded a strongexpansionof external trade, effectively doublingexports
inabsolutetermsbetweenthe early 1990sandend-2001. However, despiteallthesefacts, the
Peruvianexport sector remainsvery weak.

     and in 1998, Perujoined ALCA and APEC projects, respectively. Because of Peru belonging to ALADI,
     bilateral agreements have been signed with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba and Mexico. In 2002, Peru also
     joined the programof preferentialaccess to the United States market under the ATPDEA.

        First, although total exports inPeru in 2003 amounted to US$ 8,863.3 million, and
are around 16.5 percent hi2her than in 2002, they represent a low percentage of GDP
(around 17 percent, 2003).9         This figure is particularly striking when compared to other
countries inLatin America such as Chile (34.6 percent), Mexico (29.6 percent), Colombia (23.2
percent), and even Bolivia (21.9 percent). And it i s even more so when noting that Peru is a
resource rich country with productive mines, large fish-stocks and fertile land and abundant
forests.   International experience clearly shows that exports can be a powerful engine of
economic recovery and growth, but this potential has been left unrealized in Peru due most
importantly to a lack of overall competitiveness. With the exception of Bolivia, Peru's exports
per capita level is the lowest in the LAC region, amounting to a little over US$347.2 in 2003,
which is far below the WTO's published world average per capita export of US$1,051. In
comparison, Mexico and Chile have exports per capita levels of US$1,719 and US$1,476.6
respectively. Even much poorer Ecuadorhas an exports per capita ratio that is 75 percent greater
than that for Peru.
         Second, in addition to poor overall export performance, the bulk of Peru's exports are
concentrated in primary products.             These traditional goods include mining, fish meal,
agricultural and oil products accounting for approximately 70 percent of all exports. These
sectors tend to have low growth potential and are dependent on volatile commodity markets.
Further evidence of such export concentration is shown by low levels of manufacturing
exports:6  which representedin 2002 about 17 percent of total Peruvian exports as comparedto
an average of 58.8 percent for the Latin American region.97                  In addition to increased
vulnerability to external shocks, the prevalent export promotion strategy has not allowed Peru to
take full advantage of its export potential. Instead, the incentives provided have led to over-
investment in the traditional sectors.        Conversely, sectors where the country has some
comparative advantage or export potential-such                  as agriculture and manufacturing,
export performance remains disappointing.

         As of 2002, Peru's fruit exports amount to about US$60 million, which is extremely low
when compared with Colombia is at US$800 million, Ecuador at US$600 million and Chile at
US$1.4 billion. Peru's manufacturing exportsaccount for only 20 percent of total exports, which
compares unfavorably to the average 58 percent for the whole Latin America and Caribbean
region. While the potential for developing the textiles and apparels industry might appear
promising, Peru exports only US$25 per capita to the United States in the garment sector. In
comparison, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica all export roughly US$300 per capita in that
sector. Lastly, Peru exports to a fairly small number of countries, with about 55 percent of its
exports going to the United States and the EuropeanUnion. Peru has not made much efforts to
open new markets.

          Focusing on the firm level, the recent 2003 ICA, based on a sample of manufacturing
firms:*     showed that Peruvian firms export very little of their production. Even in that
sample, which was relatively biased towards export firms, only 21.6 percent of the sales are
exported. According to this study, this is a low share if compared to similar surveys for other
countries. Not only are there very few export-oriented firms, but also exports are very
concentrated. According to MINCETUR, in 2002 only fifty firms exported 64 percent of the
total Peruvian exports.

          The ICA survey findings show that imports are primarily consumption goods rather
than capital goods. Since Peru has had neither high tariffs in recent years nor high taxes on

for capital goods. It is also likely that the low expenditure on capital goods is a reflection of the
lack of investment in new technology due to the lack of export focus in the majority of firms in
Peru.

       exporters(42 firms) in the sample export 50 percent or more of their sales. Food productsis the one outlier in
       this respect, with 86 percentof the sampledfirms exporting 99 percentof production at the median. There is a
       clear focus on export among these firms. Ina few industries, such as garments and textiles, there are backward
       linkages to small and medium sized firms who, by supplying to exporting firms, become "secondary"
       exporters. However the median Peruvian firm shows zero exports as a percent of sales demonstrating their
       lack of focus on the export market.

       Access to financial market is also a strong constraint for firms, particularly for
SMEs. A comprehensive-World Bank supported-sector adjustment program implemented by
Peruvian authorities between 1999 and December 2001, has led to positive structural changes in
Peruvian financial markets.      Such changes have affected the financial sector, which has
experienced a substantial modernization of its regulatory framework, and the banking system,
which has improved its efficiency andliquidity. This, combined with entry of new players from
Europe and the United States, has increased the potential of the domestic market to offer
sophisticatedexport finance products andservices.
        Notwithstanding this progress, the access to finance and to adequate export finance
instruments has becomemore restrictive in recent years due to a generalized credit crunch inthe
economy. Since 1998, financial sector lending to the private sector has dropped significantly
with the ratio of private sector credit to GDP falling from 28 percent in 1998to about 24 percent
according to preliminary figures for 2002.
        Not surprisingly, results from the ICA, indicate that limited access to adequate export
finance instruments is a major problem of Peruvian exporters. This finding is supported by
discussions with financial institutions and exporters, all confirming that only a few mainly large
exporters have access to working capital loans from the banking sector, and even less to
structuredexport finance products such as export insurance, international leasingand others.
        Several institutional deficiencies have been identified that contribute to this situation,
such as the lack of efficient mechanisms for insolvent companies to exit the market, or the
inflexible anddeficient legal andjudicial framework for executing and realizing collaterals. But
there are also specific constraintsfor small and mediumexportersto secure credit that are related
to deficiencies already pointed out characterizing their productive system. For instance, the
fragmented structure of production and the lack of integration of supply chains make access to
credit markets costly and difficult. Additionally, the low level of "formalization" of SMEs in
terms of accounting practices, management and corporate governancestructure, quality standards
prevents them from making use of the financial instruments necessary to develop a stable export
activity.
        Lastly, exports are highly concentrated in the center of the country, and in turn far
away from the supply centers. Approximately 67 percent of total export value is concentrated
injust two of the eighteen custom officejurisdictions inthe country. Thesejurisdictions are in
the Lima-Calla0 region which generates approximately 45 percentof the GDP.
        Peru's lackluster export performance can be explained through a series of factors.
Primarily, the poor performance is a reflection of the country's overall low level of
competitiveness-particularly in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, while Peru has succeeded
as a low-income factor-driven economy characterized by a reliance on primary products and
commodities, it has yet to transition to a higher value-added investment-driven economy in
which efficiency in producing standard products and services becomes a dominant source of
competitiveness. Underdeveloped export product portfolio and capacity together with poor
knowledge of export markets and limited access to these markets are among the main factors
hampering Peru's export performance. The current Toledo administration acknowledges the
shortcomings in Peru's export promotion policy and is committed to reform. A particular
challenge to this reform initiative will be to ensure that the private sector, especially the
producers of nontraditional export products, respond appropriately to the new incentive

framework putinplaceby the govemment. This is not obvious since these nontraditional sectors
lack a critical mass, well developed and coherent supply chains and an export-oriented
entrepreneurialculture.

11. Government Programand Progress

        Improving Strategic Planning and Institutional Collaboration for Export
Development. In Peru, public policies on export development suffer from lack of strategic
focus, limited and poorly used resources, insufficient accountability and inadequate coordination
among institutions. The poor results achieved are not for the lack of relevant institutions with a
mandate to promote exports. A recent study found no less than 24 institutions from the private
and public sectors are involved directly or indirectly in trade promotion. Certain rationalization
of key entities responsible for export promotion was undertaken by the GoP in July 2002. The
main changes involved: (i)the creation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism
 (MINCETUR) and the merger of the Ministriesof Industry andFisheries under a single Ministry
 of Production (PRODUCE); (ii) merger of agencies handling market research, privatization,
                                 the




                                                167

concessions, and attraction of foreign investment under one entity, PROINVERSIONand; (iii)               a
decision to increasecommercial and trade promotion activities through the Foreign Office.
       Additionally, in March 2003 an ambitious export strategic national plan (Plan
Estratkgico Nacional Exportador,PENX) was launched containing 20 strategies and 108 specific
measures to be developed in the period 2003-13.             The plan was the result of a collaborative
effort of a large number of public and private institutions related to external trade. This plan is
focused around four main strategic objectives including: (i)         developing a portfolio of exportable
products of high value added, high quality and strategically diversified; (ii)accessing and
consolidating an export presence in targeted foreign markets; (iii)                putting in place a legal
framework that facilitates free trade from a variety of angles (logistics, financial, administrative);
and (iv) developing an export oriented culture. The second phase of the PENX is already
underway. Operational plans correspondingto several sectors have already beendrafted with the
collaboration of the private and public sector.lW These plans will complement other strategic
planning initiatives that are being developedat the regional level.
        Whereas direct interventions inmarket processes such as quotas and price subsidies have
generally proven to be inadequate instruments of trade policy, more subtle and market-friendly
forms of government intervention can have a significant impact in terms of development of a
domestic export industry. An initial stimulus can be achieved through bilateral and multilateral
integration treaties, including securing the reduction of external tariffs and non-tariff barriers in
targeted markets. Peru has progressed reasonably well in negotiating favorable treaties, most
recently with the conclusion of the ATPDEA treaty with the US and the initiation of the TLC
negotiations. Peru'saccess treaties to other important markets are also in place, and while access
conditions could be improved, this issue does not represent an important barrier for exporting.
        Broadening the base of exporters, with particular emphasis on SMEs. To increase
the participation of a new group of producers, particularly SMEs, into Peru's exporting sector,
several initiatives are underway. PROMPYME is undertaking capacity-building efforts in
several directions to: (i)improve essential market intelligence services for SMEs (product
portfolio, targeted markets, business trends, etc); (ii)    design and implement trainingprograms for
small and micro exporters; and (iii)      facilitate in collaboration with the Ministry of Production
greater integration of small and micro producers into the export supply chain. On the other hand,
PROMPEX is implementing a program to help selected companies prepare and develop export
strategies. This program contemplates individualized technical assistance for a limited period
and is designed to work closely with companies in the development and further execution of
their export plans.
        The Government also aims to develop export capacity at the regional level by
supporting export decentralization and regional export plans in all regions. To date eight plans
for the regions of Piura, Cajamarca, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Arequipa, Ancash, Loreto and
Ica, have beendrafted inclose collaboration between MTNCETUR, regional and local authorities
and the private sector and published by the regional governments. These regional plans are part
of a broader Trade Decentralization Plan initiative which aims to expand the portfolio of
potentially exportable products, attract private investment and facilitate SME integration into the
export supply chain. The success of this strategy relies on alliances between authorities at the
central, regional and local levels, the private sector and the academic actors. Strategic partners

from the central government include MINCETUR, PROMPEX, PROMPYME and
PROINVERSION.
        The Government has also identified six distinct areas-aggregations                   of current regional
governments-that       will enable greater efficiency in the use of resources while also facilitating
the decentralization process. A multi-regional office will oversee regional export promotion
efforts, design initiatives along the lines of the Trade Decentralization Plan with special
emphasis on the incorporation of new local firms in exporting sectors and provide local support
and training to implement the early stages of a national export culture training program. The
North West multi-regional office has already started operation in Chiclayo. A second one is
scheduledto open in2004 and an additional three in2005.
        Developing export promotion capabilities abroad and facilitating access to foreign
markets. Imperfect information in international trade requires all exporters to collect and
disseminate market information. Without external facilitation, inadequate levels of investment
and coordination failures result due to the public good character of information and associated
free riderproblems. The Foreign Relations Ministry is heading an initiative to effectively release
commercial information on Peruvian products and foster trade relations with selected target
countries. It has initially targeted the American (with emphasis in maximizing ATPDEA
benefits), Chinese, German, Canadian and Brazilianmarkets. This initiative involves studies for
specific products intarget markets, improvements to technological infrastructure in selectedpilot
commercial offices of Peruvian embassies to enable market information collection in host
countries and export promotion business missions. A commercial office inLos Angeles will be
opened. PROMPEX has concurrently launched the Productos Bandera initiative that identifies
'flag products' for Peru and develops specific schemes to promote them internationally.
PROMPEX is currently preparing a marketing and international promotion strategy for the
PERU trademark for gold, silver and handicrafts products.]"
         Improving Financial Instruments for Exporters.                        The Government of Peru is
developing several initiatives to facilitate access of small and medium firms to new and
established export related financial instruments that reduce the risks and costs of exporting. A
US$50 million back-up fund has been assigned by MEF to COFDE (through SECREX) to
provide coverage for 50 percent of the value of the pre-export financing operations offered by
commercial banks to export businesses with firm purchase orders.                          This program, called
SEPYMEX, is aimed at new export SMEs or existing ones that export up to US$8 million per
year.    As of June 2004, approximately US$26 million of the funds' resources have been
assigned.'02
         As of June 2004 US$197 million had been assigned to operations of foreign trade,
investment and human capital (pre- and post-shipment) as part of a newly created program
(Programa de Financiamiento Integral para el Sector Exportador, FIEXr). To date Banco
Interamericano de Finanzas, Banco Financiero, Banco de Comercio, AmCrica Leasing and
Interbank have used these resources to finance small and medium exporters. Additionally, a new

      for thejewelry industry, with the support of MINCETUR, PROMPEX and PRODUCE.

risk capital fund (Fond0 Trunsandino Perd) endowed with US$15 million, has been createdfor
export oriented small and mediumfirms.'03
         The Government is also supporting studies regarding restrictions in access to
finance with special focus on export oriented SMEs.            Both PROMPYME and PCM, in
collaboration with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, will conduct a series of studies to
identify key bottlenecks which affect access to credit for small and medium sized companies,
examine existing constraints to the formalization of SMEs and explore the design of innovative
and marketfriendly flexible proceduresfor the use of assets as collaterals.

111. ContinuedPriorities under DECSALI1

         The ability to offer an attractive portfolio of varied and high quality products is a
necessary condition to participate in international markets. Government initiatives supported
under the proposed DECSAL program including efforts to improve the quality of products,
reduce logistics costs and eliminate administrative barriers aim precisely to achieve a diverse
export portfolio. However, coherent and comprehensiveexport promotion strategy is essential to
successfullyaccess new markets.
         It is increasingly clear that Peru will need to considerably improve promotion activities.
The World Bank, IDB and other international institutions are supporting elements of the
Government's trade and export promotion agendaby strengtheningexport promotion capabilities
abroad to access foreign markets, developing more sophisticated market intelligence, improving
the marketing of Peruvian products and stimulating the development and use of export-related
financial instruments.
         A number of key areas for further reform and action are recommended. Primarily, within
the government there are three major institutions attached to different Ministries performing
similar export promotion activities without coordination. These include the Commission for the
Promotion of Peruvian exports (PROMPEX) under MXNCETUR, the National Board of Trade
under MINCETUR and the Executive Office of Economic Promotion under the Minister of
Foreign Affairs. Additionally, PROMPYME, within the Ministry of Labor, aims to integrate
small and medium producers into the main supply and export chains. The duplication of roles
 and functions and the lack of a clearly articulated country strategy on trade policy, export
promotion and foreign investment weakens Peru's export capacity and, therefore, undermines its
 ability to achieve sustainedeconomic growth.
         Better coordination and support i s also needed within the series of private sector export
development and promotion initiatives. Two private sector entities are particularly active - the
 Association of Exporters (ADEX) and the Peruvian Association of Foreign Trade
 (COMEXPERU). ADEX was created in 1973 as a nonprofit organization and its membership
 currently consists of mostly small and medium enterprises. It primarily supports members
 through lobbyingactivities, market analysis to identify businessopportunities, provision of legal
 advisory services and dissemination events. This menu of services is basically the same for
 COMEXPERU, created in 1989 with the same objectives as ADEX. But, unlike ADEX,
 members of COMEXPERU are primarily larger firms that did not feel their interests were
 appropriately represented by ADEX. Overall the lack of coordination between these two

 103. Ibid.


                                                  170

business associations generates inefficiencies in the process of export promotion, increasescosts
unnecessarily, confuses potential new market participants and ultimately leads to ineffective
export development.
       Although the Consejo Nacional de Negociaciones Comerciales Znternacionales was
created at the end of 2001 to coordinate private and public actions, the private sector's voice i s
not particularly well represented. Infact, the sector does not have the right to vote inthe counsel
and serves exclusively in an advisory capacity on the rulingprocess. The Peruvian private sector
remains divided over the balance between Government protectionist and free market policies.
Certain sectors have recently pressured the Government to implement protective measures to
safeguardagainst certain Chinesetextile products. COMEXPERU, on the contrary, has opposed
these protectionist measures on the grounds that they are ultimately distortionary and anti-
competitive.
       Inorder to expandexports significantly Peru will needto formulate an approach to inter-
governmental coordination of trade policies. PCM, with the support of MEF, will carry out a
study to review successful cross-country experiences in institutional coordination in trade policy
formulation inaneffort to develop an adequatestrategy for Peru.
       Lastly, an in-depth analysis of the major constraints to exports by region is required.
Certain constraints-such    as logistics bottlenecks-are  common across all regions. However,
other constraints-such    as access to credit and agricultural pest control are region-specific. A
study by MEF will collect available information on regional constraints to: (i) a detailed
                                                                                  obtain
picture of the regional sources of Peru's agricultural and manufacturing production and exports;
(ii)examine areas where exports appear to be unduly low; (iii)   interview producers in those areas
to determine constraints; and (iv) provide analysis and alternatives to address identified
problems.

            Annex XI: Logistics Costs and DecentralizedInfrastructure Development

  I.BACKGROUND
          Logistics costs have become increasingly relevant for the trade competitiveness of
  developing countries as tariffs decline globally and transport costs account for a greater
  proportion of the final value of goods they produce and trade. Consequently, the quality and
  efficiency of transport and logistic services have a larger impact on the competitiveness of
  exporting firms.'"       In general, developing countries exporting high volume and low cost
  commodities andmanufacturedgoods will pay a higher proportion of the final value of the goods
  for freight. The average cost of transport for developing countries' export goods i s around 9
  percent of the total cost of the traded good as compared to 5 percent for developed co~ntries.'~~
  These trends have led to an increasedrecognition of the importance of reforms that promote the
  development of transport and logistic services for the improvement of developing country trade
  competitiveness.
           Logistic costs account for a large share of the total operating costs faced by Peruvian
  firms.   According to a 2001 survey, average logistics costs accounted for 27.8 percent of
  Peruvian firms' revenue and 34.4 percent of their operating costs, far exceeding regional and
  international comparators (Table 1).The level and composition of logistics costs in Peru point to
  deficiencies intransport infrastructure and services. Transport costs, of which 17.8 percentrelate
  to port operations and 14percent to roads and railways, account for 31.8 percent of all logistical
  costs. Other logistics costs include administrative procedures (20.5 percent), warehousing (9
  percent) and inventories andfinancial costs (18.7 percent).lo6

         Peruvian exporters face higher transportationcosts than other Latin American countries .
Even though Peruvian ports are closer to the country's principal market for exports (the United
States), exports from the port of Callao havehighertransport costs compared to other ports inthe
region."'    Transporting textiles from the port of Callao to the U S is 29 percent more expensive
than doing so from Taiwan while Peruvianexporters of fish meal to the U S face costs that are 32
percent higher than those of their Chilean competitors."'                   It has also been found that the
operating cost of road transport per km traveled is US$ 0.62 in Peru, almost double than that of
Spain, equalto US$0.34, and higherto that of Colombia.log
         The high cost of transportation andits large participation within the structure of logistics
costs reflect the poor state of the Country's transport infrastructure and services. Indeed,
inadequate infrastructure was ranked among the most problematic factors for doing business in
Peru in the latest opinion survey of the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR)."O According to
the same survey, the quality of transport infrastructure in Peru ranks among the lowest in Latin
America and compares unfavorably with other countries in the APEC region (Table 2). In
addition to affecting their competitiveness, Peruvian firms also view the quality of transport
infrastructure as a factor that discourages Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). A survey for the
Andean Competitiveness Project (PAC) found that 63 percent of firms consideredthe quality of
port operationsto be very unattractive for foreign investors while 62 percent view the marketfor
road transport services as a major disadvantage.

         Evidence suggests that improving the quality of road and port infrastructure and related
services can have a large impact on the logistics costs of Peruvian firms. Maritime transport is

 107. The difference in costs also has to do with distance, the density and frequency of shipping services, and the
      existence of economies of scale in maritime transport operations.

the most utilized method of transportation for exports in terms of value (73.5 percent) and in
terms of volume (97.5 percent). A survey conducted as part of a recent study by the Bank
showed that 52 percent of the value of exports by the manufacturing firms surveyed was
transported through ports. On the other hand, the results of the same survey indicated that 97
percent of all sales and nearly all exports, prior to being shipped by air or maritime transport
were shippedby roads.l1
         Therefore, actions aimed at the improvement of roads and port infrastructure and related
services should be prioritized. The organization and efficiency of markets for the provision of
logistics services and the quality and availability of other transportation modes, such as air
transport and railroads, are also areas where improvements are needed in order to achieve
reductions in logistics costs. Nonetheless, given the importance of ports and road infrastructure,
most of the identified actions seek to address pressing issuesinthese areas.

11. PORTINFRASTRUCTUREAND SERVICES

BackgroundandBenchmarking

         The Peruvian port system is still in a process of reform aimed at counteracting the
inefficiencies that have characterizedit for the last decades. Historically, port administration has
beenunder the control of a public entity, ENAPU(Empresa Nacional de Puertos S.A), which has
lagged behind in investments in infrastmcture and equipment, due to strong budgetary
restrictions (transfers from the MTC to the maritime transport system, between 1990 and 1999
were less thanUS$8 million). This resulted ina highly uncompetitive port systemcompared with
international and regional benchmarks, featuring important over costs and unsatisfactory service
standards.
         Despite reductions in port tariffs and higher levels of efficiency in port operations in
recent years, the performance of Peruvian ports remains poor against international standards.
The Global Competitiveness Report 2003-2004 ranks Peru 84th in the quality of port
infrastructure (maritime and fluvial), only above the landlocked countries of Bolivia and
Paraguay in the South American region (Table 3). The poor performance of the Peruvian port
system is partly reflected in the highcost for maritime freight, which averages over 8 percent of
the value of imports (CJF), as comparedto 7 percent for Colombia and Chile.'            **
Diagnosis
         The poor performance of Peruvian ports i s mainly the result of an investment deficit in
port facilities and equipment and regulatory deficiencies that result in higher costs for port
services. Peruvian ports are first generation facilities with inadequate infrastructure for handling
the increasing level of containerized cargo.'l3 Consequently, Peru ranks last among South
America's six biggest economies in the utilization of containers. In addition, the lack of
organization andmultiplicity of agents and regulatory entities that are involved inport operations
result in additional charges that increasethe cost of maritime transport. These deficiencies result

        The Port of Cullao. The port of Callao concentratesthe majority of the Peruvian cargo
that is mobilized by ports. Container traffic in the port of Callao totaled 513,138 TEUs in 2003
and cargo mobilized reached 13,544,070 metric tons.li4 In2003, Callao serviced 77 percent of
the ships, mobilized 71 percent of exports and 84 percent of imports, and channeled 88 percent
of container movements. The importance of the port of Callao derives from the high
concentration of population andeconomic activity inthe metropolitan regionof Lima.
        The efficiency and competitiveness of the port of Callao i s low compared to other ports
in the region. Despite its importance, the port is characterizedby high costs and low levels of
efficiency compared to other ports in Latin America and international standards. The average
duration of ships rotation in dock is of approximately 29 hours, above the international average
of 20 hours; while the occupancy rate is of 38 percent, far from the international standard of 60
percent."' While the international benchmark for productivity in the movement of containers is
60-90 TEUs per ship hour, inCallao, the container-unloading ratio only reaches 20-30 TEUs per
ship hour, meaningthat its productivityis only 33 percentof the international level. According to
a study by CAF, the port of Callao is the second most inefficient port in Latin America (only
slightly better thanthe worst one, Puerto Cabello inVenezuela).
        The lack of gantry cranes has been identified as one of the major constraints to the
achievement of higher efficiency levels at the port of Callao. In the port of Callao, ships must
use their own cranes to load and unload containers. This situation results in turnaround rates of
about 12 to 14 containers per hour, instead of the 25 that could be mobilized with the crane.
ENAPUhas not managedto fund the investment requiredfor acquiring a gantry crane, while any
undertaking by the private sector depends on the establishment of clear rules for private

involvement in port operations. The port also has berths that are too shallow to allow for large
ships to enter.
         Port Services. In addition to infrastructure constraints, the competitivenessof the port of
Callao has also been affected by the higher costs of port services. Callao may seem competitive
when compared to other ports in the region, such as Guayaquil and Valparaiso, but the cost
structure reflects the existence of excessive administrative and regulatory costs. 34 percent of
port service costs inthe port of Callao are related to expenses neededto cover legal requirements
and administrative issues, while 22 percent have to do strictly with port operations. 116The
additional costs prevailing in Callao have to do with charges for services that are not even
provided in many instances, such as the issuance of bill of lading, the electronic transfer of the
bill of lading, control of precinct, loading and unloading of cargo, cleaning of containers, and
cargo handling. These additional costshave been estimated at US$146 per container. Inaddition,
the port of Callao i s the only one in the region to have a ship reception commission made up by
representativesof the Directorate Generalof the Coast Guard (DICAPI for its name in Spanish).
Such commission takes an hour to approve the access of ships and generally receives donations
form ships' captains. The perception of users is that DICAPIuses the proceeds of these charges
to finance its operations.
The combination of regulatory andoperatingfunctions vested inENAPUand the organization of
the market for port services provision has limitedcompetition in service delivery. The absence of
competition among service providers and the tendency towards monopolization of activities is
promoted by the port itself, which sets strong institutional barriers for companies seekingto enter
the market. Also, the trend towards vertically integrated port services, resulting from alliances
among providers, diminishes the margin of competition for new enterprises and eliminates
possibilities for cost reductions. According to a study by the Transport Supervisory Agency
(OSITRAN), servicetariffs at Callao canbe three times higher than the LatinAmerican average.
          Sector Znvestment. Investment inports has been constrained by the inability of the public
port operator to invest in the upgrading of facilities and equipment and the lack of a clear
regulatory framework for private sector involvement. Despite the fact that ENAPU has
 maintained a relatively highoperating margin, it has beenunable to make significant investments
 in port facilities due to its high contribution to pension payments as stated by Law. Pensions
 represent20 percentof ENAPU's income equivalent to approximately US$20 million annually.
          On the other hand, private investment has been delayed waiting for the enactment of the
 Ports Law. Although the process of privatization of ENAPUwas formally initiated in 1992 and
 concessions for seven ports were opened in 1998 (Paita, Salaverry, Chimbote, Callao, General
 San Martin,Matarani and no),almost all port terminals up to date remain under itsjurisdiction.
 Currently, only the port of Matarani is under the administration of a private sector operator and
 private sector investment inports has beenamong the lowest inLatin America.
          This has resulted in an important deficit in investment, which in light of increased
 competition from other regional ports, threatens to eliminate the competitive advantages of
 Peruvianports. It has been estimatedthat the Peruvian port system requires investments of about
 US$159 million, of which US$133 million would go to Callao, and the rest to other regional

        Ports, RegionalDevelopmentand Competitiveness.The development of regional ports is
critical for the competitiveness of producers in their areas of influence and the promotion of
competition. The ports of Paita, Salaverry and Chimbote serve close to 90 percent of the cargo
traffic generated by the departments of the Peruvian north; while the ports of Matarani, San
Nicolas and no serve the majority of cargo traffic generated in the southern departments."*
Inter-port competition in Peru is not significant due to the high level of centralization in
economic activity, the lack of roads and railways connecting production centers to ports and the
high degree of specialization in some of the regional terminals. It is envisioned that the
development of regional ports will improve the quality of services and reduce the logistics costs
of firms located outside of Lima. In addition, improvements in the regional public seaport of
Paita, and the fluvial ports of Iquitos, Yurimaguas and Pucallpa could serve to establish
multimodal corridors linking the country's three main geographical regions: costa, sierra and
selva.
         Improvements in port services brought about by the introduction of greater efficiency in
port operations and the upgrading of facilities and equipment have a large impact on the
competitiveness of exporters, particularly those outside of Lima. In the fist year of the
concession, cargo mobilized in the regional port of Matarani went upby 20 percent, and the time
of ships in port was significantly reduced. The increased levels of efficiency in cargo
mobilization have resulted in savings in terms of logistics costs that amounted to US$ 1.1 and
US$ 1.2 million in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Lower tariffs for the use of port facilities have
also renderedsavings of US 0.128 million inthe logistics costs for regional cargo."'
         The recently approved legal and regulatory framework supports the decentralized
development of regional ports and the promotion of private sector participation. More
specifically, the Law mandates the creation of Regional Port Authorities (APR) to develop and
execute regional port development plans. These plans will account for current and potential
demand for port services resulting from regional economic synergies and will seek to increase
private investment.
         The implementation of logistic centersclose to major gateways helps in the consolidation
of regional development. The Callao area, where the prime national port and airport are located,
constitutes a clear opportunity to develop a logistic center (ZAL - Zona de Actividades
Logisticas). The development of internal multimodal terminals able to consolidate and transfer
containersalong the territory are also tools to spur regional development through the reduction of
transportation costs.
Government Programand Progress
         The government program is based on the principles and guidelines established in the
Ports Law of March 2003 and corresponding regulations (See Box 1). A central feature of the
new Law involves the separation of the policy setting and operating functions of the port system
between a new independent National Port Authority (APN) and ENAPU. The APN will assume
responsibility for national port policy making and prepare the National Port Development Plan

(PNDP). The APN will plan port investments, define and promote of specific modalities of
private sector participation, and establish of technical parameters for port operations. The Law
also created Regional Port Authorities (APR) to elaborate and execute development plans for
individual ports and for ports within the particular region under their jurisdiction. Additionally,
the Law will enable greater private sector participation in the development and management of
ports.

 Box 1. The New Law regulatingthe NationalPortSystem
 h e law regulating the National Port System (27943) was approved in March 2003 and aims to promote the
 levelopment and competitiveness of ports, facilitating multi modal transportation, the modernization of port
 nfrastructure and the enhancement of the logistic chains integrated to the port system. It draws the guidelines
 :onforming the National Port Policy, including: increased competitivenessand trade, further integration, promotion
 if investments, increased participation of private sector, fair competition, decentralization, technological
 nodernization, generationof employment, high quality management and continuoustraining. Specifically, the Law:
     Sets up the framework for elaborating and approving The National Port Development Plan (PNDP). The
     objective of this Plan is to define a national port strategy, aimed at fostering infrastructure development and
     organizingand coordinating the modernizationand sustainability of the port system, under the guidelines set by
     the macro policy of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MTC). The PNDP will serve as a
     framework for the development of regional master plans for each and every Peruvian port. Every year, areport
     will be prepared on the progress achievedunderthe Plan, as well as an estimatebudgetfor the upcoming year.

    Regulatesprivate sector participation inportsoperation, calling for further investment in the sector and enabling
     port administrationby private entities. Specifically, the Law establishes that port authoritiesare able to concede
     temporal authorization (not over 30 years) on the management of port infrasmcture to the private sector,
     throughany of the different contractualinstrumentscontemplatedby the law.
     Outlines the applicable Tariff Scheme, stating that: (i)  for services lacking free competition, OSITRAN is in
     charge of establishingthe tariff regime (based on proposalsfrom regional and national port authorities); and (ii)
     under free competition, the serviceprovider is incharge of fixing the prevailing prices.

     Establishes the functions of authorities within the port system, describing their structure, composition.
     attributions and financing schemes. Traditional actors within the national port system have not been eliminated
     but their spheres of influence have been clearly redefined. Such is the case of ENAF'U, INDECOPI and
     OSITRANamongothers.
     Creates the Autoridad Portruaria Nacional (APN) as the organism ultimately in charge of the national po~l
     system. While most of the technical-normative functions can only be carried out by APN, most of the
     operational duties can be transferred to the regional port authorities. Among its exclusive functions are: (i:
     elaboration of the PNDP; (ii)    elaboration of Investment Plans; iii)regulation of Logistic Activities Zone:
     (ZAL); (iv) Establishment of regulations for service provision; (v) enforcement of contracts with the privatc
     sector; (vi) granting of required authorizations; (vii) acting as a coordinating agency; and (viii) the applicatior
     of safety standards.
     Creates the Autoridades Portuarias Regionales (APR). APRs are constituent organisms of the national por
     system, withjurisdiction of aport or set of ports within adefinedregion, following criteria set by the PNDP and
     based on the principle of decentralization. The regional port authorities ultimately depend on Regional
     Governments and are responsible for: (i)   designing regional plans for port development and master plans for
     ports under their jurisdiction; (ii)
                                        coordinating and supervising port activities and operations; (iii) guaranteeing
     general compliance of public and private operators (operations, activities, schedules, norms, tariffs, safety
     standards, etc.)

     Promotes Safety inports, making the APN responsiblefor installing an integral safety system for all ports under
     its jurisdiction and obliging all ports under the national port system to attain an international certification
     regarding quality of the safety measures in place and Sets standards for environmentally friendly management
     of port activities and operations, making environmental considerations a requisite of all plans, programs and
     contracts.

        The Governnient has demonstratedprogress towards implementing institutional reforms
set forth in the new Ports Law by appointing the president and board members of the APN.
However, the institution lacks sufficient resources to develop and implement the PNDP, a pre-
condition for private participation in the sector. Preparation of the PNDP is subject to a tight
deadline under the Ports Law. The APN has begun preparation of a general national policy for
port development which will later be complemented with regional plans and more specific
strategies. The Government has completed a first draft of the Plan, which i s currently being
circulated for consultations accordingto the timing and proceduresspecified inthe Law.
        While the regulation of the Ports Law was effectively passed, the calling for bid of port
concessions has been delayed because the procedures establishedby the Law and detailed in its
regulation made necessary the previous issuance of the PNDP, which is currently under
preparation. Regarding the feasibility study for a modem logistic terminal in the El Callao area,
guidelines have been included in the Trade FacilitationTechnical Assistance Loan (TAL); TORS
are being prepared and the study i s expected to be completed in 2005. As an overall summary,
port reform in Peru is progressing and is doing it in the right direction, even though at a low
speed.
Recommendations
        It is recommendedthat the government consolidate port sector modernization efforts by
implementing scheduled institutional reforms, and initiating immediate actions to enhance the
efficiency and competitiveness of the port system and freight terminals. Key institutional reform
measures include: (i)the strengthening of the National Port Authority (ANP) with increased
resources; (ii)the finalization of the PNDP with clear guidelines for policy and investment
planning in the sector; (iii)and the formation of regional Port Authorities (APRs).                      The
Government may also consider a series of measures to enhance sector competitivenessincluding
the promotion of greater competition in the market for port services, the establishment of
Logistic Activities Zone (ZAL) in the port of Callao and the implementation of inner freight
terminals. Finally, the construction of a new container terminal and of further facilities for
handlinggeneralcargo within the port of Callao arecritical investment priorities for the sector.


111.ROADINFRASTRUCTURE
BackgroundandBenchmarking
        The poor quality of road infrastructure and associated transport services result in
increased logistics costs and reduced competitiveness for Peruvian firms. The operating cost of
road transport is high in Peru compared to international benchmarks. Given that the main
markets andinput sources are located inthe capital city, these costs are larger for firms operating
outside of the LimdCallao area, and therefore, have a large incidence on regional development.
        Peru's road network has an extension of approximately 78,100 Km, and is divided into
three main categories: the national road network (17,100 Km); the regional road network (14,300
Km); and the rural road network (46,900 Km). Despite important improvements in the last
decade, the state of the road network inPeru remains weak.'20

      network of 10 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in 2003; and an improvement in quality, exemplified by the

         Only 13 percent of the road network is paved, compared to the South American average
of 17 percent, and road density is one of the lowest inSouth America, only above that of Bolivia
and Paraguay.I2* Moreover, Peru is also one of the countries with the least paved roads per

         Over 90 percent of all cargo is mobilizedon Peru's national paved road network of which
77 percent is in either regular or bad condition. Most regional networks, through which
agricultural production centers link to national roads, are either in re lar or bad condition
thereby diminishingthe value of agricultural commodities at destination.
Diagnosis
         The poor state of roads in Peru is mainly the result of insufficient investment in road
construction and maintenance. The growing investment deficit has been exacerbated by delays
in the execution of the roads concession program and overall reduced fiscal space of the

     increase in the percentage of paved roads rated as being in good condition, from 24 percent in 1990 to 67
     percentin 1995.

        Funding for road maintenance is insufficient for the preservation of road assets. The
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) estimates that the financing gap for effective
maintenanceaveraged US$40 million between 1998 and 2000 and has continued to increase as
the road network expands. A national policy for road maintenance defining responsibilities,
sources of funding and prioritizing maintenance does not exist.                    Insufficient funding for
maintenance is also the function of low toll tariffs that do not cover the true cost of road
maintenance and a suspected evasion of toll payments.'23 Toll revenues are also frequently
diverted to cover emergency and reconstruction expenditures.
        The transfer of the management of the regional road network from the MTC to regional
governments has led to a confusing institutional framework. Even though the responsibility for
transport planning and road asset management at the regional level has been transferred to the
Regional Infrastructure Management Units (RIMU); the Regional Road Directorates (RRD),
previously under the MTC and deconcentrated as a result of the reform, continue undertaking
activities, sharing responsibilities with the RlMUs, but sill reporting and functioning as
dependent units of the MTC. Moreover, PROVZAS Depurtamentul (PVD) - an agency of the
MTC in charge of the regional road network, also intervenes in the rehabilitation and
maintenanceof regional roads, largely by force account.

RoadInfrastructure, RegionalDevelopmentand Competitiveness
        Adequate road infrastructure and related services are critical for the achievement of
regional development objectives. An efficient system would involve adequate urban-rural
transport linkages within each region and highquality road infrastructure between major
commercial centers. Targetedregional improvements in road infrastructure can also enhance the
regional competitiveness positions andpromote economic integration with neighboring countries
        The competitiveness of firms located inregions outside Lima dependsingreat part on the
quality of roads connecting them to the capital and the port of Callao. Firms in the Country's
interior receive a large proportion of their inputs from Lima and Callao. Similarly, the Lima
region accounts for on average 20 percent of all sales for firms in other parts of the country.
Given the low quality of the road network and ground transportation services, firms located
outside of Lima suffer losses from product and inputbreakage, theft or spoilage during transport
at twice the magnitude as those incurred by comparators in Lima.'24 Additionally, firms in
regions incur inflated transport costs resulting from excessively high travel times to Lima.
According to a recent Bank study, for example, firms in Trujillo (about 560 kilometers north of
Lima) report on average that sending products to Lima takes 19.6 hours if they have their own
transport and28.4 hours if they contract out the service. These figures relate to the road network
linkingcities alongthe coast, which is the most reliable inthe country.
        Inorder to facilitate regional development andcompetitiveness, there is needto improve
the East-West linkages, complete the North-South corridors, and eliminate the bottlenecks inthe
national and regional road networks through the rehabilitation of key sections of the
departmental road network and the construction of by-passes in some cities. Improved regional
and national road infrastructure could considerably improve the competitiveness of regional
firms.
Government Programand Progress
        The Government's strategy for road infrastructure is based on the promotion of private
sector participation through the concession of key road networks, as a means to increase sector
investment and improve system-wide maintenance. Initially, the Government had developed a
Road Concessions Plan which identified potential concessions based on estimates of their
commercial viability.     As part of that initial effort, two concessions were awarded in 1994
(Arequipa-Matarani) and in 2001 (Ancon-Huacho-Pativilca) involving private investment of
approximately US$456 million.
        The current road concession program is being managed by PROINVERSION, the
Government's investment promotion agency. There are two types of projects that could attract
private investment: (i)non-commercially viable projects that have a large impact on regional
economic development for which the GoP is willing to provide support in the form of direct
 subsidies or minimum revenue guarantees; and (ii)       additional projects for the concession of
relatively high traffic networks that are financially sustainable. The program is underway andthe
 Government expects to award five projects over the 2004-2005 period. Current projects in the
 pipeline include: the concessions of Road Network 1,4, and 6, and of the North and Central
 Amazon IIRSA corridors in the near term, and other road networks in the medium to longterm.
 The most advancedproject is Road Network 6, which is expected to be awardedbefore the end

        The planned North and Central Amazon road concession projects, part of the Amazon
integration and development corridor of IIRSA, are expected to have an impact on economic
activity inborder regions through greater integration with the rest of the country and potentially,
with Brazil.'25
        The Government program also considers the decentralization of road infrastructure,
which consists of the progressive transfer of road asset management responsibilities to regional
and local governments. Decentralized road management will enable regional governments to
implement innovative and need-responsive road maintenance, involving local communities and
micro-enterprises.MTC and the NationalDecentralization Council (CND) are implementing the
strategy to coordinate and execute the transfer of competencies and resources to regional
governments. MTC has developed a plan for devolving the transport planning and execution

125. The South American Regional Infrastructure Integration Initiative (IIRSA for its name in Spanish) covers the
     12 independent nations in the region, and seeks to improve physical integration through investments in
     infrastructure and the harmonization of institutional and regulatory frameworks in infrastructure sectors. In
     order to accomplish its objective, the initiative has promoted the planning of infrastructure investments
     according to the concept of integration and development hubs. The North and Central Amazon corridors in
     Peru are part of the Amazon Integrationand DevelopmentHub.

functions to regional and local                    The plan defines basic competencies and a list of
projects to be transferred to regional entities, establishes eligibility criteria for such entities. and
outlines programs for institutional strengtheningand the transferring of competencies to regional
governments.
        The decentralization o f roads management i s one of the most advanced processes within
the national decentralization program.         The transfer of rural roads management to local
governments started in2002 and will continue during2004 and 2005. As for the decentralization
of regional roads, the Government has established a Multi-sector Commission, consisting of
representatives from the National DecentralizationCouncil (NDC), the Ministry o f Economy and
Finance (MEF), the MTC, and the agency currently in charge of the regional road network,
PROVZAS Depurtumentul (PVD), to ensure a smooth transfer of functions. The commission will
delineate a plan for the gradual transfer of road assets from the central government to the
regions. Additionally, regional governments have developed participatory regional road plans
that require an adequate institutional framework to ensure for implementation.
        Although the Government i s moving forward with its private participation and road
decentralization initiatives, a comprehensive sector strategy for the sustainable modernization
and maintenance of infrastructure i s still lacking.


Recommendations
        Successful implementation of the Government initiatives will require strengthening the
technical and financial capacity of national and regional institutions involved in the management
of road assets.,    Key efforts and reforms should include: (i)          strengthening the investment
planning capacity of road agencies; (ii)     reorienting the allocation of expenditures to meet the
rehabilitation and maintenance needs of the regional road network, and; (iii)establishing a
framework for the adequate programming and funding of maintenance activities.
        It is important to work on the development of the planning and management capacity of
PROVZAS Nucionul (PVN) given that, even after the successful completion of the road
concessions program, a substantial portion of the road network will still remain under public
administration. Additionally, as regional governments assume greater responsibility for road
management, the Government will need to further clarify the division of responsibilities between
levels of government and strengthen the capacity o f responsible regional institutions.
        The Government will also need to addressthe financing gap inthe sector by adjustingtoll
tariffs and optimizing revenue collection mechanisms. The Government's concession program
will decrease revenue collected from tolls and reduce the funds available for the maintenance of
roads still under the administration of PVN. Consequently, it i s important to establish a
sustainable financing framework based on improved collection and additional user charges. The
current tariff i s set at US$ 0.70 and national toll revenue collection in 2003 amounted to
approximately US$ 46 million, far below investment requirements.              The Bank has estimated
that, even after increasing the toll tariff to US$1.50, the annual deficit of investment in road
maintenance would still amount to US$ 70 million.127Revenues can also be increased through
the systematic reduction in evasion through improvements in the monitoring and collection

IV. SUPPORT FROMTHEBANKAND OTHERDONORS

        The Bank has provided technical assistance and financing for the institutional
strengthening activities and investments included in the Government's infrastructure program.
Specifically, the Bank approved a technical assistanceloan to support trade facilitation and the
enhancement of productivity, and an investment operation for the development of an integrated
mass transit system in the city of Lima (Lima Transport Project). The first loan will finance
studies for improving trade related infrastructure and logistics services. The second operation
will finance the development of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) with the objective of improving
mobility within the metropolitan area of Lima. The Bank i s also preparing a Guarantee Facility
project that will set up a mechanism for the prompt provision of Bank partial risk guarantees to
backstop government obligations in Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) projects.
Projects that could benefit from the guarantee facility include the Central Amazon IIRSA
corridor and regional airports. In addition, the Bank is also preparing an operation to support the
decentralized management of roads, to bejointly financed with the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB).
         The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is currently preparing a technical
assistance loan to support the GoP in the preparation of PPIprojects (Total project cost: US$7
million).. In 2003, the IDB approved a Policy Based Loan for the Improvement of
Competitiveness in Peru, which in addition to policy commitments, included some technical
assistance actions for the formulation of a National Transport Policy and the preparation of
regulations for the Ports Law. In2003, the IDB also approved a project for the Modernization of
Tax and Customs Administration, which included a component aimed at simplifying procedures
and introducing new international standardsinto customs operations. The IDB also has an active
project for the Improvement and Rehabilitation of Highways.
         The Andean Development Corporation (CAF) approved in 2003 a loan to support a
Transport Sector Development Program for US$ 172million. The objectives of this program are
to improve and maintain transport infrastructure and support the institutional strengthening of the
public agencies responsible for the sector. In addition, CAF is supporting the competitiveness
agenda through a multi-sector loan that will finance technical assistance activities for the
institutionalization of the National Competitiveness Council (NCC).         Finally, CAF is also
supporting the GoP inthe preparation of infrastructure projects aimed at improving the physical
integration of Peruwith neighboring countries, as part of the IIRSAinitiative.12'
         The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is providing general
support in the improvement of economic governance and competitiveness, including the
development of trade related infrastructure, improvement of policy frameworks, and custom
modernization. USAID i s also supporting the GoP in the preparation of road concessions,
through the Poverty Reduction andAlleviation (PRA) program.

    Annex XII: InvestmentClimate: AdministrativeBarriersAnd Contract Enforcement

          There are many facets of the investment climate which can affect investment, growth and
job creation including infrastructure, technology, supply chain integration as pointed out in the
earlier chapters. However, two areas that are often overlooked are the level ofregulation and the
rule oflaw. Aside from provision of public infrastructure these are the most important areas of
interaction between the public and private sectors and are critical in determining the
attractivenessof a given country or region for investment, whether foreign or domestic."'


A. AdministrativeBarriers: Entry, Operationaland ExitRegulation
          Diagnosis and Relevance: The level and transparency of the regulation of the private
sector has been shown to have a negative relation to firm growth. As can be seen in Figure 1
level of regulation is negatively correlated with economic development, that is, poorer countries
often have more complex andhigher levels of regulati~n.'~'

          Increasing transparency in public administration helps to facilitate investment through
 reducing barriers to entry andharmonizing expectations with experience. Increasing the amount
 and quality of information available to entrepreneurs allows them to more efficiently interact
 with the state, reducing transactions costs and opportunities for corruption. In Peru it is quite
 clear that additional interaction with the state, including regulatory interaction (licensing and

inspections), court cases and participation in public procurement, have a significant negative
effect on entrepreneursperception of regulatory ~ncertainty.'~~
           Without improvement in areas of regulation it is much less likely that increasing trade
openness will Iead to widespread growth. A recent study has shown that trade liberalization,
such as the free trade agreements that Peru is currently pursuing, may not result in economic
growth if the economy is heavily reg~1ated.I~~ of this suggests a large and critical agenda of
                                                         All
reforms that are needed to take advantage of current opportunities and ensure that the potential
benefits are realizedby a large segment of the population.
           Firms across all sectors face considerable administrative barriers to gain access to and
operate in Peruvian markets.              The cumulative affect of lengthy, complex and redundant
proceduresimposed by a range of central and local agencies pose significant costs to firms and
inhibitthe ability to attract foreign investment inthe Peruvian economy. Recent studiesconfirm
that firms face the most burdensome administrative processes during start-up (registration and
permitting) and site-development(land, utilities andconstruction) phases of investments.

            Obtaining an operating license in Peru from local municipalities is by far the most
cumbersome process durin registration, accounting for over one third of the total time to
 register or about 34 days.13'         Micro-enterprises find the process particularly onerous spending
 significantly more time than medium and large firms to obtain licenses. Not surprisingly, Peru
 compares unfavorably with regional and global competitors with respect to business formation
 far surpassing Thailand, China, Morocco and India both in number of days and cost of
 registering a firm andranking amongst the worst performer inLatin America.
           Complex administrative procedures in Peru have long been linked to high levels of
 informality, particularly among small and medium sized enterprises. Continuing high levels of
 informality has very high costs to the economy. It induces a vicious circle of high tax pressure
 on the formal sector, low public investment, flight to informality further reducing the tax base.

To get some sense of the cost to Peru, the most recent estimate puts informality at over 60
percent of GDP, among the highest in Latin America.'34 Given the current IGV tax rate of 19
percent this level of informality is equivalent to 11.3 percent of GDP in forgone taxes by the
government. If Peru could reduce its level of informality, through a combination of reducing
costs and increasing benefits of informality, to 30 percent of GDP - comparableto Mexico or the
Dominica Republic- this would generate an additional 5 percent of GDP in tax revenue and
would allow a reduction of tax rates and have large effects on public spending and the need for
public borrowing.
        In the mid-1990s the Govemment of Peru initiated reforms to reduce unnecessary
bureaucratic procedures. INDECOPI was formed in 1996 and was entrusted to control onerous
administrative using a two pronged approach. The first was the Texto Unico de Procedimientos
Administrutivos (TUPA).           The TUPA instrument aimed to codify essential procedural
requirements and costs so as to avoid the introduction of new burdensome processes by decree.
However it did not require the simplification or rationalization of these processes. The second
tool was a clause in the law giving INDECOPI through its Commission on Market Access
(Comision de Aceso u Mercudos- CAM) the power to reverse laws and regulations if they were
found to be "irrational or illegal."         However many questioned the legality of allowing an
executive agency to strike down regulations and ordinances passed by democratically elected
government. In 2001 the Paniaguaadministration reduced the CAM's role to a purely advisory
function.
        While these efforts were able to reduce to some degree unwarranted increases in
administrative requirements at the central government level they did not lead to widespread re-
consideration of the need for many bureaucratic requirements or a revision of processes. In
particular the system has been unable to track and standardize procedures at the municipal level
where administrative barriers are particularly onerous. In addition, an integrated system to
monitor delays caused by administrative procedureshas yet to be implemented.
        The second important area of regulation is that of public procurement. InPeru the state is
by far the largest single buyer inthe domestic market (government purchases were equivalent to
$US5.6 billion in 2003) and is especially important in many of the regional markets-regional
and local governments will purchase an estimated $US1.35 billion in 2004. A large part of the
total procurement budget (an estimated40 percent) will be spent in small contracts (comprus de
menor c u u n t i ~ ) . ' ~ ~
        The large role of the state in markets for goods and services has a double impact on the
private sector. First if government procurement processes are not transparent and made on a
clear and transparentbasis then there i s a strong message to the private sector that efficiency and
competition are not important. Second, many small firms who would otherwise formalize, in
order to have access to this market opportunity and particularly at the municipal level, will not
bother since they see the exercise as unlikely to lead to new contracts if these are not
transparently allocated.
        Historically public procurement has been less than fully transparent in Peru. Despite
reforms and steady improvement there have been reports of lack of transparency in some public

contracts, particularly at the sub-national level. Available evidence suggests that this lack of
transparencyis particularly onerousfor micro- and small firmsi36.
         Finally, it is critical in a market economy the ability to efficiently close a firm can reduce
unnecessary costs and the wasteful use of scarce productive capacity. The Ley Concursal
governing the closure of firms was reformed several times between 1993 and 2001 in an effort to
improve the bankruptcy processes. Many observers had noted that INDECOPI's Comision de
Procedimientos Concursales, in charge of bankruptcy declaration, followed slow and
cumbersome procedures and frequently took eight years or more to close a business at a cost of
more than US$50,000 per year and that INDECOPI rulings could be reversed arbitrarily by
judges.
         Administrative Barriers and Decentralization: The reduction of administrative barriers,
simplification of business registration procedures and the increased transparency of bureaucratic
processes at the national level are important tools to reach decentralizations ultimate goal of
catalyzing regional development.           Standardizing and integrating national procedures for
licensing, tax administration and other commercial procedures can have an important leveling
effect across regions. Firms in Lima, and other large regional capitals, have an informational
advantageinterms of navigating and fulfillingcomplex regulations and requirements simply due
to their proximity to central agencies. Transparency and integration of procedures, through the
use of electronic systems, can help firms overcome these asymmetries of information and
enhance competitiveness. Procedural rationalization can have the same leveling effect across
municipalities inthe Lima and Callao metropolitan region.
         Reducing administrative barriers at the local Level is even more important than central
government reform for regional competitiveness. In 2003, the Market Access Commission
(Comision de Aceso a Mercados-CAM)              of INDECOPI, reported that 74 percent of the cases
heardby the commission involved onerous regulations at the municipal level, an additional 12
percent involved regional governmentsandjust 14 percent involvedthe central government. The
commission found the municipal regulations inquestion are illegal or irrational in 75 percent of
these cases. Approximately two thirds of all complaints to the C A M have to do with taxes or
fees that are assessed by various government agencies and, as the success rate of complaints
 suggests, there are a large number of payments beingdemanded by municipal governments that
 have no legal basis. This is symptomatic of municipalities struggling to increase their budgets,
 but it is a shortsighted strategy and will have serious repercussions on regional development if
 left unchecked.
         An integrated solution is neededto create a virtuous circle by simultaneously improving
 the financial status of the municipalities while helping them to attract further investment (which
 leads to higher tax income and improved fiscal sustainability). Such a strategy would suggest a
 combined effort at modernizing the municipal tax cadastres (Predial) and their administration
 while simultaneously improving service delivery through the removal of outdated and
 unnecessary bureaucratic procedures. Regional governments implementing competitiveness
 strategies might be well placed to convince and assist their municipalities to pursue such a
 strategy and help channel available technical assistance to reformers. Regional governments
 could also assume responsibility for using INDECOPI's monitoring to help diagnose and work
 together with the municipalities to remove unnecessaryadministrative barriers.

        Simplificationcan have large positive fiscal effects. As we have seen un-collected taxes
are estimatedat over 10percent of GDP. To the extent that simplificationcan facilitate the entry
of currently informal activity into the formal sector this will increase the tax base, raise tax
collection which inturn should allow for lower tax rates, less government borrowing or both.


      Box 1: MunicipalReform inPIURA
      Some municipal governments have already begun to initiate reforms, in the metropolitan
      Lima area (with assistance from the World Bank Group and USAID) and in Piura. The
      experience of Piura is particularly interestingas the municipality undertookthe reforms to
      increase efficiency, improve service to the public and lower "losses".    In studying their
      processesthe municipality found that its own inefficiencieswere causing its costs (in terms
      of salaries and supplies and overhead) to rise well above the established charges for the
      permits. The municipality estimatesthat its costs to processthe seven maintypes of permits
      were exceeding revenue by about US $1 million per year. Nearly half of this loss was
      accountedfor by the Operational License for businesses which took on average 66 days to
      complete. They estimated that the process was so bureaucratic and complicatedthat up to
      60 percent of those who began the process abandoned it andjoined the swelling ranks of
      informal firms in Peru. Faced with this high cost of inefficiency the municipality has
      decided to completely reengineer their processes. The new processes now takes 23 days
      and the municipalityhopes to reducethis tojust 6 days by changingmandatory inspections
      from ex ante to ex post inthe near future.

        Government Program and Progress under DECSAL I The government program on
administrative barriers reduction includes a series of interrelated measures to simplify and
integrate the processing of administrative procedures, promote e-governance, improve public
procurement andto strengthen INDECOPI's role in removing administrative barriers. There has
also been movement by several municipal government's to unilaterally begin to simplify and re-
engineer their internal processesto reduce the time and costs of registration and operation so as
be more attractive as an investment destination. At the moment this is unconnected to central
government programs. The government has also moved to improve the bankruptcy procedures
by passinga new ley concursul streamlining the processinINDECOPI.

         The Government has two large initiatives to increase transparency, improve public
procurement, reduce corruption and red tape, namely the integrated system for government
procurement (Sistema Electronic0 de Adquisiciones y Contraciones de Estado (SEACE) and a
system for simplification of red tape (Sistema de Znformucidn y Monitoreo de Trdmites
Administrativos (SIMTA)). Both systems-SEACE                 and SIMTA-will      initially use the SIAF
system as a base to interconnect all municipalities across Peru and apply integrated procurement
rules and make key forms and requirements available on-line. This option has some advantages
in that it can facilitate the use of common information already contained in identification codes
presently used in the system. For example it will now be possible to exchange information
across many entities using the DNI (personal national identity number) or the RUC (single tax
code). However the program needs to assure that this information is readily available to all
systems and that the new forms reflect this fact rather than continuing to ask for information that
i s already present in the system.



                                                     190

        The integrated procurement system (SEACE) will standardize government procurement
procedures across all government entities (national, regional and municipal) and increase
transparency through putting all procurement online. This system will connect with the SIAF
and the national register of suppliers system, the national register of contracting public entities
and the national catalog of goods, services and works. SEACE will allow all regional and
municipal government procurementto be entered into the online system and to be monitored for
transparency in the selection process. The Government plans to implement the new system by
beginning with the small contracts (compras de menor cuantia).            About 800 municipal
governments will be connected to SLAF over the next several months and SEACE will be
available to use by December 2004 although its use by local governments i s expected to be
gradual with possibly 20 sub-nationalentities usingit by end of 2004.
         The Government has also initiated the development of the Sistema de Znfomzacidn y
Monitoreo de Trdmites Administrutivos (SIMTA). The system aims to serve as a one-stop
electronic portal to access information and process applications for a wide array of
administrative procedures. In the initial stage the system will include 24 different procedures
across six central government agencies. An action planfor implementingSIMTA was developed
inNovember 2003, the guidelines (Zineumientos)have beenissuedand the government teamhas
beenestablished. Inthe meanwhile the core team inPCMhas been working with the SIAF team
to design the backboneof the integrated system and this has advancedconsiderably. The system
i s now able to integrate information between entities (such as SUNAT and SUNARP) and will
be able to reduce the amount of time and redundancy of information requested in a number of
transactions. However the first stage of the system is to begin to put forms on line so that they
can be downloaded - but not filled out electronically - and this first step is expected to be
 initiated in SUNAT andSUNARP by December2004.
         The implementation of SIMTA has been constrained by two factors. First, existing
 regulations governing some administrative procedures are incompatible with the use of
 information and communications technology. The Government plans to issue a Supreme Decree
 in September 2004 to incorporate these reforms.         Second, progress in adapting internal
 information systems of participating government agencies to ensure compatibility with the
 integrated SIMTA system has been slow. To overcome this second issue the government has
 now decided to adapt the SIAF system as a platform for the SIMTA untilit can migrate to a web
 basedplatform.
         Even within the SIAF program however there has not been a defined strategy or
 institution that is working to persuade and assist municipal governments to diagnose and
 simplify the local requirementswhich are frequently the most onerous. This is critical since the
 current SIMTA reforms will not affect the municipal redtape which currently accounts for over
 30 percent of the total time to open a firm. One way to facilitate engagement of municipalities is
 to overcome the current blockage for poor municipalities caused by the requirement to publish
 all TUPAs in a national newspaper. This could be circumvented through a change in the law to
 allow municipalities to publishtheir TUPAs on a webpage (like INDECOPI's) or some other low
 cost outlet.
          SMITA is one element of a broader Government program to promote e-governance as a
  means to increase transparency, simplify bureaucratic procedures and reduce administrative
 barriers to firm growth. Numerous central government agencies have an electronic portal
  providing access to information on activities and procedures. Similar portals, however, have are


                                                 191

only rarely available for regional and municipal governments and agencies. The Government is
currently developing a national strategy for the use of ICT in the public sector. A multisectoral
Commission for the Development of an Information Society (CODESI) has the mandateto draft
an ICT strategy and action plan to improve the regulatory framework for ICT, promote
competition in telecommunications and e-transactions, increase human capital in ICT and
promote e-government. CODESIhas beendrafting the strategy which it is due to deliver inJuly,
2004. In this area the govemment has already made substantial progress in passing legislation
neededto ensure a safe cyber-environment, including laws on: the use of electronic signatures,
authentication and certification mechanisms, electronic invoicing, cyber-crime and privacy and
data protection. Now the government with the help of CODESI needs to prepare and adopt
regulations to makethese laws effective.
        The Metropolitan Municipality of Lima and the participating district municipalities of
Surquillo andComas are set to launch an administrative barriers reduction program in July 2004
incollaboration with the Bank, FIAS, IFC's SME Facility and PROINVERSION. The program
will work with the three municipal governments in an initial phase to reduce administrative
barriers to private investment as identified in a FIAS assisted barriers study completed in 2003.
Additional municipalities will also be invited to participate as the program goes to scale.
Additionally, USAID's Crecer project is working with some municipalities in Lima in a similar
capacity. It does not appear, however, that municipalities outside of Lima (with the exception of
Piura) are presently initiating barrier reduction programs. The Government may consider
facilitating the replication of suchprogramsinother regions.
         Lastly, the Government program has been working to strengthen INDECOPI as a
bankruptcy agency and to control and reduce frivolous red tape. In July 2003 the Government
restoredINDECOPI's authority to remove irrational and illegal barriers to the private sector but
in a more democratic fashion. Now, after an investigation, INDECOPI can emit a report and
recommendations as to the legality or rationality of different government policies and remedies
in case of fault.      However under the new procedures INDECOPI sends the report and
recommendations to the PCM (in the case of supreme decrees or ministerial resolutions) or the
Consejo Regional or Consejo Municipal (inthe case of regional or municipal ordinances). If the
applicable body does not object to the findings and recommendations within 30 days then, using
"positive silence" they are consideredeffective. If relevant body does object then the process
                                                     the
moves to the judicial system (for supreme decrees or ministerial resolutions) or the office of the
regional or municipal ombudsmen for decision and action. These extra steps, while somewhat
more time consuming help legitimate the process and ensure that INDECOPI's reports on
administrative barriers are taken seriously. One deficiency noted with the current system is that
INDECOPI has no review role in government regulation. While this is clearly proper for
regional and municipal regulation (which would be too large to review) giving INDECOPI a in
reviewing key regulations at the central government level (as COFEMER does inMexico) could
 bevery useful.
          To deal with the deficiencies seen in the bankruptcy process a new bankruptcy law (Ley
 de Concursales) was passedin2002 and during 2003 new regulations were put inplace which:

       While it is true that since these new procedures have been in place the number of
bankruptcies has dropped dramatically, this has also coincided with the end of a recession and
resumption of growth. It is too early to be able to evaluate whether the new procedures are
workingbetter than the old, however such an evaluation should be carried out inthe next year.
       Overall the government program on simplification of administrative barriers has been
moving but somewhat slowly. The government has neededquite abit of time to forge consensus
to allow the SIMTA program to move forward. Due to this consensus building process it is
unlikely that the trigger for DECSAL11,to have SIMTA operating in at least4 national agencies,
will be met by December. However an inter-ministerial team has been formed and consultants
are now being hired to begin the simplification process and then place the forms on-line. The
government has moved more quickly on the issue of public procurement and moving small
contracts into the SEACE system should help reduce the amount of corruption at the local level.
The procedures for exit from the market also appear to be better aligning incentives of managers
and creditors to avoid abuses of the system seen in the past however it is too early to judge the
extent of the improvement.
       Challenges under DECSAL II The Government is now in a position to begin making
real progress toward increasing transparency and access in public procurement, reducing
administrative barriers and facilitating improved dispute resolution.         However, additional
reforms are required to consolidate gains and further improve the investment climate. It is
recommendedthat the Government consider a series possible reforms andinitiatives including:
       Simplification: Allowing municipalities to publish TUPAs in low cost venue rather than
national newspapers, ensuring that INDECOPI, in conjunction with other relevant institutions,
should publish and annually monitor the time and cost needed to get key registration,
permissions or other requirements for the private sector (e.g. Licencia de funcionamiento,
registro de salud, us0 del suelo, permiso de construccion, etc.) for all municipalities. Extend
SIMTA to cover complete firm registration, including municipal forms in 4 municipalities by
2005 (2 outside metropolitan Lima) as well as increasing coverage to 2 more entities at the
central government level.
        Create an integrated program to channel technical assistance to municipalities that helps
to improve administration of existing municipal sources of income (principally though
modernizing the municipal tax cadastres (Predial) and their administration) while, at the same
time removing outdated and unnecessary bureaucratic procedures. Such a program might be
channeled through regional governments implementing competitiveness strategies who may be
best placed to convince and assist their municipalities to pursue such a strategy and help channel

region and four municipalities inthe next year.

B. Contract Enforcementand DisputeResolution
         Diagnosis and Relevance: The ability for firms to enforce contracts rapidly and at
 reasonable cost through judicial or alternative means is a critical element in the competitiveness
 as it reduces non-payment risk and facilitates increased levels of transactions.               This is
 particularly important when attempting to increase trade. However, contract enforcement inPeru
 i s more complex and burdensome than in neighboring countries even controlling for income
 level. Peru ranks extremely low on the Doing Business Procedural Complexity Index, in
 contract enforcement costs and the number of days to complete the judicial resolution of a
 dispute. However the largest area of concern is clearly in the difficulties of enforcing ajudicial
 decision as canbe seen from figure 4.
          The Peruvian judicial system is under-funded and i s illequipped to efficiently address
 commercial complaints. Judges are not specialized incommercial subjects and tend to apply the
 norms in a strict manner without considering the economic effects of their decisions. Numerous
 surveys and studies have demonstrated that firms incur considerable costs as a result of
 inadequatecontract enforcement mechanisms. Approximately 85 percent of businessmenbelieve
 the judicial system negatively affects the economy while 41 percent cite specific losses to their




                                                   194

firms.'37     The impact of an inefficient judicial system is particularly adverse for small firms.
Recent studies have found that 58 percent of SMEs have a negative perception of the judicial
system and despite having higher percent of sales delinquent due to non-payment micro and
small firms do not take their disputes to                              In fact the majority of SMEs prefer to solve
their conflicts through informal or alternative means.'39 Some countries have createdspecialized
commercial courts to receive business-related disputes. In Peru, however, such institutions do
not exist. Commercial disputes are addressed by the 61 civil courts in the country. Most
important, however, is the needto reform the execution stage of the process whether it is incivil
or dedicated commercial courts.                     According to Hammergren (2002), the inefficiency of
enforcement proceedings is a serious issue in Peru, and a similar conclusion was reached by a
detailed report on the functioning of secured transactions in Peru in 1997 (World Bank, 1997).
Hammergren and World Bank (1997) both suggest that making the process more automatic,
allowing self-enforcement in the repossession of assets in more cases, improved property and
asset registries and additional work-out procedures for temporarily insolvent or illiquid debtors
would be useful.

           Peru has sanctioned the use of arbitration and conciliation as dispute resolution
 mechanisms and has established public and private centers to facilitate these processes.
 Conciliation became obligatory prior to going to court in 1997 which lead to an explosion of
 cases. However the number of cases has been steadily dwindling from 19,000 cases in 2001 to
 just over 5,300 in 2003. There are strong doubts about the efficacy of obligatory conciliation in
 cases of business disputes. Unfortunately available statistics from the Ministry of Justice do not
  allow for the separation of personal from business disputes which limits our ability to judge its
  true effect on the private sector. From the available statistics however, conciliation seems
  effective inabout 30 percent of all cases incivil matterswhile inthe remaining 70 percent either
  agreement is not reached or one or both parties fails to attend the conciliation. Such high levels
  of non-attendance(which is a noted problem in civil courts)'4o suggests that conciliation i s not a

highly effective measure. However thirty percent reduction of cases going to court could be
consideredas useful, unfortunately we have no data from the period prior to obligatory use so we
cannotjudge what percentage of cases were being (or could have been) resolved by conciliation
prior to the obligatory requirement. These figures suggest that a more thorough analysis of the
success rates of conciliation of business disputes (which is not possible with the available data)
would be useful in considering whether to abolish obligatory conciliation in certain types of
disputes.

        The arbitration system, in contrast to conciliation, is almost solely for business disputes
and is not widely used. For example the Lima chamber of commerce, one of the largest dispute
centers in the country, recorded an average of 131 cases a year from 1998-2003, and is used
mainly by large firms with the average dispute just over US$900,000 over the same period (see
Figure 6).
        Experts in arbitration agree that the process as it is currently offered in the market is
overly formal and too costly for SMEs. However they also agree that wider use could be
achieved usinga simplified and less costly process that would be attractive to smaller firms. To
achieve this it would be necessary to increase knowledge of arbitration as a binding resolution
mechanism through a publicity campaign as well as increase institutional support such as
increasedtraining and minimumaccreditation of the arbitration chambers. This was the kindof
support given to conciliation which has now multiplied to cover all regions of Peru while
arbitration is still only available inafew regions.
        One way to reduce both the number of disputes as well as the time neededto adjudicate
them is to improve the functioning and use of public registries to clarify property rights. While
the government has been working on improving registries for land titles the problem of titles for
movable property rights has remained unresolved. Registries for assets, particularly moveable
assets, that can be used as collateral are very important to developing and deepening financial
markets. In Peru, moveable assets are estimated to make up two thirds of most firms capital




                                                 196

stock.'41 Therefore, if firms cannot use these assets as collateral, they have only one third of
their assets available to generate financing. Although these registries exist inPeru, as inmuch of
Latin America, they do not fulfill the role that they should becauseof the way that they function.
In Peru, according to Cantuarias (2002) there are no less than 17 different registries including
registry for vehicles, a registry for agriculture, a registry for industry and "global and floating''
registry. There are several problems with the current registry system however, as Cantuarias
points out, the registries were createdunder different laws (cddigo civil, cddigo de comercio, ley
general de industrim, to name a few) and each has separate rules and regulations. Most of the
registries are not interconnected, so a lender must searchall possible registries before accepting a
moveable asset and there are no overarching laws to establish orders of precedence between
claims filed in different registries. The result is that valuable assets cannot be used as collateral
for much neededfinancing.

         Dispute Resolution and Decentralization: Reforms in dispute resolution should have
two main effects, first to increase trade by allowing contracting between unknown parties if
enforcement is credible. Secondly improved alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and
judicial processes should reduce congestion in regional and local courts.                  From a fiscal
 standpoint these reforms, over the medium term should help expand the tax base and reduce
 expenditureson courts.
         Government Program and Progress under DECSAL I The government has used a
 combination of approaches to enhance commercial dispute resolution mechanisms. The
 Government program includes efforts to create commercial courts and strengthen alternative
 commercial disputeresolution mechanisms. Financially sustainablecommercial courts are being
 planned in Lima and are expectedto be launched in the next several months. The Government

program would be further strengthened through reforms in the application of justice on
commercial issues including, for example, reforms to introduce homogeneity in sentencing
criteria. The Government concurrently plans to provide more information to the SME sector on
conciliation and arbitration mechanisms. The communication campaign will include basic
information on services, performance data for each center and a series of conferences
coordinatedby the Ministry of Justice.
         The government also initiated work OR registries of movable assets and preparedthe draft
law of registries (Anteproyecto de ley de guruntius). However this law appears to be stuck in
committee in congress and informed observers are highly critical of the changes that have been
made to the initial draft, which they fear protect bureaucratic interests and will not lead to new
reform.
         Challenges under DECSAL Z I The Government has made progress toward launching
the commercial courts as recommendedby the Comision de Mugistrados which should help to
improve the time needed to resolve a case as well as increase the quality of the service received
by firms. However, as a number of studies have pointed out, the key problem in Peru has been
the lack of execution ofjudicial decisions, that is, ensuring that decisions, once taken, are in fact
carried out. This lack of execution has large negative effects on private contraet enforcement
since firms have difficulty getting restitution despite having a positive decision. Therefore
enforcement should be made a central part of this reform process, either through extending the
ability for self-enforcement (as is already happening informally in many markets such as
householdappliances) or through reform of certified agents (e.g. bailiffs or private enforcement)
to ensure decisions are implemented.
         Reform of moveable asset registries to form a coherent integrated system that allow the
identification of other claims, establishes priority of claims and facilitates rapid, low cost
registration, search of claims and reclamation of assets by all parties, not only banks. An
efficient, well functioning asset registry combined with streamlined debt collection proceedings
will revolutionize credit markets in Peru and allow for new instruments to be created that can
reach smaller firms. This inturn will free up a large fixed asset class (machinery and equipment)
that currently is not eligible for collateralization for most borrowers, particularly small and
 mediumenterprises. These measures are summarizedinthe table below.
