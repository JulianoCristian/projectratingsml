F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The objectives of the program are threefold (i) to protect fiscal sustainability during
Peru's transition to a more decentralized state; (ii) to assist strengthening management
and fiscal capacity at regional and local levels for their progressive assumption of service
responsibilities; and (iii) to support the creation of a better regulatory and investment
environment for upgrading Peru's regional competitiveness.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macroeconomic Context at Appraisal In 2002, a year of deep recession for some countries in
Latin America and average GDP growth of -1.2 percent, Peru's growth was the highest in the
region at 5.3 percent. Led by mining, manufacturing and construction, real GDP grew nearly
two points above the original forecasts of 3.5 percent. The annual inflation rate of 1.5 percent
(end-of period) was the second lowest in the region in 2002. Consumption also boomed,
supported by record low interest rates and stability in prices and the exchange rate. Investment
gradually recovered, but only during the last quarter of 2002. The current account deficit
remained at manageable levels and was comfortably financed by public and private capital
inflows. In 2002, largely boosted by mining exports, Peru recorded its first trade surplus since
1990. Gross reserves at the end of 2002 stood at US$9.7 billion, 103 percent of dollar deposits
in the banking sector and more than twice short-term debt.

Strong macroeconomic performance has continued in the past five years. Peru has had one of
the best-performing economies in Latin America, surpassed only by Venezuela--an oil exporting
country--and Argentina--which is coming out of a deep recession.                                        Based on sound
macroeconomic policies and strong demand for Peruvian commodity exports, GDP grew 5.7
percent on average in the five years since 2002, and reached a remarkable 8 percent in 2006.
The recent upswing in domestic demand has been supported by strong growth in consumption
and in private investment. Given the small size of the domestic market, Peru targeted
international trade as potentially the most important growth and development engine. Market-
oriented economic policies adopted since 1990 have yielded a substantial expansion of external
trade, more than tripling exports in absolute terms between 1990 and 2006, and achieving an
average annual increase of 26 percent in export earnings between 2002 and 2006. This growth
has been all the more impressive considering the external shocks buffeting the region in the early
2000s as well as the political instability that prevailed during the Toledo administration. It is
noteworthy that economic growth, and more importantly employment growth, has been led by
regions other than Lima.

Fiscal and monetary policy was well-managed, with steady declines in public sector deficits and
low, stable inflation rates. Fiscal consolidation continued throughout the program period and the
combined public sector balance came down every year, from a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in



                                                               1

2001 to a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in 2006. Tax collection has been increasing steadily and
reached 15 percent of GDP in 2006, well above the program target of 13 percent of GDP.
Supported by fiscal prudence and active debt management, public debt was lowered from 46
percent of GDP in 2001 to 33 percent of GDP in 2006.                                                                                                                   As a consequence, Peru's
creditworthiness has improved substantially leading to credit rating upgrades and record
sovereign bonds spreads, below the region's average. Year-end inflation for 2006 reached 1.1
percent; lower than the target range of 1.5-3.5 percent. The inflation target was met consistently
in the last four years. As a consequence the Central Bank decided to align the inflation rate target
more closely with average inflation rates in Peru and major trading partners, by reducing the
target to 2 percent, while keeping the tolerance band at 1 percent.

Peru's external position has improved remarkably, as well. The current account balance has
registered steady improvements, reaching a record trade surplus of over $6 billion in 2006. The
strong external performance has been driven in good measure by the boom in commodity prices,
particularly for mineral exports, by the coming on line of new mining and hydrocarbon projects,
and by the surge of non-traditional exports. Although mining production accounts for over half
of all Peruvian exports, non-traditional exports have grown rapidly, 20 percent on average
annually since 2000, particularly of specialized agricultural products such as asparagus, grapes
and avocados. Other export sectors such as fisheries and textiles have also posted significant
gains in recent years.

While Peru's macroeconomic performance has been very good in the past few years, poverty
remains high. The national poverty rate dropped only two percentage points between 2002 and
2004, and half the population (51.6 percent) lives in conditions of poverty. However, since 2003
per capita incomes of the poor and the rates of poverty and extreme poverty have started showing
improvements, especially in rural areas, driven by broadening economic growth. Average
incomes of the poorest tenth of the population rose 33 percent between 2001 and 2004, while the
incomes of the wealthiest tenth of the population remained level over the same period. Growth
has had the most impact on extreme poverty rates, especially in rural areas. Extreme poverty
declined from 24 percent to 19 percent between 2001 and 2004 nationally, but rural extreme
poverty fell from 50 percent to 40 percent over the period, while urban extreme poverty declined

from 10 percent to 8 percent. Although no data are available after 2004, recent improvements in
employment in urban areas indicate that continued growth through 2005 and 2006 have further
reduced poverty. Income inequality also remains relatively high, with the Gini coefficient
improving slightly from 0.52 to 0.50 during the same period.

Decentralization Background at Appraisal. Peru, among Latin American countries, is a late
comer to decentralization. For centuries Peru has been characterized by centralized
administrations with strong economic and social disparities across sub-regions, and oscillated
between democratic and military rules. Before 1990, Peru had a double structure at the regional
level, with regional development authorities on the one hand, and prefects and sectoral branches
of the line ministries on the other. It was only in 1979 that the new Constitution reinstated
municipalities and opened the door to decentralization.       Decentralization was seen as an
important element of the return to democratization after 12 years of military rule. The first
administration of Garcia attempted to decentralize several functions by creating regional
governors, assemblies, and developing authorities parallel to the existing structures and sub-
regional planning entities at departmental levels. Poorly-designed fiscal decentralization on the
basis of unclear functional assignment resulted in duplication and inefficiencies.         These
combined with consequences of the severe recession in the late 1980s led to a reversal of
decentralization.

In 1992, the Fujimori government suspended the regional governments. Branch government
agencies responsible to central command, the so-called CTARs (Transitory Councils of Regional
Administrations) were created, which channeled substantial resources to the regions. They co-
existed with sectoral branches, but also with other autonomous governmental agencies and
additional provincial delegations of those agencies, further compounding the very high level of
fragmentation and duplication in the social sectors. At the end of the Fujimori administration
(1990-2000), only 5 percent of public sector spending was in the hands of local governments.
Sub-national expenditures were financed by central government transfers, and municipalities
exercised little or no revenue and expenditure authority. Responsibilities among national,
departmental, and the two municipal levels, blurred and overlapped, and a series of autonomous
institutions operated parallel to sector ministries.

The return to full democracy after the Fujimori administration led to a drive for greater
transparency and reduction of corruption. The Congress, courts, political parties, media and civil
society took advantage of the renewed political environment to participate actively in policy
making and keep a vigilant eye on public management.        The    timing   for    reducing   the
concentration of state power by decentralizing public functions and resources to lower levels of
government and communities was ripe. A constitutional amendment was approved in early 2002
mandating political and fiscal decentralization. Regional elections were carried out in November
2002 and 25 regional presidents were appointed, along with elected provincial and district
municipal majors. There was a broad consensus to decentralize, demonstrated by an impressive
commitment of all parts of government and the support of the population, and by the rapid speed
of the legislative process. Decentralization was seen as an integral part of modernization and
democratization, as well as a way to reduce inequalities and to increase responsiveness to local
needs.

A legal framework for a gradual and fiscally neutral decentralization process was initiated
immediately. Three organic laws were enacted to guide the process of decentralization1, the
Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency Law (FRTL) was amended to include fiscal rules for
sub-national governments, and a Fiscal Decentralization Law (FDL) was approved to ensure a
fiscally sound process. The decentralization agenda aimed at a comprehensive, yet gradual
process in several stages. In addition, the decentralization agenda was intended to support the
Government's goals of increased regionalization.


Competitiveness Background at Appraisal. The decentralization framework initiated in 2002
gave regional and macro-regional governments a mandate to stimulate investment,
competitiveness and growth. At the time the decentralization program was launched, the country
was characterized by sizable geographical income disparities. The ultimate and high level
objective of decentralization was to increase the level of regional development and economic
activity, raise employment, and reduce poverty. Thus, the success of decentralization hinged on
ensuring improvements in countrywide competitiveness and productivity. For that reason, the
Government of Peru's (GoP) vision of decentralization involved a twin agenda: devolve powers
to the regions and address key competitiveness bottlenecks, with strong focus on tackling
regional development disparities. At the time of the preparation of this series of loans, the
administration had stated two key goals related to competitiveness and growth (i) improve Peru's
international standing on competitiveness by moving 20 places up in the Global Business
Competitiveness Ranking; (ii) and doubling the value of exports to reach US$14.2 billion by
2006, with emphasis on nontraditional exports.
In spite of important structural reforms that supported increased competitiveness and exports2,
Peru's export performance over the decade of the 1990s had been disappointing, particularly
when compared to comparator countries in Latin America, and especially in agro-industry
products. Exports are often considered a proxy for competitiveness and (barring major subsidies)
there is usually a strong correlation between competitiveness and exports.                                Moreover,
international experience shows that exports can be a powerful engine of economic recovery and
growth. In 2002, it was clear that this potential had been comparatively unrealized in Peru,
largely due to a lack of focus on the subject, and most importantly, due to the absence of a
coherent, overall framework to guide policy design.

In sectors where the country had some comparative advantage, such as agriculture and
manufacturing, export performance was weak. For instance, as of 2002, Peru's fruit exports
amounted to about US$60 million, compared with Colombia (US$800 million), Ecuador
(US$600 million) and Chile (US$1.4 billion). Peru's manufacturing exports accounted for only
20 percent of total exports, which compared unfavorably to the average of 58 percent for the
entire Latin America and Caribbean region. While its potential for developing textiles and

Governments (OLRG), and the Organic Law on Municipalities (OLM).
2. External tariffs have been more than halved and non-tariff barriers were among the lowest in the LAC region.
An adequate foreign investment law and a reasonable business environment were in place, which helped attracting
significant FDI flows. Numerous privatizations and concessions, involving telecommunications, electricity, natural
gas, railways, toll roads, the Matarani port and the Lima airport, had created significant private sector participation
in infrastructure.

apparels appeared promising, Peru exported only US$25 per capita to the United States in the
garment sector. By comparison, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica all exported roughly
US$300 per capita in that sector.

The Government made increasing competitiveness a state priority, and an essential goal for its
decentralization program. The Government demonstrated considerable commitment to the
achievement of the national development goals laid out in the Acuerdo Nacional (National
Accord) signed in July of 2002. The accord reflects the common vision of the country's long-
term development goals in a number of areas and was prepared with the participation of political,
religious and civil society actors. For its short- and medium-term strategy, the Government
prepared a Hoja de Ruta (road map) 2004-06 which is in line and supports the National Accord
goals with a set of specific policies. The Toledo Administration program had had a strong focus
on competitiveness, built over five pillars with regional focus:

       · Institutionalize the Competitiveness Agenda and Design and Implement Regional
           Initiatives: Strengthen institutions to provide leadership and coordination in order to
           advance the overall competitiveness program.
       · Facilitate Exports and Trade: Support increases in exports, particularly non-
           traditional ones; improve trade facilities in the regions; identify and open markets for
           Peruvian products; and reduce trade-related costs.
       · Improve the Mix and Quality of Peruvian Products and Increase Productivity:
           Address the relative low quality, value-added, and technology and innovation
           intensity of Peruvian products and increase the human capital of the labor force.
       · Reduce Logistics Cost and Improve Public Services in Infrastructure: Reduce high
           logistics costs, which significantly hamper country competitiveness, and the low
           efficiency of Peru's public infrastructure services.
       · Improve the Investment Climate: Reduce the cost of doing business by eliminating
           administrative barriers and strengthening commercial dispute resolution practices as a
           means to improve the business environment.


The multi-pronged competitiveness strategy has led to demonstrable gains. Export growth has
been particularly impressive since 2001, resulting in a compound annual growth rate above 20
percent between 2001 and 2005. In comparison, this rate for 1990-2001 was only 7 percent. The
strong export performance has continued in 2006, with increases of 38 percent over the previous
year. The benefits were widely distributed, with many micro and small sized firms benefiting.
More than 400 new products have been exported since 2001 and near 2000 firms became new
exporters, many of them small firms. Over 2001-2005, about 105 small firms grew to become
medium size.

Yet, despite the recent impressive trade expansion, total exports in Peru still represents a low
percentage of GDP, close to 21 percent in 2005. This figure is particularly striking when
compared to other countries in Latin America such as Chile (34 percent), Venezuela (32 percent),
Mexico (28 percent), and even Bolivia (24 percent). Similarly, exports per capita in Peru, at
approximately US$580 in 2005, are roughly half the Latin American average. Thus there is
ample potential still for further expansion, and improved competitiveness and productivity
enhancement will remain state priorities in this context.



                                                  5

Non-traditional export growth has been promising and the agriculture sector, among others, has
seen large gains. Textiles, fisheries and chemicals grew 33, 35 and 51 percent respectively
during 2004. When mining is omitted, non-traditional exports have been steadily increasing as a
share of total exports. Overall non-traditional exports grew 242 percent from 1993 to 2004, while
traditional exports excluding mining grew only 145 percent. Given that exports are concentrated
in a relatively small number of regions, products, and firms, there is much room for expansion
and diversification, especially among small and medium enterprises outside of Lima. A wealth of
empirical experience points to the importance of diversifying a country's export base to mitigate
the impact of international price movements and increase value-added levels where possible and
the importance of diversification and intra-industry trade on growth. The diversification of
Peru's exports thus becomes a high priority for the country. The bulk of Peru's exports are still
concentrated in primary (and traditional) products. These traditional goods include mining, fish
meal, agricultural, and oil products and accounted for about 71 percent of all exports in 2005.
Traditional exports tend to have less long-term growth potential than non-traditional products
and are highly dependent on volatile commodity markets. Export diversification is critically
linked to higher investment, productivity improvement, and the development of new product
lines, in non-traditional sectors.

Bank Assistance: It was in this context that the World Bank and the Government of Peru
agreed on a programmatic structural adjustment operation for the assistance on its
decentralization and competitiveness agenda.            The first loan, Decentralization and
Competitiveness Structural Adjustment Loan, was approved together with the request from the
Government to move from to a "High Case" Bank lending scenario, as the CAS's triggers for the
"High Case" were fulfilled by December 2003. Two subsequent operations were approved on
December 2004 and December 2005. Reflecting changes in Bank lending policies, the lending
instrument became a development policy loan, and the loan was titled "Decentralization and
Competitiveness Development Policy Loan" (DCDPL3). The initial allocated amount for the last
operation was increased by US$50 million per request of the Government of Peru, and after
careful evaluation of the achievement of the government's program of reforms. The program of
reforms under these series of loans aimed at providing assistance in the decentralization of public
functions and resources, in tandem with measures to help ensure continued sound public finances
and economic growth. The reform agenda in these two fronts was also supported through
technical assistance lending (Institutional Capacity for Sustainable Fiscal Decentralization and
Trade Facilitation and Productivity Improvement technical assistance loans), a technical
assistance on debt management and analytical and advisory services (Country Economic
Memorandum, Micro-Constraints to Growth Study, Poverty Assessment, Municipality Debt
Study, among others) . In addition, the series of DCDPLs were complemented by two technical
assistance projects, one by IFC in Cajamarca and the other one under the Extractive Industries

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The Decentralization and Competitiveness Policy Loans (DCDPL) series aimed at: (a)
safeguarding fiscal stability during decentralization (b) increasing institutional capacity for
progressive assumption of service responsibilities; and (c) supporting the Government's
competitiveness agenda, which is based on an expanded role for Peru's regional governments.
The DCDPL were designed to provide a series of benefits. The decentralization process had the
twin benefits of promoting sustained, broad-based economic growth and improving the quality of
and access to government services by all citizens. These, in turn, will contribute to the reduction
of poverty and will address equity imbalances in Peru, particularly in rural areas where the
benefits of decentralization would be felt most strongly.


The Government of Peru decided to follow a gradual approach to decentralization, rather than a
single comprehensive campaign. In its approach, Peru was able to capitalize on the lessons
learned from other Latin American countries that adopted and began implementing
decentralization policies two or more decades ago. It also drew on its own--largely failed--
prior experience in this field.        The Government set three guiding principles for the
decentralization reform agenda:

           · Decentralization should be fiscally neutral
           · Decentralization should be gradual
           · Decentralization should enhance economic competitiveness

The program was designed to gradually shift the emphasis of the reform program. At the outset,
it stressed fiscal sustainability, including the establishment of the new fiscal decentralization
framework and of a hard budget constraint. For the second and third operations the emphasis of
the reform program was moved towards enhancing efficiency and continuing improvement in
service delivery while bolstering regional competitiveness for economic growth. The program
hinged on significant policy formulation, legal reform and administrative actions for (i)
improving budget accounting and reporting at all levels of government; (ii) strengthening
monitoring and evaluation capacity especially at the national level; (iii) mobilizing greater public
and private resources and participation; and (iv) enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of key
government institutions.

DCDPL I. The first loan placed special attention on the Government's tax reform objectives and
the importance of implementing decentralization in a fiscally neutral manner, such that
decentralization would create no additional fiscal burden on the public sector, either through
transfers to or borrowing by regional or local governments The program aimed to strengthen
central government supervision of regional and local payroll and debt management, particularly
floating and contingent (pension) debt. In this context the objectives were:
    · Safeguard fiscal sustainability and fiscal neutrality
    · Reduce fiscal distortions by eliminating sector tax exemptions
    · Guarantee a minimum capacity standard for delivery of decentralized services




                                                 7

   · Strengthen sub-national institutions to allow a minimum of efficiency in providing
       services and, at the same time, be more transparent and accountable in all phases of the
       revenue and expenditure cycle.
   · Allow for financial savings, boost efficiency and transparency in the public
       administration, and provide the ground for much-needed further civil service reform in
       benefit of decentralization.
   · Begin process for transfer of social service responsibilities as well as for guaranteeing
       fiscal sustainability and efficiency of regional and local governments. Gain greater
       control over the highly fragmented civil service.
   · Democratize the budgeting process giving voice to the local communities in choosing
       alternatives to channel public revenues.


DCDPL II. The second loan reflected an expansion in the overall program to include a heavier
emphasis on supporting the Government of Peru's competitiveness agenda. The program also
moved towards measures that enhance efficiency and quality in service delivery. Through a
focus on results and a change in the incentives framework, the second loan aimed to ensure the
necessary structural changes that allow long-term sustainable reforms. It was based on an
approach that targets key reforms areas which are most vulnerable at the early stage of the
decentralization process and the competitiveness reforms crucial at the start of the FTA
negotiations. Reforms remained based on the guiding principle of gradualism to ensure a careful
transfer of responsibilities and resources while avoiding duplication at different levels of
government. Key fiscal and economic reforms were combined with participatory approaches
and change management that allow for greater consensus and sustainability of these reforms.

The proposed second loan was designed to support the following key aims of the overall
Government's reform program:

Decentralization and Fiscal Sustainability
       · Ensure fiscal sustainability in the newly decentralized context;
       · Expand the tax base and strengthen tax administrations;
       · Finance regional and local governments in direct proportion to their abilities to
           discharge the responsibilities they will assume;
       · Ensure hard budget constraints at regional and local levels by, among other measures,
           establishing a new regime for regional and local borrowing, enforce accounting
           standards for monitoring and control of local debt, and effectively apply sanctions
           when needed;
       · Ensure gradual transfer for resources and responsibilities following a rigorous
           accreditation process of fiscal and management capacities; and
       · Promote a centralized, ex-post monitoring and evaluation system to enhance the
           quality of public expenditure and fiscal sustainability at all levels of government.




                                                 8

Institutional Development for Decentralization
        · Stimulate efficient use and maintenance of public assets for resource mobilization and
            development;
        · Reinforce budgeting, accounting and reporting standards at all levels of government
            for improved monitoring, evaluation and planning;
        · Institutionalize community and private sector participation and reinforce transparency
            in the interest of democratic benefits and higher allocation efficiency; and
        · Support gradual reform of the civil service at regional and local levels.

Competitiveness and Economic Growth
        · Promote national and regional competitiveness planning and implementation;
        · Promote and facilitate export development;
        · Improve the quality and mix of Peruvian products, through comprehensive quality
            and innovation programs in collaboration with the private sector, and the integration
            of small and medium-sized enterprises into export supply chains;
        · Reduce logistics costs through improved policy frameworks and service provision at
            ports and on the road networks, as well as the facilitation of improved transit services;
        · Improve the business environment and investment climate; and
        · Assist the regions in developing capabilities to develop and implement
            competitiveness and investment programs and to strengthen the regional business
            environment.
DCDPL III. The broad objective of the third loan was to deepen advances made on the previous
two loans. The specific objectives were 1) protection of the country's fiscal sustainability during
Peru's transition to a more decentralized state; 2) stronger management and fiscal capacity at sub-
national levels and a progressive improvement in services delivery; and 3) to enhance
competitiveness through an improved regulatory and investment environment, emphasizing
export promotion and regional development. The program supported decentralized borrowing
and debt-reporting procedures for sub-national governments.                 It also supported the
implementation of a centralized (MEF-based) public expenditure evaluation system. The system
aimed to monitor, coordinate and assess public expenditure at all levels of government, enhance
the quality of budget decisions, and ensure efficient and targeted service delivery.

On the competitiveness side, because the core institutions and legal framework to enhance
competitiveness was already in place, DCDPL III emphasized strengthening institutions and
initiatives at the regional level. Its goal was to assist the regions in developing capabilities to
implement competitiveness and new investment programs. The program also aimed to make
investment procedures more business friendly. The loan supported efforts to increases non-
traditional exports by improving regional trade facilities and providing technical assistance on
trade related issues. Finally, the program supported initiatives to reduce logistical costs by
improving the policy framework as well as transportation services.

1.3 Revised PDO
The program objectives remained unchanged.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

The program under the DCDPLs series supported reforms in three strategic pillars:

               1. Decentralization and Fiscal Sustainability.
               2. Institutional Development for Decentralization.
               3. Competitiveness and Economic Growth.

1. Decentralization and Fiscal Sustainability. This component was built around four areas: (a)
overall fiscal targets, aimed at strengthening the government's commitment to fiscal
sustainability; (b) tax policy and tax administration, aimed at ensuring the sustainability of
transferred functions, eliminating regional and sectoral-based exemptions, and gradually moving
from fiscal transfers to tax-sharing inter-government agreements and enhanced tax
administration capacity at the regional level; (c) fiscal transfers and accreditation of
management capacities, aimed at greater efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of
decentralized public services; (d) regional and local borrowing and financial management,
aimed at achieving sub-national fiscal responsibility and ensure hard budget constraint at sub-
national levels.

2. Institutional Development for Decentralization. This component included reforms in: (a)
budget and management, aimed at maintaining fiscal discipline on sub-national levels while
assuming budget autonomy and introducing inter-government budget coordination; (b)
transparency and participation, aimed at increasing citizen knowledge of, and involvement in,
public budgeting; (c) transparency in procurement, aimed at enhancing transparency, increasing
efficiency and reducing transaction costs in public procurement; (d) civil service reform, aimed
at establishing an effective framework for enabling all government levels to have adequate
personnel and to manage them better.


2. Competitiveness and Economic Growth. The third pillar of the Government's
decentralization reform program and second component of the DCDPL program was the
enhancement of Peru's overall competitiveness and productivity position, focused on five key
themes: (i) agenda and institution-building for competitiveness; (ii) exports and trade facilitation;
(iii) improving productivity and the mix and quality of Peruvian products; (iv) reducing logistics
costs and upgrading infrastructure services; and (v) improving the investment climate.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas
The policy areas remained unchanged. The programmatic approach, however, allowed for
adapting the policy framework and triggers to the changing policy environment and new
challenges that were arising as the decentralization process advanced. An example of this was
inclusion of implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system under the expenditure
management and planning policy area. During the preparation of the second operation the
Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance, MEF, indicated their interest on developing a
Management Control and Evaluation System geared to enhancing the quality of public
expenditures through improving the quality of government programs and of information needed
to take budget decisions. The Bank strongly supported the adoption of the new system, as it has
proven to be the most powerful instrument to raise the efficiency and effectiveness of



                                                10

  government programs at the central and decentralized government levels. The Bank and the
  MEF jointly organized international seminars and study tours, with the support of the Bank
  Fiscal TAL (Institutional Capacity for Sustainable Fiscal Decentralization) project for the design
  phase of the new system. The program under the new series of DPLs approved on December
  2006 the Bank Board continues supporting this effort. The MEF has launched a results based
  budgeting agenda, which is one of the main pillars of the new loans.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

The success of this demand driven series of programmatic lending was due to the high
motivation and ownership by the GoP. The series of loans also supported a program that had the
support of all stakeholders, including NGOs, civil society organizations, unions, etc. The MEF
provided strong and stable leadership from the outset. The leadership provided by the MEF was
enhanced by its consultative approach with other official and non-official agencies. Borrower
commitment was evident across all layers of government. Many alcaldes or municipality mayors
moved decisively to take advantage of the momentum generated by the national thrust toward
decentralization. On the institutional side the same momentum proved key in helping other
government agencies succeed in implementing most of their program for example, National
council for Competitiveness (CNC), Ministry of Trade And Tourism (MINCETUR), Investment
Agency (PROINVERSION), CITES and others. The technical quality of the staff at the MEF
was another element that contributed to the success of the program and the progress achieved on
decentralization.

An additional factor in the successful implementation of the series of DCDPLs was the good
relationship between the Bank and the GoP. The program was designed in close partnership with
GoP officials and in line with country's vision. The Bank team responded timely and with high
quality to the Government needs and interests, and became am important partner in the
implementation of the fiscal decentralization agenda. Several workshops, conferences, and
consultations were conducted jointly for defining the policy areas. In addition, the Bank team
prepared policy and technical notes for each operation which were included as annexes
supporting the definition of the program, triggers and proposing the future reform agenda. The
program design and implementation was also supported by AAAs such as the Public Expenditure
Review, Micro-Constraints to Growth Study, Country Economic Memorandum on Growth and
Trade, Poverty Assessment and Sub-National Debt Study.


Co-financing arrangements, institutional coordination and partnerships also contributed to the
success of the program. These series of loans were closely coordinated with other donors,
including the Inter American Development bank (IADB), European Union (EU), U.K.'s
Department for International Development (DFID), German Technical Cooperation (GTZ), US
Agency for International Development (USAID), and others. The program served as platform to
achieve a coordinated, open policy dialogue between the Government and donors, and has served
as an important reference for other donor activities in Peru related to decentralization and
competitiveness. The DCDPL series were coordinated with the IMF at all stages of preparation,
ensuring that both institutions reinforced financial and technical support to the country. The
dialogue focused on the macroeconomic background, setting of triggers, and risks, and
estimation of fiscal implications of Bank's operations. The IMF took the lead in assisting in the
design of tax reform.

The program design also contributed to its successful implementation. The two key challenges
for Peru were to make the decentralization process work administratively and to create the
economic foundations for decentralized economic development through an improved investment
climate, better market access and the development of internationally competitive industries. In
order for regions to be the engines of increased growth, employment and reduced poverty, an


                                               15

effective decentralization process must be complemented with a regional and local
competitiveness program. This is the rationale for the subject choice of the DCDPL program.

The co-financing arrangement with KfW, the German Development Bank, also facilitated rapid
response to the Government's needs. The two last loans were co-financed with the KfW. The
KfW participated in the Identification, Pre-Appraisal and Appraisal missions and worked with
the Bank and the Government to develop the agreed policy-matrix. Due to the positive results on
co-financing the DCDPL series, a strong partnership has been established with KfW, and the
new series of DPLs are also co-financed.

Risks identified at appraisal (political, economic, and financial) were well managed during the
implementation period. As discussed earlier, Peru's macroeconomic performance has been
stellar and economic and financial vulnerabilities have been substantially reduced. The benign
macroeconomic environment facilitated the implementation of the decentralization agenda
without jeopardizing fiscal consolidation. The economic program was also supported by a
precautionary IMF Stand-by-Arrangement, which was completed successfully in August of 2006.
Lastly, the Peruvian economy was solid and had strong fundamentals built in to weather risks
related to exchange rate and interest fluctuations. Moreover, dollarization has been declining
steadily, financial intermediation has deepened further and the financial system's resilience
strengthened.

On the political front, the program was implemented during a period characterized by a cloud of
political instability, and the program faced strong sectoral pressures for deviating from prudent
fiscal policies. These risks were mitigated by the strong ownership of the Government and by a
continuity of its policy agenda in spite of several Cabinet changes. The program also faced some
institutional coordination risks, in particular by depending on a string coordination and
collaboration among the MEF, the national Council for Decentralization (CND), the Presidency
of the Council of Ministers (PCM), and the CNC. Institutional coordination was good and
collaborative among all the actors, with the exception of the CND. The CND was created to
coordinate the decentralization process and was responsible for (i) overseeing and monitoring the
program; (ii) providing support for institution-strengthening of regional and local governments;
(iii) coordinating and channeling international assistance; and (iv) designing plans for the
transfer of resources and functions to regional and local governments, and from 2004 onwards,
their annual decentralization plans. Despite efforts in capacity-building, the CND was not able
to demonstrate the necessary strength and vision to effectively lead the process. The MEF and
the PCM had to fill the vacuum, assuming a greater role in policy formulation.

In the future the Government of Peru has to find innovative ways to address the new challenges
generated by the transformation of the State from central and authoritarian to decentralized and
participative. A critical issue will be to further improve the institutional capacity of sub-national
entities. Sub-national governments receiving earmarked resources for investment from the
mining canon are having problems in spending it in spite of critical needs. The absorption
capacity of some sub-national administrations is weak. For example, the region of Cajamarca,
which has one of the highest indexes of infant mal-nutrition, has about US$500 millions
accumulated through the canon minero. Technical assistance to enhance capacity is one way but




                                                  16

it may have to be complemented with outsourcing or contracting-out specific products with
private and/or public entities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a) M&E Design: During the preparation of the DECSAL program, a set of outcome indicators
for measuring progress were defined.         These indicators were selected in agreement with
Government counterparts, and reflected the PDO. The monitoring design was improved during
the second and third operations, when the set of indicators included baselines. The Sectoral
Loans Coordination Unit (Unidad de Coordinación de Préstamos Sectoriales--UCPS) in the
MEF was the main counterpart agency for the three programmatic loans, and was in charge of
M&E for the loan and for collecting the appropriate data to follow the indicators.              As
decentralization was a new event, some of the baseline indicators did not exist at the time of the
first operation, and others were adjusted or reformulated to reflect a more realistic environment.
Annex 2 includes a table with the program indicators.

(b) M&E Implementation: Data availability for most indicators was adequate and timely at
supervision and appraisal time for each one of the loans. This allowed following up progress
with the policy program. The UCPS identified the units responsible for producing the indicators
agreed (see Annex 2) and the progress with these were discussed at each stage of the project
preparation. In addition, the Bank team used a number of sources for monitoring the agreed
indicators, as well as other information important for the performance of the program. The main
sources are listed below:

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

While decentralization in Peru is advancing and competitiveness, in particular at the regional
level, is improving, the remaining reform agenda in these two broad areas is still large.
Following the approval of the last DCDPL on December 2005, the Bank and the authorities in
place at that time continued a very active policy dialogue, with particular emphasis on quality of
fiscal expenditure and competitiveness areas. The authorities' assessment was that progress on
the fiscal consolidation front and on fiscal decentralization was satisfactory and that the "second


                                                17

generation" of reforms should focus on improving the efficiency and quality of public
management (at all levels of government) and continue facilitating the business environment and
improving competitiveness. The pending reforms in these two policy areas were reflected in the
Peru book titled "An Opportunity for a Different Peru: More Prosperous, Equitable and
Governable", which was discussed largely with the outgoing and incoming administrations.

As soon as the new administration was in place in July 2007, the Government approached the
Bank and expressed their interest on receiving budget support through a series of possibly three
to four DPLs. The Bank also prepared the Country Partnership Strategy for the period 2007-
2011, which has a strong focus on results. The first programmatic "Fiscal Management and
Competitiveness Development Policy Loan" was approved by the Bank Board on December 8,
2006. This new series of loans support the Government's reform plan to improve the functioning
of Peru's public sector institutions and business environment. It builds on lessons learned from
the previous DPLs and has served as a platform for policy continuity. The loan focuses on two
broad areas of policy reform: (i) efficiency and quality of fiscal management; and (ii) improved
competitiveness. In each of these areas, the GoP has committed to a detailed series of important
policy measures as part of an integrated strategy to progressively reform fiscal administration,
public spending and the business climate in ways that will lead to specific results that have a
broad impact on growth and will be difficult to reverse.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project objectives were jointly developed between the World Bank and the GoP, and largely
consulted with civil society and the private sector. The objectives of the program were of high
relevance for the country's higher development objectives of higher and broader-based growth
and poverty alleviation.    The overall country priorities shared and supported by the Bank
included:

    · Maintaining macro stability and reducing the impact of exogenous shocks
    · Making growth broad based and environmentally sustainable
    · Focusing on basic needs to better target poverty issues
    · Promoting decentralization in the context of fiscal solvency, social inclusion and
       enhanced productivity.

The DCDPL series was developed in the results-oriented mode spelled out in the CAS by: a)
setting explicit targets; b) introducing incentives to deliver results; c) developing an explicit
results chain that links policy actions to results; and d) basing the necessary monitoring and
evaluation on the explicit results chain. A significant share of the highly satisfactory outcome of
the DCDPL series was due to this results-oriented approach.

Objectives of the DCDPL series were relevant to the Bank assistance strategy, and the
Government broad development strategy and its priorities. The Toledo Administration strategy
to reduce poverty was organized around three central objectives: (i) competitiveness and
employment generation; (ii) equity and social justice, including access to health, education,



                                                18

culture and basic services; and (iii) creating a more efficient, transparent and decentralized state,
with active private sector and civil society participation.             The decentralization and
competitiveness reform agenda was critical for achieving these three set of objectives. In
addition, the program under the DCDPLs was fully consistent with the CAS, and fitted squarely
with the CAS' central objective of reducing poverty. The 2002-06 CAS had proposed deepening
policy dialogues on decentralization, fighting corruption, and private participation in
infrastructure, and a series of programmatic and technical assistance loans.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

The program was successful in supporting the achievement of high level objectives of strong,
broad based growth and poverty reduction. The program had a consistently good track record
during the implementation and in some areas there was an over performing on the agreed targets.
The macroeconomic framework was consistent with the objectives of the program.                  The
Multiannual Macroeconomic Framework (MMM) presented the Government's economic targets,
which were all met consistently, and in some cases required revisions as some targets were being
over met. The MEF has made a tremendous progress in installing transparency of public
management, which made the monitoring of the program extremely fluent. While poverty has
declined in recent years, the levels of poverty remain high in Peru. Although no poverty
numbers are available after 2004, recent improvements in employment in urban areas indicate
that the growth of 2005 and 2006 are having further impacts on poverty. Formal employment in
cities outside Lima is increasing at two-digits and some cities are operating at full employment.
Finally, growth is being led by regions other than Lima and the bulk of private investment of the
last three years has been highly deconcentrated.

With respect to the program core objectives, these were met satisfactorily despite significant
political and political economy challenges. The set of policies implemented during the DCDPL
program were adequate and supported the achievement of the objectives in the program. First,
policy measures implemented had ensured fiscally-sound decentralization. Second, the core
institutional framework for decentralization was implemented. Major laws were passed regarding
regional governments, basic decentralization, fiscal responsibility, participatory budgeting, and
public sector reform. In total, all these reforms had changed the way in which Peru's public
sector operates. Third, a series of measures were taken to facilitate business environment and
competitiveness growth. Decentralization can indeed be a powerful instrument to secure social,
political and economic objectives. The decentralization system will only be sustainable if based
on economic realities, with regions and municipalities building up their own growth potential
through focused private sector development strategies. The ultimate success of decentralization
in Peru will be measured not as much by laws, procedures and processes but rather by the extent
to which regional economic growth and employment are catalyzed.

It is important to emphasize that both, decentralization and improved competitiveness, are two
tasks that will take long to mature and produce the intended results. The DPLs series covered
only three years and the program supported the initial stage of decentralization. In is this context
that the achievement of the development objectives is assessed.       This section provides a short
description of the key achievements of each phase of the DCDPL program.

Overall Outcomes of DCDPL I:
Decentralization and Fiscal Sustainability The Government met the macro-fiscal targets
specified in the published MMM, and in several instances over performed. The Congress
approved the amendments to the Law of Fiscal Responsibility and Transparency (LRTF) to
include regional and municipal governments under the fiscal rules. Government submitted to
Congress the draft Budget Law for 2004 with specification of transfers to regions for 2004.
Congress delegated tax authority to Government for 90 working days starting September 27,
2003, to issue tax reform for inter-alia, elimination of sector tax exemptions for the income tax;
improve efficiency of municipal tax administration; establish a special system that promotes
compliance of small taxpayers, and strengthen tax payer registration systems and otherwise
strengthen the tax administration. The Government issued regulations establishing minimum
requirements for the transfer of social productive infrastructure programs to regional and local
governments. The LRTF included provisions that regulate external borrowing by regional and
local governments.

Institutional Development For Decentralization The Government issued regulations that
established the requirements for approval of new regional investments through the Sistema
Nacional de Inversión Pública, SNIP. Congress approved the framework law of the Participatory
Budget. Public Employment framework law calling for simplification of public employees
contracting was also submitted to the Congress. The Government initiated application of an
electronic transfer system to pay and control the salaries of National Government personnel ("el
procedimiento de abono en cuenta") and also started the process to hire new sector regional
directors through a competitive process.

Competitiveness and Economic Growth The Government issued the Supreme Decree which
created Peru's National Competitiveness Council (NCC). The national Government signed at
least three contracts with regional and local governments to stimulate private investment in their
jurisdiction and share with them the benefits of such investment, in accordance with the Ley de
Bases for Decentralization and Ley Marco de Promoción de la Inversión Privada
Descentralizada. The Congress approved the Ports Law.

Overall Outcomes for DCDPL II:
Decentralization and Fiscal Sustainability Fiscal sustainability was preserved during the second
operation, as well. Transfers of functions and responsibilities were slower than expected, but all
in all the public accounts did not experience any stress. The Government published analysis of
the fiscal impact of all tax-related and expenditure policy actions during the last year (in
accordance with the LRTF). The Government issued LRTF's regulations, including definition of
emergency situations. Government formulates the fiscal and financing perspective of the regional
and local governments within the MMM. Whenever decentralization created additional fiscal
pressure, central Government adjusted according to LRTF. SUNAT continued to apply tax
policy and administration measures approved in 2002 and 2003, including new tax measures
issued by Government in accordance with Congress' delegated authority, thereby increasing tax
collection in accordance with the MMM published targets. Municipalities tax revenue collection
increased by 11 percent in real terms. Overall tax evasion was reduced from 52 percent in 2001
to 44 percent in 2004, and the effective VAT collection was increased 50 percent in 2004, from
44 percent in 2001. Mining canon transfers to sub-national governments were based on criteria



                                                20

related to poverty, population and basic needs. The sub-national budget execution as share of
total budget continued increasing.

Government also issued regulations to strengthen sub-national debt management requiring
independent, publicized credit ratings on the borrowing capacity of a city or region for obtaining
credits above US$5 million. The Government also carried out diagnosis of municipal fiscal
situations and estimated "floating" debt in 15 largest municipalities. Current expenditures of
regional governments did not grow by more than the increase authorized by the LDF for 2003­
04. The Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF-GL) was installed in 20 major cities
and 50 provincial municipalities. It designed ex-post public expenditure evaluation system based
at MEF and initiates collection and production of program performance indicators. 60 percent of
UEs paid through service accounts (abono en cuenta).

Institutional Development for Decentralization. Progress continued with reforms to secure
appropriate institutional capacity. Participatory budgeting continued built in the decentralization
process to maximize citizen ownership, increase transparency and improve the sustainability of
regional and local policymaking.      The regulations of the Framework Law of Participatory
Budgeting were approved and incorporated the inputs from an international workshop organized
by the project team for the MEF to compile the international, national and local lessons learned
by representatives of central and regional and local governments, civil society and academia as
well as national and international experts.       By 2004, more than 400 regional and local
governments had submitted their 2005 budget following participatory budgeting norms.
Accreditation continued and by end-2004, 67 provinces had been accredited for the transfer of
food programs and 241 for the transfer of social infrastructure programs.

The Government continued with accreditation process, and disseminated progress reports,
consultations and evaluations of its objectivity, effectiveness and efficiency. It issued regulations
that specify the requirements of regional and local governments to obtain approval of the
national government for external borrowing in line with LRTF.

Competitiveness and Economic Growth In order to establish a competitiveness agenda and
support regional development and competitiveness, the Government took several important steps.
It issued guidelines of National Competitiveness Strategy and for elaboration of Planes
Concertados de Desarrollo Regional (Participatory Plans for Regional Development), and
developed a set of Regional Indicators to evaluate regional competitiveness, resource
management and overall performance. To facilitate trade and promote exports, the Government
issued specific guidelines and measures that develop PENX (Plan Maestro de Facilitación de
Comercio Exterior). Regional governments published 8 Regional Exports Plans. At least one
multi-regional office of PROMPEX, MINCETUR, PROINVERSION and PROMPYME was
created and in operation, and there was development and strengthening of commercial offices
abroad. By 2004 there were 25 firms with exporting plans in execution and the number of new
products exported by region had almost doubled.           Finally, 480 new exporting firms were
operative in regions other than Lima.

The measures implemented for enhancing productivity and production produced impressive
results. INDECOPI developed norms and standards supported by a larger number of technical



                                                 21

committees, prioritizing sectors with higher export potential. SENASA initiated a plan to certify
its laboratories and to update the sanitary norms, simplifying procedures. The Government also
launched initiatives (Comprále al Perú, Ley Marco de Consejos Reguladores, Marcas
colectivas) to increase quality awareness. A new regulation for accreditation was published to
unify criteria for accreditation according to international standards. Twelve CITEs public and/or
private with wide sectoral and regional coverage were operative, with ample regional coverage.
The MEF evaluated the use of public funding by R&D institutions and proposed actions for
improved allocation. The Government launched the program of conglomerates (Small and
Medium Enterprise networks), and the program Peru Compite to promote productive chains and
suppliers networks.

In order to improve the investment climate, the Government presented the National Plan for
Decentralized Investment 2005-2014. This included a work plan, formation of the multi-
ministerial working group, and implementation of the first stage of the SIMTA (Sistema de
Información y Monitoreo de Trámites) in which both the Tax Collection Agency (SUNAT) and
SUNARP went on to simplify and put on-line their respective forms concerned with opening and
operating a business. The implementation of commercial courts in Lima as proposed by the
Commission of Magistrates was formally accepted through an administrative resolution creating
the sub-specialty of Commercial Law by the Sala Plena of the Supreme Court, and through the
agreement of the Consejo Ejecutivo del Poder Judicial to create new commercial courts.

Overall Outcomes of DCDPL III:
Decentralization and Fiscal Sustainability. Fiscal decentralization proceeded in a gradual
manner rooted in the sound legal framework established during the two previous operations. The
Government continued following the one-to-one rule by which any new resource transfer to a
regional and local government was accompanied by a corresponding expenditure cut at the
central level. This rule helped to protect fiscal sustainability and did not distort vertical fiscal
balances. Tax policy and tax administration measures yielded positive results. Aided by high
mineral prices, tax revenues of the central government grew strongly, particularly during 2005,
helping reduce the fiscal deficit to 0.3 percent of GDP, well below the 1 percent programmed for
2005. In order to support own revenue collection, the SIAF-GL cadastre module was initiated in
28 provincial municipalities, and training provided. The FONCOMUN framework was changed
to account for fiscal effort.

The Government put in place a framework to ensure sub-national fiscal discipline and budget
constraints.   The legal and institutional framework for sub-national borrowing was well
advanced, with a number of regulatory and legal actions against potential excessive borrowing
by local and regional governments, including fiscal rules on outstanding debt, debt services,
primary surplus and annual expenditure increases in place.           For the third operation the
government published the General Law on Public Sector Borrowing which incorporated uniform
and generally acceptable concepts of debt and liabilities, the introduction of annual limits on new
contingent liabilities, and a transparent registration of contingent liabilities and trust funds
created by public entities, as called for in the program trigger. The Government also proposed
corrective measures and adjustment programs for sub national governments that breach fiscal
rules.




                                                 22

Institutional Development For Decentralization The Government continued transferring
earmarked resources and corresponding responsibilities to accredited regional and local
governments. As a result 1,144 functions were accredited by 2005 Standardized public finance
accounts (planning, reporting and monitoring) were established.       The Central Government
continued with execution of programs and projects in regions and municipalities not yet
accredited and monitoring of programs and projects transferred through the convenios de gestion
(management agreements) signed with sub-national governments. By 2005, all 26 regions and
775 municipalities prepared their 2006 budget according to participatory rules, and all provincial
municipalities have set up procurement committees.     As a result, 12 percent of the 2006 total
public investment was allocated according to citizen's preferences in municipalities applying
participatory budgeting. Transparency was also strengthened with civil society participation, and
33 social auditing committees (Comités de Vigilancia) tracked expenditure, procurement,
targeting of decentralized food programs.

The national system for public investment was implemented in regional and local governments.
An increasing number of sub-national governments and other public entities conducted
investment planning following SNIP procedures. By 2005, more than 200 local governments
used SNIP procedures for 3,465 projects and all regions had used SNIP procedures for a total of
2,500 projects. In addition, 56 public enterprises and 33 universities use SNIP procedures.
Development of an automatic electronic transfer payment system (abono en cuenta) and
implementation in government agencies was almost completed and 95 percent of government
agencies use abono en cuenta module and 90 percent of all public servants are paid through
abono en cuenta. The use of this system brought by 2005 a savings amounting US$2.5 millions

Competitiveness and Economic Growth In order to support an overall competitiveness agenda
and promote exports, several measures were taken. Issuance of guidelines for the National
Competitiveness Strategy was completed. Publication of the National Strategic Export Plan and
eight regional export plans was implemented. Steps were taken to further enhance production
and productivity. More than 180 technical standards were issued and 1,243 firms or producers
were served by CITES in 2005.

The Government has made important advances in implementing an infrastructure modernization
program based on a two-fold strategy consisting of increasing private sector participation, and at
the same time, improving the institutions and regulations that govern the management of public
infrastructure assets at both the national and regional levels. Logistics costs related to ship
stationing and customs procedures were reduced by more than 2 percent. Average staying time
of ship at El Callao was reduced by two hours between 2003 and 2004 due to administrative
improvements. Improvements in the investment climate were bought about through several
measures. Work plan for the implementation of SIMTA was completed. Several local
municipalities have started introducing reforms to the business start-up procedures.        Lima
Municipality has became the pioneer on reforming business licensing, a reform that started
during the third operation in 2005. The Lima Municipality now grants a municipal license in a
week rather than a month and the number of procedures has been drop to five from 33. The
Poder Judicial created a sub-specialty of commercial law. Seven commercial courts were
established in Lima and the average time needed to resolve commercial disputes declined from 3
years to 3-6 months in 2005.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

All three operations are rated satisfactory. The operations' development objectives were
achieved satisfactorily in an efficient fashion, and as discussed above, the DCDPL's objectives,
design, implementation, and outcomes were highly relevant to country circumstances and
development priorities, and were highly consistent with Bank strategies and goals. Further, in all

areas, the government continued to develop reforms to support decentralization and improved
competitiveness. Each operation resulted in strengthening of reforms, improvement of indicators,
and increased administrative efficiency.

Rating
DCDPL I                                        Satisfactory
DCDPL II                                       Satisfactory
DCDPL III                                      Satisfactory


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts and Social Development
The DCDPLs series supported a series of actions that aimed at directly or indirectly reducing
poverty and improving the welfare of Peruvians. Poverty indicators for 2005 and 2006 are not
available and thus the assessment of the direct impact on poverty of these series of loans can not
be done. However, there are some proxy indicators that suggest that poverty and welfare have
improved in recent years. Particularly, employment has been growing rapidly in recent years and
growth is being led cities outside Lima. In addition, the latest survey by APOYO, showed an
improvement in household incomes in the Lima area, suggesting that growth trickle down is
materializing. By 2002, about 52 percent of the families surveyed had an average monthly
income of $220, while in 2006 the share has dropped to 48 percent.

The decentralization framework was designed to ensure and facilitate the provision of access to
public services to all citizens. Reforms that have improved the transparency and quality of
public spending and the provision of public services will allow programs that promote human
capital development and act as a social safety net for the poor have a greater impact on the
targeted population, and a sound fiscal management will allow the GoP to safeguard resources to
pro-poor programs. As well, steps to promote strengthened fiscal management at the
decentralized level supports the effectiveness of fiscal resources, devolving spending authority to
lower levels of government that are more aware of local needs. Policy actions for improving the
distributional impacts of fiscal transfers, including natural resource income, which will help
redress the large disparities between the coastal, mountain, and jungle regions are still pending.
However, the new series of DPLs will be supporting the GoP in that area.

The competitiveness component of the DCDPLs had a largely positive and significant impact on
poverty. Changes like reducing the time and cost of obtaining a business license or resolving a
business dispute will have a strong impact on the growth of smaller and medium-sized
businesses, which in turn will have the greatest impact on employment. Likewise, policies to
expand exports beyond commodities to non-traditional exports will lead to greater employment
growth and poverty reduction.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutions are strengthened when there is an improvement in their (a) professionalism (less
turn-over, less politics, more weight to knowledge) (b) efficiency (doing more with less); (c)




                                                26

accountability (face the consequences of policy measures) and (c) transparency (show to the
stakeholders and general public what, why and how taxes and public funds are put to work.)

In this regard the DCDPL series have supported a number of steps the resulted in substantial
institutional strengthening. The program had an immediate impact in different institutions, as it
supported policies aiming at improving efficiency and transparency. The MEF is using its Web
page to show, on a timely basis, the central budget allocation, transfers to regions, national and
regional debt, the number of projects approved by the public investment system disaggregated by
dollar amount, type of expenditure and municipality; the data base of all government contractors
-updated monthly and myriad information regarding its activities. The Fiscal Responsibility Law,
the Law on Decentralization, the Public Sector Law, have provided strong institutional
safeguards, shielding the fiscal accounts from external or an internal shocks and containing
specific ceilings and indicator to assure fiscal discipline is now a "public good" and will be very
difficult to circumvent.

The electronic system for government purchases (SEACE), even in pilot form, is a substantial
improvement that will permit further advances in efficiency, transparency and accountability.
The SIAF is enhancing efficiency and transparency by improving the financial administration of
the state and also avoiding fraud. The judicial system has been strengthened by substantial
efficiency gains by the creation of commercial courts. Those gains have triggered actions to
continue expanding commercial courts to the country's hinterland. All the special funds and
programs like PROMPEX, PROMPYME, PROINVERSION, etc. created to enhance regional
development and competitiveness have their Web page (transparency) with data relative to its
activities (accountability.) no matter who their parent official agency is. It is common now, and it
was not a few years ago, that all positions open to external candidates are posted in the Web
pages of the different public offices thus enhancing professionalism and reducing clientelism.
Gains in transparency and accountability in most of the government programs supported by the
DCDPL series have had another positive externality namely a reduction in the incentives for
corruption and malfeceance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

       Rating
       DCDPL I                                  Negligible
       DCDPL II                                 Negligible
       DCDPL III                                Low


The risk to development outcome after DCDPL I was negligible. In the early phases, the process
created some political and political economic strain, but the risks of not decentralizing
outweighed the risks of decentralizing. Strict fiscal regulations (still binding) supported fiscal
consolidation. The other components related to institutional development and competitiveness




                                                 27

was consolidated in the following tranche and risk of backsliding, at the time of DCDPL I, was
very low.

The risk of backsliding on DCDPL II was also negligible. The reforms supported by the DCDPL
II are sustainable because of a broad consensus among political leaders, business associations
and civil society.5 Governments may change but the active participation of civil society in
discussing and shaping the type of reforms addressed by the DCDPL seems to have taken root.

Participation from multiple donors also enhances the prospects for sustainability. In its second
and third phase, the program had co-financing from KfW. The IADB and the IMF coordinated
closely on the design of the program, as both institutions are supporting the government's public
sector reform agenda. In addition, the Bank coordinated the reforms supported by the DECSAL
with numerous donors (GTZ, USAID, DFID, COSUDE, AECI, Cooperazione Italiana, SNV,
etc.) that will continue to be involved in supporting the reform process.

The risk to development outcomes generated by the DCDPL III is low. There is a risk that the
new referendum on macro regions (during 2009) may again fail, but the fiscal revenue mapping
will have been completed by then, and voters in the regions will have a clearer idea of stake in
the outcome. Reversal on decentralization and competitiveness reforms is not likely, as stated by
the new Administration's policy program. On the contrary, the Garcia Administration has
decided to accelerate decentralization and has launched a "decentralization shock" advancing the
devolution of remaining 185 functions to regional governments by end-2007. It has also started
pilot decentralization of education to municipalities. In addition, the CND was eliminated in
April 0f 2007 and was replaced with the "Intergovernmental Council for Decentralization"
(annexed to the Prime Minister's office). The elimination of the CND has left the accreditation
system orphan, something critical to safeguard a sustainable decentralization and ensure quality
of public service delivery.        The decision on which institution will monitor and perform
accreditation is still pending. However, the government is placing more emphasis in ex-post
control on public spending and has started the implementation of a results based budgeting
system. The pilot of reducing malnutrition will start in 187 districts using a results based
budgeting allocation. The government has set the goal of reducing 5 percentage points of
malnutrition in 5 years.

As noted, the loan program design for the DCDPL series was well aligned with the CAS and
with the Government's development strategy, priorities and policies.

DCDPL I: Bank performance was satisfactory. Teams provided technical leadership in the
preparation and implementation of the loan. They included an adequate level of expertise and
drew on extensive background analyses and provided credible advice to the Government. During
implementation, Bank staff interacted frequently with counterparts and provided technical
support. The DECSAL program was designed in consultation with civil society through several
workshops. Close interaction and true policy dialogue with implementing agencies have proven
particularly positive.

In some areas, performance could have been improved. The objectives of the loan were not
clearly spelled out. Some objectives were listed, but not clearly prioritized. In turn, policy
objectives were missing for some sub-components. Some progress indicators were not
sufficiently operational or specific enough. Likewise, the operation did not make use of
"benchmarks" which clearly defined the expected implementation progress for each loan.
Institutional and implementation arrangements were also not addressed adequately. The
responsible agencies were not listed which could have undermined accountability for reform.

Teams provided technical leadership in the preparing and implementing the loan. They included
an adequate level of expertise and drew on extensive background analyses and exchanges with
other countries. Bank staff advised the government credibly. During implementation, the project
team interacted frequently with counterparts and provided technical support. The DCDPL
program was designed in consultation with civil society and public policy experts. Close
interaction and policy dialogue with implementing agencies proved particularly helpful.

DCDPL II: Bank performance during the second operation was satisfactory during the loan
preparation and appraisal, with the team taking a pro-active stance at each stage, and providing
timely and needed technical assistance. The design of the second loan utilized recommendations
of the ICR prepared for the first loan, in particular those referred to outcome indicators and
monitoring and evaluation. The Bank team interacted regularly with the national and regional
governments, and with civil society. Baseline indicators for program outcomes were defined and
agreed with the Government. The agencies responsible for monitoring these indicators were
identified, facilitating monitoring progress with the program. The team also conducted a number
of workshops for the Government and visited regional governments and municipalities. The
program document includes as set of technical notes that supported the relevance of the policies
implemented under the program. In addition, the second loan presented a discussion of the
challenges ahead under each policy area, leaving enough flexibility for selecting during the next
operation those policies that were critical for achieving the development objectives. At the time
the second loan was prepared the Bank finalized the Poverty Assessment for Peru and initiated
the Country Economic Memorandum on Growth and Trade.                 These two AAAs provided
important insights for policy design. While the program matrix for the second loan reflected the
government priorities and objectives, it included also included a large number of triggers which
were a reflection of the government's ambitious and accelerated reform agenda.




                                                 29

DCDPL III: Bank performance was highly satisfactory, with the team performing all
supervisory tasks and providing technical assistance as required. The Bank team coordinated
with implementing agencies on a regular basis, and continued to consult with, and respond to,
various line-ministries within the national government.       All development outcomes of the
DCDPL I & II were sustained during the last operation. The appraisal mission was carried
jointly with the KfW. The policy matrix was also coordinate with the IMF, and ensured a strong
alignment on the programs for 2005 and 2006. The policy matrix was more streamlined than the
previous ones, and reflected more closely the Government's priorities. The Bank continued
providing technical assistance through other lending operations (TALs), as well as through
workshops and conferences. Active dialogue was maintained with the Country Office and when
needed consultations and dialogue was conducted through video conferences and GDLN services.
The Bank team coordinated also with IFC and visited several regions and municipalities to
monitor the progress in decentralization and to identify challenges.

     DCDPL III                                Highly Satisfactory

DCDPL I: Supervision of progress against triggers was conducted through missions. The
macroeconomic framework monitoring was conducted jointly with IMF SBA and by evaluating
the GoP's own macroeconomic framework as stated in the annually published MMM. In
addition, the Bank team made use of several Government websites for monitoring progress not
only with triggers but with development objectives.

DCDPL II: Supervision of the second loans was conducted jointly with the KfW. Program
implementation was also monitored with reports that the authorities produced. The monitoring
of macroeconomic framework was done through the IMF SBA program and the respective
reviews. Monthly and quarterly reports produced by MEF were also used for monitoring
progress, as well as those produced by the Central BANK, Institute of Statistics and the Council
of Competitiveness. Supervision missions were also conducted jointly with missions for the
Institutional Capacity for Fiscal Decentralization Loan. Closed seminars and workshops were
also conducted during the timeframe of loan supervision. The second loan agreed on baseline
indicators and units responsible for producing the indicators.

DCDPL III: Supervision proceeded well during the last operation. The task-manager was
located at the resident mission which allowed a frequent interaction with the authorities.
Supervision mission were also conducted jointly with the KfW. Program implementation was
monitored with reports that the authorities produced.        The monitoring of macroeconomic
framework was done through the IMF SBA program and the respective reviews. Monthly and
quarterly reports produced by MEF were also used for monitoring progress, as well as those
produced by the Central Bank, Institute of Statistics and the Council of Competitiveness.

timeframe of loan supervision. The missions followed up on program progress more easily the
last operation as responsible agencies for producing program indicators were identified in the
previous operation. A significant improvement in supervision procedures was the visits to
regional governments and municipalities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

As both the Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision are rated satisfactory, the overall bank
performance is rated satisfactory in accordance with the ICRRR harmonized evaluation criteria
guidelines. Throughout the period o implementation of the program, from identification to
closing the team was deeply involved in an active policy dialogue with the authorities identifying
priorities, and future challenges. The policy dialogue and the identification of areas for Bank
collaboration paved the road for the new DPLs series, which are ensuring continuity and
sustainability of the policies under the DCDPL program.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Ratings: preparation and implementation
Ratings: Highly Satisfactory
Government performance was highly satisfactory, primarily because of the lead role taken by the
MEF. During project design, the MEF acted as the lead government agency, collaborating
actively with ideas, projects, discussions, logistical support and supporting statistical data.
During implementation, the MEF's leadership encouraged other government agencies to
participate more actively and fully than initially anticipated.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Not applicable.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Thee borrower's performance was satisfactory.            The borrower, in particular MEF staff,
participated actively in the preparation of the DCDPL program. They provided guidance to the
Bank team and pointed out sensitive political issues. The Borrower team also had good grasp for
the timing of the policies.

During the implementation the Borrower also maintained a proactive attitude, facilitating and
coordinating actions with the other responsible agencies. The Borrower followed closely the
policy matrix and was in constant contact with the Bank team reporting on progress or
suggesting new policy areas. Several government agencies, like PROINVERSION, SUNAT,
PCM, CND, CNC, Transport Ministry, and the Central Bank participated during the preparation
and implementation of the program, and all showed strong ownership and commitment to
implement the reforms. Meetings were always very collaborative and all government agencies
shared information with the Bank team.

6. Lessons Learned



                                                 31

The experience of the DCDPL series provides important lessons for future operations. These
lessons are described below, which were incorporated in the follow-up program of DPLs.

Commitment to and strong ownership: Operations designed for middle income countries with
highly skilled government staff and were first generation reforms have been already
implemented, need to place strong emphasis in building the program in a participatory and
consultative way. The achievements of the DCDPL series can be attributed to a number of
reasons: (a) the reforms were not imposed by the Bank but rather demand driven by the
beneficiaries; (b) there was a consensus among civil society in favor of decentralization; (c) there
was a strong lead agency in the MEF to spearhead the process; (d) Peru drew from the Bank's
global experience with decentralization and competitiveness; (e) the reform program was
designed and implemented gradually; (f) Peru already had the legal framework (i.e., the LRTF)
within which other reforms could be implemented; and (g) the process of change was taken as a
national project. Structured bilateral talks between the Bank and sub-national rural governments
and the Bank and civil society leaders in Lima also provided broad, practical insights from the
beneficiaries' point of view.

Analytical Underpinning: The DCDPLs series drew on a wide range of analytical work
undertaken by the Bank, as well as other analytical work carried out by the Government or
research institutions.    Examples of the AAAs supporting the DCDPLs were the Public
Expenditure Review, Country Financial Accountability Assessment, Country Procurement
Assessment Report, Investment Climate Assessment, Poverty Assessment, Country Economic
Memorandum, and sector specific studies such as Municipal Debt, Microconstraints to Growth
Study, and Environmental and Social Impact of the Mining Sector.            In addition the loan
preparation included policy and technical notes that were prepared by Bank staff with inputs
from government counterparts. For the two last operations these specific policy notes were
prepared jointly with the KfW. However, the Project Documents (PDs) of the DCDPLs only
documented the how the analytical work done by the team explicitly informed the policy actions
supported by the PDO or the expected results, and there was not explicit linkage or reference of
the number of AAAs that supported the program design.

Programmatic Approach and Flexibility: Another key lesson is the that the program had built in
at the onset a degree of flexibility that allowed accommodating to evolving priorities and needs
of the country.     The Government of Peru had chosen to adopt a gradualist approach to
decentralization. Most of the policies chosen under the program were aligned with this principle.
Some complex and technical processes like e-government and the devolution of service delivery
to the sub-national level need critical time for development and implementation, or capacity
constraints. Moreover, time is also needed to overcome the resistance of groups that may feel
threatened by the uncertainty brought about by changes and the accountability brought about by
performance-oriented reforms.

Program Conditions and Triggers: The program was loaded with conditions and triggers,
reflecting the government's ambitious reform agenda.          During the second operation the
Government felt that the conditions for accelerating reforms were appropriate and proposed the
inclusion of additional triggers. The last operation was more focused on conditions and triggers



                                                32

that were critical to the program success and distinguished those from the other actions that the
government had implemented beyond the program. An important lesson is, thus, to reach the
right balance on the number of triggers and conditions. Finding the right balance is difficult, in
particular when the Borrower views the DPL program as an important vehicle for pushing for
critical reforms. A good practice in such cases is to distinguish benchmarks from triggers.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower

(a) Borrower

The Ministry of Economy and Finance reviewed the draft ICRR and was in full agreement with
the findings, adding that the document reflected their views and experiences with the
implementation of the decentralization and competitiveness policy agenda. The implementing
agency sent a letter related to the ICRR draft which is attached in Annex 3.

(b) Cofinanciers

The two last loans were financed with the KfW. A joint mission with the KfW was conducted
for the preparation of this core ICRR. The assessment of the KfW is that, despite gaps in the
data, the Peruvian government has clearly been making progress in their reform efforts with
regard to the decentralisation of administrative and fiscal structures.

Overall assessment: The reforms of recent years are significant and moving in the right direction.
The implementation and concretisation of some of the measures however are often hesitant and
may leave the sub-national units without a comprehensive framework for decision-making.

Annex 4. Comments of Co financier

The following is a text prepared by the KfW regarding the future challenges on decentralization:

Regarding lessons learned KfW opinion is the following:
  ·    Sub-national revenues: Own revenues by sub-nationals have increased slowly and they
       suggest strengthening Peru's self-financing capacities in particular in the context of the
       current very favourable economic situation. In preparation for the referendum in 2009 on
       forming macro-regions, an issue that needs to be resolved is how the restructured regional
       governments could be given their own sources of income and the effect that that would
       have on transfer payments. The citizens can only reach an agreement on the formation of
       macro-regions if they are better informed about the political changes.
  ·    Income redistribution: The issue of providing relief to the poor by increasing direct
       progressive taxation has not been addressed in this operation. Peru raises a considerable
       portion of its income from indirect taxes (approximately 70% from VAT and other
       consumer taxes), which places a greater burden on poor people than on other sections of
       the population.
  ·    Transfers to sub-Nationals: There remains imbalances in the distribution of the funds. On
       the one hand, there are "rich" regions, which derive considerable benefit from the canon
       funds and have surplus funds. However, they cannot use the funds to make an equivalent
       amount of investments as there are no suitable projects and capacities. These regions
       could be given the support of advisory services. On the other hand, there are regions that
       hardly receive any canon funds. They are dependent on sectoral and programme-related
       funds from the central state. Their autonomy and the necessary investments could be
       strengthened by easier debt options. It remains to be seen whether it would be possible, in
       an appropriate economic and legal framework, to ease the debt rules without putting the
       macroeconomic stability of the country at risk. A further well-established method would
       also be to set up a compensation fund to cushion the volatility of the canon income and
       thus to improve the reliability and predictability of municipal income.
  ·    Budgetary Processes: An improvement in the Presupuesto Participativo could come from
       providing focused initial and advanced training for people on the Comites de Vigilancia.
       In addition to the co-determination possibilities for investment measures, their
       involvement could also be extended to full participation in budget planning at the local
       level. The objective ought to be to strengthen those facilities and to support them in their
       role as competent self-determination bodies.
  ·    Transfer of expenditure responsibilities: A positive feature is the ongoing process of
       transferring competences from the central government to regional and local governments.
       All 186 planned transfers of functions are to be completed by the end of 2007 and further
       transfers of competences are being discussed. This has so far been a lengthy process and
       should be speeded up.

I. Summary

Until 2002 Peru was one of the most centralized countries in Latin America. Since then,
however, critical laws have been passed and implemented to empower sub-national
governments. Congress, different levels of government, political parties and civil society
participate in this complex policy-making process.       Decentralization has required several
changes in how the public sector operates at the national and sub-national levels. These changes
have been implemented while maintaining macroeconomic stability, but they are not yet
supported with adequate institutional infrastructure to develop, monitor, and implement the
decentralization policy. Numerous challenges could threaten Peru's decentralized system,
including a high dependency of sub-national governments on central government transfers and a
low rate of own-revenue generation; weak controls over the accumulation of sub-national debt;
limited capacity to handle newly-transferred public service delivery responsibilities; and
resource and capacity imbalances in different regions of the country. This policy note reviews
the current situation, discusses the most important challenges, and offers some policy options to
address them.

II. BACKGROUND

Compared to other countries in the region, Peru is a relative latecomer to decentralization. Until
2002, Peru was one of the most centralized countries in Latin America, with more than 97
percent of tax revenues collected by the national government. The 1993 Constitution mandated
decentralization, but regional elections were only held in 2003, following the adoption of a
constitutional amendment in 2002 that required the creation of regional governments. Since
2002, critical laws have been passed to create regional governments, facilitate fiscally sound
decentralization, secure fiscal responsibility and transparency at the sub-national level,
strengthen local government capacity for revenue collection, establish accreditation criteria for
function and responsibilities devolution, introduce participatory local budgeting and initiate
public sector reform to accommodate to the demands of a newly decentralized setting. Today
there are 26 regions and 1,829 municipalities (194 are provincial municipalities, the rest are
district municipalities) (see Box 1).

Box 1: Levels of Government in Peru

National:      Legislative (Congress), Executive branch, led by the President; and Judiciary. Central level currently
manages all national-level issues, including poverty programs, which are to be decentralized.

Regional:      Departments constituted into 26 regions, and at later stage designed to be merged into macroregions.
They are led by a Regional President, the Regional Council and the Regional Coordination Council, composed of
provincial and district mayors and civil society representatives. Their mandate is to promote regional development
and competitiveness through public investment and the mobilization of public and private resources. Specific
responsibilities for the decentralization of sectoral responsibilities to the regions are yet to be determined in detail.

Municipalities: 1829 municipalities with elected mayors, a District/Provincial Council and Coordination Councils.
Their broad mandate is to cover all relevant issues under their jurisdiction. The specific responsibilities for the
decentralization of sectoral responsibilities to the municipalities are yet to be determined in detail.

In its approach, Peru has capitalized on the lessons learned from other Latin American countries
that adopted and began implementing decentralization policies two or more decades ago. It is
also drawing on its own--largely failed--prior experience in this field. From all these, Peru's
decentralization agenda has been designed to support the following objectives: economic
development and competitiveness; modernization and simplification of administrative systems
and processes; assigning responsibility for public services to levels closest to the users; and
citizen participation in governance.

The Organic Decentralization Law (ODL), the pivotal piece of legislation on decentralization,
provides the basic guidelines for the intended process, stressing the need for hard budget
constraints and a fiscally-neutral process.                     In particular, it specifies that the fiscal
decentralization should: (i) involve an orderly transfer of functions--avoiding the transfer of
resources without a corresponding transfer of responsibility; (ii) establish limits (through fiscal
rules) on indebtedness and on increases in public expenditures of regional and local
governments; and (iii) impose restrictions on borrowing abroad and prohibit the central
government from covering non-guaranteed debts of regional and local entities.

The ODL had envisaged the sequencing of decentralization in one preparatory stage and four
implementing stages. The preparatory stage up until end-2002 focused on the establishment of
the legal and institutional framework for decentralization. The first implementing stage was
completed with the creation of regional governments. These governments were to be initially
financed with transfers equivalent to resources previously allocated to the deconcentrated units
of the national government, the Transitory Councils for Regional Administration (CTARs). The
subsequent stages have been carried out simultaneously without necessarily following the
sequencing proposed in the ODL.                      The second stage called for the consolidation of
decentralization strategy by promoting the merging of the 26 regions into a reduced number of
regions. The referendum for the formation of macro regions carried out in October 30th, 2005
failed to support the merging of regions.22 The third stage referred to the transfer of sector



22. The principal benefits for forming such macro regions--which exclude the provinces of Lima and Callao--are
to link areas of with similar geographic, economic and social characteristics to provide a broader, less parochial
governing vision and to achieve economies of scale in regional governance. The immediate incentive to back the
formation of macro-regions is basically to obtain more resources: 50 percent of own-source revenues from the


                                                           47

competences, other than education and health, and began in 2003. Social protection programs
(PRONAA and FONCODES) and public investment projects with regional impact (INADE)
have been transferred to decentralized governments based on an accreditation process. The
fourth stage envisaged the transfer of education and health responsibilities to sub-national
governments. This last stage has not been completed and there is lack of clarity regarding the
calendar for the transferring of these two important sectors.

In balance, all these reforms have changed how Peru's public sector operates. Decentralization
has led to a change in budget allocations: sub-national governments account for 35 percent of
non-financial government expenditures in 2006, up from 28 percent in 2003. Similarly, sub-
national governments are playing a more important role in public investment, and are responsible
for more than half of public investment in 2006, compared to only 20 percent in 2003. These
changes have been implemented while maintaining macroeconomic stability.                                The first
generation of reforms has focused on financial and control measures that support fiscal and
financial discipline at all levels of government. The legal framework has been designed to
support a gradual and fiscally neutral decentralization process that ensures delivery of essential
public services. The basic fiscal framework is already in place and serves as the first step in a
longer-term effort to decentralize public functions and resources to lower levels of governments
and communities.

Decentralization offers the opportunity to improve the provision of public goods by tailoring
them to local preferences. A further advantage of decentralization is that competition, proximity,
and transparency provide a strong motivation for local governments to be more responsive to the
needs of the public. Combined with more efficient taxation and spending, decentralization has
the potential to enhance welfare in all regions and contribute to reducing the existing large
geographical income disparities. Peru's choice of managing decentralization has been gradual,
ensuring that resources transferred to sub-national governments match expenditure transferred
once these have certified to receive the devolved responsibilities. However, several challenges
remain in the years to come for the decentralization agenda achieve its objectives.

III. CHALLENGES

The overall challenge is to complete the decentralization agenda. Otherwise, the political
autonomy of regions and municipalities will be severely reduced by high dependency on central
government transfers; the gap between natural resource rich regions and the rest will keep
growing; under-privileged regions and municipalities will try to take out debt to meet basic sub-
national services; poor quality of information and weak reporting will jeopardize transparency,
accountability and citizen participation; decentralization may end up threatening fiscal
responsibility; and the goal of regional and local competitiveness may not be attained. If not
completed within the next administration, decentralization may further atomize public
expenditure, with no inter-government coordination or economies of scale. Decentralization
would then reinforce current pressures to further fragmentation of fiscal decision-making.



domestic VAT, excise taxes and personal income tax in addition to discretionary transfers if needed. Unfortunately,
these benefits were not properly publicized or understood by the population and the regionalization process was not
achieved.


                                                        48

Completing the decentralization agenda will require further policies and actions in the areas of
sub-national taxation, inter-government fiscal transfers, quality of expenditure and service
delivery, sub-national debt and financial management.

Taxes. Having access to own sources of revenues is important as an incentive for increasing
local tax revenue and so that local governments face a hard budget constraint. As well, sub-
national governments need some control over their revenues in order to accommodate make
adjustments when needed due to policy changes or emergency needs. Thus for decentralization
to work, it is important to strengthen the tax bases of regional and local governments. The
traditional dilemma of ensuring that the jurisdiction for spending is the same as the one that
raises the money has to be solved within the intergovernmental transfer system. However, the
Constitution does not authorize regional level taxation. Even the prices of services and property
tax rates are set in Congress by national law. However it is still possible to delegate or otherwise
transfer the management and revenues from certain tax bases to regional governments.

Currently, tax revenues of sub-national governments cover a small fraction of their expenditure.
The challenge for municipal taxation differs sharply from the challenge at the regional level.
Municipalities have potentially dynamic yet largely under-utilized tax bases, and need adequate
incentives to mobilize their own tax revenues. Between 2000 and 2005, revenues of municipal
governments have increased by 0.6 percent of GDP (Table 1). However, the canon transfers
account for 70 percent of this increase, while tax revenue only 8 percent. Taxes account for
nearly 13 percent of total municipal income, while fees and contributions account for 30 percent.

Unlike other medium income Latin American countries, Peruvian municipalities do not entirely
manage their property tax, since all tax policy issues are determined by Congress.23 Property tax
collection is very low, at about 0.2 percent of GDP. Some municipalities are looking for ways to
improve property tax collection and with the support of the national government have installed a
cadastre module for revenue collection. Expanding this practice country-wide will strengthen
municipalities' capacity to generate their own resources and better manage them. One further
possibility is to document and disseminate the practices of good tax-performing municipalities
through horizontal exchanges for mutual learning. If Peru could raise property tax collection to
average OECD levels, it could bring in an extra US$1.2 billion per year to local governments,
more than ten times the total value of the canon.

Regions are only allowed to charge fees. There is still potential to introduce excise taxation at
regional level without jeopardizing national tax management or crowding out the national tax
base. One further possibility would be to introduce optional tax sharing arrangements between
territorial entities and SUNAT permitting the former to participate in collection of national taxes.

A key challenge is to find adequate incentives to increase tax collection at the sub-national level.
It is important to establish a fiscal incentive for local governments linked to their efforts to
increase tax revenues, consistent with the introduction of the Integrated Financial Management
System (SIAF) module on cadastre and revenues. One unutilized incentive is the fiscal effort
criteria for FONCOMUN distribution, which will be implemented once the results of the new
population census are available. The modified distribution is scheduled to be applied by 2007
and will include both fiscal effort and poverty criteria.


Transfers. The Government's strategy with the system of transfers at the early stage of
decentralization has been to protect public service delivery, ensure transparency and maintain
vertical balance. Vertical balance, understood as the equilibrium between income (revenue
potential plus transfers) and responsibilities, is essential to ensure fiscal and financial
sustainability under decentralization. In the absence of vertical balance, sub-national
governments will be pushed to excessive levels of debt.

The introduction of formal accreditation has the objective of protecting public service delivery.
The Government has respected the fiscal neutrality goal, with transfers increasing in accordance
with three factors: rate of growth of government resources,24 fiscal balances for the consolidated
public sector in line with Marco Macroeconomico Multiltianual, and financing the transfer of
additional responsibilities to sub-national levels while introducing corresponding expenditure
cuts at the national level.          However, the system of transfers would benefit from greater
simplicity, predictability, and control of service delivery quality. Currently, Peru has ten major
transfer programs to sub-national governments. The two main categories of transfers are the so-
called compensation funds for municipalities and regions: FONCOR, and FONCOMUN. Six of
the transfer programs 25 are linked to natural resources income and earmarked to capital
expenditure.

Municipalities are highly dependent on transfers based on revenue-sharing formulas, such as the
funding of FONCOMUN, canons and part of mining and hydrocarbon royalties (Table 2). These
transfers existed before regional decentralization and have been incorporated into the new policy




24. Either based on a broad tax, as in the case of FONCOMUN linked to the VAT, or revenue-source specific rate
of growth, as in the case of canon and royalties associated with natural resource income.
25. These consist of six canons: mining, hydrocarbon, fishing, petroleum, gas and forestry.

framework. 26     Transfers from the central government represent 57 percent of total local
government revenues, although large variations exist across them.                   For municipalities, the
relative importance of the mining canon has more than doubled since 2000, while other sources
of revenue have remained about the same. Local governments receive their revenues from
different sources: 56 percent of their revenue comes from FONCOMUN, a fund created specially
for municipalities whose financing source is 2 percent of the value added tax collected by the
central government. Royalties and corporate income tax of natural resources constitute 30
percent of their revenues. These resources can only be used for investment projects and they
come from five different canons: mining (18 percent), petroleum (8 percent), hydropower (2
percent), fishing (1 percent) and forest (0.2 percent). The transferred social program "Vaso de
Leche" (Glass of Milk) constitutes 10 percent of the local government revenues. The customs
income represents 3.4 percent of revenues and the Camisea gas fund 1 percent.

Transfer dependence is even more critical for regional governments, as they do not have a
source for tax revenue collection.27 Former CTARs as well as today's departmental governments
had access to fees and contributions, but made limited use of them. Regional governments
receive canon and royalties income, although these are not as large as for local governments as
these receive only 20 percent of the canon distributed. Both regional and local governments at
Lima and Callao receive a participation of revenues recollected by Customs on their jurisdiction
(as do other subnational governments where ports are located).

Canon and royalty transfers have increased sharply in recent years, driven by the commodity
price boom. Productively spending a substantial and largely unexpected amount of revenue is
not an easy task. In fact, regions and municipalities receiving these special purpose transfers
have not been able to execute the full amount, and large amount of resources are accumulating in
commercial bank accounts and Banco de la Nación. Utilization rates can be as low as 60 percent
for sub-national governments receiving these types of transfers. Canon and royalty resources are
earmarked to investment, including project design and project maintenance. The National Public



26. The distribution formula for FONCOMUN was amended in 2004 in order to include poverty indexes.
27. Up to 2002, when these governments became elected, the regional level of government (CTARs) was a
deconcentrated branch of the central government, financed through budget allocations in the national government
budget.

Investment System (SNIP) evaluates investment projects according to standardized criteria.
However, the SNIP is a relatively slow mechanism not prepared to provide technical assistance
to project-avid regions and municipalities. Though it has deconcentrated and adjusted to be
closer and more responsible to regions and municipalities, much is still to be done if sub-national
governments are to deliver quality investment projects. A proposal for creating stabilization fund
for canon and royalty resources, to limit pro-cyclicality and smooth the investment stream spent
by sub-national governments has been presented to Congress and is pending approval.

Wide divergences in natural resource endowments and economic concentration have the
potential negative effect of increasing horizontal inequalities, as has been the case in other
countries. Such disparities can be mitigated by a well-designed system of equalization-oriented
intergovernmental transfers. The amount of per capita resources varies widely across regions,
with a coefficient of variation of 0.9, very high for international standards. Moreover, the
variation of transfers does not correlate strongly with poverty (Table 3).           The correlation
coefficient for per capita transfers and the Unsatisfied Basic Needs Index is negligible, 0.07 in
2004. Ayacucho, one of the poorest regions, received S/144 per capita, while Tacna, one of the
wealthiest regions, received S/465 per capita. The revenue sharing arrangement for canon has
exacerbated inequalities. To address inequities in fiscal transfers, especially for regions without
natural resources, the Government has been responding with ad hoc measures like the Fondo de
Desarrollo de Camisea that makes compensatory transfers to natural resources-poor
municipalities that are in the neighboring area of a mine, gas or oil field. This type of ad hoc
policy should be limited to avoid arbitrariness and additional rigidity to this volatile transfer.

A pending issue in the decentralization agenda is to define compensation goals to re-establish
some minimum common standards of public services across regions and municipalities, and


                                                      52

achieve these goals through fiscal and sectoral transfers. There is a strong trend across the entire
intergovernmental system in Peru to increase horizontal disparities. They would become more
accentuated if departments aggregate into regions, given the decision to devolve locally-
generated revenue. A new compensation policy should be developed if the country still wants to
maintain a minimum level and quality of services throughout the territory. In addition, the open-
ended offer to finance regional investments might grow out of proportion, if not checked and
controlled in accordance with the investment capacity of the consolidated public sector.

The management of the canon transfer and how to handle volatility and lack of absorption
capacity at sub-national levels is also important to address.            This requires strengthening
investment capacity and institutionalizing mechanisms for auditing and public oversight of
canon and royalty-rich regions and municipalities.

Spending and Service Delivery. The assignment of responsibilities at the sub-national level,
particularly at the regional level, is still at a very early stage, with very few functions devolved.
The strategy chosen has been to slow down the transfer of responsibilities and resources to
departmental or local governments while the central government does more careful sector and
budget planning and introduces better management and control systems at sub-national levels.
Though this strategy might create political pressures from Congress and departmental
governments that wish to accelerate the pace of decentralization, it was the only way to protect
the quality of services while at the same time observing fiscal neutrality. Transfer of personnel is
always a complex and fiscally challenging operation. Indeed, a civil service reform should occur
before specific responsibilities such as health and education are transferred to regional and local
governments. A few responsibilities have been transferred already, primarily social protection
programs that were being financed through earmarked sources, and some infrastructure projects
that could be easily identified in the budget.

The accreditation process has been designed to ensure continued--and indeed, improved--
service delivery quality under decentralization. To this end, an annual transfer cycle was created
whereby decisions for expenditure transfers take place first on a cabinet level, followed by
formal requests of individual sub-national governments to adopt certain functions, the
verification of local institutional capacities, and finally, accreditation.    By              2005,
departmental governments had achieved substantial progress in accreditation: verification of
institutional capacities has taken place for about 70 percent of all functions that are to be
transferred according to the National Decentralization Plan. This entails responsibilities for
diverse regional infrastructure projects, road maintenance, agriculture development, and rural
electrification. In purely financial terms however, these responsibilities are limited, since the
transferred functions represent 130 million soles in 2004, while the total departmental
government budget is 8.3 billion soles. In 2004, departmental governments assumed
responsibility for the payroll of health workers and teachers, which today represent a large share
of their expenditures without corresponding sector management responsibilities.

Up until 2004 (no additional functions were devolved in 2005), some 125 out of 194 provincial
municipalities were accredited for administering the food assistance program (Programa
Nacional de Asistencia Alimentaria--PRONAA). This represents roughly 20 percent of total
PRONAA expenditures. In addition, 406 out of 1,829 district municipalities were accredited for
running the social infrastructure projects of the Social Investment Fund (FONCODES); this
represents roughly 17 percent of total FONCODES expenditures. Municipalities were also
subject to adopting responsibilities in the road maintenance program Provias Rural for which 40


                                                    53

out of 194 provincial municipalities were accredited, representing 98 percent of this program's
total expenditures. The newly transferred expenditure responsibilities represent just a small
fraction of total municipal expenditures, about 15 percent. In the case of regional governments,
devolved functions only relate to the management of a few projects of rural electrification and
maintenance of rural roads.

The transfer of main social, infrastructure and other significant responsibilities has yet to be
accomplished. While the slow pace of Peru's decentralization is a wise strategy, considering the
need to maintain service quality and fiscal balances, it is important that momentum be
maintained and the transfers of new responsibilities and resources to local governments continue.
Otherwise, the tensions (fiscal and otherwise) created by elected regional and local governments
that do not have clear mandates might end up derailing vertical balances, fiscal neutrality and
phased-in decentralization.

To achieve accountability for service delivery quality, the ex-ante accreditation process needs to
be accompanied by ex-post accountability mechanisms at the national and local levels.
Currently, two instruments serve this purpose: (i) results administration agreements (convenios
de administración de resultados--CARs) to be signed by MEF, sector ministries, and regional
governments; and (ii) management agreements (convenios de gestión) that define targets for
service delivery coverage and quality, to be signed among sector ministries and sub-national
governments. The CARs define targets for service delivery, establish lines of reporting, specify
responsibilities for institutional strengthening, and determine resource flows.      Management
agreements, which are now a formal step in the process of transferring functions to sub-national
governments, strengthen the commitment of the key institutions to maintain a given level of
services. The Ministry of Women and Social Development (MIMDES) is spearheading the effort
to implement management agreements. By end-2005, 125 provincial municipalities had signed
management agreements for the transfer of functions of the food program PRONAA, and 406
district municipalities have signed these agreements for transfers from FONCODES.

Until now, the decentralization process has maintained fiscal neutrality, but the limited
expenditure capacity of sub-national governments and their small tax bases could generate
problems in the future. It is necessary to specify clearly and explicitly the competences and
responsibilities of each level of government and design the proper financing mechanism so that
sub-national governments have the necessary resources to comply with their obligations. Most
importantly, training and investment in human capital and merit-based human resource
management are required at the sub-national level, in order to allow an efficient management of
public resources and an optimum provision of public goods and services.

Sub-national Borrowing. When a central government maintains a credible policy against
bailouts, it forces sub-national governments and their lenders to live with the consequences of
their decisions. They become accountable for their borrowing and other commitments. Under
these circumstances, suppliers and lenders tend to refrain from advancing goods and work or
lending to non-creditworthy sub-national governments. Where responsibility for debt is
ambiguous--as it is when there is a reason to expect national bailouts of failing sub national
entities--sub-national governments and their creditors have a greater incentive to take risks at
the expense of national taxpayers28.

In contrast with other Latin American countries, Peru's management of regional and local public
finances has not adversely affected the national financial sector or macroeconomic stability. The
magnitude of sub-national debt is not yet a problem. Regional governments do not yet have any
significant debt and the current municipal debt stock is estimated at 1.5 percent of GDP. The
legal and institutional framework for sub-national borrowing is well advanced, with a number of
regulatory and legal ceilings, accounting and reporting requirements for local and regional
governments, including fiscal rules on outstanding debt, debt services, primary surplus and
annual expenditure increases in place.

However, those figures may mask the real extent of municipal indebtedness due to the lack of
standardized accounting practices. The lion's share of the debt is concentrated in a relatively
small number of municipalities, many of which are populous, which could lead to moral hazard
problem. In addition, 90 percent of municipalities broke at least one of the eight different
regional or local debt rules in 2003. Another difficult challenge is that a high share of financial
obligations relate to labor debt, constituting 47 percent of long-term debt stock of municipalities.
Solving the labor debt problem requires reform in the municipal civil service. Further, as
regional governments have won the authority to contract debt, the central government needs to
make a more concerted effort to manage regional and local finances. Regardless of
decentralization, markets still tend to react to the news of the aggregate public sector, including
national, regional and local levels.

Rules are not yet enforced and sanctions have not been established. In the meantime, the lack of
standardized municipal accounting practices is also a potential problem.           While national
accounting is moving towards an accrual system, enforcement of accounting standards has room
to improve. No consolidated statistics for sub-national governments are available. At present,
financial data for sub-national governments is mostly aggregated, not consolidated.           Poor
accounting makes it difficult to apply the existing legal ceilings for borrowing. The MEF has
established a transition period where sub-national governments are required to prepare financial
reports with no sanctions applied. By 2008, sanctions will be applied to governments breaching
fiscal rules. However, the regulation of these sanctions is pending. A debt module has recently
been installed in the SIAF system and its implementation should provide timely information on
debt flows. An important issue to resolve now is how to estimate the stock of existing municipal
debt and what measures will be taken to clear arrears.


Financial Management. Given the limited authority upon and the low ability to raise own
revenue by sub-national governments, the SIAF-GL for local governments has become a key tool
for the efficient management of resources and for improving accountability and allocative
efficiency.   Different from other LAC countries, the introduction of financial management
standards at the sub-national levels is done voluntarily, through SIAF-GL agreements with each
municipality. SIAF-GL coverage achieved to date in regional and municipal governments is
very high compared to most other countries in the region. Nearly 600 out of 1800 municipalities,
including most of the largest and intermediate municipalities, manage expenditure accounts on
line with the system; and more than 95 percent are preparing their budgets with SIAF-GL.

Despite coverage progress with the budget, treasury and accounting modules, full integration of
financial management remains to be achieved at both central and local levels. The current system


                                                  55

neither integrates nor reconciles the budget classification with the country's accounting codes,
which makes it difficult to monitor rules that have to do primarily with budgeting. At the local
level, integration is also limited and on-line registration and reporting is still restricted to larger
municipalities. Secondly, SIAF cannot count on a single Treasury account and therefore does
not support an efficient cash management or control of balances. Multiple Treasury accounts not
only hinder the timely and accurate flow of financial information but weaken transparency,
creating opportunities for corruption.

III. POLICY OPTIONS

Revenue. In the short term, incentives are needed to promote improved tax revenue collection
by municipalities. Full application of the new FONCOMUN formula offers good potential. In
addition, some transfers or certification might be condition upon reducing current fiscal
dependency rates (transfers as a percentage of total revenues). While giving back full property
tax authority to municipalities might be in the cards for the medium term, the most immediate
challenge is to raise local own tax revenues. In the medium term, Peru would like to give the
regional governments a tax base they can manage on their own. Territorially-based consumption
taxes on specific goods and services (excises) have been demonstrated to be manageable and
efficient tax bases for regional governments throughout the LCR region.

Vertical and Horizontal Imbalances. Canon and royalties have become the single largest source
of government-created territorial inequality. The problem of territorial inequality needs to be
compensated by an explicit equalization policy built upon the analysis of current equalization
impact of government programs. Following the recent Canadian federal social pact, such
analytical work could be developed through a five step exercise.29 First, the analysis could
decompose the per capita inter- and intra-regional incidence of transfers and other forms of
public expenditures and investments by source of funding and over time. Second, own revenues
raised primarily at the local level would be added to national transfers and direct expenditures in
the corresponding municipalities. Third, determine the approximate per-capita cost of providing
minimum sub-national services that are to be guaranteed to any Peruvian citizen, regardless of
where they live. Fourth, propose a compensatory or equalization transfer that ensures minimum
per capita expenditures sufficient to guarantee minimum service standards. Territories that do not
have sufficient revenues to meet minimum service standards would be compensated. In order to
maintain fiscal neutrality, territories that already have more revenues than needed for standard
sub-national services would receive less transfers in the future. Fifth, the analysis could include
an assessment of local and regional institutional capacities.

The problem of slow expenditure should not be solved by relaxing public investment
requirements. As demonstrated by Chile and other countries with respect to regional and local
investment transfers, the medium term solution consists of the creation of a bank of eligible
investment projects that have been evaluated by the National Public Investment System (SNIP).
If necessary, the central government should assist sub-national governments that do not have

sufficient capacity to prepare quality investment projects. Similarly to the 2005 reforms of the
FNDR in Chile, the use of canon and royalty transfers may be expanded to cover current
expenditures of social programs; but it is still necessary to evaluate those programs ex-ante and
ex-post according to central government standards.

Canon and royalty transfers are also source of fiscal laziness, disproportionate revenues vis a vis
current responsibilities or expenditure capacity and possibly debt push when commodity prices
fall in the international markets. The problem of potential vertical imbalances once commodity
prices come down should be taken care of by creating a stabilization fund or similar mechanism.

Spending and Service Delivery. Inter-government Fiscal Transfers. It is imperative to quickly
produce a realistic and responsible calendar of responsibility transfers to sub-national
governments. The new calendar should protect the existing level and quality of service while at
the same time protecting fiscal neutrality by reducing direct service provision by the national
government and strengthening its capacity to monitor, evaluate and stimulate good performance
at sub-national levels.

New transfers should be results-oriented and results-conditioned. Further use and strict
enforcement of inter-government service delivery arrangements is recommended. They might
include incentives to form public-private partnerships or outsourcing. Transfers might also be
establishment-based (like transfers by school according to student enrollment) while keeping
monitoring and coordinating capacity at the local level. Not every service needs to be directly
provided by sub-national governments; creativity for efficiency in service delivery needs to be
encouraged. In the end, certification, inter-government performance arrangements and results-
based transfers will lead to asymmetry in service responsibilities, with good performers ahead of
others.

In the medium term, civil service reform at local and regional governments is needed. New labor
relations in the public sector also need to be performance-based. Otherwise mayors or governors
will have no room to reorganize production functions, demonstrate higher efficiency or respond
to their electorate. It is not recommended to transfer health and education services before labor
contracts can be properly managed at regional or local levels.

Sub-national Borrowing. In the short term, it is critical to pass a law with sanctions for
infringement of fiscal responsibility and borrowing rules at sub-national levels. It is also
important to further identify the debt stock problem and propose medium-term adjustment plans,
beginning with largest municipalities. Similarly, the national level should adopt stricter practices
of payment enforcement of sub-national liabilities with the central government.

Financial Management. It is essential to advance quickly with implementation of the SIAF
agenda so that, in three or four years, SIAF ensures integration and consolidation of sub-national
accounts, standard and timely reporting. Similar to other unitary (Colombia) or federal (Brazil)
countries in the region, introduction and full implementation of SIAF may be made a condition
for transfer of revenues and responsibilities. It is advisable to identify and publish the SIAF
coverage and quality goals for the coming year as well as for the next two, three and four years.

I. Summary

Peru's economic performance has been remarkable in the last four years. Real GDP grew an
average of 5 percent per year. Export growth has been particularly impressive since 2001,
resulting in a compound annual growth rate above 20 percent. Yet, Peru started with a relative
low base, so there is ample scope to continue improving export performance, and for regions
outside of Lima to become key engines of growth and employment. To secure sustained
expansion and diversification of exports, Peru should focus on improving competitiveness and by
moving up the value-added chain from a concentration of production and exports based on
primary products to new products with higher value added. To do so will require improving the
business climate to attract needed investment; reducing high logistics costs; facilitating
technological innovation and quality standards; increasing access to demand-driven training
programs; integrating SMEs into the value and export chain; and promoting the expansion of
modern agriculture.


II. Recent Performance and Challenges for Trade and Competitiveness

Peru's economic performance has been remarkable in the last four years. Real GDP grew an
average of 5 percent per year, with growth broadening beyond the traditional sectors. The recent
upswing in domestic demand has been supported by strong growth in private investment, up 14
percent in real terms during the first half of 2005. Peru understood that given the small size of
Peru's domestic market (and purchasing power), international trade was to be the country's most
important growth and development engine, and a thus key objective was to double the value of
exports in five years. Market-oriented economic policies adopted since 1990 have yielded a
substantial expansion of external trade, more than tripling exports in absolute terms between
1990 and 2005

Export growth has been particularly impressive since 2001, resulting in a compound annual
growth rate above 20 percent between 2001 and 2005. In comparison, this rate for 1990-2001
was only 7 percent. The strong export performance has continued in 2005, with increases of 25
percent over the previous year. The benefits were widely distributed, with many micro and SMEs
benefiting. More than 400 new products have been exported since 2001 and near 2000 firms

became new exporters, many of them small firms. And for that period, about 105 small firms
grew to become medium size.

Yet, despite the recent impressive trade expansion, total exports in Peru still represents a low
percentage of GDP, close to 21 percent in 2005. This figure is particularly striking when
compared to other countries in Latin America such as Chile (34 percent), Venezuela (32 percent),
Mexico (28 percent), and even Bolivia (24 percent) (Figure 1). And it is even more so when
noting that Peru is a resource rich country with productive mines, large fish-stocks, fertile land
and abundant forests. Similarly, exports per capita in Peru, at approximately US$580 in 2005, are
roughly half the Latin American average. Thus there is ample potential for improvement, and
improved competitiveness and the nurturing of exports should be key drivers.

Need to expand the export markets. Peru's export markets are relatively concentrated, with the
United States and the European Union accounting for over half of total exports, but exports to
Asia (China) are growing quite fast.31 Exports to China--driven mostly by traditional mining and
fish meal--have seen the largest gains, with a compound annual growth rate of 43 percent
between 2001 and 2004. Recognizing the need to open markets, the Peruvian authorities have
actively pursued free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. The prompt conclusion of a trade pact
with the U.S. is especially important because existing preferential access to the U.S. market,
which has generated significant export growth in labor-intensive industries, will expire in 2006.32
Peru has also progressed with the negotiation of bilateral trade agreements with Mexico,
Singapore, Thailand, and regions within the E.U. through the Andean Community (CAN). As of

51 percent between 2003 and 2004. In contrast, ATPDEA exports (as a share of total exports) rose from 42 percent
to 55 percent in Colombia and from 48 percent to 59 percent in Ecuador. One exception has been textiles, where
Peruvian firms have aggressively taken advantage of ATPDEA preferences. Source: Banco de Crédito del Peru.

July 2005, Peru provisionally became part of the European Union's Generalized System of
Preferences Plus, which allows 7,200 types of products to enter the E.U. duty free. These efforts
to open need markets for Peruvian products need to continue and expand. The Andean FTA and
other trade arrangements under consideration would offer a number of clear benefits to Peru,
such as a deepened access to the U.S., the world's largest import market, as well as to other
strategic markets for Peruvian exports; a greater stimulus to export diversification beyond
traditional, capital-intensive commodities to non-traditional labor-intensive goods with greater
value-added; and a strong signal to both domestic and foreign investors that the country is
committed to a strategy of export-led growth, which will further strengthen the already growing
confidence in Peru's economy and encourage greater investment

Need to increase the export base. The bulk of Peru's exports are still concentrated in primary
(and traditional) products. These traditional goods include mining, fish meal, agricultural, and oil
products and account for about 71 percent of all exports. Mining comprises by far the largest
share, at 55 percent of total exports. Although traditional exports have enjoyed healthy growth
rates recently--40 percent in 2003-2004--, they tend to have less long-term growth potential
than non-traditional products and are highly dependent on volatile commodity markets. Further
evidence of export concentration is shown by low levels of manufacturing exports,33 which
represented only 20 percent of manufacturing value-added in Peru in 2003. In contrast,
manufacturing exports in the Latin America and Caribbean region were 76 percent of
manufacturing value-added.34

Over the last two decades, agricultural exports have declined in Latin America while value-
added manufactures have increased. Agricultural and food exports fell from 44 percent of total
exports in 1980 to 20 percent of total exports in 2003, while manufacturing exports rose from 15
percent to 55 percent over the same period. In contrast, Peru's composition of exports has
changed much more slowly. Food and agricultural exports went from 19 percent of total exports
in 1980 to 23 percent in 2003, while manufacture exports increased from 12 percent to only 17
percent over the same period. Only Chile shows similar low rates of manufacturing exports over
total exports, though its export diversification and specialization is much more dynamic.

Non-traditional export growth has been promising and the agriculture sector, among others, has
seen large gains (Figure 2). Textiles, fisheries and chemicals grew 33, 35 and 51 percent
respectively during 2004. When mining is omitted, non-traditional exports have been steadily
increasing as a share of total exports. Overall non-traditional exports grew 242 percent from
1993 to 2004, while traditional exports excluding mining grew only 145 percent.35 Given that
exports are concentrated in a relatively small number of regions, products, and firms, there is
much room for expansion and diversification, especially among small and medium enterprises
outside of Lima. A wealth of empirical experience points to the importance of diversifying a
country's export base to mitigate the impact of international price movements and increase

Need to increase quality standards and value added of Peruvian products. To access markets,
Peruvian products needs high quality standards and increased value added. To move forward in
the value chain Peru requires significant continued effort to improve the country's production
quality and productivity and to provide incentives for technology adoption and adaptation and
for innovation in the private sector. The use and adoption of quality standards in Peru remains
quite low (Figure 3), and quality is key to access export markets. Likewise, Peru's efforts and
support for technological development and innovation have been minimal. Peru's expenditures in
R&D are extremely low, at only 0.11 percent of GDP in 2000, well below Brazil (1.1 percent of
GDP), Chile (0.56 percent) or Costa Rica (0.35 percent). A well balanced and incentive-based
strategy to foster quality and innovation should be a high priority.

Need to expand the use of land for modern agriculture. Non-traditional agriculture exports
have expanded and began to diversify in recent years. Between 2000 and 2004, these exports
grew at an average annual rate of nearly 20 percent.37 Peruvian firms are entering new market
niches with higher value-added products and signing medium term distribution contracts with
supermarket chains and some of the largest distributors in the U.S. Regional industry has also
benefited from the rapid growth of agro-exports through new investment in processing plants and
equipment and services related to preservation and packaging.

Growth has largely come as a result of expansions in land under cultivation, which required
developing new land and converting existing farmland to non-traditional export crops. Peruvian
agriculture shows important contrasts between a small but modern farming sector well connected
to international markets through the export of vegetables and fruits (e.g. asparagus, grapes,
avocados, paprika, canned artichokes, etc.) and a large small-scale agriculture devoted primarily
to the production of non-tradable or import substituting crops. Although Peru may show relative
large yields per hectare for many of these crops, unitary costs are quite high, severely limiting
the competitiveness of the sector.

Under current circumstances of low productivity, the impact of trade on agriculture production
and export is limited. Simulations done by the MINCETUR show that agricultural production
may barely grow as a result of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US (0.3 percent).



37. In 2000, exports of only two products--asparagus and mangos--exceeded US$15 million. In 2004, there were
seven such products, including paprika, a variety of pepper, artichokes, grapes, and avocado.

Employment effects are estimated in little more than 0.6 percent while the growth potential is
just slightly higher and is estimated at 0.7 percent. It is important, however, to recognize that
these estimations do not include the benefits already obtained from ATPDEA. If these are added,
the growth benefit for agriculture exports rise to 12 percent while production and employment
growth rises to 14 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Complementary modeling exercises done
by Fairlie (2004) and Cuadra et al. (2004) are much more optimistic and may hint the potential
additional gains that could occur if complementary policies are put in place to allow for
productivity increases. The authors incorporate key modifications to that base model to allow for
unemployment, capital accumulation and productivity increases through trade-related
externalities. They report agricultural production growth ranging between 4 percent and 9
percent and an increase in agriculture export between 24 percent and 32 percent if a FTA with
the US is signed.

There is ample agricultural land in Peru that potentially could be converted to more profitable
export crops (Figure 4). Specifically, there are approximately 1.1 million hectares used for
traditional agriculture (e.g. coffee, rice, sugar), 600,000 hectares used for small traditional
agriculture (e.g. corn, tomato, squash), and 2 million hectares used for subsistence farming. In
contrast, only about 50,000 hectares--or 1 percent of total farm land--are devoted to modern
agriculture for export, and is that 1 percent of land that is leading the agriculture export boom in
Peru. Bringing another 1 percent from the traditional agriculture sector into the modern would
have a major impact on growth, job creation, and regional development. Expansions to date
have often involved subcontracting production to owners formerly engaged in traditional
agriculture. Such subcontracting has had a positive effect on productivity when large firms
transfer knowledge and technology to their suppliers in order to obtain higher quality produce.
Land expansions have also allowed exporters to increase production periods for seasonal crops.

Need to address small scale production in agriculture. In that sector, there are also important
challenges ahead to adapt the traditional small farming productive structure to the opportunities
offered by non-traditional export farming. Global food markets are shifting toward more
stringent product and process standards. Growing concerns about food safety have made product
traceability and controlling the supply chain `from farm to shelf' a vital requirement in higher
segments of the market. This has led to a concern that smallholder growers will be marginalized
by high quality control costs. In other words, increasing standards imposed by food importers on
premium suppliers would make it difficult for suppliers to afford the necessary training and
oversight for a large number of small growers. Working with smallholder farmers is difficult for
trading and processing companies. Quantities of products are small and heterogeneous in quality,
supply can be haphazard, and bulking-up of volume into a steady stream of products of constant
quality is difficult to achieve. Smallholders also face constraints in terms of lack of knowledge of
modern markets, technologies and inputs, and difficult access to capital which prevents them
from upgrading their operations. These factors constitute a serious constraint to supplying high-
end modern supply chains.38

Need to facilitate exports at the source of production to reduce logistic costs. High regional
concentration of exports within the country is also a source of concern. The Lima-Callao region,
which accounts for roughly 46 percent of the country's GDP, was responsible for 35 percent of
its export production in 2004. The next three largest export producing regions are Ancash,
Cajamarca, and Moquegua, which account for 8 percent of the nation's total production but 34
percent of its exports. Exports in these regions are largely driven by mining. In contrast, the
regions that are primarily comprised of jungle geography account for 7 percent of national
production, but only 1 percent of exports. Exports in Lima and the coast and mountain regions
grew at roughly the national average (37 percent) between 2003 and 2004, while exports in the
jungle regions grew at less than half that rate (14 percent). In addition to this regional
concentration, exports are concentrated within each region in terms of products and exporters.

Exports firms are concentrated in Lima, around the port of Callao and the Lima Airport. The
majority of exporting firms have their headquarters and pay taxes there. In fact, in 2003, the
Lima-Callao area was home to 76 percent of exporting firms, the coastal regions accounted for
17 percent of exporting firms and both Lima and coastal regions saw 7 percent annual growth in
exporting firms between 2001 and 2003. In contrast, mountain and jungle regions only accounted
for 7 percent of exporting firms with 1 percent annual growth (Figure 5). These vast regional
disparities highlight the fact that regional infrastructure and associated export services are
deficient, forcing producers to move and export through Lima. Those infrastructure and service
bottlenecks make it hard for other regions to develop economically and compete with the capital
city.

Despite this concentration, there are some promising signs of regional diversification. According
to PROMPEX, 54 percent of the new export products originated in regions other than Lima-
Callao in 2003. This number is estimated to rise to 59 percent in 2005. Furthermore, there is
some evidence that coastal region customs offices are handling a growing share of exports--they

Need to improve access to finance. Lack of access to finance and to adequate export finance
instruments limits the expansion of the export sector in Peru. Although the Peruvian financial
sector has experienced a substantial modernization of its regulatory framework, and the banking
system has improved its efficiency and liquidity, the potential of the domestic market to offer
sophisticated export finance products and services has not been fully exploited. To help address
these deficiencies, several export-oriented financial instruments have been launched by the
Government targeting small and medium-sized firms, such as the Credit Insurance for Exporters
initiative, the FIXr (Programa de Financiamiento Integral para el Sector Exportador) or the new
risk capital fund (Fondo Transandino Perú). The Plan Maestro de Facilitación de Comercio also
contains other financing instruments that are currently under development, such as lines of credit
for buyers of Peruvian exports. Despite these initiatives, results from Peru's Investment Climate
Assessment indicate that limited access to finance is still a major problem of Peruvian exporters.
This finding is supported by discussions with financial institutions and exporters, all confirming
that only a few mainly large exporters have access to working capital loans from the banking
sector, and even less to structured export finance products such as export insurance, international
leasing and others.

Several institutional deficiencies have been identified that contribute to this situation, such as the
lack of efficient mechanisms for insolvent companies to exit the market, or the inflexible and
deficient legal and judicial framework for executing and realizing collateral. But there are also
specific constraints for small and medium exporters to secure credit that are related to
deficiencies characterizing their productive processes. For instance, the fragmented structure of
production and the lack of integration of supply chains make access to credit markets costly and
difficult. Additionally, the low level of "formalization" of SMEs in terms of accounting practices,
management and corporate governance structure, and quality standards prevents them from
making use of the financial instruments necessary to develop stable export activities.

Need to integrate SMEs into the value and export chain. Despite some progress in the past four
years,39 there is also pervasive evidence on export concentration at the firm level. Customs data
reveal that in 2005, the top 20 exporting firms were responsible for 57 percent of Peru's total
exports (by value) and the top 500 firms were responsible for 95 percent of exports.40 Not
surprisingly, exporters also tend to be medium and large size firms. In fact, a miniscule
percentage of micro and small enterprises participate in external markets (0.15 percent and 2.9
percent respectively). For medium and large enterprises, this number is 12.7 percent. According
to a different source, small and medium enterprises account for only 4.4 percent of the total value
of exports41, despite the fact that they comprise more than half the number of exporting firms.42
In a few industries, such as garments and textiles, there are backward linkages to small and
medium sized firms who, by supplying exporting firms, become secondary or indirect exporters.
However the median Peruvian firm shows very low exports as a percent of sales demonstrating
the lack of focus on the export market.

Need to improve its Investment Climate. Many of the listed actions and initiatives will require
significant investments, particularly from the private sector. To secure those investments, Peru
needs to improve its Investment Climate, which as shown by the latest Doing Business Report
(2006), has plenty of room for improvement, in areas such as firm and property registration,
securing licenses for construction, resolving conflicts, contractual disputes, trade facilitation etc.
Efforts at both national and regional levels are necessary.


III. Key Policy Recommendations

If Peru's competitive deficiencies are not addressed, the ongoing moderate/strong economic
growth will not be sustained. Strong macroeconomic and financial conditions are a necessary
but not sufficient condition to sustain the current momentum without decisive and
comprehensive reforms to boost the investment climate and global competitiveness. Peru's
strong macroeconomic performance of the last five years has not translated into similar success
on the competitiveness front.             The World Economic Forum ranks Peru 63rd in its
Competitiveness Index, compared to 29th place for Chile. Peru lags behind other countries in
the region in terms of microeconomic reforms. It suffers from low total factor productivity, low
human capital, high logistical and transportation costs, weak quality standards, very low research
and development (R&D) investment, and fragmented supply chains.

Although trade liberalization and export promotion may improve Peru's growth prospects, the
potential for export growth and job creation will be significantly higher if the country takes
policy actions to remove critical obstacles to the private sector in general and the export sector in
particular. Different econometric tests to assess the determinants of productivity consistently


39. The number of SME exporters has gone from 983 in 2001 to 1,292 in 2004, an annual increase of over 30
percent. Furthermore, 9 percent of these SMEs became medium and large enterprises.

Evidence from the Manufacturing Sector, World Bank (2004), based on an investment climate survey for
manufacturing firms.

show that the investment climate contributes nearly 40 percent to total factor productivity.
Quality, innovation and labor skills had the greatest impact on productivity, followed by
infrastructure.43 This provides a compelling argument for active and comprehensive public policy
to improve quality, innovation, and labor skills, as well as infrastructure, to reap maximum gains
from the opportunities and benefits of growth from free trade.

Some measures have already been undertaken to enhance competitiveness of the Peruvian
private sector. These include new laws to modernize the port sector and to facilitate science and
technological development; a national competitiveness plan and the creation of the institution to
implement it; measures to reduce administrative barriers and ensure contract enforcement;
actions to support infrastructure development and reduced logistics costs ­ particularly at the
regional level ­ and the creation of centers for technological innovation. To complement these
initiatives, the Government program for the promotion of production and productivity
enhancement focuses on four key areas identified by prior studies 44 as key obstacles to
productivity and economic activity: quality management, technology innovation, productive
chain integration and labor force development.


Peru has taken a number of important reforms since the 1990s, but greater effort is needed to
diversify its export base. To promote sustained growth and diversification of exports, Peru
should focus on improving competitiveness by further deepening trade liberalization, addressing
the infrastructure gap, ensuring that an adequate business environment is in place and designing
proactive policies to promote new export products and to enhance productivity and quality. 45
Specifically, efforts should proceed in the following areas: a) trade facilitation and export
promotion; b) improvements of infrastructure and logistic costs; c) reforms to improve the
business climate; and d) innovation and adoption of technology and quality standards.


a) Trade facilitation and export promotion

Market-oriented policies, a stable macroeconomic environment and openness to foreign direct
investment should provide adequate incentives to develop new export sectors. However,
becoming internationally competitive in more sophisticated markets involves also more complex
requirements than those demanded by the export of primary commodities or the like. A
comprehensive strategy for trade expansion is needed.

Efforts should also proceed in the following areas:

· Continue to integrate Peru into the world economy by redressing anti-export bias in public
   policy, barriers to international trade, and government constraints on foreign direct
   investment, technology and other sectoral linkages related to export development.

· As first step to developing a strategy to diversify exports and move up the production chain,
   undertake a survey to provide important information about what Peruvian exporting
   companies identify as potentially successful new products as well as constraints on
   production, distribution, marketing or finance. Supply and demand conditions can be
   obtained by existing UN records (COMTRADE, UNIDO, ITC, FAO). Secondly, identify
   through a case study approach the changes in export patterns in other developing countries
   which have experienced a positive diversification process. Third, an analysis of Latin
   American export performance or some neighboring countries with similar endowments might
   convey also useful information about products where Latin American countries are gaining
   market shares.

· Peru should consider further to consolidate institutions directly or indirectly related to export
   promotion so that efforts are not duplicated and knowledge can be more easily shared across
   different types of products, firms, and regions. A complement to this consolidation is an
   integrated information system that makes all manner of market, technical, and procedural
   information related to exporting available to firms on an easy-to-use Web portal. Regarding
   information and coordination externalities, for example, collecting information on foreign
   markets is an expensive business in which social yield is higher than the private benefits
   obtained. Currently, this information is neither centralized nor readily available. Activities in
   this respect should be enhanced, as well as campaigns to create a positive image of the
   country. Successful export promotion bodies have evolved towards autonomous semi-public
   corporations with substantial private participation. Promotion of Export Committees of
   business associations has also helped gaining better development of foreign markets

· The multi-regional offices initiative should be adequately resourced and extended to enable
   the decentralization of export promotion, quality certification and customs services, with
   careful identification of the institutional partners that will help guarantee their sustainability.

· Improvements to the customs regime: there is still room to further simplify and reduce tariffs,
   decrease dispersion, and reduce discretion regarding specific tariff policies. Customs
   operations could also be made more customer-friendly, for instance by allowing on-line
   consultations and complaints as well as increasing operating hours. Moving forward with the
   "exports via the postal service" program would also make customs procedures easier for
   small businesses.

· Progress has been made in terms of access to finance for exporting firms, yet more needs to
   be done to facilitate access to working capital and pre- and post-shipment credit, especially
   for SME exporters in regions outside of Lima. Moreover, evaluations of existing export
   financial instruments--for example, COFIDE--should be performed to assess their
   effectiveness.


b) Improvements in infrastructure and logistics

Improvements in infrastructure can also facilitate export diversification. Upgrades to roads, ports,
and airports can reduce the transactions costs associated with exporting products and importing


                                                  70

intermediate inputs from abroad. Lower transactions costs can make it profitable to export a
wider variety of products, especially from less developed regions outside of Lima. As shown in a
previous section, over 60 percent of Peru's exports leave the country via the Lima-Callao region,
while only 35 percent of the country's exports are actually produced there. Infrastructure
enhancements could either reduce the cost of transporting goods to Lima-Callao for export or
open up new points of departure for exports closer to actual areas of production.

The infrastructure services gap is constraining the successful achievement of growth and
competitiveness goals. New ways to boost badly needed investment in key infrastructure,
particularly roads, ports, and airports, need to be explored, without threatening the Government's
fiscal sustainability. Different modalities of public-private partnerships seem the most viable way
forward. Lessons can be derived from several experiences with infrastructure concessions in
Peru in the last 15 years, which have generally been positive, with improvements in both usage
and efficiency under private management. The Government should enhance its capacity to carry
out sound ex-ante evaluation of investment projects, ensuring that the institutional and legal
framework for the regulation and supervision of private sector participation is complete;
involving local governments and communities in project design and execution phases;
implementing a communications strategy to help reduce the negative perception that private
sector participation has among the population; improving contract design and awarding
processes; and accounting for the future fiscal impact of commitments being made as part of
private sector participation projects.

Among the many remaining challenges facing infrastructure development include:

· Roads: The road concession program should be complemented with the strengthening of the
    public agencies in charge of the management, regulation and oversight of the sector. The
    national road maintenance financing scheme should be reoriented to meet rehabilitation and
    maintenance needs of the regional road network and a framework for the adequate
    programming and funding of road maintenance activities should be established. Moreover,
    the successful decentralization of rural road management to municipalities and the new
    program for departmental roads should be supported further by eliminating overlapping
    interventions by different levels of government on the regional road network and replicating
    and scaling up successful road experiences.

· Ports: In addition to preparing the specific projects under the National Port Development
    Plan, a high priority for the Government should be the modernization/ concessioning of the
    port of El Callao and of key regional ports such as Paita in the North and another in the ICA
    region. In addition the GOP should carry out studies to address: (i) the development of value
    added services and logistic activity zones; (ii) the suitability of different private sector
    participation modalities; (iii) the promotion of intra and inter-port competition (iv) the
    potential urban and port development synergies; and (v) the needs of specific regional port
    systems.

· Airports: Lima's international airport experience, run by a private company under a 30-year
    concession, should be used to help design a strategy to franchise out regional airports that are
    key to benefit from economic expansion opportunities. The development and modernization
    of regional airports is essential to sustain the regional development and reduce logistic costs.

· A Network of Distribution and Logistic Terminals: To reduce logistic costs and reduce
    congestion an educated system of logistic terminals as public-private endeavors should be
    facilitated


c) Investment Climate improvements

Although some reforms to improve the regulatory, legal, and labor market framework facing
companies have already taken place, there is still room for more reforms and for speeding up
some others already underway. Remaining challenges in the area of investment climate
improvements include:

· Facilitate the formal registration of firms by speeding up the very long and costly process of
    registering a business, with a special focus on municipal registration. A strategy to persuade
    and assist municipal governments to diagnose and simplify local requirements is necessary.
    This is critical since municipal red tape currently accounts for over 30 percent of the total
    time to open a firm.

· Define an integrated system for asset registration that facilitates rapid, low cost registration,
    search of claims and reclamation of assets by all parties.

· Simplify legal processes for enforcement, which are weak in Peru. This will require, at least,
    simplification of the law and the legal process for enforcement, increasing accountability of
    judges to see their decisions enforced, and a review of the role of court and police in the
    enforcement process.

· Monitor the experience of the new commercial courts and expand their jurisdictions outside
    of Lima. This seeks to reduce the cost of doing business, by supporting the reduction of
    administrative barriers and strengthening commercial dispute resolution practices as a means
    to improve the business environment.


d) Adoption of technology and quality standards

Peru requires significant continued effort to improve the country's production quality and
productivity and to provide incentives for technology adoption and adaptation and for innovation
in the private sector. Adoption of quality standards in Peru is quite low and its expenditures in
R&D are extremely low, at only 0.11 percent of GDP in 2000, well below Brazil (1.1 percent of
GDP), Chile (0.56 percent) or Costa Rica (0.35 percent). To raise the level of technology and
innovation and adoption of quality standards, the Government should:

        · Develop an integrated National Quality System by: (i) clearly delineating the roles of
            SENASA and DIGESA; (ii) revising INDECOPI's role as the main national
            institution in charge of standardization and accreditation; promoting both process and
            product quality standards adoption specially among MSMEs; and fostering a culture
            for quality among Peruvian consumers.
        · Facilitate technological adaptation and innovation by (i) evaluating the performance
            of the CITEs network; (ii) strengthening their capacities to provide more technical
            assistance and testing, and to perform technological development; and (iii) helping
            them to establish links with a laboratories' network of excellence to build credibility
            for their testing capacities in international markets.



                                                   72

       · Increase the effectiveness of public R&D funding by improving incentives for
           technology transfer from the public to the private sector and allocating additional
           public funds in programs that foster innovation in SMEs.
       · Implement a coherent National Innovation System by developing the regulations for
           the new S&T Law, enacting the complementary R&D Incentive Law with incentives
           that promote applied research, technology transfer and linkages among private and
           public institutions, and increasing intellectual property right protection to ensure high
           returns to innovation.

A number of these recommendations are contained in Peru's National Competitiveness Plan that
was approved in July 2005. The Plan explicitly targets issues of consolidation of export
promotion activities, information integration, tariff reduction/dispersion, and improvements to
the customs regime to reduce transactions costs. While most of the plan's goals have target dates
within the next year, actually realizing the goals could prove to be a substantial challenge.

Regional governments with the support of the Government, may have a crucial role as catalysts
in regional economic development, diagnose key barriers, consult the local private sector and
subsequently implement targeted reforms and investments to improve competitiveness and
product diversification. The Government may consider strengthening the capacity of regional
councils to participate in the competitiveness and export planning process. It will also be critical
to evaluate progress by incorporating key competitiveness indicators at the regional level.
