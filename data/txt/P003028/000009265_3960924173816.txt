FOtRTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 916-ZR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        Of the eleven Bank Group operations in the transport sector since
Zaire's independence, six were for the rail/river/ports sub-sectois and
five for the highways sub-sector. A sixth highway project was appraised in
aid-1984 for Board presentation in mid-1985.
2.         Although water and rail transport are still the most important
means of transport for the country's exports, the importance of road trans-
port is growing fast, especially to support the Government's strategy to
increase agricultural production.
3.         Until now, IDA's assistance in the road sub-sector has focussed
on the maintenance and rehabilitation of about 41,000 km main road network
administered by the Bureau of Roads (BR), an agency of the Ministry of Pub-
lic Works.   Since 1969, IDA has provided about US$120.5 million for the
sub-sector and has been instrumental in arranging some US$133 million co-
financing from other international lending agencies and bilateral donors.
This financial assistance has included sizeable amounts for technical as-
sistance and training, thus contributing to institution building of Mt.
4.        The US$26 million Credit for the Fourth Highway Project, the sub-
Ject of this PCR, was signed on July 14, 1979. The original closing date
was December 31, 1982. However, since Credit effectiveness was delayed by
ten months due to the late effectiveness of the Saudi Fund's Agreement with
Government, the closing date was extended until December 31, 1983.  The
final disbursement took place on June 4, 1984.
5.         This PCR was prepared by a consultant on the basis of documents
available in the Bank, and a brief mission by him to Zaire from June 27 to
July 7, 1984. The report was reviewed and revised by EAPTI staff. The
Credit Agreement included a covenant requiring Government to prepare a
PCR. Government did aot undertake this task, nor did IDA remind Gavernment
of Its obligation. BR's staff, however, cooperated well with the project
completion mission.

6.         Given the complex composition of the project and the many prob-
lems that arose during its implementation, there rema.n ambiguities in re-
gard to the actual implemeitation period of various components. For this
reason, a project implementation table could not be prepared. Expenditures
partly overlap with the Third and Fifth Righway Projects (see Annex I) and
as a result, the actual cost of the Fourth Highway Project sbown in the PCI
is souewhat doubtful.
7.         In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (ORD),  but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for conments; their reply is shown
as Annex X.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 916-ZR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The project was the fourth Bank Group operation supporting Zaire's
highway sub-sector. Its main objectives were to strengthen highway admini-
stration, improve road maintenance and rehabilitation, and further develop
local expertise and experience. To a large extent, these have been accomp-
lished.
2.        Implementation of the project took longer than expected.  Effec-
tiveness of the credit was delayed by ten months to July 1980 (para.
2.08). The paved road rehabilitation component of the project took three
and a half years to complete (from mid-1980 until tho 'closing date of the
Credit, December 31, 1983).
3.         Although IDA financed only about, 112 of the estimated US$231.3
million cost of the project, it was Instrumental in arranging about US$83
million co-financing from other international lending agencies and bilate-
ral sources. IDA also provided considerable assistanci to Government in
making alternative arrangements to cover some of the shortfalls (para.
7.03).
4.        For reasons set forth in paras. 2.05 and 2.06, the amount of co-
financing v-as reduced by some US$21.4 million, US$13.2 million of which was
irrevocably committed. Because of this shortfall, some equipment was eli-
minated from the project and financlag of other transferred to IDA Credit
1290-ZR  for the Fifth Highway Project.   Some project goals were not
achieved as a result.
5.             The SAR shows  the estimated cost of  rehabilitation and
strengthening of "about 800 km' of road as US$20.7 million or about
US$25,600 per km, while the 'illustrative example' used In the economic
analysis shows the estimated cost as US$100,000 per km (para. 3.11).
6.        Although three contracts for a total of 224 km in the Bas Zaire
region and 30 km in the Shaba region were carried out satisfactorily by
contractors, contracts for samilar works for about 371 km in the Bandundu
and Shaba regions were not awarded because of lack of funds. Execution of
similar works on 153 km in the Kivu region, carried out by a BR brigade
with KfW financing for equipment and technical assistance, was only par-
tially completed (para. 3.14).



-vl-
7.         Other sub-components eliminated from the project were: (a) 45
cable ferries which were ex'pected to be financed from the suspended part of
the Saudi Fund (para. 3.17); (b) ferry romps, construction of which was en-
trusted to local contractors who failed (para. 3.17); and (c) part of
equipment and spare parts expected to be financed by CIDA (para. 2.05).
8.        The final cost of the project is below the appraisal estimates.
It is, however, difficult to draw a proper comparison of the estimated and
actual costs particularly because of the reducta.on in project scope and the
frequent devaluation of the over-valued Zairian currency during project im-
plementation (para. 3.29).
9.        Institution building was an important achievement as a result of
of IDA's continuous involvement in the maintenance and improvement of
Zaire's road system. During the implementation of the project, managerial,
technical and administrative skills of BR were strengthened further through
continued technical assistance and training (paras. 3.24 abd 4.02).
10.      Because the project was rather complex and certain sub-components
remained open at appraisal, its implementation called for frequent super-
vision and strict monitoring.   IDA's performance In this regard is ques-
tionable. There was a gap in supervision reporting of 27 months between
May 1980 and August 1982. and insufficient continuity in Bank staff in-
volved in preparation and supervision of the project (paras. 7.04 and
7.06).
11.      Since the equlpment was financed by tied aid from several donors,
BR's equipment fleet is very heterogeneous.  It consists of some 45 makes
and types for which it is uneconomic to keep large stocks of spare parts.
Although availability of equipment for BR's mechanized brigades has im-
proved since 1980, ordering and delivery of spare parts took too long with
detrimental results on BR's productivity (paras. 3.04 and 3.05).

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
(Credit 916-ZR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Of the eleven Bank Group operations in the transport sector since
Zaire's independence, six were for the rail/river/ports sub-sectors and
five for the highway sub-sector.  A sixth highway project has been ap-
praised for Board presentation in mid-1985.
1.02       Zaire's transport network is composed of the 15,000 km Zaire-
Kasai waterway system with rais.ways and roads feeding Into the many river
ports.  There is only one seaport, Matadi, located some 140 km from the
Atlantic coast.  Zaire has borders with nine other countries and a large
share of its internaticeal traffic passes through ports in neighboring
countries. The role of road transport, although growing, Is not as doml-
nant as In many other African countries; the road network is of relatively
low standards.
1.03      Roads are Important for transporting agricultural products from
the interior to areas of consumption and/or the river ports and rail sta-
tions. Since transport by rail or water is slow and unreliable, the role
of road transport has increased In recent years and will continue to do so
In the future.
1.04        Qf the 145,500 km road network, 20,700 km are classified as
national roads, and 20,200 km as priority regional roads; together, these
carry abcut 95Z of all traffic in the country. In total only 2,400 km are
paved and 2,800 km are gravel roads; the remainlig 140,300 km or 962 are
earth roads.  The responsibility for the 40,900 km national and priority
regional roads vests in the Ministry of Public Works and the works are exe-
cuted through the Bureau of Roads (BR), a semi-autonomous agency.  The
agency was established In 1972 under the Second Highway Project, and the
three subsequent highway projects assisted in strengthening it further.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Project Preparation
2.01      The project was identified and prepared during the implementation
of the Third Highway Project. From the beginning of the Association's in-
volvement In Zaire's highway seqctor, the emphasis has been on rehabilita-
tion and maintenance of the existing road network, rather than on new con-
struction, and this policy continued under the Fourth Highway Project.
Since Zaire's difficult financial situation seriously hampered implementa-
tion of the Third Highway Project, it was decided to follow a more compre-
hensive approach by including in the Fourth Highway Project all BR's acti-
vities envisaged for the next three years, ranging from routine road main-
tenance to road rehabilitation. (The program was later reduced to two and
a half years). Under conditions prevalent in Zaire, routine and/or perio-
dic maintenance is not feasible without also carrying out localized upgrad-
ing and improvements of the weak spots.
2.02        The project was appraised in July/August 1977 when the Third
Highway Project (Credit 536-ZR) was still less than half completed and only
about one third of the Credit amount disbursed.   The project scope and
costs were updated by a post-appraisal mission in January 1978; the nego-
tiations were held in December 1978.   The project was presented to the
Board on May 24, 1979 by which time about 80% of the funds under Credit
536-ZR had been disbursed. Although the Development Credit Agreement be-
tween Government and the Association was signed on June 14, 1979, it took
thirteen months for the credit to become effective (para. 2.08).
B. The Prolect
Description
2.03      The main objectives of the project were to (i) strengthen Zaire's
highway administration; (ii) improve road maintenance, rehabilitation and
betteDment work; and (iii) develop local expertise and experience at all
levels. The project comprised the road maintenance and rehabilitation pro-
gram of BR for mid-1979 to the end of 1981 and consisted of:
(i)    Routine and periodic maintenance and, where necessary, rehabili-
tation of 28,000 km roads indispensable for agricultural develop-
ment, and of the most Important 12,000 km of main road axes with
focus on Bas Zaire and Bandundu regions; this component was to
entail:
(a) constructing and equipping two workshops and warehouses;
(b) procurement of additional equipment;
(c) replacement of existing equipment;



-3-
(d) procurement of spare parts and fuel;
(e) maintenance works carried out by contract; and
(f) technical assistance to BR and its SGMTP (Equipment
Department);
(ii)    Rehabilitation and strengthening of about 800 km of paved roads;
(iii)    Repair and replacement of ferries comprising:
(a) procurement of materials to construct 11 motor ferries, and
45 cable ferries, procurement of 48 ferry motors, 51 outboard
motors, spare parts and tools; (b) construction of workshops and
warehouses; (c) construction of 11 ferry access ramps; and (d)
technical assistance to the SMB.
(iv)    construction, strengthening or replacement of 25 bridges to re-
place ferry crossings or weak bridges; and
(v)    Improvement of the Public Works Laboratory by providing equipment
and technical assistance.
Prolect Financing
2.04        The financing plan for the project as agreed at appraisal is
shown in detail in Annex III and is summarized In para. 2.07.
2.05       Because of Zairets deteriorating economy and budget constraints,
local funds made available by Government to BR were insufficient. In addi-
tion, despite section 3.01 (b) of the Credit Agreement, Government did not
provide any foreign exchange to BR. Furthermore, because of the increased
value of the U.S. dollar vis-1-vis European currencies the actual va'ue of
the EEC Special Action Credit reduced from US$15.5 to $12.0 million equiva-
lent, and the Canadian Government decided to spend US$6.0 million of its
assumed US$6.5 million contribution on other projects. This shortfall was
partly compensated by some US$3.2 million Japanese co-financing and a
US$1.2 million Increase in the ODM contribution.
2.06       However, the major setback occurred In May 1982 when the Saudi
Government suspended disbursements for non-project related reasons. Since
by that time only US$15.5 million of the Saudi Fund contribution had been
disbursed, this caused a shortfall in funding of US$18.4 mllion.  Firm
commitments for Saudi Fund financing had already been made for an amount of
US$13.2 million for payments to contractors for road works and to suppliers
for equipment. This resulted In reduction in the scope of the project and
an adjustment in the use of the remaining resources. Also, the US$0.6 mil-
lion contribution from the agricultural Credit 660-ZR was Increased to
US$3.2 million; the composition of the Fifth Highway Project was adjusted
to accommodate financing of equipment.

Credit Effectiveness
2.08     The three conditions for Credit effectiveness were as foUows:
(a) the Saudi Fund has notified IDA that its conditions for disburse-
mnts have been fulfilled;
(b) legislation satisfactory to IDA has been adopted to ensure that
the DR would have full control over its assets and day-to-day
managemmnt; and
(c)- conditions to make the EEC Special Action Credit effective have
been met.
Credit effectiveness took much longer than expected. Firstly, extensive,
loan negotiations took place before the Saudi Fund credit became effective
(September 1980).   Secondly, it was not until January 22, 1980 that a
legislation was passed granting DR adequate autonomy and it took another
four months before a legal opinion on the law, satisfactory to IDA, was
obtained. As a result, the Credit finally beeme effective on July 16,
1980, ten months behind schedule.
2.09      Due to the delay in Credit effectiveness, actual project Imple-
mentation started in aid-1980 except for IDA financed technical assistance
which through a PPF was financed as of mid-1979.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
A. Road Maintenance
3.01      Road maintenance operations carried out during the two and a half
period from mid-1980 to December 19821/ ranged from simple manual and/or
mechanized routine maintenance to refabilitation and upgrading of earth
roads. Actual accomplishments over this period varied depending upon the
availability of local funds (which fell short in the beginning) and of fuel
and materials.  Although the funds for 1982 met BR's needs, shortage of
fuel, spare parts and materials affected road maintenance operations to the
extent that the achievements were less than half of those in the previous
years. The maintenance operations were also adversely affected by the de-
lays and shortfall in external financing.
3.02       BR reports the condition of roads under its jurisdiction on the
basis of driving speeds: roads allowing speeds over 50 km/hour are judged
to be in good condition, those allowing speeds between 30 and 50 km/hour
are judged to be fair, and those allowing speeds below 30 km/hour are
judged to be in poor condition (see Annex V). On this basis, at the end of
1981 the roads under BR's responsibility were considered to be 48% good,
23? fair and 10Z poor; 19% had not been surveyed. For 1982 the road condi-
tions were assessed to be 53% good, 30% fair and 17% poor which showed con-
siderable improvement2/ over the past.
3.03      The final cost of this component was US$133.2 million, compared
to US$152.8 million (including 20.7% contingencies) at appraisal. However,
actual achievements were considerably lower than planned, particularly in
1982 (para. 3.01).   The cost of road maintenance carried out by contract
was much higher than estimated, namely, US$17.7 million compared to US$4.7
million, due largely to back payments to contractors for works carried out
earlier and not included in the Project. These amounts could not be deter-
mined.
Procurement of Equipment and Spare Parts
3.04         BR's equipment is managed and maintained by the Service de
Gestion du Materlel de Travaux Publics (SGMTP). Fleet composition clearly
reflects the drawback of tied aid: there are 45 makes/types of equipment
from nine countries resulting in lack of standardization. This creates the
/ From January 1, 1983 onward, road maintenance was financed under the
Fifth Highway Project.
/ At the end of 1983, the end of the first year o2 the Fifth Highway Pro-
ject, these figures were even better, namely 59%, 25Z and 162 respec-
tively.



-6-
need for excessive stock of spare parts, many of which may never be used,
and makes training of mechanics even more difficult than it already is un-
der circumstances prevailing in Zaire.
3.05      Annex VI shows the composition of a typical equipment fleet of a
BR regravelling brigade and of a regrading brigade. It is clear that the
brea%down of a single piece of equipment, such as a bulldozer, grader or
loader has a detrimental effect on the production of a brigade as a whole.
Further, it takes several weeks to complete paper work and to get goods re-
leased through customs.  As a "result, productivity is Impaired.  In most
cases the equipment is canabalised by the time the spare parts arrive. BR
should therefore not only maintain adequate stock of spare parts but also
streamline its procedures for ordering and delivery of spare parts.
B. Rehabilitation and Strengthening of Paved Roads
3.06        The SAR and Credit Agreement show that about 800 km of paved
roads would be rehabilitated and strengthened under the project (para.
2.03(1i)).  No breakdown of the length was then presented.  During the
first supervision mission, after signing of the Credit Agreement, an agree-
ment was reached on the first year program for road rehabilitation and
strengthening which was as follows:
Kibangu-Tshela Road         90 km in Bas Zaire
Boma-Matadi Road           121 km
Lubumbashi-Likasi Road      90 km In Shaba
Lubumbashi-Kipushi Road    30 km
331 km
3.07      Governmant received bids for the works on October 8, 1979, nine
months before the Credit became effective.  The Association reminded the
Government that BR would be responsible for payments to contractors since
reimbursements could be made only after the IDA and Saudi Fund Credits
had becoue effective.
3.08      BR awarded contracts for these works as follows:
(a)   for Kibangu-Tshela-Moanda-Banana Road   103 km to a Zairian contractor
(Bas Zaire)                (contract dated
March 1980);
(b)   for Matadi-Boma Road (Bas Zaire)         121 km to an Italian contractor
(contract
dated Sept.1980); and



-7-
(c)   for Lubumbashi-Kipushi (Shaba)            30 km to another Zairian contractor
-54km (contract dated
April 1981).
The works on these three contracts started on November 1980, February 1981
and April 1981 respectively.
3.09      Later, BR sought approval to award contracts for the following
two roads:
N'sele-Kenge Road (Bandandu)             230 km
Lubumbashi-Likasi Road (Shaba)           141 km
371 km
But, since the bids received were high and the funds were iiaited, these
roads were dropped from the projectl/.
3.10         It was decided that in the Kivu province, one of BR's own
brigades would carry out asphalt paving of the following roads with KfW
financed equipment and technical assistance.
Uvira-Kamanyola                         90 km
Frontiere Rwanda-Bukavu-Kavumu          36 km
Sak-Goma                                27 km
Total              153 km 
3.11          The SAR shows the estimated  cost of rehabilitation and
strengthening of 'about 800 km' of road as US$20.7 million (excluding con-
tingencies) or about US$25,600 per km, while the "illustrative example"
used in the economic analysis (Annex V, table 1 of the SAR) shows the esti-
mated cost as US$100,000 per km.  It appears that the estimated cost of
US$25,600 per km was based on a single surface treatment of the existing
pavement, whereas the estimated cost of US$100,000 per km used in the il-
lustrative example is based on complete rehabilitation and strengthening of
the roads.  In the latter case, the cost for this component should have
been In the order of some US$80 million. The text of the economic analysis
also implies that "paved roads were to be improved on the axis from Natadi
to Kinshasa - and its continuation further into the interior of the coun-
try". But none of the roads rehabilitated under this component forms part
of that axis, although they do belong to the "large population centers'
mentioned in the President's Report.
3.12      Progress of the works under the three contracts (Para. 3.08) was
slow. Works were frequently interrupted by the non-aftilability of local
counterpart funds, resulting in delay in payments to contractors.   The
financing problem became acute when in May 1982 the Saudi Fund suspended
disbursements (para. 2.06) and as of December 31, 1984 some US$4.2 million
due to an Italian contractor has not been paid
I/ Only a section of the Lubumbashi-Likasi Road was later included in the
Fifth Righway Project, to be co-financed by AfDF.



-8-
3.13      The 9 kma Moanda-Banana section of the Kibangu-Banana Road rehabi-
litation contract -        was completed around May 1984, that is, after the
closing date of December 31, 1983. Since by then the IDA Credit had been
fully disbursed, further payments could not be made from the Credit and an
amountl/ not fully agreed between BR and a Zairian contractor remained to
be pai&. A solution for their payments should oe found, particularly since
these two outstanding payments to contractors might affect competition for
future contracts.
3.14       Works in the Kivu area posed problems.  Not only was the equip-
ment ordered too late, but transporting it to the site took a very long
time. By the end of 1983 the O'mestic brigade had completed only 10 km of
paving and 40 km earth works.
3.15      A Zairian contractor completed repaving of the 103 km Kibaugu-
Tshela-Moanda-Banana Road at a cost of US$21.8  million, including U010.2
million in foreign exchange.  The Italian contractor completed repaving of the 121
km Matadi-Boma Road at a cost of US$13.4 million, including US$6.5 mil:.ion in foreign
exchange; another Zairian contractor completed repaving of the 30 km Lubumbashi-
Kipushi Road at a cost of US$3.6 million, including US$2.6 million in
foreign exchange. The total cost of the three contracts amounts to US$38.8
million of which US$19.3 million or 50% was paid in foreign exchange2/.
The cost increase of about 35% over the October 1979 bid prices is partly
explained (about two-thirds) by the increase in the quantities of work
(especially two bridges and a seawall) and the remaining by the effect of
escalation in prices.
C. Ferrn Program
3.16       The project included the supply of materials for domestic con-
struction of 11 motor ferries and 45 cable ferries, procurement of 48 ferry
motors, 51 outboard motors spare parts and tools, construction of 11 ferry
access ramps, S workshops and warehouses for the SMB, all supported by 88
months of technical assistance.
3.17    ' A large part of this component was successfully completed.  Work-
shops and warehouses were satisfactorily completed in Kinshasa, Bandandu,
Matadi, Mbandaka and Kisangani. The 120 ton ferry at Matadi and three 35
ton ferries for Kisangani, Ilebo and Lisala were built with KfI co-
financing. Nine 20 ton ferries were built at the private Chanimetal ship-
yard in Kinshasa and the remaining two at the BR workshop in Bandundu.
Moreover, BR rehabilitated in its own shops an additional sixteen ferries.
However, the cable ferries were eliminated from the project when the Saudi
Fund suspended its contribution, part of which was earmarked for financing

3/ The total foreign components had been estimated at about 65% at
appraisal.

of these ferries.   In addition, construction of the 11 access ramps was
postponed since all domestic contractors to which contracts were awarded
failed.
3.18        The completion cost of this project component, excluding the
ramps, amounts to US$12.8 million, compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$22.5 million, including US$3.7 million for the access ramps.
D.  Bridge Program
3.19      Under the bridge program, strengthening or new construction of 25
bridges was foreseen but 30 were eventually constructed/reconstructed. In
all cases, Bailey bridges were used (under ODM financing). The bridge ele-
ments shipped to Matadi had already arrlved by the time the IDA Credit
Agreement was signed; those shipped to Dar Es Salaam for delivery to the
Kivu region arrived later, and by January 1980 all bridge elements had ar-
rived in the country.
3.20       BR awarded contracts for the construction of bridge abutments at
eight new bridge sites in Bandandu and two in Equateur after inviting of-
fers from two contractors, Zairian and Italian. Since the procedure followed
for contract awards was not in accordance with IDA guidelines, It was
agreed that BR would finance them from its own sources. Works started in
March 1980 and were completed by the end of 1982. All other bridges were
erected on existing piers and abutments.
3.21      The total cost of the entire bridge program was US$10.8 million
(of vhich US$3.4 million was in foreign currency), compared to an appraisal
estimate of US$16.4 million (mainly because bridge abutments were rede-
signed and constructed by local firms).
K. Soils Laboratory
3.22       Equipmert for the laboratory was ordered in May 1982 and deli-
vered in September 1982. Technical assistance by a five-man team from a
French consulting firm was satisfactorly completed. The laboratory is now
usefully assisting BR in design and supervision of works and research on
the utilisation of local materials for road construction. The cost of this
component (excluding technical assistance) was US$0.2 million (all in
foreign currency), compared to an appraisal estimate of US$0.4 million.
F. Technical Assistance and Training
3.23       This component of the Project was initially subdivided into Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program (1,173 man-months), Ferry Program
(88 man-months) and Soils Laboratory (88 man-months). Delays in Credit ef-
f: civeness made it necessary for IDA to finance part of this component un-
der a PPF which was refinanced retroactively from Credit 916-ZR.



- 10 -
3.24        Of the 60 experts foreseen at appraisal, 56 were actually en-
gaged. Of these, 26 were staffing BR's office in Kinshasa, including the
SGMTP, 14 SGMTP's regional workshop, 8 BR's training centers; and 8 as-
sisted in maintenance operations of the 26 field production units.  BR' s
policy is to recruit and contract most of its technical assistance experts
individually. Even where consulting firms are used, these act largely as
recrntiting bureaus rather than as coordinating or advisory body. The ad-
vanta&s in this is that the costs are reduced and the experts' loyalty ful-
ly belongs to BR which outweighs the disadvantage of initial lack of homo-
geneity of the team.  Most expatriates were in executive positions which
ensured adequate management and technical depth at a time;BR's activities
increased substantially. As a result, BR could also provide a learning en-
vironment for the large nua.,ers of young engineers that it recruited.
3.25        It should be noted that BR's supervision of execution of the
works mentioned in para. 3.08 was weak. A team of one expatriate and five
local BR staff with limited experience was entrusted with the supervision
of contracts for the Kibangu-Banana road (103 km) and Matadi-Boma Road (121
ki). Another team of one expatriate plus two domestic staff supervised the
third contract. These teams were not strong enough to supervise unit price
contracts, to ascertain that the quality of work was in accordance with the
specifications, and to monitor quantities which formed the basis for pay-
ments amounting to about US$39 million or over US$150,000 per km.  Suitable
consulting firms should be employed for supervision of construction works
unless Borrowers have demonstrated competence. In Zaire that point had not
been reached at the time of the Credit negotiations for the Fourth Highway
Projectl/.
3.26       Technical assistance for the SGMTP workshops and for most of the
training activities was provided by experts recruited through a Swiss con-
sulting firm.   Annex VII shows that in the period 1981-1983 over 2,000
equipment and ferry operators, mechanics, electricians, storekeepers, ac-
countants, secretaries, road engineers, etc., were trained.
3.27       In the SAR the number of man-months of technical assistance was
estimated at 1,351 or 1,486 including 102 physical contingencies.   The
relevant annex in the SAR shows that 60 experts would be employed, reflect-
ing an average service period of about 25 months, rather than 30 months as
would be consistent with a two and a half year project. Actually, some 56
experts were employed, virtually all for 30 months or a total of 1,680 man
months, 132 more than the appraisal estimate.
3.28       Whereas the total cost of 1,486 man months of technical assist-
ance was estimated at US$14.2 million including contingencies, or US$9,550
per man month, the actual cost came to US$11.2 million for 1,680 man months
or US$6,660 per man month. This would indicate that the actual cost per
man month would be only 702 of the estimates, which is partly explained by
the Increased value of the dollar vis-a-vis donor country currencies. How-
l/ For similar contracts of the Fifth Highway Project it has been agreed
that consulting firms satisfactory to the Bank Group will be employed.

ever, as mentioned earlier the actual amount of salaries paid to the tech-
nical assistant staff by donor countries could not be verified, and the ac-
tual amount may well be higher.
G. Prolect Costs
3.29       Annex rV shows that the actual cost of the project was about
US$210.6 million, compared to ad appraisal estimate of US$231.3 million;
however, this apparent 92 cost reduction is m'esleading for various rea-
sons.   The project scope was reduced, particularly as a result of the
shortfall in project funds (para. 2.05 and 2.06).  Roughly half of the
total expenditure on the project was incurred in local currency and due to
the frequent devaluation of the over-valued Zairian currency, It is diffi-
cult to arrive at the equivalent dollar cost of the project. Including the
PPF, only about 792 of the estimated amount was spent on technical assist-
ance; however, the actual amount of salaries paid to the technical assist-
ance staff cannot be verified (Para. 3.28).  Contributions of donor agen-
cies varied substantially during implementation as a result of changes in
exchange rates vis-a-vis the dollar.   Finally, It also appears that BR's
accounting leaves much room for improvement.
3.30      it must also be recognized that the co-financing was of two cate-
gories: (a) contributions exclusively earmarked for the Fourth Highway Pro-
ject (IDA, EEC Special Action Fund and the Saudi Fund); and (b) contribu-
tions forming part of the ongoing aid commitments, where disbursements
could not always be accurately identified as forming part of the Fourth
Highway Project. As to the latter category, orders for equipment may have
been placed before or during the two and a half year lmplementation period
of IDA's Fourth Highway Project, and deliveries taken place during or after
that period.   Salaries for technical assistance financed from bilateral
sources were paid directly to the experts and cannot be identified in BR's
accounts.  Finally, as was the case with the EEC contribution, disburse-
mente varied substantially with the rates of exchange. In summry, part of
the final cost as presented in Annex IV is based on the assumption that the
disbursements relating to the latter category were more or less equal to
the contributions assumed at appraisal, except for the specific adjustments
mentioned in Paras. 2.05 and 2.06.
3.31       The following table summarizes the appraisal estimates of cost

IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.01        When Zaire became independent and internal strife was halted,
managerial, technical and administrative skills were in short supply to as-
sume control of the country's rapidly deteriorating road transport infra-
structure spread over a vast area with difficult access.
4.02       IDA's major contribution to Government's efforts in the sector
has been in strengthening the various transport institutions, including
BR. BR was established in 1972 under the Second Highway Project after its
need became obvious during Implementation of the First Highway Project.
Considering that this entity had to start from scratch, its achievements
over a timespan of twelve years are remarkable.
4.03       Implementation of the subsequent highway projects has been ham-
pered by shortage of adequate funds, manpower and management capabilities.
However, by and large, IDA's efforts in staff training through successive
highway projects have been successful (para. 3.24 and 3.26). These efforts
are being continued under the ongoing Fifth Highway Project.
4.04      In-mid 1982 some 56 expatriate experts were working In high level
positions within BR.  An important activity of the technical assistance
staff has been training of Zairian staff and workers at all levels, from
engineers and supervisors to equipment mechanics and operators. Under the
Fourth Highway Project over 220 engineers and supervisory staff and some
1,900 workers at various levels received training, either through long-term
courses or through short-term seminars (para. 3.26). These numbers, though
Impressive, still do not fulfill BR's needs. Staff training should there-
fore continue unabated.
4.05      An imjortant result of the institution building is the improved
availability of road maintenance equipment; during implementation of the
Fourth Highway Project this increased from an average of about 50S in 1980
to about 702 by the end of 1983.
4.06       After completion of the two pilot road maintenance projects in
Bas Zaire and Bandandu under the Third Highway Project by the end of 1980,
BR's activities were decentralized and by the end of 1983, some 26 regional
production units and 80 brigades were operating in the country. One may
argue that considering the limitations of funds and trained manpower, the
increase from two small pilot regions, located close to Kinshasa and with
better road conditions, to nine larger and remote regions of the country,
where road standards are much lower, was rather a big jump.  But, this
proved to be successful.
4.07         Zaire's socio-economic environment has changed since BR was
created and it is time that a fresh look is taken at BR's activities, espe-
cially force account and mechanized operations, in order to review its
strategies and organization in the coming years.   This is the subject of a
study financed by IDA under the Fifth Highway Project which was completed
by the end of 1984. The study also addresses broad sub-sector issues and
especially the question of maintenance/rehabilitation of rural roads.

V. PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVEkUHENT
5.01       :mplementation of the Fourth Highway Project took place during a
period of difficult economic situation in the country.  Although some of
the problems were due to internal factors, such as weak financial disci-
pline, others were due to external factors outside Government's control,
such as drop in copper prices to the lowest level in 30 years.
5.02       Due to the difficult-economic situation, BR's budget allocations
remained low, which adversely affected BR's operations.  However, despite
severe financial constraints Government tried Its best to meet the require-
ments of the Development Credit Agreement, but was not always successful.
BR's financial situation improved substantially in December 1982 when fuel
taxes were increased to cover its recurrent expenditures.
5.03       Another problem faced by BR was that it did not receive adequate
foreign currency from Government which led to the shortage of spare parts
for equipment.   The situation, however, improved when in September 1983
foreign currency became available to public entities through a free market.
5.04       Government did not comply with the requirement of axle-load con-
trol prescribed in Section 4.03 of the Development Credit Agreement. There
were no weigh bridges in Zaire and there was no provlsion for their pro-
curement in the project. Even if weighbridges were Installed, it would be
difficult for the Government to find suitable personnel to enforce regula-
tions in remote areas of the country.   Better control of truck imports
could also be considered as a means of controlling axle-load.

VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
General
6.01      The chapter on economic analysis in the SAR opens  with the foot-
note 'because of incomplete data, the economic evaluation of the project is
based on illustrative examples".  However, it is seen that the "illustra-
tive examples" were based to a large extent on assumptions as to traffic
density and growth and ratios of heavy to light vehicles.  In the absence
of precise data at the time of project completion, there is no basis for
updating appraisal assumptions. As shown in Annex IX, the vehicle operat-
Ing costs have substantially changed over time.  The large changes in ex-
change rates during project implementation make comparisons still more dif-
ficult.   In view of these complications, the re-evaluation of ERR's has
been limited to the impact of difference in estimated and actual cost of
components for which an illustrative example was presented in the SAR, and
to applying savings in VOC's as at end-1983.
Rehabilitation and Strengthening of Paved Roads
6.02        The illustrative example used in the SAR was a 94 km section
(Tshela-Kibangu) out of 254 km actually rehabilitated. Actual costs were
542 over the appraisal estimate and 352 over the October 1979 bid prices
(para. 3.15).
6.03       The ERR has been reevaluated on the basis of average voc savings
of US$0.21 per vehicle/km and traffic of 150 vehicles per day (instead of
340 vpd in the SAR). The assumption was made that the road would have been
rehabilitated and maintained as a good earth road had the project not been
carried out. The reevaluated ERR is about 15X compared to 53X in the SAR.
Procurement of Equipimnt. Spare Parts. Etc. for Road Maintenance
6.04       In the SAR it is stated that "the economic return on the financ-
ing of additional equipment, spare parts, materials and fuel will, owing to
its incremental nature, be substantial". The economic return is estimated
at 672, provided that the following assumptions come true: (a) average
traffic on 28,000 km maintained in the past would grow from 12 vehicles per
day (v.p.d.) to 15 v.p.d.; (b) the condition of a further 10,000 km of
earth roads would be improved from bad to good condition; and (c) that VOC
savings for 1979 would be as shown in Annex IX and yield on earth roads a
weighted average VOC saving of US$0.22 per vehicle kilometer.
6.05        Since road maintenance operations continued over a series of
overlapping highway projects (Annex I) it is difficult to identify sepa-
rately economic benefits resulting from various components. During imple-
mentation of the Project, there was no reliable system for measuring the
effects of maintenance operations.   The first assumption could not be
checked. The data presented in Annex V Indicates that the planned Improve-
ment of 10,000 km of earth roads km from bad to good condition was not
achieved. However, the weighted average saving of only US$0.22 per vehicle
km, in the SAR was probably much underestimated since the more realistic
end-1983 estimate is US$0.73 per vehicle km. Moreover, cost of this pro-
ject component is lower than estimated, because salaries (expressed in US$



-17 -
equivalent) amount to only two-thirds of the appraisal estimate.   Final-
ly, it also appears that in the total cost of this component are included
certain expenditures incurred during the Third Highway Project and the
costs of the brigade in the Kivu area.  In view thereof no attempt is made
to re-evaluate the ERR of this component.
Ferry Program
6.06      The illustrative example chosen for this component was the Isangi
ferry.  ERRs of 37% to 55% were obtained under several assumptions.   The
total actual cost of this component amounts to only about 66% of the ap-
praisal estimates (allowing some US$2.2 million for the access ramps which
are yet to be completed). The vehicle operating cost savings are about 17X
lower than assumed. ERRs were reevaluated on this basis. The results are
about the same as estimated at appraisall/.
Bridge Program
6.07       The estimated EER's for the three illustrative examples for this
component range from 35X-39% to over 100%. The actual cost of this pro-
ject component amounts to about 66% of the estimated cost, and the vehicle
operating cost savings are about 17% lower. EER's of this component were
reevaluated on this basis. The results are about the same as estimated at
appraisal.
Soil Laboratory Technical Assistance and Training
6.08       No attempt was made in the SAR to quantify the ERR' 8 of these
components.
1/ ERR - 52% instead of 55% under the assumption of no deferred traffic.

VII. THE ROLE OF IDA
7.01        The Government's basic strategy in the highway sub-sector has
been to assist agricultural development through proper maintenance and re-
habilitation of the existing road system, rather than new road construc-
tion. This was fully supported by IDA.
7.02      Government shared IDA's opinion that BR's responsibilities should
be restricted to the 40,900 km of national and priority regional roads to
avoid difussion of its capabilities.   Responsibility for the remaining
about 104,600 km of lower class roads was thus left to local governments
and the Ministry of Agriculture.
7.03       Although IDA could finance only 11% of the total estimated cost
of the project or about 21% of the estimated foreign cost, it assisted
Government in lining up co-financing for an amount of about US$83 million
from other international lending agencies and bilateral sources. The Pro-
jeet proved a major instrument in coordinating foreign aid around a clear
and comprehensive set of priorities.  IDA continued to assist Government's
coordination efforts during project implementation.   IDA was also able to
help make alternative arrangements for covering some of the shortfalls
(paras. 2.05 and 2.06).
7.04      Although IDA played a major role in defining broad policies and
in making co-financing arrangements for the project, its performance'in
preparation and supervision of the Project is questionable. No supervision
report was produced for 27 months between May 1980 and August 1982, al-
though several missions took place during this time to supervise the pro-
ject and to prepare and appraise the Fifth Highway Project.
7.05      As explained in para. 3.25, the supervision of the paved road re-
habilitation and strengthening component was unsatisfactory.   IDA should
have insisted upon using a reputable independent consulting firm for the
engineering, and supervision of construction contracts.
7.06       Finally, the Project suffered from a certain lack of continuity
of staff.  Of the five staff members involved in the preparation and ap-
praisal of the project, only two were members of the first supervision mis-
sion which took place one year before the credit became effective. There-
after, supervision missions were carried out by three different engineers
and two transport economists, none of whom was involved in the preparation
and appraisal of the project.

VIII. LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      The project as a whole was quite complex and difficult to moni-
tor.  Preparation and supervision were not sufficient because of the lack
of continuity of Bank staff involved in the project.  A gap of 27 months
between supervision mission reporting during the initial implementation
period was rather long. To the extent supervision is combined with prepa-
ration of follow-up projects, adequate reporting on supervision should be
ensured especially since co-financing institutions may to some extent rely
on the Bank's expertise in project supervision.
8.02      Site supervision by BR staff of civil works carried out by con-
tractors was too weak. In Zaire it will take several years before domestic
competence has reached the level where the Bank could relax itanormal re-
quirement of employing consultants for the engineering and supervision of
execution of works. This requirement has been met under the Fifth Highway
Project.
8.03     Carrying out road maintenance and rehabilitation works by some 80
mechanized brigades spread over a large area puts a heavy burden on the
limited managerial, technical and administrative skills available within
BR. Field supervision by expatriates is spread too thinly. Consideration
should be given to increased use of contractors.
8.04       Whereas availability of equipment has steadily improved since
1980, its composition reflects too many makes and types, resulting from
tied financing from various donors. This has resulted in lack of standar-
dization and consequent problem of delay in ordering and delivery of spare
parts with negative effects on BR's productivity.

the calculated end-1983 figures. It should also be noted that the end-1981 figures
are higher than the end-1983 figures but this may be partly caused by transferring
zaires into dollarcents when exchange rate was distorted.

Mr. Yukinori Watanabe

Subject: Completion Report on the Fourth Highways Project
(Credit 916-ZR) of the Republic of Zaire
Dear Mr. Watanabe:
Thank you for your first version of the completion report on the Fourth
Highways Project of the Republic of Zaire.
The analyses and conclusions contained in this report seem to me
altogether pertinent and draw attention to problems that the Office des Routes
is endeavoring to resolve. Certain improvements have already been made for
the drawing up of the Fifth and Sixth Credit Agreements.
Only the conclusion contained in paragraph 8.03 calls for some comments.
It is correct that in view of the financial resources in particular
available to the Office des Routes, the supervision in the field by
expatriates (and also by Zairians, for that matter) of maintenance work is
spread too thiui, because the country is too large and the Office's staff is
limited.
The problem of field supervision of work done will not be solved by
resorting to local firms (besides, for the most part there are none).
I believe that this would even produce precisely the opposite result.
The experiment was made in 1975 and before repeating it (in another form
maybe), its costs should be carefully analyzed since they are, in my opinion,
incompatible with the budgets that the Zairian State can presently allocate to
the Office des Routes, short of abandoning maintenance on the greater part of
the network.
Sincerely yours,
/s/J. Baudoin
