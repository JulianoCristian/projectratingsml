It comprises the maintenance and rehabilitation\n            of about 40,000 km of roads, including 800 km of paved\n            roads; strengthening and replacement of bridges;\n            construction of workshops and warehouses; procurement of\n            motor and cable ferries and replacement motors and of\n            highway maintenance equipment, spare parts and fuel;\n            improvement of the National Public Works Laboratory, and\n            technical assistance and training.
