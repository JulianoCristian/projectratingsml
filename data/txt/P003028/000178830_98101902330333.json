It comprises the maintenance and rehabilitation\n            of about 40,000 km of roads, including 800 km of paved\n            roads; strengthening and replacement of bridges;\n            construction of workshops and warehouses; procurement of\n            motor and cable ferries and replacement motors and of\n            highway maintenance equipment, spare parts and fuel;\n            improvement of the National Public Works Laboratory, and\n            technical assistance and training. The project will help\n            meet minimum road transport requirements for the\n            agricultural sector and will result in substantial\n            reductions in vehicle operating costs."}, "docdt": "1979-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
