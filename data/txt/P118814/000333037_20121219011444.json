Reduction\n            Support Operation (PRSO) Project for Laos were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: complementarity between policy and\n            institutional dialogue through PRSO and existing investment\n            and technical assistance projects is critical for the\n            success of reforms. In order to assist in effective\n            implementation of the policy reforms, complementary\n            technical assistance have been provided through projects and\n            coordinated technical support by other development partners.\n            Opening the dialogue and flexibly adapting to the political\n            economy for reforms will be critical for success. These\n            include local governments such as provinces and the national\n            assembly economic and budget committee. Supporting a\n            reasonably well defined reform agenda of a senior champion\n            in Government is equally important for success. In areas\n            where sector working groups are active, it is important that\n            PRSO engage in and maintain direct communications with\n            existing sector working groups to ensure a constructive and\n            consistency to the existing reform dialogue. It is equally\n            important that PRSO coordinates closely and maintain contact\n            with other development partners who do not participate in\n            the PRSO modality but are involved in areas relevant to PRSO dialogue."}, "docdt": "2012-10-05T00:00:00Z"}
