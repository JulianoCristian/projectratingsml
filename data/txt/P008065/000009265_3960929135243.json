Key agricultural development components\n            comprise a land administration program, consisting of a new\n            leasehold titling system, cadastral mapping and land\n            surveying; strengthening of the Department of\n            Agriculture's extension and land services; and\n            agricultural planning, including market research and\n            investment promotion.  The sugar industry component would\n            support the engagement of a small management team to keep\n            the mill operating, and to introduce much needed operational improvements."}, "docdt": "1991-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
