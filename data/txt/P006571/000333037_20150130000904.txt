Involving Local Communities in Saving the Brazilian Rain Forest                                      December 13, 2005
Pilot Program Demonstration Projects (PDA)

Building the capacity of local communities to
develop, adapt, and implement environmentally
sound forms of resource use is essential for
promoting sustainable development in the Brazilian
Rain Forest. Since 1995, the Demonstration
Projects(PDA) have been providing resources for
promoting, testing, and disseminating a wide range
of community-based initiatives in both the
Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions.

The Demonstration Projects have three aims:
                                                       FLOATING CORRALS - Villagers living in

       program;

    2. to inform other community groups,
       researchers, and policymakers about the
       lessons learned from local sub-projects;
       and

    3. to strengthen the capacity of local
       populations and support two of the most
       important Brazilian NGO networks: GTA
       (Amazon Working Group) and RMA (Atlantic
       Forest Network).

Examples of activities financed by the PD/A
include:

       Experiments with new forms of
       sustainable resource use , e.g., the
       processing and marketing of non-timber
       forest products, such as fruits and nuts

Since 1995, the project has helped to:
       Stimulate a wide array of community and
       NGO experiments with natural resource use
       and conservation;

       Strengthen the participant communities
       and bring significant improvements in
       management, social organization, the role of
       women and political representation;

       Generate a large amount of knowledge and
       lessons learned, and begin to disseminate
       it;

       Foster changes in attitudes and behavior
       in the rural areas of the Amazon and
       Atlantic Forests, and increase environmental
       awareness of participating communities and
       surrounding populations;

       Stimulate policy initiatives and the revision
       of governmental programs such as credits to
       farmers and technical assistance at the local
       level.

Although it is too early to evaluate the sub-projects’
impact on the environment, many appear to have
helped increase family incomes and raise
awareness of the importance of sustainable use of
natural resources.
