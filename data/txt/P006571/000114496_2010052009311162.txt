and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the Special Accounts shall be made as 
follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocations, the Recipient, shall 
furnish to the Trustee a request or requests for  deposits which do not exceed the 
respective aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocations. On the basis of such

request; or (B) deposit into the relevant Special Account (or, if the Trustee shall 
so request, refund to the Trustee) an amount equal to the amount of such

shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Trustee into the Special Accounts 
shall be made until the Recipient has provided such evidence or made such 
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
(b)

outstanding in the Special Accounts will not be required to cover further 
payments for eligible expenditures, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice
