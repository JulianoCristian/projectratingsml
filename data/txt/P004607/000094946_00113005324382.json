overall project outcome is rated as\n            marginally unsatisfactory mainly because a) National Power\n            Corporation has maintained its precarious financial\n            situation and the objective of the strengthening the\n            financial viability of the project entities has not been\n            achieved; and b) the high cost of meeting the project's\n            physical and environmental objectives was a contributing\n            factor to this situation. The lessons learned from this\n            project include: 1) While fast-track BOT\n            (build-operate-transfer) projects have proved crucial in\n            alleviating power shortages, the economic efficiency of\n            individual private investments should be improved with due\n            consideration for a cohesive sector approach and\n            rationalization of prices and risk-sharing arrangements\n            within a competitive and transparent framework. 2) It may\n            not be realistic to expect power projects developed with\n            private funds under the \"fast-tracked\" Independent\n            Power Producer (IPP) Program to be least costly in the\n            \"traditional sense.\" 3) The high cost of the IPP\n            Program has been a contributing factor to the failure of the\n            project. Such an outcome indicates the need for sufficient\n            risk analysis or management in a highly uncertain operating\n            environment. 4) The use of a \"rate of return on\n            assets\" target for financial performance is\n            inappropriate for a company or sector with a very large and\n            lumpy investment program. 5) Quality at entry is a critical\n            success factor for project implementation."}, "docdt": "2000-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
