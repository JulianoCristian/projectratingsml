The project comprises the\n            rehabilitation of existing irrigation perimeters and\n            includes the following components: (a) rehabilitation of\n            irrigation infrastructure and equipment; (b) crop\n            intensification; (c) assistance to cooperatives; (d)\n            adaptive research and seed multiplication; (e) strengthening\n            of ONAHA; and (f) strengthening of RINI."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
