                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Project development objective is to (i) mitigate environmental and health risks associated with chlordane and mirex in termite control by (a) demonstrating the
                         elimination of their use through the introduction of integrated pest management in selected areas, and preparing a national replication program for complete
                         phase-out of chlordane and mirex in China (by 2014).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved the POPs phase-out target by issuing the ban on production, use, import and export of chlordane and mirex in May 2009. Demonstration of the Integrated
                         Pest Management (IPM) approach (use of bait systems in this case) has made great progress since July 2010, the installation rate of bait systems has reached 95% of the total
                         procured and will be 100% by Nov. 30, 2011. Preparatory work for piloting the Monitoring-Dusting (M&D) technology proposed by FECO and its national experts is ongoing, which

                         aims to identify one more cost-effective IPM option for termite prevention and control in China. The first contaminated site cleanup was completed. The cleanup contract for the
                         second contaminated site is expected to be signed in early August and the cleanup will be completed by Dec. 31, 2011.
