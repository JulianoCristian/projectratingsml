                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Project development objective is to (i) mitigate environmental and health risks associated with chlordane and mirex in termite control by (a) demonstrating the
                         elimination of their use through the introduction of integrated pest management in selected areas, and preparing a national replication program for complete
                         phase-out of chlordane and mirex in China (by 2014).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved the POPs phaseout target by issuing the ban on production, use, import and export of chlordane and mirex in May 2009. Much progress has been made

                         after delays on demonstration of alternatives to chlordane and mirex (use of Integrated Pest Management technology-Bait System in this case achieving the reduction of the use of
                         alternative chemicals). A request to extend the project, together with an implementation plan, is expected from the government shortly. The extension request will be evaluated in
                         December.
