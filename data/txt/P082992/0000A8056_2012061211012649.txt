                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Project development objective is to (i) mitigate environmental and health risks associated with chlordane and mirex in termite control by (a) demonstrating the
                         elimination of their use through the introduction of integrated pest management in selected areas, and preparing a national replication program for complete phase-out
                         of chlordane and mirex in China (by 2014).

                         The Termite Project has been closed by December 31, 2011 as scheduled. It has achieved the PDOs: a ban on production, use, import and export of chlordane and mirex in China
                         was issued in May 2009 and two chlordane and mirex contaminated sites were cleaned up as pilots; the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach using monitoring-baiting
                         systems in the three demonstration provinces and monitoring-dusting systems in the five newly-participating cities (added in late 2010 through the project restructuring) was

                         control in China. 100% of the project grant was disbursed as of May 23, 2012 and the project grant account has been closed.
