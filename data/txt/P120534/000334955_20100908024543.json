"The Third Economic Management and\n            Governance Reform Grant Program (EMGRG III) for Central\n            African Republic (CAR) is the fourth in a series of\n            development policy operations (DPOs) that began with the\n            Reengagement and Institution-Building Support Program in\n            2006. It builds on the preceding DPOs and continues to\n            support the implementation of CAR's poverty reduction\n            strategy, as set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            adopted by the Government in September 2007. The operation\n            supports the Government's efforts to mitigate the\n            economic and poverty impact of the global economic slowdown.\n            The EMGRG III is designed as a two-tranche operation to give\n            the authorities the time needed to implement the proposed\n            tranche release conditions in the context of an evolving\n            electoral process. The reform program has been developed\n            jointly with the Government and in close collaboration with\n            other donors active in CAR. Also the government and other\n            budget support donors as a group have agreed on the EMGRG\n            III tranche release conditions. The European Union and\n            African Development Bank intend to provide parallel external\n            financing to help mitigate the impact of the global\n            financial crisis and support the implementation of the\n            government's poverty reduction strategy. The operation\n            is consistent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            supported program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)."}, "docdt": "2010-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
