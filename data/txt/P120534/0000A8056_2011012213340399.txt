                         The program is progressing well and triggers for the second tranches are under implementation by the respective administrative units but, one triggers related to the adoption of the
                         legislation and regulations on the downstream petroleum sector is lagging. However the Minister of Finance as well as the Minister of mining and energy are committed to keep the
                         implementation of the related trigger on track. The second report of EITI is now available and main conclusions have been published in one of the local news paper (nouvelle vision -
                         a weekly media for national and international news) as well as on the EITI website. The Government has communicated all informations needed to the Court of accounts including a
                         draft law of budget execution. The procurement regulatory authority is working to finalize its report assessing compliance with the provision of the procurement Code as it would help
                         to ensure proper implementation of the governance program with respect to procurement. The government intend to settle part of the arrears to Small and medium companies before
                         end of December 2010 and the remaining early in January 2011. A framework document for a national tracking system and verification in the forestry sector has been adopted and
                         validated. These documents were integrated in the negotiation framework of FLEGT (Forest law enforcement, Governance and Trade) to be signed by European Commission (EC)
                         and the Government before end of December 2010. The draft Budget law under ongoing discussion at the parliament includes provisions stating the reduction of costs arising from
                         the creation of business as well as the cost of the transfer of urban commercial real property.
