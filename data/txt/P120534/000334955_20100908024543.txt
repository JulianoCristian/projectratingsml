                               Central African Republic
                             Grant and Program Summary
     Proposed Third Economic Management and Governance Reform Grant (EMGRG III)
Borrower                 Government of Central African Republic
Implementation Agency    Ministry of Planning, Economy and International Cooperation
Financing Data           IDA Grant of SDR5.8 million (US$8.8 million equivalent) through
                         the Crisis Response Window (CRW).
Operation Type           Development Policy Operation
Tranching                The grant would be disbursed in two tranches, of SDR2.9 million
                         each. The operation is designed so that all actions for the first
                         tranche would have been taken prior to Board consideration.
                         Disbursement of the second tranche is expected in early 2011,
                         contingent on fulfillment of the tranche release conditions.
Main Policy Areas        The main policy areas supported by the operation are: (i) budget
                         execution and reporting, and public procurement; (ii) revenue
                         administration; (iii) forestry, mining and petroleum sector reforms;
                         and (iv) business environment improvement.
Key Outcome Indicators    Commitment and procurement plans are adopted by priority sector
                           ministries by end-June 2010;
                          Arrears owed to small and medium enterprises reduced by at least
                           CFAF 500 million;
                          Review of compliance to the new Procurement Code and adoption
                           of action plan;
                          Submission of the 2008 draft Budget Execution Law to Parliament;
                          The value of tax and customs exemptions is reduced by 15%;
                          Adoption of a national traceability system and verification scheme
                           of the legality of timber production;
                          Adoption of the second EITI report;
                          Adoption of downstream petroleum sector legislation;
                          Audit report on the utilization of funds in the petroleum product
                           account;
                          Registration fees associated with the creation of business and the
                           transfer of urban property reduced by at least 50%.
Program Development      The proposed grant is designed to provide fiscal space to the CAR to
Objective (s) and        protect priority sector spending and mitigate the effects of the global
Contribution to CAS      financial crisis. It supports the continued implementation of the
                         reform program aimed at improving transparency and efficiency in
                         the management of public resources and extends it to include aspects
                         of private sector development. More specifically, the objectives of
                         the proposed grant are to improve transparency and efficiency in the
                         management of public resources and promote private sector
                         development through reforms aimed at: (i) strengthening budget
                         execution and reporting as well as public procurement, and
                         improving revenue administration to increase domestic revenue,
                         with the view to expand public investment in priority sectors; (ii)

                                            vii 
 
                           strengthening the regulatory framework in the forestry, mining and
                           petroleum sectors so that they can continue to be a source of
                           sustainable growth, employment and incomes; and (iii) improving
                           the business environment by reducing the cost of doing business.
                           The proposed grant will contribute to the expected outcomes of the
                           Country Partnership Strategy for the period 2009-2012 and support
                           implementation of the Government's poverty reduction strategy.
Risks and Risks            The reform program faces five kinds of risks. First, the security
Mitigation                 situation remains fragile owing to continued clashes between the
                           national armed forces and a splinter rebel group in the north, and the
                           slow implementation of the DDR program. Increased insecurity
                           could affect the composition of expenditures away from public
                           investment. Second, the vote by Parliament to extend the mandate of
                           President Bozizé until the elections can be held has reduced the risk
                           of a constitutional vacuum. On July 30, 2010 a presidential decree
                           fixed the date of the presidential and legislative elections to January
                           23, 2011 to which civil society, political parties, and ex-rebel groups
                           have agreed. While this consensus on the election dates bodes well
                           for political stability, continued uncertainty about their timing could
                           affect the pace of reforms. Third, a prolonged global economic
                           slowdown could lead to slower growth, current account deficit, and
                           deterioration in debt indicators. Fourth, financial controls remain
                           weak, which may limit the impact of the proposed operation; and
                           fifth, constraints to the implementation of reforms persist due to
                           weak institutional capacity.
                           Risk Mitigation. These risks are mitigated, respectively, through: (i)
                           support from the international community for the Government's
                           security sector reform program; (ii) commitment of the UNDP, EU
                           and other donors to help accelerate implementation of the DDR
                           program and facilitate the organization of transparent presidential
                           and legislative elections; (iii) the Government's continued adherence
                           to the medium-term macroeconomic framework supported by the
                           IMF under the Extended Credit Facility; (iv) the establishment of
                           transparent and accountable procedures for financial management
                           and procurement in the context of the LICUS III and IDF grants; and
                           (v) continued technical assistance from budget support donors.

                          GRANT (EMGRG III)
                  TO THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

                                         I. INTRODUCTION
1.      This program document proposes the third Economic Management and Governance
Reform Grant (EMGRG III) in the amount of SDR5.8 million, or US$8.8 million in pilot Crisis
Response Window (CRW) resources equivalent, to the Central African Republic (CAR). The
proposed grant is the fourth in a series of development policy operations (DPOs) that began with
the Reengagement and Institution-Building Support Program in 2006. It builds on the preceding
DPOs and continues to support the implementation of CAR's poverty reduction strategy, as set
out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper adopted by the Government in September 2007.

2.      The proposed operation supports the Government's efforts to mitigate the economic
and poverty impact of the global economic slowdown. Low external demand and a steep fall
in prices caused CAR's main exports, timber and diamond, to contract sharply in 2009. The
forestry sector was particularly hard hit; timber production fell by 37 percent, exports declined
by 29 percent in volume terms, revenues decreased by more than 37 percent and employment
contracted. Diamond production and exports fell by 18 percent. As a result real GDP growth,
which had slowed from 3.7 percent in 2007 to 2 percent in 2008 owing to a variety of supply
shocks, weakened further to 1.7 percent in 2009. Compared to the period 2006-2008, this
represents an overall reduction of real GDP of 1.5 percentage points. This growth slowdown is
challenging efforts to reduce the incidence of poverty which remains widespread, especially in
rural areas. A particular concern is that the slowdown is likely to hamper improvements in public
services that are needed if CAR is to move toward the MDGs. In response to the crisis and in an
effort to mitigate its economic and poverty impacts, fiscal policy has been geared to supporting
aggregate demand through government spending; however, limited resources make it hard for
the government to implement its poverty reduction strategy. The EMGRG III will provide fiscal
space through the Crisis Response Window to support and complement, in coordination with
other donors, the Government's efforts to maintain its public expenditure programs in priority
sectors, including education, health, agriculture, transport and infrastructure, which aim to
deliver basic services to the population.

3.       Specifically, the proposed operation aims to protect priority sector spending and
limit the poverty impact of the global economic crisis by: (1) supporting the planned
acceleration of public investment in priority sectors and measures to increase domestic revenue.
This will permit the rehabilitation of primary and secondary schools and health care centers;
development of the road network so as to support the development of the agricultural sector;
rehabilitation of the electrical utility; and extension of the supply of potable water and sanitation
facilities to the interior, which would help improve the health status of the poor and vulnerable
groups. Particular emphasis will be placed on strengthening government capacity to implement
its investment projects; (2) assisting the government in strengthening the regulatory framework
in the forestry, mining and petroleum sectors so that they can continue to be a source of

                                                 1 
 
sustainable growth, employment and incomes; and (3) improving the business environment
through a reduction in the cost of doing business.

4.      To ensure that the CRW resources are used most effectively to achieve policy
objectives as defined in the PRSP and the Millennium Development Goals, the proposed
operation supports the continuation of the reform program launched under the previous
operations. The proposed operation supports the reform program prepared under EMGRG I and
EMGRG II further deepening it to promote an effective utilization of resources, and extending it
to support private sector development to stimulate private investment. More specifically, the
EMGRG III reform program aims to improve transparency and efficiency in the management of
public resources and promote private sector development through: (i) a strengthened public
finance management (PFM) system which includes reforms aimed at improving budget
execution and reporting as well as public procurement, and broadening the tax base to increase
domestic revenue; (ii) enhanced economic governance in the forestry, mining and petroleum
sectors; and (iii) a reduction in the cost of doing business.

5.      The grant is aligned with the objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy
developed jointly by the World Bank Group and the African Development Bank. The
WBG/AfDB joint country partnership strategy (CPS) for the period 2009-2012 was presented to
the Board in July 2009. The CPS lays out a strategy to support CAR's transition from extended
instability to long-term economic recovery. The proposed operation contributes directly to the
expected outcomes of the CPS, which include improved public finance management, increased
transparency and accountability in natural resource management, and improved investment
climate. It will be supported by the LICUS III technical assistance grant designed to deepen
reforms in public finance management and public administration, and improve the business
environment; and the IDF grant, which aims to strengthen capacity in public procurement.

6.     The proposed EMGRG III is designed as a two-tranche operation to give the
authorities the time needed to implement the proposed tranche release conditions in the
context of an evolving electoral process. Strategically, the two-tranche approach permits the
Bank and other donors to maintain the focus on critical reforms and to remain engaged in the
policy dialogue with the authorities during and after the political transition. Programmatic
development policy lending, which has the flexibility of adjusting triggers, is not available to
CAR at this time.

7.     The proposed reform program has been developed jointly with the Government and
in close collaboration with other donors active in CAR. Also the government and other
budget support donors as a group have agreed on the EMGRG III tranche release conditions. The
European Union and African Development Bank intend to provide parallel external financing to
help mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis and support the implementation of the
government's poverty reduction strategy. The proposed operation is consistent with the IMF-
supported program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).

A.  POLITICAL AND SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS 

8.     The CAR authorities continue to focus on efforts to strengthen political stability and
consolidate the peace process throughout the country. An Inclusive Political Dialogue (IPD)
organized in December 2008 in Bangui resulted in the adoption of a road map for full
reconciliation. Its main recommendations included: (i) formation of a coalition government,
including members of the opposition; (ii) implementation of a Disarmament, Demobilization and
Rehabilitation (DDR) program; and (iii) setting up of an independent electoral commission to
organize general elections in 2010. A consensus government has been in place since January
2009; the DDR process has been launched; and an independent electoral commission has been
set up with the mandate to organize credible presidential and legislative elections. To further
promote national reconciliation, President Bozizé appointed the former Archbishop of Bangui as
the National Mediator in August 2009. The Mediator has engaged with members of the
opposition and the Government in an effort to find peaceful solutions to the country's political
problems. For instance, as a result of the Mediator's efforts, opposition groups have resumed
their participation in the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) after they withdrew in
disagreement over its composition and the creation of CEI committees for the presidential party.
Implementation of the recommendations of the IPD has been slower than anticipated, however;
and the Government faces numerous challenges as described below.

9.      The security situation outside the capital remains tenuous as attacks continue in the
North, North-East and South-East. While most of the rebel groups are participating in the
peace process, clashes have continued between the national army and a splinter rebel group, the
`Convention des Patriotes pour la Justice et la Paix (CPJP)' in the north. In addition, road
bandits, also known as Zaraguinas, have continued to carry out fresh attacks on the populations.
The government lacks defense and security forces capable of ensuring security across the entire
national territory. The Northern part of the country is in effect controlled by several rebel groups
including CPJP1, APRD and FDPC2. Security is also threatened in the Eastern and North-
Eastern parts of the country due to frequent intrusions by the rebels of the Lord Resistance Army
(LRA), a rebel movement fighting the Government of Uganda. As a result of the continued
insecurity and violence, the number of displaced persons has risen again after declining to
108,000 in February 2009 from more than 200,000 in 2007. In December 2009, UNHCR
estimated the number of internally displaced persons at over 162000, with a concentration on the
northern part of CAR, including 73,000 people who were trying to return to their homes but had
not yet found durable solutions. There are two peacekeeping missions in CAR with civilian
protection mandates: the UN Mission in CAR and Chad (MINURCAT), which replaced EU
forces in Darfur; and the MICOPAX, a regional peace-building force, deployed under the
Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) leadership. However, MINURCAT is
winding down: the size of its military contingent was cut by half in May and the final withdrawal
of the remaining troops is expected to take place in October 2010. The security situation in the
north-east, along the borders with Chad and Sudan, could deteriorate as a result.

10.     Implementation of the DDR program to create favorable security conditions for the
conduct of presidential and legislative elections has been slower than expected. The first
phase of the sensitization campaign on the DDR was formally launched by President Bozizé on
August 13, 2009. The campaign, conducted by a joint team of government officials and
representatives of rebel groups, provided also an opportunity to promote reconciliation between
former rebel groups and local government authorities in territories that were previously held by
the rebels. With UNDP support, the steering committee on DDR3 has prepared the methodology
for the verification of the list of ex-combatants as well as the guidelines for the implementation
of the DDR. Almost all former rebel groups have submitted the list of their combatants, and
about 8,000 ex-combatants are expected to be demobilized. Overall, the operation has not
progressed as expected because of political disputes and disagreements over the payment of food
allowances to former rebels. On January 10, 2010, President Bozizé held a meeting with civil
society, rebel groups, and donors during which he ordered the steering committee to speed up the
implementation of the disarmament and demobilization components of the program. A second
campaign of information on the DDR began on February 5, 2010 to lay the ground for the
deployment of military observers from ECCAS who are charged with the verification of the lists
of ex-combatants, and the setting-up of local DDR committees. In addition, the campaign is
carrying out the distribution of food allowances ("Prime Générale d'Alimentation") to ex-
combatants under the DDR activities financed through the national budget.

11.     The authorities and opposition leaders need to overcome their differences to ensure
transparent and fair presidential and parliamentary elections. These elections should have
constitutionally been held before the end of April 2010. A presidential decree, issued on
February 25, 2010, initially set the date for the presidential and legislative elections on April 25,
2010. This prompted questions on the ability of the Independent Electoral Commission to
organize credible elections under such a tight schedule, given continued insecurity in some parts
of the country and the delay in implementation of the DDR program. A coalition of opposition
parties, the "Collectif des forces du Changement", called for (i) the withdrawal of the decree
announcing the elections; (ii) the publication of the report of the CEI on its activities; (iii)
acceleration of the DDR program; and (iv) the organization of an electoral census over the
national territory and in all embassies to update the electoral register. President Bozizé, who had
declared his candidacy on March 16, 2010, and his party insisted on the date of April 25, 2010 in
order to comply with the constitutionally mandated time frame for the general elections. In a
joint statement issued on March 17, 2010, the representatives of the EU, France, United States
and UN expressed concern that the conditions for credible presidential and legislative elections
were not in place and recommended that these elections be delayed. Recognizing the need to
mobilize resources to operationalize the CEI and put in place the structures and operations
required for the conduct of credible elections, on March 30, 2010 President Bozizé issued a
decree postponing the elections to May 16, 2010. On April 29, 2010, the CEI declared that it was
unable to organize the presidential and parliamentary elections on May 16, 2010 as announced
but did not set a new date for the elections. On May 10, 2010 Parliament voted overwhelmingly

 A national steering committee was established by Presidential decree on 3 February 2009 to coordinate the DDR
program. The committee is chaired by UNDP and includes three representatives of the Government and one from
each rebel groups and donors representatives

                                                               4 
 
to amend the constitution with a provision that extended the mandate of President Bozizé and the
Parliament, which would have expired on June 11, 2010, until the elections can be held. This
amendment, which was validated by the Constitutional Court, has ensured that there would be no
constitutional vacuum while the CEI prepares to organize credible elections. In mid-June,
following broad consultations, the CEI proposed the date of October 24, 2010 to hold the
elections. Citing the need for further progress on the DDR program, especially on the
disarmament component, and for mobilizing additional resources, the Government issued on July
30, 2010 a presidential decree setting the date of the presidential and legislative elections to
January 23, 2011. Since then, all the parties to the Inclusive Political Dialogue, including civil
society and ex-rebel groups, have agreed to this new date; in addition, they further agreed on the
date of March 20, 2011 for the second round of the elections. In view of these agreements on the
new election dates, the European Union has signed a contribution agreement with the UNDP to
help finance the electoral process. 
 

B.  RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 

Growth

12.    CAR, a landlocked post-conflict country with a rich natural resource endowment, is
striving to achieve a transition from extended periods of instability to growth and
development. Starting from dire economic and social conditions at the end of conflict in 2003,
CAR has made good progress in stabilizing the economy, implementing financial and structural
reforms, and restoring social services. Since the start of the PRGF-supported program in 2006,
the government has maintained prudent policies and implemented structural reforms that have
helped establish the conditions for economic growth to resume. Real GDP growth rebounded
strongly to 3.8 percent in 2006 from 2.4 percent in 2005, owing in part to donors re-engagement
following the end of the conflict. Supported by sound economic policies, real GDP growth
averaged 3.2 percent per annum over the period 2006-2008, permitting a modest recovery in real
GDP per capita income, which grew by 1.2 percent on average over the same period.

13.     However, a succession of domestic and external shocks in 2008 and 2009 has led to
lower real GDP growth underscoring the vulnerability of the economy to exogenous shocks.
The economy remains undiversified, with diamonds and timber accounting for over 80 percent of
exports. As a result, CAR's economy is highly vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. Already
constrained by infrastructure bottlenecks and a poor business environment, economic growth has
been further hindered by a series of exogenous shocks in 2008 and early 2009. First the
breakdown of the major hydro-power plant, followed by the worldwide price hike for food and
fuel, and then the global financial crisis and recession. These events led to a marked slowdown in
growth. Real GDP growth slowed to 2.0 percent in 2008 from 3.7 percent in 2007. The global
economic crisis affected the CAR economy primarily through the export channel. Low external
demand and a steep fall in prices caused timber and diamond exports to contract sharply in 2009,
with dampening effects on revenues and related activities. Timber production fell by 37 percent,
exports declined by 29 percent in volume terms and revenues were reduced by more than 37
percent; while production and export of diamonds declined by 18 percent. As a result, real GDP
growth is estimated to have decreased from 2.0 percent in 2008 to 1.7 percent in 2009, an overall
reduction of real GDP of 1.5 percentage points compared to the period 2006-2008.

                                                5 
 
14.     Real sector growth in 2009 was driven mainly by agriculture, with estimated growth
of 3.2 percent, compensating somewhat for the negative external shocks. Owing to the
gradual improvements in security in the producing areas and good weather conditions,
production of both food and cash crops has rebounded. In the case of cash crops, for instance, the
authorities' estimates for 2009 indicate that 2,800 tons of cotton and 4,300 tons of coffee were
harvested compared to 950 tons and 3,473 tons respectively in 2008. Growth has also been
robust in the service sector, averaging 3.0 percent in 2008 and 3.5 percent in 2009. Growth in
manufacturing is projected to slow from 5.5 percent in 2008 to 3.0 percent in 2009; real output
growth in the secondary sectors remains severely constrained by power shortages and poorly
maintained infrastructure.

15.     The authorities have taken a number of measures in an effort to mitigate the impact
of the global recession on the forestry sector. They have revised downward the mercurial and
Free on Track (FOT) values on which the stumpage fees, reforestation tax, and exit duties are
based, and spread the payment of the surface area taxes over nine months as opposed to an
upfront payment at the beginning of the fiscal year. These measures have resulted in a significant
loss of forestry revenues (fees and taxes), estimated at 37 percent compared to their 2008 level.
However, while signs of a recovery are emerging, the forestry sector remains fragile and
expectations of a sustained recovery in 2010 are uncertain. As part of additional measures taken
in the 2010 budget law to further assist the forestry sector, exit duties have been temporarily
reduced from 11.5 percent to 8 percent for timbers and form 8 percent to 5 percent for sawn
woods.

External Balance

16.    As timber and diamonds account for over 80 percent of exports, developments on
these two commodities largely determine export performance. Low external demand coupled

                                                  6 
 
with declining timber and diamond prices, and the pronounced deterioration in the terms of trade
arising from the sharp increase in the unit price of imports, caused the current account deficit to
worsen from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008. However, significant
inflows of FDI and short term private capital contributed to a decline in the overall balance of
payments deficit from 3.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2008. As a result,
international reserves did not fall as expected and stabilized around 3.2 months of imports at end-
2008 compared to 2.4 months of imports in 2007.

17.     The current account balance improved in 2009 owing in part to a reversal in the
terms of trade. The deficit on the services account stabilized at its level in 2008. Reflecting
lower interest payments on public debt, the deficit on the income account improved slightly.
Similarly, the current transfers account improved as a result of higher program grants. As a result
of these developments and improvements in the terms of trade arising from the fall in world oil
prices and the recovery in diamond prices, the current account deficit is estimated to have
narrowed from 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 7.7 percent of GDP in 2009. Moreover,
owing to the recent augmentation of access under the PRGF program of SDR 25 million, the
additional allocation of SDR 44 million and donor inflows toward the end of the year, gross
official reserves rose to 4.1 months of imports cover in 2009 from 3.2 months in 2008.

Fiscal performance

18.    Fiscal management has improved markedly since 2006 although the ratio of
domestic revenue to GDP remains low, at 10.8 percent of GDP in 2009. Despite the global
economic crisis, the tax revenue ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points to 8.7 percent of GDP
in 2009, sustaining a steady increase since 2006. The overall sustained improvement in the tax
revenue ratio has been made possible by the reform of petroleum sector taxation, which has
emerged as a major source of government revenue, and more effective revenue administration.
The implementation of these structural reforms has helped make the budget more resilient to
negative shocks. Still, CAR's domestic revenue ratio remains very low; it compares to the
average of 17.4 percent for fragile countries and 22.7 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa in 2009.

19.     In response to the global economic slowdown fiscal policy in 2009/10 is geared to
supporting aggregate demand while preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability. Total
expenditure in 2009, estimated at about 13.8 percent of GDP, has been lower than initially
programmed. Wages and salaries, representing about 4.2 percent of GDP, account for a large
share of expenditure but also include repayment of wage arrears accumulated under the current
regime. The Government has continued to pay current salaries on time and a substantial amount
of salary arrears accumulated under the current regime has been cleared (1.1 percent of GDP in
2009). However, domestically-financed capital expenditures were significantly delayed; and,
although the revised budget adopted by Parliament in September 2009 included new
expenditures related to the DDR process and the 2010 elections, the bulk of the planned spending
was postponed into 2010. As a result, the domestic primary balance posted a surplus projected at
1.5 percent of GDP in 2009 rather that the deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP expected in the IMF-
supported program. Against this background, fiscal policy is expected to be moderately
expansionary in 2010, with the domestic primary deficit projected at 1.5 percent of GDP.

20.     The primary focus of the fiscal expansion will be on the expenditure side. In
particular, priority spending is projected to increase in the 2010 budget. The main priorities
include the implementation of the peace process, with a focus on the DDR program, the
organization of elections, the payment of government utility consumption, and an expansion of
public investment to provide basic services to the population. The Government is also expected
to continue to clear outstanding salary arrears as well as arrears to suppliers. Limited resources
will make it hard for the government to sustain its planned expenditure program. Difficult trade-
offs will be required as the government strives to implement its poverty reduction strategy while

                                                8 
 
expanding expenditure to meet other commitments. Sustaining the expansion of public
investment, particularly in infrastructure, health and education, will be critical given the large
deficits in these areas and the high incidence of poverty.

21.     The CRW resources will enhance the Government's ability to protect spending in
the priority sectors to help cushion the impact of the crisis on vulnerable households and
the poor. A key government objective is to increase priority spending by 5 percent in real terms
in 2010. The CRW resources will support these efforts and help the government achieve its
objective. The focus will be on spending in sectors related to the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), including health, education, water and sanitation, agriculture and rural development,
social protection, and infrastructure. Emphasis will be placed on priority investment projects
included in the 2010 capital budget, removing key bottlenecks on the budget execution chain,
enhancing government capacity to implement investment projects, and improving the efficiency
and effectiveness of spending by strengthening the public financial management system and
ameliorating the quality of governance.

Inflation, Monetary and Financial Sector policies

22.     After a sharp increase in 2008 inflationary pressures eased substantially in 2009.
The domestic and external shocks that hit the CAR economy in 2008 led not only to a marked
slowdown in growth and a higher current account deficit; it also caused inflation to accelerate.
CAR inflation picked up in 2008 to an annual average of 9.3 percent from 0.9 percent in 2007,
reflecting the rise of food and fuel prices. As a member of CEMAC, CAR's monetary policy is
determined by the regional Central Bank (BEAC), whose priorities are the control of inflation
and the maintenance of the regional currency peg to the Euro. Inflationary pressures have eased
as a result of the increase in food production and declining international energy and food prices.
Reflecting these favorable conditions, year-on-year consumer price inflation fell to -1.2 percent
at end-2009 from 14.5 percent at end-2008. Average inflation declined to 3.5 percent in 2009,

                                                        9 
 
moderately above the CEMAC convergence criterion. A return to modest inflation rates should
help sustain external competitiveness and improve living conditions.

23.     The impact of the global economic crisis on CAR's financial sector has been limited,
reflecting mainly the fact that CAR is less integrated into global financial markets. The
banking system has not been directly affected by the global crisis, and the liquidity position of
most commercial banks appears adequate. Although indirect effects on major economic
operators and repercussions on commercials banks cannot be ruled out, sovereign risk is the
main threat on the banking sector stability. At end-2009, the government used part of the general
SDR allocation from the IMF to reduce its most expensive obligations to the commercial banks,
thus saving on the interest bill for additional expenditure in priority sectors. However,
commercial banks still hold considerable amounts and, hence, remain vulnerable to government
default risk; the financial program envisages further commercial debt repayments. As a first step
of its strategy the Government consolidated past loans and signed in August 2009 new
conventions with each of the four domestic commercial banks, reducing its debt service burden,
clarifying relations with commercial banks, and helping banks meet limits on single customer
exposure. In view of the strong effect of the crisis on the financial sector in other countries, the
Government has also taken steps to better supervise banks and other financial institutions4.

External and Domestic Debt

24.     In June 2009 CAR reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC
initiative which, together with the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), provided
significant debt relief. Total debt reduction granted to CAR amounted to around
CFAF 560 billion in nominal terms (59 percent of GDP), a large part of which was provided at
the completion point, allowing a reduction of CAR's external debt to about CFAF 90 billion by
the end of 2009. The NPV of external public and guarantee debt has declined from 41 percent of
GDP in 2007 to 10.7 percent of GDP in 2009. The total debt owed by the CAR to Paris Club
creditors was reduced from US$59.3 million to US$3.7 million in September 2009. The
Government continues to focus on efforts to reach agreements with all bilateral creditors on debt
relief consistent with the terms of the HIPC completion point and comparable to Paris Club
treatment5.

25.    The stock of domestic debt has been reduced from 23.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to
19.4 percent of GDP in 2009 following adoption by the Government of a domestic arrears-
clearance plan. Domestic public debt consists of outstanding credits to the government from
domestic commercial banks (6.5 percent), government debt with the central bank of central
                                                            
4
 Due to poor management one local bank, which is part of a regional group and in which the government holds a 10
percent stake, was placed under provisional administration in November 2009. Discussions are under way with
COBAC, the regional bank supervisor, to resolve the situation and prepare for recapitalization.
5
  All multilateral creditors except the Central African States Development Bank, International Fund for Agricultural
Development, and the OPEC Fund have provided debt relief. Agreements were already signed with Austria, Italy,
Switzerland, U.S.A., France, Germany, and Japan for Paris Club creditors. Agreements were signed with Saudi
Arabia, France Telecom, and GERBER Company for non-Paris Club creditors. The signature by Assistance
Publique des Hôpitaux is expected soon; negotiations continue with other creditors.



                                                               10 
 
African states (BEAC, 37 percent), budgetary arrears (52 percent), public enterprise debt (4.5
 percent), and nonbanks (0.1 percent). Resources from the European Union and France as well as
the use of part of the SDR allocation helped the government repay about 2 percent of GDP in
domestic arrears in 2009, including salary arrears and the unpaid bills of small and medium
enterprises. Domestic arrears clearance is among the government's priority spending and the
2010 budget provides for the continued payment of these arrears.

26.     The Government has continued to take steps to improve debt management. A
computerized Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) is now operational in
the Debt Department at the Ministry of Finance and can produce external debt reports. The
capacity of the Debt Department has been reinforced through the recruitment of new staff and
training by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on the use and
maintenance of DMFAS. A comprehensive debt database, covering domestic and external debt,
has been established and is being maintained. The debt records in the database contain data on
domestic, external, and guaranteed debt of the central government in a format that follows
international standards. To improve the coordination and monitoring of the government's debt
policy, a Presidential decree established the National Committee for Public Debt (NCPD) in
April 2009. In line with its debt strategy after the HIPC completion point, the Government is
committed to keep a zero ceiling on new non-concessional debt to avoid excessive debt
accumulation.

C.  MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS 
27.    After a marked slowdown in 2008 and 2009 growth is expected to revert to a more
expansionary path in 2010, on account of (i) infrastructure rehabilitation, including hydro
power plants and feeder roads as well as the launching of rehabilitation works on the Bangui-
Douala corridor; (ii) diminishing effects of the impact of the global slowdown; (iii)
implementation of the DDR program and security sector reforms enabling the reintegration of
ex-combatants and the return of refugees to their communities; and (iv) the effects of
countercyclical fiscal policies. As a result of these trends, real GDP growth is projected to
increase to 3.3 percent in 2010 from 1.7 percent in 2009. Average inflation is expected to remain
low, helped by stable food and fuel prices. Improved growth prospects and lower inflation,
projected at 2.0 percent, will help to support the peace process and maintain political stability in
the run-up to the general elections. The current account deficit is expected to stabilize at about 8
percent of GDP. The overall balance of payments will record a large deficit, which will
contribute to reduce international reserves in the absence of additional external support.

28.     Over the medium term, sustaining growth at higher levels would require restoring
security throughout the country and addressing the most binding constraints to growth,
which are reflected in poorly developed infrastructure (mostly in the energy and transport
sectors), weak financial intermediation, limited human capacity, and a poor business
environment. First, fiscal resources for public infrastructure investments need to be found
through increased efficiency, stronger tax revenue performance, and through an appropriate mix
of grant and concessional borrowing. Second, the Government needs to strengthen financial
intermediation and develop human capital; and, third, the government needs to improve the
business environment through measures to significantly reduce the cost of doing business.


                                                11 
 
29.     The Government's macroeconomic framework and structural reform agenda are
geared toward addressing the binding constraints to accelerated economic growth and
poverty reduction in the medium-term. Growth performance is expected to improve from 2.5
percent on average over 2007-2009 to 4.1 percent on average in 2010-2012. Growth in the
primary sector is expected to recover in 2010 owing to a gradual recovery in the forestry and
mining sectors and to remain robust in 2011and 2012 as external demand strengthens. The
distribution of seeds and small equipments to coffee and cotton farmers envisaged by the
Government will help farmers improve cash crops production. Growth in the secondary sector is
expected to pick up in 2010 after a decline in 2009 due to a drop in manufacturing. Public works
for road maintenance and rehabilitation, and the rehabilitation of power plants will be important
sources of growth in this sector. An anticipated growth rate of 3.8 percent in services, including a
significant contribution from the telecommunication sector (4.2 percent), is expected to underpin
growth in the tertiary sector, projected at about 3.4 percent in 2010-2012. The average inflation
rate, expected to moderate to about 2.0 percent in 2010 as a result of the sharp decrease in food
and fuel prices, will remain stable at around 2.5 percent in 2012.

30.     The investment-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise from 11 percent on average in 2007-
09 to 12.6 percent in 2010-12. Supported by sound macroeconomic policies and an
improvement in institutional and administrative capacity, public investment in infrastructure and
social sectors would increase in line with GDP growth. Private investment will remain relatively
modest, at 6.5 percent of GDP on average during 2010-2012, as the business environment
improves slowly. Private investment in forestry, mining and telecommunication is expected to
increase in response to the recovery in global demand and the improved regulatory environment
in the sectors.

31.     The Government is expected to continue to pursue prudent fiscal policies to
maintain macroeconomic stability and support economic growth. On the revenue side, the
Government will continue its efforts to broaden the tax base through tax policy reforms and
improvements in tax and customs administration. Domestic revenue is expected to increase from
10.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 10.8 percent in 2011 and 11.1 percent in 2012. On the
expenditure side, the Government intends to pursue PFM reforms to improve the efficiency,
quality and transparency of public expenditure while continuing to maintain tight control over
the level of public spending. The fiscal policy framework envisages a domestic primary deficit of
1.5 percent of GDP in 2010 as the Government pursues a countercyclical fiscal policy to stabilize
demand through an increase in public spending to mitigate the effects of the global economic
crisis. As a result, the overall fiscal balance (including grants) is projected to switch to a deficit
of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2010 from a surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP in 2009. The domestic
primary balance is projected to be in equilibrium in 2011 and to post a small surplus in 2012 as
current expenditures on the elections and the peace process are curtailed.

32.     The external current account deficit is projected to remain stable, at an average of
8.1 percent of GDP over 2010-12. Export volumes are expected to rebound in 2010 after the
sharp contraction in 2009, as world demand recovers steadily. However, imports are also
expected to increase as the government implements its public investment program and spending
on the peace process accelerates. As a result the trade deficit is projected to increase; however,
current transfers to support the peace process are expected to increase strongly, which will help

stabilize the current deficit at 7.9 percent of GDP. The current account deficit is projected to
widen to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2011 and 8.1 percent of GDP in 2012 as imports continue to rise
on account of the public investment program and as current transfers decline from their high
level in 2010. In addition to official development assistance, the current account deficits are
expected to be financed by foreign direct investment, and regional capital inflows from the future
regional securities market. Donors are also expected to provide additional concessional financing
to cover residual needs projected to average 1.3 percent of GDP in 2010-12.

33.     In summary, CAR's macroeconomic framework provides an adequate basis for the
proposed operation. Despite suffering a succession of shocks in 2008 and 2009, CAR has
avoided major macroeconomic imbalances. The Government has generally demonstrated a
satisfactory track record in maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies that are sustainable over
the medium term. However, this framework is subject to significant downside risks. Political
uncertainty over the presidential and legislative elections and continued security concerns could
hamper donor support and investor confidence. A prolonged impact of the global economic crisis
on exports could lead to slower growth, lower revenue, and deterioration in debt indicators.
Moreover, insufficient investments in infrastructure, such as roads and electricity, could cause
delays in private sector investment projects that are needed to boost the CAR economy and
create jobs. Mitigating factors are CAR's recent track record in macroeconomic management,
which has been strong in response to exogenous shocks. The Government's focus on growth
enhancing structural reforms as part of its poverty reduction strategy, and support provided by
donors, including through the proposed operation, will help to address the new challenges
emerging from the global slowdown.

34.     The most recent joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis, dated April
2010, indicates a moderate risk of debt distress for CAR. Indicators are particularly sensitive
to export growth, indicating that diversifying the export base is essential for preserving external
debt sustainability. The debt sustainability analysis shows that CAR could breach the policy-
related threshold for the PV of external debt-to-exports ratio in the most extreme scenario. The
analysis recommends that CAR should maintain the minimum concessionality requirement for
future borrowing. The public debt indicators are vulnerable to slower GDP growth and an
increase in debt-creating flows, confirming that CAR needs to pursue prudent fiscal policies over
the medium-term and to consolidate the basis for growth.

D.  POVERTY OUTLOOK 
35.     Poverty incidence varies substantially across regions, with the lowest concentration in
Bangui, and the highest incidence in the Yade province (78.2 percent). The 2008 survey also
revealed that poverty incidence is stronger (by around 5 percent) in male-headed households,
which are traditionally larger than female-headed      Table 4: Poverty Incidence in 2008, by Region
households. Incidence also increases with age,                           P o v e r t y In c i d e n c e

36.      Social indicators place the CAR among the least developed countries in the world.
The 2009 UNDP Human Development Report ranks the CAR near the bottom of its Human
Development Index (179th out of 182 countries). This trend is reflected in several health
indicators: life expectancy has fallen from 50 years in the 1990s to 45 years in 2007; maternal
mortality, estimated at 543 per 100,000 live births in 2007, remains very high; the HIV/AIDS
prevalence rate, at 6.2 percent for the 15-49 age group in 2005, is high although considerably
below the double-digit rates found in a number of southern African countries; maternal and
infant mortality rates have increased over time. Current policies in the health sector aim to
refurbish health infrastructure, increase the availability and quality of basic health care, reduce
infant and maternal mortality, fight endemic diseases, and promote a multisectoral approach for
initiatives to combat HIV/AIDS.

37.     The situation in the education sector reflects the challenge of reversing the adverse
effects of decades of conflict on the education system. In 2004/05, one child out of four had
never attended school, only 31 percent of children enrolled in primary school completed primary
education and the repetition rate was high. About 62 percent of those who completed primary
education when they were young are literate today compared with 70 percent on average in other
African countries. Estimates from the last survey6 show that net enrollment rate for 6-11 years
old is 60 percent at the national level, with 73 percent in urban cities and 53 percent in rural
areas. Boys have an enrollment rate higher than girls, respectively at 65 percent and 55 percent.

38.     As the overall security and medium-term economic situation improve, there have
been positive developments in the education sector. The Government is implementing the
national education strategy (Strategie Nationale de Secteur de l'Education 2008-2020) that was
developed using a participative approach and adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2008. The
strategy covers all levels of education, from pre-school to higher education, and aims to meet the
education MDGs by 2020. On that basis, the education sector has begun to receive additional
support from the international community. A grant of US$37.8 million was conferred to CAR
from the EFA/FTI Catalytic Fund to support the first phase of implementation (2008-2011).
This constitutes the largest financial commitment to the education sector received by the CAR in
two decades. With support from the Catalytic grant and the Multisectoral HIV/AIDS, Health and
Education Emergency Support Project, about 3,000 teachers would be recruited, trained and
deployed in underserved and post-conflict areas by 2011. Using a combination of innovative
approaches (Catholic Church, the banking system, petrol stations and mobile phone companies),
teachers are being paid on a more regular basis. Schools construction and rehabilitation financed
by the Catalytic grant will also ease overcrowding, with a pupil: classroom ratio of 111 instead
of 129 in 2011. Furthermore, the distribution of textbooks will provide each child with one book
in French and one book in Mathematics.

electricity as a source of lighting; about 30 percent of the population has access to safe water;
and less than 10 percent of the population has access to improved sanitation facilities. Gender
disparities are high, and the CAR was ranked only 153 out of 177 countries in 2007 in terms of
the gender-specific human development index.

40.     As a result of these trends, the CAR will not achieve its MDGs by 2015. The public
sector's contribution to the provision of basic social services is limited and inequitable, which
adds to the vulnerability of the poor, while the private sector is ill-equipped to fill the gaps in the
provision of these basic social services.7 In its PRSP, the Government estimated the incidence of
poverty over 2006-2010 under two scenarios. Under the prudent scenario, national poverty
would decline only modestly, from an estimated 64.4 percent in 2006 to 61.3 percent in 2010.
The dynamic scenario projects a much steeper fall in poverty to 56.8 percent, as a result of
higher economic growth and a steep rise in public expenditure for the social sectors,
infrastructure, and rural development. The unexpected global downturn has, however,
contributed to a slowdown in economic growth below the rate of population growth. According
to estimations the financial crisis may have negatively affected the scale of poverty reduction by
2015 by as much as 2 percentage points in African countries.

 For example, the poorest 20 percent of households benefit from only 8 percent of public expenditure on primary
education; implicit subsidies for public utilities (water and electricity) are not pro-poor; in addition, while private
and/or community education provision has increased sharply in the last few years, the quality is generally poor and
more than 40 percent of teachers are community teachers, untrained and hired directly by families.

                                                                                16 
 
41.     Recent studies indicate that the 2008/09 global slowdown has likely worsened key
social indicators. Analysis of the effects of downturns on infant mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa
shows that a 1 percent reduction in per capita GDP is associated with a rise in infant mortality
rate of 0.34­0.48 per thousand births, or 34­39 percent of the average annual decline in the
infant mortality rate8. A poverty monitoring study9 of 13 countries, including the Central African
Republic, indicates that poor households reported cutting overall consumption in response to
income shocks to protect children's school attendance. These findings underscore the critical
importance of protecting priority sector spending and enhancing the ability of the government to
deliver services to the population, which the proposed EMGRG III seeks to address.

                                                               III.   GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
42.      CAR's first full PRSP, adopted in September 2007, sets out the government's
priority agenda over the period 2008-10. The PRSP outlines the government's vision and
priority actions for stimulating economic growth and alleviating poverty in line with the
Millennium Development Goals. The strategic framework of the PRSP is based on four pillars:
(i) restore security, consolidate peace, and prevent conflict; (ii) promote good governance and
the rule of law; (iii) rebuild and diversify the economy; and (iv) develop human capital.
Monitoring of the program takes place in the context of the PRSP annual progress reports. In
2009 the government produced the first annual progress report (APR) that assessed
implementation of the poverty reduction strategy (PRS) in 2008. The second annual progress
review, focused on 2009, took place in March 2010. This section reports on overall progress
under the PRSP four pillars, as well as on participation, coordination and monitoring
mechanisms. The four pillars and their main objectives are briefly summarized below.

43.      Pillar 1 aims to create a secure and peaceful environment, both domestically and in the
sub-region, prevent the recurrence of conflict, re-establish trust between citizens and their
institutions and ensure the successful implementation of the government's poverty reduction
strategy and policies. The government intends to address the underlying causes of the political
crisis that led to the extended conflicts and stabilize the country. Emphasis is placed on
reforming the security sector and strengthening the operational capabilities of the defense and
security forces (DSF).

44.     Pillar 2 aims to strengthen the ability of the public sector to design and implement
efficient and effective policies to realize development goals, government responsiveness and
respect for citizens and the institutions of society, and mechanisms for the peaceful transfer of
power in accordance with popular will. The government plans to enhance community
participation, undertake public sector reforms, including civil service and public finance
management reforms, intensify the fight against corruption, and promote local development.

45.     Pillar 3 aims to firmly establish the conditions conducive to a substantial and sustainable
rise in incomes and employment creating growth. Economic growth is to emanate from the
activities in which the poor participate directly so as to alleviate poverty on a sustainable basis.

Emphasis is placed on developing agriculture, ensuring a transparent management of natural
resources, pursuing the restoration and expansion of infrastructure, supporting the traditional
growth sectors of forestry and mining, developing public services, and improving the business
environment and private sector development.

46.     Finally, pillar 4 aims to strengthen the human capital of the poor by improving access to
basic education and health within a framework of equity and quality that improves their
employment opportunities and income. Emphasis is placed on achieving universal primary
education, improving the quality of secondary education, developing literacy and professional
training programs, strengthening the health care system, combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and
malaria, and developing a regulatory and institutional framework conducive to employment
creation for the population.

A.  PROGRESS IN PRSP IMPLEMENTATION 

47.     Progress in implementation of the PRSP is monitored annually by Government through
the Annual Progress Report. The first APR, covering 2008, and the Joint Staff Advisory Note
(JSAN) were presented to the Board in June 2009 at the same time as the HIPC completion point
document. The June 2009 JSAN concluded that overall, the C.A.R. made good progress in
implementing its PRS in 2008 and that the direction of its policies and programs appeared
appropriate. The second annual review, covering the year 2009 and conducted in March 2010,
was led by the Prime Minister, the Head of the PRSP's National Strategic Committee, with the
participation of cabinet ministers, development partners, and representatives of civil society and
the private sector. The review noted the detrimental impact of a series of exogenous shocks,
compounded by the global economic downturn, on the government's poverty reduction efforts
but pointed to progress across a broad range of areas under the PRSP four pillars, which allowed
CAR to attain the HIPC completion in June 2009.

48.     Developments under Pillar 1 have been marked by continued Government's efforts
to implement the recommendations of the December 2008 Inclusive Political Dialogue. In
addition, as part of the strategy to enhance the operational capacity of the Armed Forces, a round
table on security sector reform was organized in Bangui in October 2009 to define strategies for
addressing the security challenges in the country. Security sector reform is critical for sustainable
peace and security as well as for the overall stabilization of the country, and the Government
needs the support of the donor community to implement well designed security projects.

49.     Progress under the governance and the rule of law (Pillar 2) remains steady and
broad-based, building on recent achievements. To reinforce transparency, the provision of the
Constitution linked to the asset disclosure of senior government officials has been enforced.
Senior public enterprise officials as well as key senior civil servants have also complied with
their obligation of asset declaration and disclosure. Public finance reforms have continued to
advance. Following adoption of the new procurement code in 2008, the government has created a
general public procurement directorate (DGMP), charged with the overall responsibility for
public procurement policy, and a regulatory authority (ARMP) to oversee the procurement
function. In PFM, the accounting and reporting systems have been strengthened, which resulted
in the publication of quarterly budget execution reports. These first reports ever for CAR are

                                                 18 
 
based on comprehensive budget and accounting classifications and supported by a new
computerized expenditure management system.

50.     Progress under the economic reconstruction and diversification pillar has been
uneven. The government has made significant progress in improving the legal framework for
natural resource management. In the forestry sector, the adoption of the new forestry code in
October 2008 and the implementing texts in April 2009 have provided C.A.R. with a modern
legal framework. In the mining sector the mining code has been revised to address previous
weaknesses and the Government has adopted a standard form agreement. In agriculture,
achievements have included payment of arrears to cotton farmers, the provision of a range of
services (agricultural inputs and extension services) and machinery to farming families in
targeted areas; and initiation of livestock restocking and pilot programs. At the policy level, the
government has drafted a comprehensive medium-term priority action plan following the
national workshop (Etats Généraux) on agriculture, the implementation of which is expected to
take effect with the launching of the "Development Pole" project and other donor-supported
programs. In contrast, progress in improving the business environment has been slower. The
number of days needed to launch business has been reduced since the creation of the one- stop
window in August 2008; however the costs of doing business are among the highest in the sub-
region and in Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, which are deterring much needed investment.

51.     Notable progress has been made in furthering sector objectives in education and
health under pillar4. Recent achievements in education include the construction of 568 new
classrooms, the rehabilitation of existing 417 classrooms, and the distribution of learning
materials to more than 49,000 pupils and 985 teachers across the country. To improve the quality
of primary education, 600 new apprentice teachers were trained; community teachers (teachers
recruited by parent associations) have also continued to receive formal training to upgrade their
skills. These efforts are expected to reinforce the administrative and pedagogical measures
adopted by the Government to reduce the repetition rate in primary education, which fell
nationally from 28 percent in 2006/07 to 26 percent in 2007/08.

52.     In health, thanks to a multisectoral approach including the Ministry of Health and NGOs,
neonatal surveillance sites generally are reporting stable HIV prevalence rates, although rates
among young pregnant women (ages 25­29) are still high (around 10 percent) at some sites; the
target for HIV-positive mothers receiving prophylactic treatment has been achieved and the
target for HIV-infected patients receiving ARV therapy has been exceeded. Programs to combat
malaria by distributing treated mosquito nets to children under five and pregnant women
throughout the country are operational and anti-tuberculosis drugs are now available free. In
addition, with the support of donors, a major hospital in Bangui (Hopital de l'Amitié) has been
rehabilitated, 22 new community health centers have been constructed and equipped throughout
the country, and 12 existing health centers have been equipped.

B.  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS ­ PARTICIPATION, COORDINATION, 
MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
 
53.    Participation. The PRSP was prepared through an extensive participatory process
involving a broad range of stakeholders including civil society, the private sector, development

                                                19 
 
partners, and communities representing the country's seven regions.  Since then the  government
has continued to work to operationalize the institutional framework for participatory monitoring
and evaluation of implementation of the PRSP. This framework includes (i) a national strategic
committee chaired by the Prime Minister as described above; (ii) a national technical committee
responsible for maintaining a permanent dialogue within and across government departments;
(iii) a national technical secretariat, which coordinates the implementation, monitoring and
evaluation of the poverty reduction strategy (PRS); (iv) nine sectoral committees responsible for
monitoring the implementation of sectoral strategies; and (v) seven regional committees,
responsible for monitoring and evaluation at the regional and local levels.

54.     In line with its mandate, the national technical secretariat produced the first annual PRSP
progress report covering 2008 in 2009 and coordinated the second annual review of PRSP
implementation in 2009 conducted in March 2010. The annual PRS implementation review
continues to be based on a broad participatory process, which ensures the involvement of
stakeholders at the national, regional and local levels. All nine sectoral committees are now
operational and participating in national policy discussions including through the organization of
sectoral round tables which serve as platform to discuss sector priorities, challenges and needs,
assess implementation of policy reforms, and formulate recommendations for decision makers.
In 2009 sectoral round tables were organized on commerce and private sector development,
regional integration and employment, security sector reforms, and water and sanitation. Annual
reviews at the regional level, which will provide a framework to address the interests and needs
of local populations and communities, are being planned and will be at the center of the next
annual PRS review. Membership to regional committees includes representatives of civil society,
private sector, local authorities, farmers, women and the youth.

55.     Coordination. The Government coordinates with the donors operating in CAR to
harmonize the structural reform program. The General Framework for Budget Support to the
PRSP (CGAB-DSRP) agreed to in October 2009 by the Government and participating donors is
expected to improve the predictability of aid and facilitate administration of donor support. The
donors participating in this process are the African Development Bank, the European Union,
France, and the World Bank, with the IMF participating as an observer. The strategic goal of the
harmonized program is to agree on a streamlined and better focused reform agenda and support it
by technical assistance. This is expected to involve the adoption of a joint matrix of policy
actions, outlining the government's priority reform areas and measures as well as planned donor
support for the implementation of the priority policy reforms.

56.    Monitoring and Evaluation. Government's monitoring of the PRSP has continued to
improve. All sectoral committees presented substantial progress reports using a standard format
in a consultative meeting in August 2009. Such meetings play a central role in harmonizing
views between the Government, civil society and development partners. As a follow-up of the
Brussels pledging conference organized in October 2007, sectoral committees have organized
donor roundtables. The Ministry of Planning has set up and maintains a good practice aid
management system. The statistical operations that will generate most of the PRS evaluation and
tracking indicators are being implemented, with the help of donors. Most notably, the results of a
core welfare indicator survey undertaken in 2008 have allowed the government to update the
national poverty rate and poverty profile. On June 24-25, 2010, as part of preparation for the

                                                20 
 
second PRSP generation, the Government launched an independent evaluation of the first PRSP
to draw the lessons leant from the design and implementation of the 2008-2010 PRSP.


             IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM
A.  LINK TO THE CPS 

57.     The overarching aim of the FY09-12 Joint Country Partnership Strategy is to
support CAR's transition from extended instability to long-term economic recovery. More
specifically, the strategy is focused on addressing selectively key constraints to growth as well as
enhancing the policy and institutional framework to ensure that growth is widely shared. The
new joint CPS supersedes but builds on the 2007 joint Interim Strategy Note (JISN) to begin
laying the foundations for sustained and shared growth over the medium term.

58.    The CPS, which is fully aligned with the PRSP pillars and objectives, focuses on two
strategic objectives: (i) consolidating economic governance and institutional capacity to ensure
an effective management of the country's resources and create an enabling environment for
private sector development; and (ii) rehabilitating and developing infrastructure to sustain
economic growth and improve basic service delivery and the living conditions of the population.
These objectives are aligned with Pillars 2, 3, and 4 of the PRSP; they reflect the respective
comparative advantage of the World Bank and the African Development Bank and complement
support from other donors in accordance with respective institutional mandates.

59.     The proposed grant directly supports government policy reforms to rebuild basic
fiscal institutions that support a sound PFM system, strengthen economic governance and
promote private sector development by: (i) strengthening budget execution and reporting,
including public procurement, and improving revenue administration to increase domestic
revenue; (ii) strengthening economic governance in the forestry, mining and petroleum sectors;
and (iii) improving the business environment through a reduction in the cost of doing business.

B.  LINK TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS 

60.     The EMGRG III builds on a series of DPOs to support, in coordination with trust
fund-financed technical assistance projects, the government's public finance reform
program. The Reengagement and Institution-Building Support Program (RIBSUP), which
closed on November 30, 2007, was the first IDA financed DPO in CAR since the country went
into arrears in 2001. The main objective of RIBSUP was to set the stage for a meaningful
reengagement of the donor community in a sustainable way and to assist CAR in its economic
and social recovery. RIBSUP focused on restoring key functions of state planning, execution and
control, and improving governance. The operation was assessed by IEG to have satisfactorily
achieved its stated objectives. Building on the achievements of RIBSUP, two successive
Economic Management and Governance Reform Grants (EMGRG I and II) continued to support
reforms in public finance management and public sector and economic governance. EMGRG I
was approved in May 2008 and closed in May 2009. EMGRG I was rated satisfactory by IEG.
EMGRG II was approved in March 2009 and closed on March 1, 2010; it has made relatively

                                                21 
 
satisfactory progress towards its development objectives. Progress in the implementation of the
follow-on actions identified in EMGRG II is summarized in box 1.

                                                  commitment to adopt a law to protect
                                                  whistleblower in the context of the new anti-
                                                  corruption strategy, which is expected to be
                                                  adopted by Government in December 2010.

    Systematic application of the new standard Met. Since adoption of the new Mining Code in
    investment agreement forms to new investment  April 2009, 2 conventions for exploration have
                                                  been signed with international investor groups.
                                                  These conventions have been granted in
                                                  compliance with the standard form agreement.
    Implement the Government action plan to move Met. Formal negotiations with the European
    the FLEGT agenda forward                      Union on the voluntary partnership agreement
                                                  began in October 2009. There are four key phases
                                                  in the FLEGT process, each involving a number
                                                  of technical discussions. Negotiations are
                                                  currently in the third phase, dealing with the
                                                  verification and control systems. Negotiations are
                                                  expected to end in December 2010 with the
                                                  voluntary partnership agreement finalized at the
                                                  same time.

61.   Resources from the Low-Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) Trust Fund have
been instrumental in facilitating the implementation of the reform program under the
EMGRG series. Two LICUS grants have supported implementation of the EMGRG through

                                                         23 
 
technical assistance. The LICUS II grant, which closed in December 2008, provided technical
assistance to strengthen the customs and tax departments, build capacity in the Treasury
department, strengthen civil service management and payroll control system, and improve the
public procurement system. Building on LICUS II, the LICUS III grant was approved in August
2008 to provide technical assistance to deepen reforms in public finance management and public
administration and enhance governance and the business environment. Under the first
component, support has been provided to build capacity in revenue collection, budget
preparation, execution, and reporting, and in designing civil service reforms. Under the second
component, support is provided to strengthen the capacity of institutions involved in oil sector
management, revise the oil sector legislation as well as oil pricing structure and adjustment
mechanism, and strengthen capacity in oil sector administration. In addition the grant supported
the revision of the 2004 mining code, the design of a standard mining form agreement, and
capacity building in mining sector administration.

62.     The LICUS Trust Fund Resources have also been applied to promote accountability
in the security sector and strengthen demand-side governance. A portion of the LICUS II
resource envelope was committed to assist the Government in strengthening financial
management and budgetary processes to minimize leakages in the security sector and related
agencies. A public financial management review of the security sector conducted in 2009 has
provided a careful analysis of security sector expenditures in relation to (i) predictability and
control in budget execution, (ii) accounting, recording and reporting, (iii) external scrutiny and
audit, (iv) budget comprehensiveness and transparency, (v) and policy-based budgeting. On the
basis of this review training activities will be designed for civilian and military personnel geared
toward improving financial management practices in the security sector. Another sub-component
of LICUS II seeks to improve state accountability through enhancing communication channels
between the central Government in the capital Bangui and the population throughout the national
territory. Specifically, this activity seeks to rehabilitate the country's primary link between
Bangui and the rest of the country ­ the radio - by strengthening the national radio's rural
presence and its capabilities for national broadcasting. In addition to increasing the flow of
information on government policies to rural areas this activity also aims to create entry points to
strengthen voice by empowering local communities to express their views and needs.

63.      The development policy loans and technical assistance projects are playing an
important role in efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the Bank portfolio in CAR. The
DPOs contribute to the Bank portfolio by (i) providing space in the government budget for
priority sector spending; (ii) strengthening overall public financial management and effectiveness
of public spending; (iii) supporting transparency and accountability; and (iv) promoting
institutional development, including enabling mechanisms for improving government efficiency
and for ameliorating service delivery. The current portfolio consists of two regional projects and
5 sectoral projects as follows:

 The CEMAC Transport and Transit Facilitation Project, which aims to secure access to
 landlocked countries, enhance regional integration and increase trade in the CEMAC
 countries.




                                                24 
 
 The CEMAC Africa Backbone, which aims to support population, businesses and
 governments across the central African region to have access to quality and affordable ICT
 services by lowering the cost of international broadband capacity, and extending the reach of
 backbone networks.

 The Emergency Response to the Food Crisis Project which (i) implements safety net
 programs to finance/subsidize public works or cash/food-for-work for small subprojects; (ii)
 and coordinates school feeding programs with WFP, targeting students from vulnerable
 households in urban and rural areas.

 The Emergency Energy Project which aims to (i) rehabilitate hydropower generation; (ii)
 improve collection and prevent waste of energy; (iii) introduce efficient lightening device to
 reduce peak demand; and (iv) implement a loss Reduction Program.

 The Education For All - Fast Track Initiative Education Sector Development Project,
 designed to support the implementation of the first phase of the Government's national
 education strategy (2008-2011), aims to improve access to better quality primary education.

 Support to Vulnerable Groups Community Development Project focuses on rehabilitating
 social infrastructure and improving the capacity of local stakeholders to plan and manage
 local recovery in targeted areas of CAR.

 The Emergency Urban Infrastructure Project (PURISU), which assists the Government of
 CAR in rapidly rehabilitating, restoring, improving and expanding sustainable access to basic
 infrastructure services to the population of the most deprived districts of Bangui. IDA is now
 working to provide additional financing, particularly to help with flood recovery and
 mitigation. The EMGRG III and the PURISU additional financing are both part of a
 concerted donor effort to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis.

 In addition to the above, IFC's Conflict Affected States in Africa (CASA) and Ventures
 Programs are being developed to support investment climate reforms and the local SME
 sector.

C.  COORDINATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS 

64.     A limited number of key donors are active in the CAR, with a broadly low level of
budget support and overall development assistance. The European Union (EU), International
Monetary Fund (IMF), African Development Bank (AfDB), France and United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) are providing support in a number of areas, including public
finance management, justice sector reforms, and private sector development. The World Bank
coordinates closely with the Fund reviews to ensure consistency in the macroeconomic and
structural policy programs of the Bank's development policy operations, the Poverty Reduction
Grant Facility (PRGF) and its successor arrangement, the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).

65.    In 2009, several donors provided budget support to assist the government in
mitigating the impact of the financial crisis, including the IMF, EU and IDA. The IMF

                                              25 
 
provided an additional SDR 19.5 million as part of the access augmentation of 25.1 million SDR
under the PRGF. This extra financing added to the increased access (SDR 8.354 million) decided
in mid-2008 in response to the food crisis. The European Union provided 4.6 million Euros as
part of the response to the food crisis, 7.6 million Euros as part of the FLEX-Vulnerability
program (V-FLEX 2009), and 4.325 million Euros from ASERCA II (Appui à la Stabilisation
Economique en RCA), for a total of 16.525 million Euros in budget aid operations.

66.   The proposed operation has been elaborated in close consultation with the donor
community active in the CAR. There has been extensive consultation with the donor
community, in particular the IMF, UNDP, EU, AfDB and France to ensure coordination and
harmonization on the response to the financial crisis.

67.      The operation has been elaborated around the General Framework for Budget
Support to the PRSP (CGAB-DRSP) agreed in 2010 to mobilize donors around a streamlined
and better focused reform agenda. This framework is part of the broader effort of improving
coordination and effectiveness in the provision of budget support between the World Bank,
European Union and African Development Bank (with the IMF as an observer) within the
Common Approach Paper to the provision of Budget Support in Situation of Fragility (CAP)
initiative, launched in 2008. This is also in line with the Paris Declaration (2005) and the Accra
Agenda for Action (2008), which call for aid to be more effective in fragile situations, pointing at
budget support as a mechanism that lowers transaction costs, increases national ownership and
addresses the recurrent cost issue of development projects. The CGAB-DSRP approach also
aims to improve the effectiveness of donor support and coordination, addressing the issues
highlighted during the CAR consultations within the International Dialogue Progress (which
follows up the Accra 2008 Round Table 7) held in Bangui in July 2009.

68.     The IMF issued a Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) in May 2009, the staff
report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation in January 2010, a technical assistance report in


                                                26 
 
December 2009, and a report on Public Financial Management reforms11 in January 2010. In
2009 CAR has undergone successfully the fourth and fifth reviews of the PRGF, which led to the
disbursements of SDR 14.2 million in June 2009, and SDR 11.6 million in December 2009. The
IMF and IDA are coordinating closely reforms in Public Finance Management, support to
priority sectors, and support to reforms in the petroleum industry within the sixth and last review
of the ECF carried out in March 2010, which will bring an additional financing of SDR 8.7
million. The IMF is preparing the successor arrangement to the current ECF, which is expected
to begin in September 2010. The new ECF will continue to be the Fund's main tool for medium-
term financial support to CAR and aims at providing an enhanced flexibility in program design
features, and more focused and streamlined conditionality. The IMF and the Bank carried out a
joint debt sustainability analysis in April 2010.

69.     AfDB and the Association completed a joint Country Partnership Strategy in 2009. AfDB
has recently approved a program supporting the rehabilitation of rural infrastructures in CAR's
development poles. A new AfDB program to support public finance management reforms,
governance and improvement of business climate is under preparation to provide resources
starting in 2011.

70.     Building on the 2009-2011 ASERCA II program, the European Union will provide
grant resources in 2010 of 5 million Euros. Furthermore, as in 2009, CAR is eligible for an
additional 2010 allocation from the Vulnerability Flex Mechanism of 13 million Euros. The V-
FLEX is a short-term instrument supporting the most vulnerable countries to cope with the
impact of the global financial and economic crisis and to mitigate its social consequences.
Amounts are paid in the form of budget support and are aimed at reducing financing gaps with
the objective to maintain the level of public spending in priority sectors without compromising
macroeconomic stability. EU has recently issued a report on the fiscal management of the
forestry sector and is currently negotiating a Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade
voluntary partnership agreement (EU, FLEGT, VPA) with the CAR. ASERCA III is being
planned for 2012-2014.

71.     UNDP is actively engaged on the evaluation of the 2008-2010 PRSP and preparing for
the successor PRSP II. The United Nations Peace building Fund has allocated 20 million dollars
(in addition to US$10 million provided in 2009) to support peace building projects that will
assist in consolidating the peace process (including support investment in the security sector,
return of internally displaced people, and support to a new human rights commission). With
respect to funding for the elections, the UN indicates that an amount of US$16.5 million has
been secured (including pledges from the EU of US$8.8 million, and the Peace Consolidation
Fund of US$1.5 million, and contributions from UNDP and France for about US$1 million). As
one of the measures to support the electoral process UNDP has been accompanying the ongoing
process of Demilitarization, Demobilization and Reintegration. The UNDP is also actively
engaged in monitoring CAR's progress toward the MDGs as well as providing support to the
Government's decentralization policy.

72.     France provides technical assistance on capacity building in public and financial
management through a number of long-term experts supporting the staff of the Budget and
Treasury departments. AFD supports, in close coordination with the Association, the
rehabilitation of the Boali power generation.

D.  ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS 

73.      The EMGRG III is supported by a broad range of existing and ongoing economic
and sector work covering most aspects of the operation. Key existing analytical work
includes the CFAA, PEFA (both in FY08) and the Country Procurement Issues Paper (FY06) in
the area of public financial management; the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS, 2007),
and the World Bank Doing Business report on CAR. Ongoing analytical work includes the
Country Environmental Analysis, the Diamond Sector Review, and the Poverty Assessment
mentioned earlier. These studies, carried out in close cooperation with other donors, identified
critical steps in the short and medium-term for the reform process. A Public Expenditure Review
(PER), which will provide a detailed analysis of the expenditure chain, is planned for FY11/12.

74.      The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability (PEFA). The CFAA was finalized in October 2007. This report
identified a series of deficiencies and shortcomings in the CAR's public financial management
system. It includes a global action plan and recommendations to improve the legal and
institutional framework, budget and expenditures management, and customs and tax
administration. The PEFA exercise (FY08) pointed to weaknesses in financial accountability
arrangements in the public sector, including the absence of budget execution reports as well as
budget execution laws, and Government accounts incorporating extra-budgetary expenditures.
The PEFA underscored the need for redressing weaknesses in the accounting system as well as
the need for exhaustive and harmonized accounting and budget nomenclatures. Lastly, the PEFA
emphasized the need for a forward-looking budget to support in a sustained manner policy
priorities spelled out in the PRSP. The public finance management reform areas included in the
EMGRG I & II focused on improving budget execution and reporting, enhancing the efficiency
and transparency of government operations, and improving domestic revenue mobilization. The
EMGRG III builds on these efforts and focuses on improving the efficiency of budget execution
procedures, enhancing revenue administration, and strengthening the external oversight of
budget execution.

75.     Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS). The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study
(DTIS; FY07) examined the constraints to regional and international trade integration. It
identified the dire situation of the country's public finances, in particular the low level of tax
revenues, as one of the significant problems that affect the country's competitiveness through its
impact on infrastructure. The EMGRG II explicitly focused on the need to improve government
capacity to mobilize domestic revenue, through improved tax administration, including
especially improvements in tax and customs management through the alignment of the National
and Regional Investment Charters as recommended by the DTIS. The EMGRG III will continue
to support these efforts.




                                               28 
 
76.     Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP). A CPIP was completed in April 2006. It
included an assessment of the country's public procurement system and outlined an action plan
to improve and align procurement processes with internationally-recognized standards.12 Actions
recommended in the CPIP included the adoption of a new procurement code with regulations for
standard bidding documents, and the establishment of new procurement institutions. Since then,
a new Procurement Code has been adopted, all legal texts and documents to render the Code
operational have also been adopted, and key procurement institutions have been established. The
proposed EMGRG III builds on the preceding operations and continues to support the
Government's efforts to improve the efficiency of the new procurement procedures, strengthen
the capacity of line ministries in procurement, and consolidate the legal framework to provide
incentives to the private sector to participate in public biddings with a view to improve the
execution rate of the capital budget.

77.      Country Environmental Analysis. The proposed EMGRG III is guided by the ongoing
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) being conducted by IDA in collaboration with the
Government, development partners and civil society organizations. The CEA will consist of
three elements, focusing on (i) the costs and principal sources of environmental degradation, (ii)
institutional capacity for environmental management, (iii) and priority sectors in which to
strengthen policies, build institutions and invest for sustainable growth. The priority sectors
addressed in the CEA were identified by the Government in collaboration with development
partners and civil society stakeholders.

78.     Diamond Sector Review: This study assesses the extent of fraud and suggests avenues
for improving transparency in the sector. Based on preliminary results, illicit diamond activities
generate more than 40 percent in financial losses to the State and noticeably involve all types of
internal and external actors. Moreover, the study has revealed some inherent problems with the
international Kimberley Process, in which companies enroll on a voluntary basis. The
traceability mechanism for diamonds of Central Africa's origin is grossly inadequate especially
on major international markets. With increased interest in a variety of minerals, efforts to
improve transparency and accountability by all actors in the mining sector as a whole have been
made evident with the Government undertaking several initiatives linked to its official
participation in EITI, including organizing workshops and open dialogue with civil society. The
EITI International Secretariat visited CAR in November 2009, in support of the country's efforts
to implement EITI standards. One unique and striking feature of EITI in CAR is the availability
of diamond revenue information in the local language, hence facilitating access by the
population. This is the result of effective donor coordination on EITI implementation in the
country. CAR is expected to become EITI compliant at the end of 2010. The 2nd EITI report has
set to capture revenues generated from artisanal exploitation of gold in addition to the traditional
diamond activities. The proposed EMGRG III will support the preparation and dissemination of
the second EITI report.

   CAR's procurement system had last been assessed in February 2003, with financing from the EC. This earlier
assessment had recommended the need for significant reforms given the extent of the problems uncovered. A draft
procurement code was prepared, but was not adopted as many government institutions believed it was not adapted to
national circumstances.

                                                               29 
 
79.     Petroleum Sector Review. In 2007, the Government enacted a new law creating a
petroleum sector regulatory agency, "l'Agence de Stabilisation et de Régulation des Prix des
Produits Pétroliers (ASRP)", in charge of import and distribution of oil, supervision of the
sector's quality of products and services while ensuring it became open, transparent and
competitive. A new firm was created for the storage of oil products, "Société Centrafricaine de
Stockage de Produits Pétroliers (SOCASP)", with public/private participation in its capital
(51/49 percent). ASRP was put in charge of implementing an automatic quarterly petroleum
product pricing mechanism, to ensure a pass-through of world oil price variations to consumers,
and to ensure that it is appropriately staffed and financed through access to a portion of the
revenue thus generated. In 2009 the Government initiated a review of the exiting body of legal
and regulatory rules and procedures, with a view to ensure consistency with the 2007 Law. The
stated objective is to adopt a legislation that is in conformity with international best practice in
order to prevent collusion among operators, increase competition, ensure that only quality
products are imported and delivered to consumers throughout the country at a fair price, and to
combat smuggling, product adulteration and fiscal fraud. This is the next step that the
Government had committed to take during the preparation of the EMGRG II, including
continuing the capacity building effort of the new staff hired by the ASRP to enhance the
Agency's competency to monitor and regulate the petroleum sector. Building on the EMGRG II
and LICUS III, the proposed operation will support the Government's efforts to continue the
ongoing work and substantially strengthen the regulatory framework in the oil sector.

on businesses at ten stages of a typical business's life cycle: Starting a business, Dealing with
construction permits, Employing workers, Registering property, Getting credit, Protecting
investors, Paying taxes, Trading across borders, Enforcing contracts and Closing a business.13
CAR ranked 183rd out of 183 countries in the Doing Business 2010 and has continued to
maintain low rankings across all indicators. Against this background the World Bank Investment
Climate Advisory Services Department called for comprehensive reforms in the business laws
and regulations to bring significant improvement in the business environment and the Doing
Business indicators. It recommended reforms in all ten Doing Business areas and noted that
successful implementation of the suggested reforms will send a clear message that Central
African Republic is increasing its competitiveness, which will improve investor perceptions and
encourage investment and job creation. The government has responded positively by setting up a
high-level "Doing Business Committee" charged with monitoring reforms in this area. The
proposed EMGRG III will support reforms aimed at reducing the cost of doing business in two
areas: starting a business and transferring a property to promote the development of small and
medium enterprises.

  The Doing Business methodology has its limitations. Other areas important to business--such as a country's
proximity to large markets, the quality of its infrastructure services (other than those related to trading across
borders), the security of property from theft and looting, the transparency of government procurement,
macroeconomic conditions or the underlying strength of institutions--are not measured directly by Doing Business.

E.  LESSONS LEARNED 

81.     In post conflict situations, the reform agenda should be sharply focused and well
sequenced and technical assistance should be available to support the implementation of reforms.
A Development Policy Operation is an effective instrument for addressing key issues critical for
restoring a functional government. It contributes to setting the stage for medium-term reforms,
and facilitates donor coordination. Technical assistance should be available to help the
Government implement the reform program and build up capacity in key areas for improving
government effectiveness. Funding for technical assistance should be readily available. Close
dialogue should be maintained at all times, through frequent supervision missions, field presence
and use of videoconferences.

82.    Donors should work closely together and, if at all possible, use the same instruments
around the government's reform program, providing predictable support. The policy matrix
developed for EMGRG I was used by the AfDB and the Bank, and other donors provided timely
technical assistance to ensure implementation of the program. The General Framework for
Budget Support to the PRSP agreed recently between the Government and donors operating in
CAR will help improve the predictability of aid and facilitate the administration of donor
support.

83.     After a long period of economic mismanagement and internal conflicts, the priority is to
restore the basic functions of government. With the return of peace, the population has high
expectations that long repressed basic needs will be met. Managing expectations is essential, as
resources are extremely limited.

84.    The risk of falling back into conflict remains high if the Government does not sustain its
recovery efforts. Reaching the HIPC completion point was a strong incentive for moving the
reform agenda. The risk now is that the Government may slow down the reform process. Much
remains to be done in CAR to generate strong economic growth and improve social outcomes.
Continued and predictable budget support from the international community is needed to help
the Government continue and deepen its reform program.

           V. THE PROPOSED THIRD ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND
                       GOVERNANCE REFORM GRANT

A.  DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION 

85.     The proposed EMGRG III continues supporting and further deepening the reform
program developed under the EMGRG I and II, with the aim to improve transparency and
efficiency in managing public resources. As mentioned earlier, it also begins the process of
expanding the program to cover private sector development, focusing on improving the business
environment through targeted measures. More specifically, the objectives of the proposed grant
are to improve transparency and efficiency in the management of public resources and promote
private sector development through reforms aimed at: (i) strengthening budget execution and
reporting as well as public procurement, and improving revenue administration to increase
domestic revenue, with the view to expand public investment in priority sectors; (ii)
strengthening the regulatory framework in the forestry, mining and petroleum sectors so that they
can continue to be a source of sustainable growth, employment and incomes; and (iii) improving
the business environment by reducing the cost of doing business.

86.     The proposed EMGRG III supports two of the four pillars of the PRSP: (i) good
governance and the rule of the law, and (ii) rebuilding and diversifying the economy. It supports
reforms in three key areas: (a) developing a sound public finance management system; (b)
strengthening public sector and economic governance; and (c) private sector development. The
resources of the grant will support the Government's efforts to mitigate the impact of the global
slowdown on the CAR economy and population. The specific reforms to be supported by the
grant are detailed in the EMGRG III policy matrix (Annex 2).

B.  TRANCHE RELEASE CONDITIONS 

87.    The table below lists the tranche release conditions for the EMGRG III. The rationale for
their selection, including their importance to the program and expressed government
commitment and feasibility, is discussed in the following sections. Several of the tranche release
conditions for the proposed grant were broadly defined in the previous operation as further
policy actions that were critical to the success of the overall program. It should be noted that
these conditions also support the two strategic objectives of the joint CPS and are part of a
sequenced series of reforms identified by the Government and whose implementation would
continue to be supported by a possible future EMGRG IV, and the IMF three-year Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) program.

                              Box 3: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
    Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
     The PRSP was approved in 2007 following extensive participation and consultations and has been
        implemented since then.
     The country has had a positive policy reform track record.
     The Association has had extensive discussions with the authorities on policy options and the Government
        has designed the reforms according to its needs, notably in PFM and governance in the economic sectors.

    Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
    framework
     The accountability framework (e.g., policy matrix) for measuring progress under the Government program
        has been discussed with all key departments involved in the program and higher authorities
     The operation has been discussed with donors in the country providing budget support and the monitoring
        and evaluation system may benefit other donors aiming to participate in the medium term in budget support.
        In particular, the PFM measures will feed into the COSUFIBA's framework ­ donors' framework for
        coordination in PFM

    Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances
     The budget support operation focuses on measures to address immediate bottlenecks in public resource
        management and governance, as part of a broader Government reform strategy. It reflects priorities in
        economic management and avoids areas of political sensitivity such as privatization.
     The Government has expressed its policy intentions and many of the policy reforms have already been
        initiated.

    Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
     Prior actions and conditions focus on critical actions to assure early improvement in the management of
        public finance management and governance. All the first tranche release conditions have already been
        undertaken by the authorities.
     Prior actions for the forestry sector are to support the Government's efforts to enhance transparency and
        governance in the sector.
     Prior actions for the mining sector represent the Government's priorities in furthering the development of
         the sector.
     Prior actions for the petroleum sector focus on supporting the Government's efforts to further the sector's
         development.

    Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
    support

         The country's domestic accountability and M&E cycle has been recently established as part of the
         assessment of PRSP implementation and is being steadily strengthened.
         Two annual reviews of PRSP implementation have been conducted to sharpen the focus on results taking
         into account the limited indicators available in the country and the short period over which to have visible
         impacts.
         A series of reviews were conducted over the course of 2009 and 2010 to ensure satisfactory implementation
         of EMGRG II, which permitted an early preparation of EMGRG III.




                                                          35 
 
C.  POLICY AREAS 

Component 1: Improving Public Financial management

88.    Sound and effective public finance management (PFM) systems are essential to
increase the prospects of achieving key economic and social priorities and to support
transparency and accountability. The second PRSP pillar addresses this concern. Government
actions under this pillar focus on improving domestic revenue mobilization, strengthening
spending control, and fighting corruption. The reform program under the proposed EMGRG III
continues to focus on strengthening public expenditure management, with an emphasis on budget
execution, reporting and public procurement, supporting transparency and accountability to
enhance the effective use of public resources, and enhancing domestic revenue mobilization
through an effective control of customs and tax exemptions.

A.     Strengthening Budget Execution and Reporting

89.     Strengthening public expenditure management is critical to ensuring an efficient
and effective use of resources in CAR. In particular, the efficiency of the budget execution
chain needs to improve significantly. Line ministries prepare procurement plans with
considerable delays. This, in turn, delays the elaboration of their commitment plans. These
delays as well as the lack of coherence between planned activities and availability of cash to
finance them contribute to the low expenditure execution rates of line ministries, especially on
the investment budget. The commitment rate on the domestically-financed investment budget
was just 10.5 percent in 2008 and much lower in 2009, at about 5.1 percent. Moreover, due to
arrears, suppliers have low confidence in the capacity of the State to pay and, thus, are reluctant
to participate in Government's tenders. More generally, enforcement of the new procurement
rules and regulations has been weak. As a result, capital spending is highly inadequate, which
prevents the Government from addressing the population's basic needs. Furthermore, there is
need to establish a sound system of control of budget execution to provide reasonable assurances
that public expenditure is executed in accordance with the approved budget and the established
regulatory framework. Specifically, government accounts have never been reviewed by the Court
of Accounts and no budget review law has ever been prepared and submitted to parliament.

90.     PFM reforms have been at the center of the government's efforts to improve the
efficiency of public expenditures in recent years. As noted earlier, several diagnostic studies
helped guide these reforms, including the 2007 CFAA report, the audit of the treasury carried out
by the government in 2006, and the PEFA report completed in early 2008. As a result, progress
has been made in several areas although many challenges remain as discussed below.

91.    Budget execution has been improved in many respects due to (i) enhanced cash
management and control following the creation of a Treasury Committee; (ii) the suppression of
non-cash backed treasury checks issuance and monitoring and control of cash advances, (iii) the
adoption of new budget execution procedures which have reduced the number of exceptional
procedures; (iv) the deployment of expenditure commitment control units in all line ministries,
and (v) a new computerized expenditure tracking system in the budget department with World
Bank and France technical assistance.

                                                36 
 
92.    The Government has taken steps to make the new procurement code operational.
The new code was promulgated by Parliament in June 2008. Since then, Cabinet has adopted the
key legal texts that are needed to render the new code fully operational. In addition, the
government created a general public procurement directorate (DGMP), charged with the overall
responsibility for public procurement policy, a regulatory authority (ARMP) to oversee the
procurement function, and a bidders complaint unit to ensure that effective procedures are
implemented for resolving disputes or any other complaints that may arise during the
procurement process. Procurement units have been set up in the ministries of Education, Health,
Agriculture, and Infrastructure and are being equipped and staffed. To facilitate the
implementation of the new code, a manual of procedures for executing agencies, standard
bidding documents, and a description of the general conditions of contracts have been prepared,
and a training program is being implemented. Going forward the focus needs to be on (i)
improving procurement planning within line ministries so that planned expenditures can be
committed early in the budget year, and on (ii) enforcing compliance with the new procurement
law and regulations. More transparent procurement processes will help to reduce corruption.

93.    A plan to clear the arrears due to suppliers has been formulated and is being
implemented. A clearance plan for domestic arrears was put in place at the end of 2008. Debts
owed to suppliers up to December 2007 have been compiled and verified; and validated debts
have been consolidated in the stock of domestic debt. With the help of development partners, the
government has started to make payments to clear these arrears. In 2008, the Government paid
CFAF 2.7 billion to domestic suppliers; and in August 2009, a CFAF 2.8 billion clearance
operation was launched. The Government also repaid three months of wage arrears for CFAF
10.7 billion. The challenge remains to restore the confidence of domestic suppliers and
encourage them to participate in the bidding process for government contracts. In this regard, the
government needs to specify more clearly the modalities for the determination of supplier debts
that are eligible for clearance and ensure that these criteria are widely disseminated and
followed, and payments are effectively made. Establishing clear criteria for their repayment will
make the clearance of arrears more transparent. This transparency is needed in order to dispel the
perception of suppliers that the authorities may not treat them fairly and on an equal basis when
it comes to settling arrears. Such a perception could also create an incentive for suppliers to
attempt to bribe officials in order to obtain preferential treatment.

94.     Significant progress has been made in improving efficiency and transparency in the
government accounting system. Reconciliations between the Treasury and Central Bank
accounts are undertaken daily, but until 2009 this procedure did not apply to government
accounts opened in commercial banks. The accounts were closed in 2009 as part of efforts to
establish a Treasury Single Account (TSA), thus increasing the comprehensiveness and
relevance of the reconciliation between banking and fiscal records. Recent improvements include
quarterly budget reports from commitment to payment that are discussed with development
partners and presented to parliament since 2009. The integrated computer systems of the treasury
and budget departments now make it possible to generate detailed and comprehensive budget
execution reports. The first quarter report in 2010 was prepared 8 weeks following the end of the
period; although this represents an improvement over the average of 10 weeks in 2008, the
timeliness of the reports needs to improve further. In addition, their usefulness is undermined
somewhat by inaccurate data, especially as regards donor projects.

                                               37 
 
95.     The new reporting system is based on a comprehensive and modern budget
classification nomenclature which provides an adequate picture of general government
activities in accordance with international practice. The Government has adopted
comprehensive accounting nomenclatures following OHADA norms and has carried out the
harmonization of the budget and accounting nomenclatures. Based on this framework, and for
the first time in its history, the Ministry of Finance submitted in March 2010 government
accounts covering the year 2008 to the Court of Account ­ Supreme Audit Institution. The
compilation of these accounts was undertaken with technical assistance from the World Bank.
The Court of Account now needs to undertake an exhaustive review of the government 2008
financial accounts and assess the extent to which public expenditure has been executed in
accordance with the approved budget and legal framework. The Court of Account's report on the
execution of the 2008 budget will enable Parliament to vote on the 2008 budget review law.

96.      The government has also made progress in strengthening the institutional
framework aimed at reducing corruption. As part of efforts to strengthen public
accountability, the government is supportive of anti-corruption initiatives. Most notably, rules
governing the disclosure of assets by senior government officials and key senior civil servants
have been formulated and enforced as mentioned earlier; an Anti-Corruption Committee, with
broad remits to formulate, coordinate and monitor the implementation of anti-corruption
strategies, has been set up in the office of the Prime Minister; and a civil service reform program
was launched in June 2009. The Anti-Corruption Committee is currently developing a national
anti-corruption strategy and an action plan, in consultation with a broad range of stakeholders,
which will include measures to strengthen prevention, enforcement and public awareness. The
government is aware that the challenges to improving transparency remain significant and that
the institutional and legal framework would need to be strengthened further in order to improve
public accountability and reduce opportunities for corruption. To this end, the government will
conduct a participatory review of all relevant legal texts aimed at addressing the weaknesses of
national law and improving compliance with the UN conventions against corruption to which
C.A.R. is a signatory. The Government has also signaled that it will adopt a law to protect
whistleblowers. Complementary demand side governance initiatives would also need to be
implemented. In particular, there is need to reform the relationship between service providers
and clients and support better monitoring systems, and develop citizens' feedback systems
including through the use of surveys and development of citizen report cards on critical public
services such as electricity and water and sanitation.

97.     Against this background, the reform strategy of the proposed EMGRG III to
strengthen budget execution and reporting centers on measures in two areas: (i) strengthen
the procurement process, with a focus on priority sectors, to accelerate implementation of the
capital budget and reduce corruption; and (ii) produce timely and comprehensive reports on the
execution of government budgetary and financial operations to promote greater transparency and
accountability.

98.    Procurement reforms: The actions to strengthen the public procurement system consist
of (i) improving procurement planning in priority sector ministries14, (ii) facilitating the
                                                            
14
 Priority sector ministries are the ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development, Education, Equipment, Health,
Mining, energy and hydraulics, Social Affairs, and Transports.

                                                               38 
 
participation of small and medium enterprises in the government bidding process through
continued clearance of government arrears, and (iii) strengthening the enforcement of
procurement rules and regulation. The proposed tranche release conditions are:

          (A) The Commitment Plans for the year 2010 in respect of each Priority Sector
          Ministry have been approved, in each case, by (i) the "ordonnateur" (i.e., the
          relevant Priority Sector Ministry); (ii) the Recipient's Credit Administrator
          within the Ministry of Plan, Economy and International Cooperation; and (iii)
          the Recipient's Director of Financial Control within the Ministry of Finance
          and Budget, and (B) the Procurement Plans, consistent with the associated
          Commitment Plans, have been adopted, in each case, by (i) the relevant Priority
          Sector Ministry; (ii) the Recipient's General Director of Public Procurement;
          and (iii) the Recipient's Ministry of Finance and Budget.  This measure was
          fully satisfied by end-June 2010. For the first time, priority sector ministries
          have prepared and adopted their commitment and procurement plans in the first
          half of the financial year. This will permit an orderly execution of the capital
          budget and help to increase the commitment rate. This result was due to an
          improved coordination between the key participants in this process: priority
          sector ministries, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Plan, and the public
          procurement general directorate (DGMP). In particular, the control exercised by
          the Ministry of Plan over the preparation of commitment plans helped ensure
          that the planned sectoral investment expenditures were in line with sector
          priorities; and the DGMP verified that the procurement plans reflected well the
          planned purchases listed in the commitment plans and the corresponding line
          items in the budget. The control by the DGMP also helped to ensure that
          procurement plans were prepared in accordance with guidelines and procedures
          in the new procurement code. The Bank provided technical assistance through
          an IDF grant in support of these efforts.

          The Recipient's Minister of Finance and Budget has adopted and publicly
          disclosed (e.g., newspapers) an order ("Arrears Order") setting forth, inter
          alia, eligibility criteria for the settlement of arrears in respect of commercial
          suppliers under the Domestic Arrears Clearance Program.  The Arrears Order
          has been adopted. It has been posted on government website and published in
          local newspapers, ensuring wide dissemination. It establishes clear criteria for
          determining domestic suppliers' debts that are eligible for clearance and sets out
          the priorities and procedures in clearing the arrears. The Government will
          ensure that these criteria are enforced through a strict adherence to existing
          budgetary procedures. The budget, treasury, and debt departments will play an
          important role in the payment of arrears, and the Arrears Order clearly defines
          their respective roles and responsibilities. The Debt department, in collaboration
          with the National Debt Committee, will prepare the annual domestic arrears
          clearance plan, which will be attached to the budget law submitted to
          parliament. Parliament's approval will render the annual clearance plan binding
          to Government for its execution. The Debt department will prepare payment
          orders in accordance with established criteria and all payments will be made

                                              39 
 
       through the banking system following the Minister of Finance's approval. The
       Inspectorate General of Finance will conduct controls at the beginning and end
       of the payment process to ensure full compliance with the provisions of the
       Arrears Order; and the quarterly budget execution reports will publish
       information on the actual clearance of domestic arrears, which will contribute to
       its transparency. By making the process of arrears clearance transparent, this
       measure is expected to increase the confidence of suppliers in the public
       procurement system. At the moment, confidence is extremely low as there is
       widespread perception among suppliers that who gets paid is more dependent on
       connections than on the intrinsic merits of the claims or government priorities.
       This results in overcharging (or forged invoices), requests for payments before
       service delivery, reduced pool of suppliers dealing with the State and, hence,
       limited competition in procurement. This measure will contribute to efforts to
       minimize corruption risks, optimize the use of financial resources and foster
       competition in public procurement.

       The Recipient's has settled at least CFAF 500 millions of arrears due to small- and
       medium-enterprises in accordance with the Arrears Order. In January 2010, prior to
       the adoption of the Arrears Oder, the authorities had made a payment of CFAF1.3
       billion to reduce commercial arrears, including arrears to small suppliers. This
       additional payment, representing about 20 percent of the resources budgeted by the
       government to clear commercial arrears in 2010, constitutes an important government
       effort to reduce arrears owed to small and medium enterprises. Part of the donor
       budget support expected in the second half of the year will be used to clear domestic
       arrears in line with the macroeconomic framework. This measure will ensure that
       small and medium enterprises are not crowded out in the repayment process.
       Moreover, the clearance of these arrears will be made in a transparent manner in
       accordance with clearly defined criteria for their repayment. These efforts will not
       only help improve fiscal management; they will also help restore the confidence of
       private enterprises in the soundness of government financial operations as well as
       boost private sector activities, which will contribute to the ongoing economic
       recovery. In addition, the Government has taken additional steps to prevent the
       accumulation of new arrears. Most notably, it has strengthened the new computerized
       expenditure management system, GESCO, by fully applying it to all stages of the
       expenditure cycle from commitment to payments. Since January 2010 the computer
       systems of the budget and treasury departments have been integrated, and a feedback
       mechanism has been established between the two systems to link payments to
       corresponding budget categories. This mechanism makes it possible to automatically
       establish accruing payment arrears thereby permitting a better management of the risk
       of arrears accumulation.
       The Recipient's Public Procurement Regulatory Authority has endorsed a
       report which assesses compliance with the provisions of the new procurement
       code and identifies necessary corrective measures.  This assessment and
       implementation of corrective measures where necessary will be critical in
       ensuring that line ministries comply with the new procurement rules and
       regulations. Effective enforcement of these rules and regulations will help

                                           40 
 
          strengthen the procurement system and minimize the risks of corruption. An
          underlying objective is to reduce the extent of sole source procurement and
          promote greater competition and more transparent procurement processes. The
          procurement regulatory authority (ARMP) is leading this effort in collaboration
          with the DGMP and with technical assistance from the Bank.

99.     Budget execution control system: Actions to strengthen budget execution oversight
consist of (i) improving the harmonization of budget and accounting nomenclatures and (ii)
strengthening the parliamentary control exercised by Parliament and the jurisdictional control
carried out by the Court of Accounts. The proposed tranche release conditions are:

          The budget classifications under the 2010 budget have been harmonized with
          the accounting nomenclatures which are based on OHADA norms. This
          condition has been met. The 2010 budget approved by parliament was based on
          the new budget nomenclature adopted and implemented since December 2009.
          The new budget nomenclature includes the key classifications, functional,
          administrative, and economic, and has improved the clarity and transparency of
          the budget. The new accounting plan of the State was elaborated in accordance
          with OHADA norms and adopted in January 2009. The harmonization of the
          accounting framework with the budget classifications, which was achieved
          through the codification of revenue and expenditures and the corresponding
          classes of accounts in the accounting plan, will facilitate the tracking of poverty-
          reducing expenditures and help enforce accountability.

          The Recipient's Court of Account has published its report on the implementation
          of the 2008 budget law (loi des finances) and the Recipient's Ministry of
          Finance and Budget has submitted the 2008 budget review law (loi de
          reglement) to the Recipient's Parliament.  This measure addresses the lack of
          external control over budget execution and complements other reforms such as
          the adoption of a new accounting framework. For the first time the Court of
          Account will undertake a detailed verification of consolidated government
          accounts and issue a report which will include a general declaration of
          conformity. This report will provide the basis upon which Parliament will vote
          on the corresponding budget review law prepared by the Ministry of Finance
          and submitted to Parliament at the same time as the 2011 draft budget law.

100.   Key next steps include:

       Increase the absorption capacity of priority sector ministries. The production of
       procurement and commitment plans is a useful first step to translate the ministries' work
       plans into appropriate budgets. The next step will be to support ministries in the effective
       implementation of these plans, including through technical assistance in the areas of
       public procurement and budget execution. The objective would be to progressively create
       sufficient capacity in line ministries' Administrative and Finance Directorates in order to
       correctly plan and execute spending.


                                               41 
 
       Strengthen the capacity of procurement units in all line ministries. Achieving favorable
       development outcomes will depend to a significant extent on improving public sector
       efficiency and effectiveness. This will require not only institutional strengthening but also
       capacity building. Strengthening the capacity of line ministries in public procurement will
       ensure that procurement plans are prepared in a timely manner and executed efficiently
       on a sustainable basis.

       Continue and expand the process of arrears clearance to all suppliers. Suppliers'
       confidence in the State is unlikely to be restored unless the clearance of arrears is steady,
       transparent, and credible; and the Government continues to take the steps necessary to
       prevent the accumulation of new arrears including through more effective budgetary
       monitoring and control procedures, adequate accounting and reporting requirement for
       line ministries and departments, and by improving liquidity management. This will
       require overcoming persistent capacity and organizational constraints to permit the full
       use of the potential of the new computerized expenditure management system.

       Prepare and submit to Parliament the 2009 draft budget review law at the same time as
       the 2012 draft budget law. With the experience gained in the compilation of the 2008
       accounts and the preparation of the budget review law and the capacity that was
       developed through technical assistance financed by the LICUS III grant, the Ministry of
       Finance is expected to move more rapidly to compile the 2009 accounts and begin the
       preparation of the 2009 draft budget review law.

B.     Domestic revenue Mobilization

101. Although CAR's fiscal performance has improved considerably since the end of the
conflict in 2003, many challenges remain in strengthening domestic revenue. Despite
enhanced revenue mobilization from the petroleum sector, revenue collections are still relatively
weak, which severely constrains the Government's ability to implement its poverty reduction
strategy. The causes underlying this weakness include a small tax base as well as continuing
weaknesses in tax and customs administration, including inadequate control of exemptions.

102. The Government has made steady progress in improving domestic revenue
mobilization. The tax revenue ratio has increased from 7.7 percent of GDP in 2006-08 to 8.7
percent of GDP in 2009. The main sources of tax revenue have been taxes on goods and services,
of which taxes on petroleum products have become an important component. The contribution of
taxes on profits and property remains relatively small. The tax revenue ratio is projected to
continue to rise steadily over the next three years to reach 9.5 percent of GDP by 2012. With
non-tax revenue included, total domestic revenue increased from 10.1 percent of GDP in 2006-
08 to 10.8 percent in 2009. It is projected to stabilize at 10.7 percent of GDP in 2010 and reach
11.1 percent of GDP in 2012. The government has implemented important structural reform
measures to enhance revenue mobilization. In particular, the quarterly petroleum product pricing
mechanism, which ensures full pass-through to consumers of all costs of changes in world oil
prices, has contributed to strong revenue from the petroleum sector in 2009. The government has
also made progress in revenue administration. To improve the payment of VAT refund requests,
a special VAT account with BEAC is being used exclusively for VAT refunds; and the tax and

                                                42 
 
customs administrations' information systems (SYSTEMIF and ASYCUDA) have been
interconnected, which facilitates information and data sharing. Progress has also been made in
reducing customs and tax exemptions.

103. The Inter-ministerial Committee in charge of customs and tax exemptions
(CICEFD) has played an important role in helping to reduce the level of exemptions.
Established in 2007, The CICEFD has as remit to (i) review requests for exemptions and issue
recommendations to the Minister of Finance who is the sole signatory of exemption conventions;
(ii) establish an exhaustive list of beneficiaries over the last three years, (iii) audit, monitor and
control beneficiaries' compliance with the terms of exemptions granted, (iv) review compliance
of existing exemptions with existing regulations (Regional and National Investment Charters, tax
and customs as well as sectoral Codes), (iii) and propose an action plan to the Government aimed
at rationalizing exemption management. Since becoming operational in 2008 the CICEFD has
actively reviewed all requests for exemption it receives from the Minister of Finance; and it has
consistently produced quarterly reports in which it presents the results of its reviews. These
reports, which include the amounts of the requests as well as the institutions requesting the
exemptions, have been posted on the government's website. In 2009 CICEFD reviewed 88
requests for exemption, out of which it recommended approval for 38 requests and the rejection
of 50 requests. CICEFD's reviews have helped reduce customs exemptions to CFAF8.9 billion
in 2009, an improvement over the reduction of customs exemptions to CFAF11 billion achieved
in 2008. However, the CICEFD has not tracked systematically all actual exemptions handed out
by the Minister of Finance owing in part to inconsistent feedback information on approved
exemptions. Moreover, because the CICEFD is not a separate legal entity it has not been
interconnected to SYTEMIF and ASYCUDA as envisaged and, hence, continues to lack access
to real time information regarding the exemptions applied by the tax and customs directorates.
Thus, while the level of exemptions has declined, its management continues to lack transparency,
and there are no controls on discretionary exemptions. Moreover the CICEFD has focused
mainly on new exemption requests and less on the existing stock of exemptions. Going forward
the CICEFD will need to focus not only on controlling new exemptions; it will also need to
review the legal basis of existing exemptions, and develop a strategy to change the legislation
governing exemptions in order to significantly reduce the possibility of exemptions, including
discretionary exemptions.

104. The proposed EMGRG III will continue to support efforts to strengthen the control
of exemptions with a view to curtailing discretionary exemptions. Emphasis will be placed on
increasing access of CICEFD to information on all exemptions awarded to enhance transparency
in the management of exemptions. The CICEFD's work will also be refocused to place greater
emphasis on the review of the legal basis for existing exemptions and the development of a
strategy to change the legislation in order to significantly reduce the possibility of exemptions.
The proposed tranche release condition is that:

       The Recipient's Minister of Finance and Budget has adopted a procedures manual which
       sets forth, inter alia, (i) guidelines and procedures for the processing of tax exemption in
       the Recipient's territory; and (ii) the requirement for the Recipient's Director of Tax
       Administration as well as the Recipient's Director of Customs to provide to the CICEFD,
       on a monthly basis, the list of all approved tax exemptions. The manual of procedures has

                                                 43 
 
       been adopted by ministerial instruction and will, henceforth, guide the processing of new
       as well as exiting exemptions. It requires that the CICEFD be given access to information
       on all tax and customs exemptions applied by the Tax and Customs departments and
       approved by the Minister of Finance, and states that any exemptions awarded outside
       established procedures are not valid.

Component 2: Strengthening Public Sector and Economic Governance

105. In addition to public finance reforms, Government actions under the Governance
and Rule of Law pillar aim also to strengthen the regulatory framework in key economic
sectors. The proposed EMGRG III will support in a selective manner government actions in the
forestry, mining, and petroleum sectors. The primary objective of government reforms in these
sectors is to ensure that they can provide a strong backbone for sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction through increased foreign direct investment, export earnings, fiscal revenue,
and employment.

D.  FORESTRY SECTOR 
106. The Government has made significant progress in improving governance in the
forestry sector over the past years. It has adopted a new forestry code that conforms to best
international practices. The new code provides a legal and regulatory framework that promotes a
sustainable management of the forestry sector. The implementing decrees adopted in April 2009
promote a concession award system based on competitive bidding for all harvesting rights;
demand that information about the allocation process is to be made public; and stipulate that new
permit holders adopt and implement forest management plans. This framework permits awarding
longer and more predictable concession contracts. Furthermore, the taxation system defined in
the code provides for an equitable sharing of forestry rents among the central government,
private operators, and local communities.

107. The global slowdown has hit CAR's forestry sector particularly hard, affecting
production, exports, revenues, incomes and employment. The forestry sector plays an
important role in the CAR economy. It accounts for 10 percent of GDP, 50 percent of exports,
and is the largest private sector employer in the country. The forestry sector, through the
production and processing of timber, provides 4,000 jobs directly and work to several thousands
of manual workers. As a result of the global slowdown, production of timber has declined by 37
percent and exports by 29 percent in volume terms as mentioned above. In turn, this decline has
affected the collection of taxes and fees, which fell by more than 37 percent. The social fund for
the development of the forestry sector (CAS DF) and local communities, which receive their
revenues from forest taxes according to a revenue distribution mechanism, have been severely
affected by the decline in forestry tax revenues. The impact of the crisis on the incidence of
poverty has not been measured due to lack of data. However, given that so many poor people
depend on the sector for employment and income, the impact of the crisis on the poor is expected
to be significant because of initial vulnerabilities.

108. A government task force has recommended a range of measures in an effort to
mitigate the effects of the downturn on the forestry sector, but activities in the sector

                                               44 
 
remain weak. In addition to permitting forest companies to spread the payment of area taxes
over a period of 9 months and reducing the mercurial and FOT values of each species, thereby
reducing stumpage fees, surface area taxes, and exit duties, the government has further reduced
the duties on timber exports. The government also eased the regulations of hiring and working
hours to protect jobs, permitting forestry companies to hire workers on a part-time basis and
carry out temporary layoffs. Despite these measures, economic activity in the sector remains
weak. The audit of forestry companies conducted by the Government in February 2010 indicates
that for the 9 forestry companies operating in the sector, total revenue has declined by more than
37 percent, and many of them are experiencing serious financial difficulties. As a result of the
decline in revenues their contributions to the CAS/DF account as well to local communities have
declined; and, in addition, they have accumulated arrears in tax payments to the Government.

109. The new legal and regulatory framework is taking effect just as world demand for
timber has fallen sharply. Nonetheless, the Government has continued to implement the new
forestry legislation. All forestry companies manage their concessions under a validated
management plan; and the three permits that remain to be allocated are also expected to be
placed under sustainable management plans once they have been attributed. A key challenge
facing the government now is to revive activities in the sector. In this regard, an accelerated
reimbursement of VAT credits will provide much needed funds to forestry companies, allowing
them to finance their activities, stay competitive, and respond to the emerging demand for their
products. As of April 2009, validated VAT credits that have yet to be reimbursed amounted to
more than CFAF 1 billion. Ensuring the timely repayments of all VAT credits, most of which are
due to forestry companies, in order to support economic activity is among the key policy issues
in the IMF-supported program under the Extended Credit facility.

110. Beyond short term actions to address the effects of the global downturn on the
forestry sector, the Government is taking steps to move the Forest Law Enforcement
Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process forward, which aims to combat the growing
illegal exploitation of timber in the sub-region.15 The purpose of FLEGT is to promote good
governance in the forestry sector by combating the threat to forests from illegal logging, illegal
trade, and wildlife poaching; securing forestry products; and promoting a rational management
of natural resources. The Government has become an active participant in this process.
Following the (i) nomination of a focal point of FLEGT in April 2007, (ii) a request to the EU
for negotiations on the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA), and (iii) creation of a national
Committee of FLEGT in June 2008 to implement the VPA, negotiations with EU began in
October 2009.

111. The Government is committed to the implementation of the road map to finalize the
Voluntary Partnership Agreement with the European Union through the FLEGT process.
The road map includes four main negotiation sessions. During the first two negotiation sessions
the CAR team, which includes government officials, private operators, and NGOs, and the EU
delegations have focused on the review and test of criteria for assessing the legality of
                                                            
15
  Cameroon has already concluded its negotiations with the European Union on the Voluntary Partnership
Agreement. The Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo have started the process to adhere to the
FLEGT process.

                                                               45 
 
production in forestry concessions, traceability, and verification and control systems. The third
negotiation session took place in Bangui on June 15-16, 2010 during which the CAR team
presented its program documents on the legality, traceability and verification system of the
legality of timber production. Discussions highlighted the need for CAR to further strengthen its
program documents by, inter alia, developing traceability and verification systems that would
also permit tracking timber production originating from communal forests, artisanal permits and
plantations; strengthening mechanisms for sharing information within government on forest
management; and providing for an independent audit of the national verification system. The
fourth negotiation session, planned for August 2010, is expected to focus on the agreement
protocol and accompanying technical documents. Negotiations are expected to be concluded in
December 2010 followed by the ratification of the partnership agreement by the two parties.

112. Strengthening governance in the forestry sector is an important part of the Bank's
policy support in CAR. The previous operations supported reforms aimed at increasing
transparency in the award of forest concessions, strengthening compliance with national fiscal
regulations among forestry operators, and disclosing information pertaining to the forestry
revenue sharing mechanism between the Government, local communities, and forestry
companies. As key areas of continued policy dialogue the EMGRG II identified the need for
CAR, including through the FLEGT process, to (i) develop a clear and agreed definition of
conflict timber, (ii) develop mechanisms to conduct independent forest assessment and
monitoring, and (iii) strengthen national and local mechanisms for sharing and exchanging
information on forest management. The proposed EMGRG III will continue to promote forestry
reforms aimed at enhancing transparency and ensuring a sustainable management of forestry
resources. The proposed tranche release condition seeks to support the Government's efforts to
develop a national traceability system and verification scheme of the legality of timber
production. It stipulates that:

       The Recipient has adopted (i) a framework document for a national tracking system, and
       (ii) a framework document for a system of verification of the legality of timber
       productions, in the context of the FLEGT process. The objective of the measure is to
       increase legality and to discourage illegal logging and the outcome is likely to be to
       curtail, rather than to promote, industrial scale logging because of the higher cost of
       complying with legality conditions. The national traceability system will permit tracking
       timber as it moves through the supply chain from the forest and processing plants to the
       port in Cameroon from where the timber is exported. The implementation of this system,
       together with a certification scheme to establish the legality of timber production, will
       help to stamp out the unlicensed logging that has decimated large areas of CAR forest in
       the recent past.


E.  MINING SECTOR 

113. Although the price of diamond has staged a recovery in world markets, the mining
sector in CAR remains under the effect of the global downturn. After an initial decline, total
diamond exports in 2009 are estimated to have exceeded slightly their 2008 level in value terms.
The improvement in the terms of trade for diamonds is one of the factors behind the

                                               46 
 
improvement of the current account balance in 2009. In contrast production, which is primarily
artisanal in nature, is estimated to have dropped by some 18 percent. Towards end-2008, 8 out of
11 diamond purchasing bureaus were closed for not respecting mining regulations. In addition,
the three remaining purchasing bureaus were negatively affected by low external demand.
Today, only a few of the 8-10 purchasing bureaus, the main source of financing for the artisanal
miners, are in operation. Artisanal miners (thereafter referred to as "artisans") have suffered
heavily during the global economic downturn; in part because of the inability to obtain
competitive prices for their diamonds and also because of reduced access to credit to finance
their activities. Because the artisans tend to be poor, the impact of the downturn on the incidence
of poverty in the mining sector is expected to be large.

114. The Government's strategy to revive and stimulate the development of the mining
sector is based on improving the regulatory framework of the sector, strengthening
transparency and capacity, and increasing production and improving the incomes of the
population in mining areas. Regarding the regulatory framework, Parliament adopted the
revised mining code on April 28, 2009; and the implementing texts were adopted by Presidential
decrees on April 30, 2009. Under the new legislation, tax incentives are rationalized and
standardized for all new mining projects; however, there is need to ensure that the overall tax
burden is not excessive as potentially associated infrastructure needs could be significant - CAR
is landlocked and has an acute shortage of viable infrastructure ­ for certain types of mineral
development (iron ore for example). A new standard form mining agreement based on best
international practices has also been adopted. The new model mining agreement is intended to
attract new investments from small and medium enterprises as well as larger enterprises by
reducing investor risk in a transparent manner. However, uncertainties about the forthcoming
elections appear to have somewhat delayed large-scale investment in the mining sector.

115. Implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) is
advancing. The Government published its first EITI report on mining revenues, covering
2006, in March 2009. The Government remains committed to continue to move toward
becoming a compliant country, which will require that CAR complete EITI validation by end
2010. It is worth noting that CAR is one of the countries that have recently joined EITI. At the
global level, out of the 30 EITI member countries only two have been validated to date as
validation is a demanding process. At the validation stage EITI implementation in CAR will be
evaluated in consultation with stakeholders (civil society, public sector, and mining operators) to
assess the degree and quality of their participation in the process. The Validator will also verify
achievements with reference to the EITI global standard, and identifies opportunities to
strengthen the EITI process going forward.

116. To increase production and the incomes of the populations in mining areas, the
Government has placed emphasis on promoting the development of artisanal mining.
Several actions are being considered by the Government, including (i) attracting regional
banks/branches in the mining areas; (ii) creation of a mining fund to finance the activities of the
artisanal miners; (iii) reduction of mining license fees; and (iv) promotion of small scale mining
activities. Implementation of these actions will require substantial donor support. The short to
medium term feasibility of these proposed actions remains to be discussed with the Government.


                                                47 
 
117. The proposed EMGRG III will continue to support efforts to increase transparency
in the management of mining receipts. The proposed tranche release condition aims to support
the Government's efforts to complete EITI validation by November 2010. It stipulates that:

       The Recipient has published on official websites its second EITI report covering years
       2007, 2008 and 2009 and such report has been disseminated in the Recipient's territory.
       The second EITI report is expected to be based on extensive consultations with
       stakeholders including the public sector, mining operators, and representatives of civil
       society, and cover revenues from minerals other than diamonds. In addition to the
       website of the national EITI secretariat, the second report will be posted on at least two
       official government websites. Dissemination will be evidenced by making the report
       available to the public through publication of a notice in a local newspaper.

118.   Key next steps include:

       Achieving compliant country status: CAR became a candidate country in November 2008
       and was granted two years to implement specific actions outlined in the work plan that
       was officially adopted by the National Steering committee. These actions have to be
       implemented in collaboration with the Government, civil society, and private sector
       operators. A satisfactory assessment of the second EITI report by the EITI International
       Secretariat will be an important step for CAR toward compliant country status.

       Development of a geological information system: The alluvial nature of artisanal mining
       of diamonds in CAR has been a major impediment to the generation of any kind of socio-
       economic development for the country. CAR intends to make a strong plead to the
       international community in order to receive assistance for financing R&D activities to
       help establish a diversified geological base and attract investors in all mineral areas, as
       opposed to just diamonds and uranium. Indeed, in CAR, over 120 mineral indices are
       known to exist. The Bank could play a catalytic role in helping CAR in mobilizing both
       the right technical expertise in addition to adequate financial resources to set up a modern
       Geological Information System (GIS) and a modern geo-scientific database.


F.  PETROLEUM SECTOR 

119. Reforms undertaken by the Government since 2007 have helped to stabilize and
secure the downstream petroleum sector. In the first half of 2007, the Government enacted a
new law to create a regulatory agency and restructure the public company in charge of storage
and distribution of oil. The regulatory agency's role was to supervise the sector and ensure that it
became open, transparent and competitive. A new firm was created for the storage of oil
products, with the Government holding 51 percent of the capital and three private operators
sharing the balance. In addition, an automatic quarterly petroleum product pricing mechanism
was instituted in mid-2008 to ensure a direct pass-through of world oil price changes to
consumers. The results of the reforms have been significant. By ensuring that the pass-through of
world oil price changes to consumers included all costs, distribution margins, and taxes,
including VAT at the regular rate, this mechanism has emerged as an important source of
revenue for the Government. In 2009, application of the formula, helped generate about CFAF
                                                48 
 
16 billion in government revenue, significantly up from CFAF 3 billion in 2008. This
performance permitted the Government to clear its debt to importers and suppliers of petroleum
products, progressively reduce and eliminate subsidies of petroleum products, and significantly
reduce petroleum product shortages in the country. The regulatory authority appointed an
external agency, through a competitive bidding process, to control the quantity and quality of all
petroleum imports entering CAR. Thanks to the control system put in place, the quantities of
petroleum products actually imported are now fully recorded and accounted for, and their quality
and safety conditions meet established industry norms.

120. Enactment of the 2007 has led to limited entry of new participants in the sector.
Currently, only two companies assure the distribution of petroleum products across the country;
and access of the population in the interior of the country to these products has been highly
uneven. A third company was approved in June 2010 but is not yet operating. The sector reforms
need to continue so as to become perennial and sustainable, including by addressing the
constitution and maintenance of the proper storage level of petroleum products at the most
reasonable cost. Storage capacity expansion, including strategic storage levels and maximization
of imports by river rather than road imports, will lower the overall cost of supply and ensure the
required security the economy needs to maintain its growth.

121. The Bank, through the EMGRG II and the LICUS III grant, has supported
Government's efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework in the downstream
petroleum sector. The Bank supported the creation of the regulatory agency, the Agence de
Stabilisation et de Régulation des Prix des Produits Pétroliers; helped to ensure that it is
appropriately staffed and that a portion of the revenue generated through the automatic price
adjustment mechanism would be used to finance the activities of the agency. Also, the Bank
assisted the ASRP in the procurement process for an independent and reputable pre-inspection
agency to control the quantity and quality of imported oil products. A strong capacity building
component was also included in the contract and many newly hired staffers were trained on all
oil import operations by river and by road, both in Bangui, Yaoundé and in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). Today, the ASRP is operational and its trained staff should be able to
undertake and supervise any loading or unloading operations and verify storage levels and
product quality and quantity in SOCASP as well as in private gas stations. ASRP also monitors
the evolution of the pricing structure of petroleum products as well as the implementation of the
automatic quarterly price adjustment mechanism, and tracks the quality and quantity of imported
petroleum products from procurement through storage, which also permits the detection of
frauds and products adulteration. However, the automatic price adjustment mechanism has not
been implemented consistently, the formulation of the monthly price structure of petroleum
products, which also covers the ASRP's operating costs, lacks transparency; and no controls are
undertaken along CAR's borders with Cameroon and at operational gas stations in the country.
Addressing these deficiencies, including maximizing imports by river and storage expansion to
ensure the country's required level for year-round security of supply, needs to be pursued.

122. In 2009 the Government initiated a review of exiting texts, rules and procedures
regulating the downstream oil sector to ensure consistency with the 2007 law with a view to
adopt a legislation that is in conformity with international best practice. The legal texts
currently in application are being reviewed and will be modified to harmonize the institutional

                                               49 
 
and regulatory framework to support the development of the sector, under the supervision of the
ASRP. The overall objective is to prevent collusion among operators, increase competition,
ensure that only quality products are imported and delivered to consumers throughout the
country, and to combat products adulteration and fraud. The Government will also ascertain how
well the pricing mechanism is working, and undertake a comprehensive review of the use of
funds generated through this mechanism since its institution in 2008 to reinforce the sector's
performance.

123. The proposed operation will focus on supporting the Government's efforts to
strengthen the regulatory framework in the downstream oil sector. The proposed two
tranche release conditions are that:

       The Recipient has adopted legislation and/or regulations on the downstream petroleum
       which: (i) set forth the respective role and responsibilities of the petroleum sector
       regulatory agency (ASRP), the state-owned storage company of petroleum products
       (SOCASP) and the Recipient's Ministry of Mines and Energy; and (ii) the methodology
       for determining the price of petroleum products. The new legislation will address the
       overlap in the functions of ASRP, SOCASP and the Ministry of Mines and Energy and
       clarify their respective roles and responsibilities, which will help improve the operational
       efficiency of the downstream petroleum sector and, in particular, enable the ASRP to
       fully carry out its regulatory functions. Similarly the new legislation will clarify the
       methodology for calculating the price of petroleum products, which will provide clear
       signals to operators and consumers, facilitate implementation of the automatic price
       adjustment mechanism, and generate adequate resources for the government budget.

       An audit report on, inter alia, the use of funds by the Recipient's petroleum sector
       regulatory agency (Agence de Stabilization et Régulation des Prix des Produits
       Pétroliers) has been prepared by an independent consultant(s) and endorsed by the
       Recipient's Ministry of Finance and Budget. The purpose of the automatic petroleum
       product pricing formula was to protect the budget from the risks of fluctuating petroleum
       prices, ensure the regularity and predictability of revenues, and create room for measures
       to mitigate the social impact of petroleum price changes on the most exposed segment of
       consumers. The review will help determine the extent to which the pricing mechanism
       has worked as intended and, on the basis of this audit, draw lessons for the future and
       take corrective measures as necessary. Going forward, the Government will provide for a
       better distribution of kerosene particularly in the country-side in order to minimize the
       impact of the price adjustment on the poor. Moreover as the automatic price adjustment
       mechanism is a key component of the Fund-supported program the findings of the audit
       will be also an important input in the design and monitoring of the Fund program.

Component 3: Promoting Private Sector Development

124. As elaborated in the PRSP, improving the business environment and increasing
private investment are vital for CAR's growth prospects. The Government aims to promote
the development of a dynamic and competitive private sector, capable of creating jobs and
increasing the incomes of the population and, hence, contribute to poverty reduction. However, a

                                               50 
 
range of factors continue to constrain the development and competitiveness of private enterprise,
including cumbersome bureaucracy that slows down and complicates the formal process of
setting up a company, weak basic infrastructure, poor quality as well as high production costs,
legal and judicial weaknesses, and limited access to credit. Reflecting these constraints, private
sector investment represented just 6 percent of GDP during the period 2007-09

125. The World Bank Doing Business 2010 ranked CAR 183rd out of 183 countries on the
ease of doing business. In some of the indicators, CAR ranks in the bottom ten: Closing a
Business (183), Paying Taxes (179), and Trading Across Borders (181). In the remaining
indicators, Central African Republic ranks in the bottom sixty: Enforcing contracts (171),
Starting a Business (159), Employing Workers (144), Dealing with Construction Permits (147),
Registering Property (138), Getting Credit (135), and Protecting Investors (132­Central African
Republic best performing indicator). This low performance across a broad range of indicators
suggests the need for a comprehensive reform program to improve the business environment.

126. The Government intends to take a number of steps to improve the environment for
private sector investment. First, it intends to establish a legal and institutional framework and
incentive structure conducive to private enterprise. Second, the government seeks to build the
capacity of institutions servicing the private sector and develop business support services. This is
expected to involve building the capacity of Ministries such as the Ministry of Commerce, and
the Ministry for the promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises. It will also involve
restructuring and building the capacity of the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and
Cottage Industries to promote local entrepreneurship and provide basic economic and
commercial information. In addition, the Government intends to strengthen partnerships between
the public and private sectors, and promote the development of a financial system responsive to
the needs of small and medium enterprises.

127. IFC has developed a technical assistance program to assist the Government in its
efforts to improve the business environment. This program focuses primarily on (i)
strengthening the partnership framework between the State and private sector to promote a
productive dialogue around the issues affecting private sector development in CAR, (ii)
supporting the restructuring of the Chamber of Commerce so that it can carry out its functions
effectively; (iii) strengthening the one-stop window for business registration; and (iv) reducing
the regulatory constraints in selected areas covered in the Doing Business report.

128. The proposed EMGRG III will complement the IFC technical assistance program
and support in a selective manner Government's priority actions to stimulate private sector
development. The focus is on reforms that have the potential to significantly improve the
business environment and can be implemented swiftly by the Government. Specifically, the
EMGRG III proposes to use the CRW resources to support the Government's efforts to reduce
the cost of doing business in relation to two Doing Business indicators: (i) starting a business, (ii)
and property transfer. In some cases the Government has already taken steps to ameliorate
performance on the indicators. For instance, a one-stop shop set up in August 2008 is helping to
streamline the procedures an entrepreneur must complete in order to register a new company by
providing a single access point, called Guichet Unique, for establishing, changing, or



                                                 51 
 
discontinuing business operations in the country, thereby reducing bureaucratic red tape. 
However, as reported below, the cost of doing business remains exceedingly high.

       The Doing Business Starting a business indicator measures the procedures, cost and time
       that are officially required for an entrepreneur to start up and formally operate a limited
       liability company. In Bangui starting a business takes 10 procedures, 14 days, and costs
       FCFA 452,100 (US$882) or 232.3 percent of Central African Republic's income per
       capita. In addition, entrepreneurs are required to deposit a minimum capital of FCFA 1
       million (US$ 1,953) to start such a business, equal to 513.9 percent of CAR's income per
       capita. Globally, CAR ranks 159 out of 183 countries in this indicator. The easier and
       cheaper it is to set up a business, the more businesses will register. Enticing enterprises
       into the formal economy has two benefits. First, formally registered businesses grow
       larger; and, secondly, formally registered enterprises pay taxes, adding to government
       revenues.

       The Doing Business Registering property indicator records the procedures, time and cost
       necessary for a local business to transfer the title of a land and a building to another
       business. In CAR, it takes 5 procedures, 75 days, and cost 18.6 percent of property value
       for a business to legally transfer land and building title to another business. CAR
       currently ranks 138 globally on this indicator. High property registration costs encourage
       informal transactions and underreporting of property values. Governments lose revenue,
       and property owners lose security of title. The more difficult property registration is the
       more assets stay in the informal sector. But informal titles cannot be used as security in
       obtaining loans. The cost of registering property in CAR is currently above the Africa
       region average, at18.6 percent of the property value compared to 10.5 percent for the
       region

129. A significant reduction of these costs is likely to create a business environment that
is conducive to the creation of enterprises, especially small and medium enterprises. The
tranche release conditions on private sector development are that:

          The Secretariat of the Joint Committee responsible for the Improvement of Business
          Environment (CMAEA) (1) has prepared reports that, inter alia, (i) identifies the
          costs related to the creation of business and the transfer of urban commercial real
          property (mutation d'immeubles urbains bâtis et non-bâtis) and (ii) identifies the
          relevant laws and regulations relating to these costs, and (iii) proposes measures to
          be taken to reduce these costs by amendment or repeal of these laws and regulations,
          and (2) has submitted such reports to CMAEA. This condition has been met. The
          Joint Committee responsible for the Improvement of Business Environment
          (CMAEA) was established in April 2010 through a government order (Arrêté).
          Chaired by the Prime Minister, the committee seeks to enhance dialogue at the
          highest level between the Government and the private sector, promote reforms to
          improve the business environment and monitor the implementation of these reforms.
          Technical commissions set up for this purpose have prepared and submitted to the
          Prime Minister reports that have identified the main costs associated with the creation
          of business and the transfer of property as well as the legislation relating to these

                                               52 
 
           costs and made clear reform recommendations. The Joint Committee has examined
           and endorsed the reform measures recommended by the technical commissions.

           The Recipient has reduced administrative costs arising from (A) the creation of a
           business and (B) the transfer of urban commercial real property (mutation
           d'immeubles urbains bâtis et non-bâtis) by amending the Recipient's Registration
           Code (Code de l'enregistrement) so as to reduce the registration fees in connection
           with (i) the creation of a business; and (2) the transfer of urban commercial real
           property (mutation d'immeubles urbains bâtis et non-bâtis), each by at least fifty
           percent (50%). The reports of technical commissions have established that
           registration fees are the major costs to the creation of a business and the transfer of
           property. On the recommendation of the Joint Committee the Government has
           undertaken to modify the applicable legislation, in respect of the OHADA Uniform
           Law, to bring about a significant reduction in these costs.


G.  POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT 

130. The actions supported by the Grant are expected to have positive poverty and social
impacts. First, by protecting priority sector spending the grant seeks to contribute to limit the
negative consequences of the economic slowdown on poverty, malnutrition, health and
schooling. The grant resources will generate fiscal space to allow the government to devote
additional public resources towards its PRS objectives. The government is committed to aligning
the national budget with the PRS, and the 2010 budget law projects that priority spending in
support of poverty reduction activities will increase. However, as limited resources make it hard
for the government to maintain its public expenditure program any additional financing, such as
through the Crisis Response Window, will enhance the government's ability to advance its
poverty reduction objectives.

131. Second, the measures supported by the proposed grant will contribute to improving
CAR's public finance management system and to strengthening public sector and economic
governance. Sound expenditure policies, an effective PFM system and good governance could
help reduce inequality and poverty and lead to growth, which will have a favorable impact on
poverty. In addition, by focusing on measures to increase domestic revenue the grant will also
contribute to enhancing the ability of the Government to implement its poverty reduction
strategy. Furthermore, by helping to revive the forestry sector, the grant will help attenuate the
impact of the global slowdown on forestry communities, which depend on revenues from forest
taxes to finance social and income generating projects; and by strengthening the regulatory
framework in the petroleum sector, the grant will contribute to improve the distribution of
petroleum products to the population, including in the interior of the country where needs are
unmet.

132. Specifically, the tranche release conditions on public expenditure focus on supporting
efforts to strengthen capacity in budget execution and reporting. Line ministries will prepare
commitment plans that are consistent with procurement plans; transparent measures would be
adopted to encourage small and medium enterprise to participate in the public bidding process,
government accounts will be compiled and submitted to the Court of Accounts for review and
                                               53 
 
the budget execution law will be prepared and submitted to Parliament. The harmonization of
budget and accounting nomenclatures will enhance the tracking of public spending. These
actions will permit an efficient and effective use of the CRW resources, enhance transparency
and accountability, and contribute to the protection of priority sector expenditures.

133. A tranche release condition focuses on reducing customs and tax exemptions as a way to
improve revenue administration and increase domestic revenue. This would help make the tax
system more transparent, minimize the scope for discretion on the part of administrators, and
reduce the incentives for corruption, which will support efforts to increase economic growth and
equity in the distribution of the tax burden.

134. In the forestry sector, a tranche release condition focuses on strengthening the regulatory
framework to effectively combat unlicensed logging and ensure that the forestry sector will
remain a major source of investment, revenues and employment for the population through
sustainable management of the forestry resources. A rebound in timber exports will revitalize
economic growth. Forestry companies will be able to sustain their contributions to local
communities, which have helped to finance poverty-reducing expenditures including the
construction of classrooms, health centers, and the implementation of income-generating
projects. The proposed measure will fall mainly on the non-poor as it is foreign companies which
tend to be involved in unlicensed logging activities.

135. The tranche release condition in the mining sector focuses on supporting the preparation
of the second EITI report on mining revenues for 2007, 2008, and 2009. This report will examine
revenues generated from artisanal exploitation of gold in addition to the traditional diamond
activities, contributing to promoting transparency and accountability in the use of mining
revenues for economic and social development.

136. The quarterly petroleum product pricing mechanism has emerged as a major source of tax
revenue from the petroleum sector. The mechanism ensures full pass-through to consumers of all
costs, distribution margins, and taxes, including VAT at the regular rate. The Government has
recognized the importance of the principle of regularly passing-through to consumers changes in
world oil prices. Also, the petroleum product taxation falls mainly on the non-poor because fuel
products are predominantly consumed by the non-poor. Nonetheless, although fuel consumption
by the poor is very limited it still places a heavy burden on them. To minimize the impact of the
price adjustment for kerosene on the poor, the Government intends to provide for a better
distribution of this product, particularly in the country-side. One proposed tranche condition in
the petroleum sector supports this effort through the reform of the downstream petroleum
legislation.

H.  ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS 

137. Building on the recently adopted forest Code and drawing on the long-term
engagement of development partners, including significant support for institutional
strengthening, reforms supported by the EMGRG III are likely to have positive effects on
the natural resources, and forestry. The proposed operation continues to support the
Government's efforts to promote a sustainable management of forestry resources. Since 2005,

                                               54 
 
timber exports have been monitored on behalf of the Government by an independent body with
the mandate to ensure compliance with operational requirements from logging sites to export
points. Ensuring transparent information and the integrity of the traceability system of the
logging and commercialization cycle will complement the existing tools such as inspection of
waybills for transportation of timber products, mill entry and exit books, and the cross-checking
of species and volumes of timber exported with the collection of equivalent export taxes. In
addition, the Association, in collaboration with other development partners, is undertaking a
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) to help the Government establish the regulatory,
administrative, and technical capacity to identify, mitigate, and monitor environmental issues in
a sustainable manner.

138. The capacity of the administration has been strengthened through various channels.
Building on the results of the forest sector assistance provided by AFD through the PARPAF
project, which helped establish a forest Geographic Information System (GIS), forest
administration capacity has been strengthened through an agreement signed in 2007 between the
Government and the World Resources Institute (WRI), funded by USAID through the Central
Africa Regional Environmental Program (CAREP). Under this contract, WRI is helping the
forest administration in mapping logging areas, protected areas, as well as hunting and safari
zones, with field inspections being conducted in logging areas by a special unit of the forest
administration. Specific attention is being paid to the monitoring of logging activities and the
enforcement of forest management plans. The system allows the forest administration to
compare timber harvests with the results of forests inventories, monitor skid trails and logging
roads, and check compliance with other management requirements in order to ensure sustainable
management of forest. In addition, an independent monitoring contract with the pre inspection
agency in CAR organized a series of training on methodologies to ensure proper tracking and
identification of illegal logging for the forestry, tax and customs administrations to transfer
knowledge to local staff.

139. The rights of the local population are protected by various mechanisms. Consultative
meetings with neighboring communities prior to granting permits for forest exploitation provide
them with opportunities to express their concerns about traditional forest rights and uses and
indicate their needs for basic socio-economic infrastructure such as classrooms, health centers,
water points and roads. The Government has established a permanent information system to
inform the population about the revenue sharing mechanism between the State and communities
and the amount accruing to them from the proceeds of local taxes paid by operators, which are
used based on investment plans conceived by the local population. Lastly, the new Forest Code
addresses effective compensation and adequate representation of indigenous people.
Establishment of a publicly accessible centralized data on forest management (tax paid,
concession maps production and exports, infractions) will further enhance the transparency of
the information system and further promote the participation of local population in monitoring
activities that affect their lives.

140. The public finance management reforms supported by this operation are unlikely to have
any effects on the environment. A negative effect can be expected if expenditure reforms are
achieved at the cost of cutting on environmental protection and conservation expenditures, which
is not the case under the proposed operation. The measure supported on the revenue side is

                                               55 
 
expected to result in an improved control of tax and customs exemptions, including discretionary
exemptions, which should have a positive effect on the environment as the measure is intended
to ensure that awarded tax and customs exemptions are in line with the country's laws, rules and
regulations. The reform measures relating to the mining and petroleum sectors supported by the
proposed operation are also unlikely to have any effect on the environment. Similarly the
business environment improvement measures supported by this operation are unlikely to have
any negative effect on the environmental and forest clearance processes. Actions to lower the
cost of creating an enterprise and transferring a property will be accompanied by measures to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the environmental agencies.

I.  IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

141. Implementation entity. The Ministry of Planning, Economy and International
Cooperation will be responsible for monitoring the reforms under the proposed operation which
will be described in the Letter of Development Policy as well as for reporting progress and
coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. This ministry was the unit
responsible for coordination and implementation of the activities and reforms under RIBSUP and
EMGRG I and II.

142. Program monitoring and evaluation. As in the first two budget support operations, the
review of the goals of the program will be largely based on relevant and easy-to-monitor
indicators. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements will rely on Government with the aim of
strengthening Government capacity and institutions. CAR has designed a monitoring and
evaluation architecture to follow up on PRSP implementation which covers the whole budget
cycle, from planning to execution. Building on this architecture, the EMGRG III and the
monitoring-evaluation institutional framework for this operation's reforms and activities have
been designed bearing in mind the need : (i) to ensure quality and timely information, (ii) and to
keep involving civil society in the accountability systems. In this regard, an implementation
oversight committee, with the mandate to monitor implementation of policies of the EMGRG III
is in place, with representatives from all line ministries and directorates involved.

143. In parallel collaborative monitoring has progressed among donors, and with Government
support, in the areas of public sector and economic governance, including in the mining and
forestry sectors, transparency and the fight against corruption. In particular, a multi-donor
commission within the CGAB-PRSP undertakes joint missions and holds regular meetings to
coordinate donor's activities in public finance management in the country.

J.  FIDUCIARY ASPECTS 

144. Although much remains to be done, PFM standards have improved over the recent
past. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) completed in FY08 helped assess
fiduciary risks associated with budget support and deepened the dialogue between donors and the
Government on PFM issues. The CFAA developed a joint donor-Government understanding of
the main strengths and weaknesses of the PFM system and has identified a list of prioritized
recommendations based on the capacity of the Government to implement these measures. Budget
implementation and fiscal reporting are at the core of the operation. It also takes into account the
results of a Treasury audit and the 2008 PEFA. The preliminary findings point to systematic

                                                56 
 
underlying problems as well as more punctual shortcomings that are being addressed in this
operation. The Association will be engaged in a very close dialogue with the Government to
agree on necessary remedial actions that insure integrity of public funds.

145. The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the
Central African States. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC was completed on
July 6, 2009. The findings of this assessment indicated that implementation of previous
safeguards recommendations on financial reporting, internal audit and internal control had been
limited, and that the changing risk profile of the BEAC foreign exchange holdings required
further actions to strengthen safeguards at the BEAC. Subsequent to revelation of a fraud in the
Paris office of the BEAC, a series of safeguard measures were agreed between IMF and BEAC
in order to continue with country programs. In December 2009, BEAC adopted an action plan
with the aim of reforming its own governance and strengthening key safeguards. In view of the
delayed implementation of critical actions contained in this plan the IMF decided, in May 2010,
to postpone the IMF reviews of BEAC countries.

K.  DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING 

146. In light of the fiduciary risks associated with the governance and internal control
breakdowns in evidence at the BEAC, the application of additional fiduciary arrangements
is justified as per OP 8.60. A dedicated local currency account will be opened by the authorities
in a commercial bank operating in CAR acceptable to IDA for this operation in order to avoid
channeling the grant through the BEAC while the safeguard situation is being addressed. The
Association will request an audit of the use of the funds to verify that no expenditures from the
negative list are financed from the grant proceeds.

147. The grant will be disbursed in two tranches: the first tranche of SDR 2.9 million (US
$4.4 million equivalent) will be disbursed upon grant effectiveness. The second tranche of an
equivalent amount will be disbursed upon satisfactory implementation of the corresponding
tranche release conditions. The proposed grant will follow the Association's disbursement
procedures for development policy operations. Once the operation is approved by the Board and
the Financing Agreement becomes effective, the proceeds of the grant will be deposited by IDA
in the dedicated local currency account designated by the Recipient, subject to meeting the
tranche release conditions and upon reception of the Recipient's request. The account should be
held in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. As an exception to normal practice, and as OP
8.60 allows, this account will not form part of the country's foreign reserves. The dedicated local
currency account will be used exclusively to finance budgeted expenditures, with the exception
of ineligible expenditures as defined in the Financing Agreement.

148. The Association will request an external audit of the expenditure financed from the
dedicated local currency account to verify its eligibility. If the proceeds of the grant are used
for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, the Association will require,
promptly through a notice, the Recipient to refund an amount equal to the amount of said
payment. Amounts refunded to the Association upon such request shall be cancelled. The
administration of this grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Planning, Economic
Development and International Cooperation.

L.  RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION 

149. The EMGRG III faces significant country, macroeconomic and institutional capacity
risks. These risks reflect the country's fragile security and political situations, as well as risks
associated with the economic and poverty impacts of the global economic slowdown and
flooding.

150. Security risk. The security situation remains fragile and the Government still lacks
control over large parts of the country. There have been clashes between the national armed
forces and a splinter rebel group in the north; banditry remains a major concern in certain rural
regions; and security is threatened in the Eastern part of the country where the LRA rebels
continue to carry out fresh attacks on the population. The intensification of these security threats
could impose trade-offs on expenditure commitments, which may result in lower public
investment. Mitigating factors include the following: the Government has organized a round
table on the reform of the security sector to define strategies for addressing the country's security
challenges and has solicited donors' support to implement security projects aimed at
strengthening the operational capacity of the national armed forces. This support will be critical
in helping the Government regain control over the entire territory. Moreover, with the support of
UNDP, the EU and other donors, the implementation of the DDR is expected to accelerate,
which will help consolidate the peace process and improve the security situation ahead of the
general elections.

151. Political risks. The main political risks are linked to the organization of the presidential
and legislative elections. Initially set for April 25, 2010 the elections have been postponed twice.
In May 2010 Parliament voted to amend the constitution to provide for an extension of the
mandates of President Bozizé and Parliament, which would have expired on June 11, 2010, until
the elections can be held. This amendment, which has been validated by the Constitutional
Court, ensures that there would no constitutional vacuum over the elections period. On July 30,
2010 the government issued a presidential decree which sets the date for the presidential and
legislative elections to January 23, 2011 to permit further progress on the DDR program and to
mobilize additional resources to organize the elections. Civil society, political parties, and rebel
groups participating in the peace process have all agreed to this new date; in addition they have
agreed that the second round of elections should be held on March 20 2011. This consensus
around the election dates bodes well for political stability, which, in turn, should help mitigate
the security risks mentioned above. However, continued uncertainty about the timing of the
elections could impair the implementation of the reform program supported by this operation.
Mitigation factors include: first, the 2010 budget provides for expenditures to implement the
DDR program and organize the elections, and these resources will be complemented by
additional donor support to permit progress on at least the disarmament and demobilization
components of the program, and to operationalize the Independent Electoral Commission.
Second, the EMGRG III is part of a coordinated effort by donors in CAR, including the EU,
AfDB, France, UNDP and the IMF to support the Government in responding to the effects of the
global economic crisis. The General Framework for Budget Support to the PRSP agreed in 2009
will provide the basis for budget support donors to engage the Government on the public finance
reform program. Third, the EMGRG III has been designed as a two-tranche operation to help
maintain the focus on critical reforms and to remain engaged in the policy dialogue with the

                                                 58 
 
authorities before and after the elections. Finally, by helping to protect priority sector spending
the proposed operation will assist the Government in sustaining the implementation of its
poverty reduction strategy, which is also critical to maintenance of political stability.

152. Macroeconomic risk. A prolonged impact of the current global economic slowdown on
exports could lead to slower growth, lower revenue, higher current account deficit, and
deterioration in debt indicators. In addition, continued uncertainty about the elections could deter
investments and delay disbursement under some budget support programs. Mitigating factors are
CAR's recent track record in macroeconomic management, which will help in addressing new
challenges emerging from the global slowdown; the Government's demonstrated commitment to
implement growth enhancing structural reforms; and support pledged by donors, including
through the proposed operation. The Association and the Fund's role in coordinating budget
support from the donor community will be critical in this regard.

153. Institutional capacity risk. Weak institutional capacity and implementation delays that
could arise from these capacity constraints represent a significant risk to the proposed operation.
Despite achievements in terms of building up capacity at the Ministry of Finance, and the
Ministry of Planning, Economy and International Cooperation, constraints to the implementation
of reforms remain owing to weak institutional capacity to prepare, implement, and monitor
reforms. Risk of weak implementation capacity is mitigated by (i) sustaining reforms that have
started generating positive results and for which capacity is strengthening, such as in public
finance management and governance; (ii) concentrating on a limited number of themes/areas;
(iii) ensuring that the most difficult reforms are taken up-front; (iv) donor harmonization, which
reduces the number of activities to be implemented by the Government and help sharpen the
focus of technical assistance; (v) and funding for critical actions.

154. Flood/drought risk. Poor economic performance as a result of drought, floods or other
natural disasters could undermine the mobilization of domestic revenues and slow down poverty
reduction efforts. This risk is being partially mitigated by the government's efforts to enhance its
capacity for disaster management and to strengthen social protection programs. The Bank is also
currently preparing analytical work on drought and flood issues financed by the Global Facility
for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, which will provide a framework for assisting CAR more
effectively.

155. Fiduciary risk. As the CFAA and the PEFA revealed, financial controls in the CAR are
weak. Improvements in fiduciary standards has been a central objective of the RIBSUP and
EMGRG I and II programs, and measures under these programs have allowed for improved
financial control, including the closing of Government accounts in commercial banks,
deployment of treasury agents in all line ministries generating revenues, and operationalizing the
financial control units in line ministries. The proposed EMGRG III will continue to sustain
improvement in budget implementation and fiscal reporting, including in procurement planning
and through strengthened enforcement of the procurement law and regulations. The weak
internal control environment at the BEAC will be mitigated through the opening of a dedicated
local currency account in a commercial bank and a mandatory audit of the flow of funds.

     LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT OF
                THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
                        FOR 2009-2011

A.     Introduction

The Government requests IDA assistance for coping with the economic crisis which has beset
the country since 2008, and which developed into a recession in 2009, the object of this request
being to enable the Government to maintain control over the implementation of its program of
economic reforms. Economic growth dropped from two percent in 2008 to 1.7 per cent in 2009
as a result of the effects of the economic crisis, which threatens to slow the Government's
efforts. To keep the reform program on track, the Government benefits from assistance from its
partners designed to maintain the reform program but especially to prevent any reduction of the
priority expenditures which make it possible to combat poverty and to provide vulnerable
population groups with basic social services. This policy letter summarizes the social context and
the recent evolution of the economy and describes the policies that the Government proposes to
pursue, particularly within the framework of the reforms aimed at (i) improving the management
of public expenditure, (ii) improving economic governance and (iii) promoting the private sector.
The satisfactory implementation of the reforms already undertaken has made it possible to
reestablish the financial equilibria that needed to be consolidated. The recent decision of the IDA
and IMF boards, approving attainment of the Completion Point, is evidence that the measures
already undertaken and implemented constitute a significant step forward and are making it
possible to keep the economy on the right track. The progress posted in the reform field during
the political transition period accordingly now requires that the Government pursue on this track:
(i) maintaining of the dialogue and consolidation of peace; (ii) acceleration of the policies aimed
at ensuring the non-reversibility of the reforms already adopted; (iii) improvement of access for
the population as a whole and particularly the most vulnerable groups to basic social services;
(iv) strengthening of the public investment program with a view to creating development hubs
and promoting local development in general, with emphasis on the emergence of sustainable
economic growth in secondary towns and centers, and (v) improvement of governance and
promotion of the private sector in order to attract more investment and promote sustainable
growth.

The satisfactory results obtained during the transition period should not be allowed to hide the
fact that the CAR's economy is still facing numerous challenges; there are also some significant
opportunities which the country should seize regarding modernization of the economic
environment, production, and vigorous re-entry into regional and international markets. The
current sources of growth are essentially in the agriculture sector, while the other potential
sectors can also contribute if they are supported and encouraged. The authorities believe that the
reforms to be introduced in the agriculture subsectors will make it possible to ensure expansion
of the entire sector with: (i) a more pronounced contribution to growth, and (ii) significant

                                                70 
 
income streams for agricultural producers, especially those operating in rural areas. This
approach will be implemented within the context of a broader strategy aimed at establishing
good governance and development of the private sector, including the mining and forestry
sectors, with a view to further growth and employment creation.

B.     Implementation of the PRSP and Preparation of the Second Poverty Reduction
       Strategy Paper

In September 2007 the Central African Republic adopted its first Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), covering the period 2008-2010. The main strategy thrusts are based on four
pillars, namely: (i) Restoring security, consolidating peace, and conflict prevention; (ii)
Promoting good governance and the constitutional State; (iii) Rebuilding and diversifying the
economy; and (iv) Developing human capital. The Government's policy focuses on reform of the
security sector with a view to restoring peace and security; improvement of public finances in
order to restore to the State the means to perform its functions and to promote economic
governance that frees up economic players; promotion of development hubs with a view to
unleashing the region's economic potential; and finally, improvement of the business
environment with the aim of restarting the economy and promoting the private sector.

The PRSP's implementation period was marked by several crises, including in particular the
energy crisis which hit ENERCA and resulted in extensive power cuts due to breakdowns in the
Boali plant; the sharp increase in oil prices; the marked rise in the cost of staple foodstuffs; and
an international financial and economic crisis which severely slowed economic growth as a
result of its negative impacts on the entire range of productive sectors. The forestry and mining
sectors were particularly hard hit by this latter crisis, with serious repercussions in the
socioeconomic sphere in the regions where these two sectors are the chief sources of
employment and income for the population.

In this difficult context, some significant progress was achieved in the resolution of internal
conflicts, the maintaining of peace, and the consolidation of social cohesion. The Government,
after a series of agreements signed with the different politico-military factions, organized an
Inclusive Political Dialogue (IPD) in December 2008, with the participation of all the country's
active forces (including all shades of political opinion, civil society, armed groups, etc.). The
resolutions resulting from this dialogue paved the way for a calming of the security situation,
commencement of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) process for
former fighters, inclusion in the Government of representatives of all political persuasions
including politico-military movements, adoption of an amnesty law that enabled the return to the
country of political leaders in exile, and the creation of an Independent Electoral Commission
tasked with organizing the 2011 presidential and legislative elections. The efforts made by the
Government in implementing the PRSP in the course of 2008 and the first half of 2009 have
enabled the CAR to attain the Achievement Point set by the strengthened Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Continuing along the path shaped by the guiding principles

                                                71 
 
underlying its development programming, the Government has begun the evaluation process for
PRSP-1 and the formulation of the second-generation PRSP designed to cover the period 2011-
2013. It has also embarked upon a series of consultations with its development partners in order
to ensure consistency between the various cooperation programs and its own national strategy for
alleviating poverty and achieving the MDGs, beyond the 2010 horizon.

The preparation of the second-generation PRSP will be guided by a Steering Committee
responsible for: raising the awareness of all parties involved, conducting and coordinating the
activities connected with the process; ensuring the monitoring and evaluation of the preparation
process for the new PRSP in accordance with the spirit of the instructions and road map given to
all the stakeholders; and producing periodic reports of activities carried out, for submission to the
competent authorities and with distribution to all parties involved. The methodology will follow
two main phases, comprising: (i) evaluation of PRSP-1, and (ii) performance of the specific basic
studies; organization of a forum for commencement of the formulation of PRSP-2 will follow
after the drafting of the document and its adoption.

The mid-term evaluation of PRSP-1, concerning the period of its actual implementation, is
currently being finalized and has identified the approaches to be followed for preparation of
PRSP-2 in order to correct the shortcomings encountered during the implementation of PRSP-1.
To this end the evaluation has focused on, among other things: national ownership and
leadership, the consistency of the PRSP pillars and emphases with the strategic objectives, the
institutional arrangements and implementing mechanism, the financing obtained and actually
disbursed, together with the results and impacts obtained over the implementation period of this
national program. For PRSP-2, the specific studies on the priority topics already identified or
emerging will make it possible to refine the diagnosis and establish strategic aims. These studies
will have to place emphasis on the sources of growth and the key sectors and subsectors
involved, whose support for the reconstitution of the nation's economic fabric needs to be
sustainably strengthened. An approach of this sort will be incorporated in a strategy of global
growth for development, to be implemented over the medium and long term. The analysis of the
profile and determinants of poverty on the basis of the findings of the last household survey will
have to be methodically carried out. The updating of the needs and quantification of the MDGs is
a requirement of the resource-mobilization strategy. The management and coordination of aid
and external financings will also be examined, with a view to facilitating the dialogue between
development partners and the country, since the Central African Republic is now one of the
fragile countries engaged in the international dialogue regarding the effectiveness of aid. The
emerging problems in the socioeconomic field, such as the environment and climate change,
have already been the subject of a series of studies at national level, the findings of which will
have to be taken into account in PRSP-2.

Finally, the formulation of the sector policies will be organized and distributed in the Sector
Technical Committees (STCs), whose grasp of the sectoral strategy questions is one of the most
important positive results obtained in the course of the implementation of PRSP-1. These STCs
                                                 72 
 
will be responsible for: (i) presenting a diagnosis of the sectors considered; (ii) summarizing the
sector guidelines and other policy documents, and (iii) proposing guidelines and concrete
programs for the sector topics. Questions that cut across more than one category, such as gender,
regional integration, the environment and human rights, will receive special attention in the
studies made. The findings and recommendations of the specific studies, nation-wide
consultations and surveys will also be used as a basis for the formulation and drafting of the
proposals of the thematic working groups.

Initially scheduled for delivery at the end of December 2010, the first version of PRSP-2 will
now be made available to the parties involved around the end of March 2011, due to the changes
in the election calendar. Accordingly, consultations with representatives of the National
Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, civil society organizations, and the technical and
financial partners will then be underway. After these meetings, the Government, through the
Technical Committee, will draw up the Priority Action Program (PAP). This program will be
submitted according to the different scenarios used for the macro economic framework. It has to
cover all priority programs (public investments and reforms or other actions) contained in
PRSP-2. It will retrace all priority investments, which will make it possible to render the
measures that will contribute to the implementation of PRSP-2 more visible. The PAP should
establish precise links between the PRSP, the MTEFs, the Public Investment Program, and the
State budget. It will therefore serve to underscore the consistency and alignment of the objectives
sought by the PRSP and the annual budgets of the State.

The financing of the second-generation PRSP will be handled by the budget of the Support
Program for Strengthening the Capacity for Implementation of the PRSP (UNDP's ARCAD),
and the Government up to the limit of its present capacities. A supplementary effort is expected
from the Government, which has also requested assistance from the other development partners.

C.     Macroeconomic and Budgetary Framework

Real GDP rose by 2.4 percent in 2005 and 3.8 percent in 2006, as a result of the prudent policies
followed by the Government and the large-scale reforms which made it possible to establish the
conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. However, the external shocks in 2008 and 2009
caused a reversal of the rising trend underway. As a result the rebound faded, as demonstrated by
the slowing down of economic activity with a distinct reduction in growth rates with effect from
2008. The vulnerability to outside shocks of an undiversified economy, still in a "catch-up"
phase, is a demonstration of the fragility of the gains posted, which is a typical characteristic of
countries in a post-conflict situation whose capacity to withstand such stresses is generally weak
or limited.

Economic growth was again adversely impacted by a series of external shock in 2008 and at the
beginning of 2009. First, there was the increase in food prices as a consequence of soaring oil
prices, then the world financial crisis and the recession that followed it. These events brought

                                                73 
 
about a slow-down of the economy, which posted a real GDP growth rate of 3.7 percent in 2007
and 2.0 percent in 2008. Low external demand due to the crisis, and the marked fall in prices
obtainable for raw materials, resulted in an 18 percent drop in total exports by volume and a 29
percent drop in timber exports, while diamond production and exports fell by 22 percent and 21
percent respectively. These lower figures led to an adjustment of estimated GDP growth for 2008
and 2009, which were initially set at over three percent whereas the final figures were two
percent for 2008 and 1.7 percent for 2009.

In order to contain the impacts of this worldwide recession the Government adopted a set of
supplementary measures; this without deviating from the objectives of the reforms undertaken
since 2005, whose reviews by the IMF and World Bank had enabled the CAR to swiftly attain
the HIPC Initiative's Completion Point. These measures pertained chiefly to the forestry sector,
the standard price being adjusted to take into account the movement of world prices on which
felling duties, reforestation tax and exit duties are calculated. In addition, payment in respect of
surface rights has been spread over nine months instead of requiring one single, immediate
payment at the start of the fiscal year. These measures have helped the forestry companies to
maintain their activities at a minimum level, thereby avoiding having to lay off all the sector's
workers. Nevertheless, although there are some indications of a rebound, the forestry sector
remains fragile with sparsely filled order books. Within the framework of the steps taken in the
2010 finance law to assist the forestry sector, exit duties have been temporarily reduced from
11.5 percent to eight percent for logs and from eight to five percent for sawn timber.

Timber and diamonds account for over 80 percent of the CAR's exports, so their production
largely determines the country's export earnings. Moreover, weak external demand coupled with
the decline in timber and diamond production and the pronounced deterioration in the terms of
trade deriving from the sharp rise in the unit costs of imports caused a current balance deficit
which swelled from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008 and 7.7 percent
in 2009. As a result, gross international reserves stabilized at around 4.1 months of imports in
2009 against 3.2 months of imports at the end of 2008, compared with 2.4 months' worth in
2007. The figure is expected to reach 4.3 months of imports in 2010.

The current balance posted a relative improvement in 2009, due in part to an easing of the terms
of trade. The services balance stabilized at its 2008 level, reflecting the lower interest payments
made as a result of the reduction of the public debt. Current transfers also improved thanks to
budget support received. As a consequence of these developments and the effects induced by the
fall in international oil prices and the rise in the price of diamonds, the current deficit was
reduced from 10.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.7 percent of GDP in 2009.

Budget management has been distinctly improved since 2006, although the mobilization of
domestic revenues remains weak at 10.8 percent of GDP in 2009. Despite the world economic
crisis, the ratio of fiscal revenues has improved and stood at 8.7 percent of GDP in 2009, against
eight percent of GDP in 2008. This sustained improvement has been made possible by the

                                                74 
 
improvements in tax administration, which is now more efficient, and the reform of petroleum
taxation, which is an important source of budget funds. The implementation of these structural
reforms and especially the continuation of the efforts aimed at enlarging the tax base will help to
render the budget more resistant to negative shocks.

On the expenditure side and in response to the worldwide economic recession, fiscal policy in
2010 aims to support global demand while continuing to observe prudence as its watchword and
to adhere to the commitments made to various macroeconomic stabilization programs. The
Government is continuing to pay its employees' wages and salaries on a regular basis, and a
substantial proportion of the wage and salary arrears accumulated under the present regime, i.e.
1.1 percent of GDP in 2009, has been cleared. However, the capital expenditures financed from
domestic resources have been considerably delayed and only executed at a level of 50 percent of
the programmed expenditures, this notwithstanding the revision of the budget in September
2009. For 2010 the Government intends to pay special attention to the priority sectors'
expenditures. In this context, budgetary policy will be moderately expansionist in 2010 and total
expenditures will increase by 3.1 percentage points with respect to GDP and the anticipated
primary deficit will represent 1.5 percent of GDP.

The priority expenditures will increase in 2010 owing to the need and requirement to strengthen
the peace consolidation process and thereby to ensure access to basic social services for the most
vulnerable population groups. The top priorities here comprise implementation of the peace
process, with special emphasis on the DDR program, organization of the elections, and payment
of the invoices for the Government's water and electricity consumption. The State should also
actively pursue settlement of the arrears due to its suppliers, of outstanding wage and salary
arrears, and also overdue pensions. The Government must also remain constant in its efforts to
implement every component of the national poverty reduction strategy by providing funding for
its other commitments.

Regarding the financial sector, the impact of the worldwide economic crisis has been limited in
the CAR due to the low level of integration of the country's economy with the international
financial markets. The banking system was not directly impacted by the world crisis and the
commercial banks' liquidity position has remained intact. However, indirect effects on the main
economic operators and their repercussions on the banks are not out of the question. The
commercial banks hold a considerable quantity of the public debt and, therefore, are vulnerable
to risk of the State defaulting on its payment obligations. Being aware of this situation, in August
2009 the Government signed new debt-restructuring agreements with each of the four local
commercial banks. Performance of these agreements should help to lessen the risk of default by
the State. Recourse to domestic borrowing fell from 23.2 percent of GDP in 2008 to 19.4 percent
of GDP in 2009, following the Government's adoption of a plan for clearing domestic arrears.
Settlement of these arrears is one of the Government's priorities and action to this end will have
to be funded through the budget for 2010.

D.     Program Adopted in the Context of Budget Support

Implementation of the program supported by the Grant forming the subject of this Letter of
Development Policy will have the benefit of helping the Government pursue the rebuilding of the
country on the basis of solid economic pillars. The letter accordingly reiterates in the following
paragraphs the economic performances posted in recent years, and the reforms to be
implemented with a view to modernizing the national economy. The Central African Republic
also requests other contributions from donors for the performance of this program and will need
a frame of reference for a harmonized policy on the donors' part. In this connection, the
Government wishes to obtain intensified coordination by IDA and support from all financial
partners for this budget support and for the PRSP, the revised version of which is currently under
preparation as noted above. The fourth budget support grant from IDA should make it possible to
consolidate the reforms undertaken under the first three such programs, however this one will
focus on: (i) improvement of the management of public finances; (ii) improvement of economic
governance and of the public sector, and thirdly (iii) promotion of the private sector.

The Government initiated the program of budgetary and accounting reforms as of 2005 with the
aim of: modernization of the legal framework of public finances (budget management,
accounting, control); improvement of budget management by means of preparation of a new
budget nomenclature; adoption of a new chart of accounts consistent with OHADA norms;
reorganization of the expenditure channels with a view to reducing budgetary procedures;
improvement of budgetary control; reorganization of State accounts and improvement of
management of accounting; reduction of exemptions; institutional reforms; recovery of State
revenues and control of expenditures; computerization of financial administration by means of
budget execution software; and adoption of a new Public Procurement Code. In addition, the
State has adopted, with the support of its development partners, a strategy and an action plan for
the public finances which mesh with the Government's commitments aimed at establishing an
efficient management system for public finances that will enable progressive achievement of the
MDGs and alleviation of poverty. The specific objectives of the public finances reform strategy
are as follows: (a) maintaining fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability; (b) restoring the
credibility of the budgetary process; (c) ensuring greater accountability in budget performance
(revenues and expenditures), coupled with greater transparency in the budgetary process; (d)
ensuring appropriate allocation and efficient utilization of public funds for the priority sectors in
general, and basic public services in particular; and (e) efficient mobilization of external and
domestic resources for financing the priority expenditures of the PRSP.

Measures taken in the context of the program: For the fourth budget support operation the
Government has adopted employment programs for each priority ministry, validated by the
Minister of State for Planning, Economy and International Cooperation; the corresponding
procurement plans have also been approved. The budget nomenclature has been harmonized with
the chart of accounts adopted in accordance with OHADA norms. In addition, the Minister of
Finance has adopted and published a Government Order (arrêté) defining the eligibility criteria
                                                 76 
 
for settlement of arrears, assigning priority to suppliers to the State, in particular SMEs and
SMIs. Regarding improvement of revenues, the Minister of Finance has adopted a formal
document (cahier de charges) which defines the procedures pertaining to the granting of
exemptions and stipulates the obligation of senior management of the financial authorities
(régies) concerned to forward to the Inter-Ministerial Committee in charge of Fiscal and
Customs Exemptions (CICEFD) the list of all exemptions for verification. Beside verifying and
checking the exemptions, CICEFD will also propose to the Minister of Finance the reforms
necessary for further reducing the exemptions and thereby enhancing revenues. Finally, with a
view to promoting private enterprise a preliminary study aimed at reducing the cost of
establishing businesses and transferring ownership of urban commercial real property has been
started. Some technical reports which have, among other things, identified the costs involved in
starting businesses and the transfer of urban commercial real property, pinpointed the relevant
laws and regulations relating to these costs, and proposed steps to be taken to reduce these costs
by amendment or repeal of said laws and regulations, have been prepared and submitted to the
Joint Committee responsible for Improvement of the Business Environment (CMAEA) chaired
by the Prime Minister.

Measures to be taken in the context of the program: Toward the end of the year and with a
view to disbursement of the second tranche, the Government will submit to the Court of
Accounts the revenue and expenditure account of the State for 2008 and the pertinent
administrative account for review. The Court of Accounts will then publish its report approving
the account for 2008. The Government will also adopt a report evaluating the implementation of
the new Public Procurement Code and will identify the steps needed to correct any shortcomings
observed. In addition, the Government will pay at least CFAF 500 million of arrears due to small
and medium enterprises in accordance with the Order on arrears.

The Government does not propose to limit itself to these reforms but will undertake to pursue or
carry out other reforms to guarantee better budget execution, the preparation of medium-term
expenditure tables consistent with the sector strategies and the PRSP, and the training of senior
staff and of all parties involved in the public expenditure chain. The reform of the Civil Service
was started with audits of certain ministries, after which the Government adopted a single
organization structure for the Service and promulgated a new set of staff regulations (statut) for
the Civil Service. This reform will be continued with the review of Civil Service staffing and the
introduction of a new promotion system.

Regarding the forestry sector: The Government will continue introducing reforms designed to
increase transparency and good governance in the sector, and to favor sustainable management
of forest resources. In the context of the budget support program special emphasis will be placed
on combating illegal forest exploitation. The Government will accordingly adopt a framework
document for a national traceability system and another such document for a system for verifying
the legality of timber production, in accordance with the provisions of Forest Law Enforcement,
Governance and Trade (FLEGT). Effective implementation of the traceability and legality
                                               77 
 
verification systems will contribute to curbing illegal activities and protecting the Central
African forest.

In the downstream petroleum sector: The reforms undertaken so far, implemented in
collaboration with other partners, made it possible in 2008 and 2009 to: (i) lower the State's debt
by over CFAF 4 billion vis-à-vis importers and distributors of petroleum products; (ii)
substantially increase the Treasury's tax revenues by CFAF 16 billion in 2009; and (iii) ensure
stabilization of the petroleum market in the CAR, which has not experienced shortages since
2008. To render this stabilization of the market permanent and with the support of LICUS III, the
Government will proceed to strengthen the present institutional and regulatory framework, which
will be adapted to take account of the CAR's landlocked situation. To this end, the law
organizing the sector will be reviewed in order to clarify the respective roles of the Petroleum
Sector Regulatory Agency (ASRP) and SOCASP (the Central African Storage Company for
Petroleum Products) and to reconsider the formula used to determine the domestic prices of
petroleum products. The Government will also have an audit performed by an independent
auditor to evaluate the use made of the funds generated by the price formula, including their
management by ASRP or by the agencies or bodies holding those funds.

In the mining sector: The Mining Code has been reviewed and the standard agreements
adopted. The first EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) report has also been
adopted utilizing LICUS III financing. LICUS should also help to finance production of the
second report, which the Government would also like to take into account the reviews of
diamond and gold production for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009. The second EITI report will
not only be published on the Government's official websites, but will also be distributed
throughout the entire country. The Government will undertake some other studies as well.

For promotion of the private sector the Government will undertake, with the private sector
operators who are members of CMAEA, the reforms required to reduce the costs associated with
starting businesses and with transfers of ownership of urban commercial real property on the
basis of the technical committees' recommendations.

E.     Institutional Framework for Implementation of the Program

The monitoring of the program will be performed by CTP/PAS in collaboration with the existing
bodies that have participated in the management of the preceding programs, including the two
programs supported by the IMF and the World Bank and the CGAB which also include donors
who provide budget support to the Central African Republic. The CTP/PAS will meet as needed
for monitoring of the bodies involved in the program, and will regularly produce reports that will
be transmitted to the World Bank until the program is concluded. The bodies represented in the
Inter-ministerial Steering Committee comprise the ministries involved in the implementation of
the program and specifically include the Ministries of: Finance and Budget, Planning, Economy



                                                78 
 
and International Cooperation, Mines, Energy and Water management, Water Resources and
Forests, Justice, Trade, SMEs/SMIs and the CMAEA.

F.     Expected Results and Conclusion

The results expected from this program will be consolidation of the progress already achieved,
and ensuring better coordination and harmonization of the development partners' action around
the Government's chief priorities, as described in the PRSP. The performance of this program
will be measured by assessment of improvements in the management of public finances in the
budget and accounting sphere, but also considering the supervision exercised by Parliament over
the execution of the State budget. Greater efficiency in the management of public expenditures
and an increase in domestic revenues will be necessary to ensure effective delivery of basic
services to the population groups targeted. The performance of the program will also be
measured by the degree of improvement in the traceability and verification of the legality of
logging, which will render the forestry sector more productive; greater transparency in the
management of mining revenues; strengthening of the regulatory framework of the downstream
petroleum sector; and a reduction of the costs entailed in starting a business and transferring
urban commercial real property.

The Government attaches importance to the regular production of budget execution reports,
regular production of the Table of Government Financial Operations (TOFE), and annual
production of the annual revenue and expenditure account and of the administrative account to
be submitted for review by the Court of Accounts. Priority will be assigned to management that
is transparent and in accordance with the program objectives, with a view to holding the budget
deficit and the current balance at levels compatible with the public resources as spelled out in the
program with the IMF. The Government is determined to commence the reforms designed to
improve the business environment, which will in turn enable it to improve its ranking in Doing
Business, attract private investment, both national and foreign, especially in the mining and
forestry sectors which could become drivers of growth and promote local development. Finally,
at the level of management of public funds, the Government aims to achieve a marked
improvement in governance and transparency with regard to public procurement in particular.

    IMF Completes Sixth Review Under the Central African Republic's ECF Arrangement
                       and Approves US$13.1 Million Disbursement

Press Release No. 10/318
August 25, 2010

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved today the sixth review
of the Central African Republic (C.A.R.)'s performance under a program supported by the
Extended Credit Facility1. The approval will enable the disbursement of an amount equivalent to
SDR 8.67 million (about US$13.1 million), bringing total disbursements under the program to
an amount equivalent to SDR 69.62 million (about US$104.9 million).

The Executive Board approved a three-year arrangement for an amount equivalent to SDR 36.2
million (about US$ 54.6 million) in 2006 (see Press Release No. 06/299). It approved
augmentations of an amount equivalent to SDR 8.355 million (about US$12.6 million) in June
2008 (see Press Release No. 08/142) and an amount equivalent to SDR 25.065 million (about
US$37.8 million) in June 2009, when it also approved a six-month extension of the arrangement
(see Press Release No. 09/242). Last June the Board approved another six-month extension of
the arrangement.

Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
"The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) authorities are to be commended for the satisfactory
implementation of the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), against the
backdrop of difficult domestic and external challenges.

"The C.A.R. authorities have made further progress under their economic and financial reform
program. The credibility of public finances has improved through domestic revenue
mobilization, prudent budget execution, and reduction of domestic arrears. In part thanks to the
reform measures, the economy now appears to be on its way toward sustainable higher growth.

"The authorities have drawn on the Fund SDR allocation, which has helped replace expensive
commercial bank financing, thus saving budget resources, and strengthening liquidity in the
banking system. The restructuring strategy of one local bank in accordance with international
best standards will be an important step in this process.

"It is important for the economy to continue improving the security situation and maintaining
political stability in the period ahead of the January 2011 general elections. Donor funding for
the peace building process and elections is essential. Enhanced donor financial and technical
support is also needed to help the authorities build economic management capacity and address
critical infrastructure bottlenecks.

"The C.A.R. authorities need to continue their reform efforts to accelerate growth, strengthen
competitiveness, and to mobilize resources required for poverty reduction while keeping debt
sustainable. The authorities need to continue to focus on efficient government revenue
mobilization, prudent expenditure and debt management, business climate improvement, and the
promotion of private sector activities including through better access to credit and
diversification of exports. Resuming regular and automatic fuel price adjustment to avoid
subsidies will be important," Mr Portugal added.

 . The Extended Credit Facility (ECF) has replaced the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) as the Fund's main tool for medium-term financial support to low-income countries by
providing a higher level of access to financing, more concessional terms, enhanced flexibility in
program design features, and more focused streamlined conditionality. Financing under the ECF
currently carries a zero interest rate, with a grace period of 5½ years, and a final maturity of 10
years. The Fund reviews the level of interest rates for all concessional facilities every two years.
