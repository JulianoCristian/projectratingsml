Fund", "versiontyp": "Gray cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Third Economic\n            Management and Governance Reform Grant Project for the\n            Central African Republic (CAR) were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            development policy operation can be an effective instrument\n            for addressing key issues in restoring a functional\n            government and contribute to setting the stage for deeper\n            reforms. A programmatic series of DPOs may be better than\n            stand-alone Development Policy Operations (DPOs), which may\n            provide a timely response to exogenous shocks but could lead\n            to inappropriate sequencing of the reforms over the medium\n            term. Going forward the new DPO series should seek to link\n            more strongly the public sector and economic governance\n            reforms with measures to promote private sector development.\n            A two-tranche budget support operation can be effective in\n            supporting the continuation of reforms, especially in\n            fragile countries. The project, a two-tranche grant\n            disbursing on agreed conditions, helped maintain the focus\n            on critical reforms and ensured that the Bank remain engaged\n            in policy dialogue with the authorities before and after the\n            elections. The second tranche helped support the\n            government's efforts to restore fiscal discipline\n            following election-related slippages. Its disbursement\n            helped clear arrears which, in turn, permitted other donors\n            including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the\n            African Development Bank to move forward with their support\n            program. In a fragile post-conflict country such as the CAR,\n            Technical Assistance (TA) should be available to help\n            implement the reform program supported by the DPO and build\n            up capacity in key areas. TA should promote synergies and\n            built on them. The policy measures under the project that\n            were most successfully implemented were those that benefited\n            from greater cooperation among the departments and units\n            concerned. To help build robust budget processes, reforms\n            should be closely monitored and a close dialogue with the\n            government should be maintained through frequent supervision\n            missions and a strong field presence."}, "docdt": "2012-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
