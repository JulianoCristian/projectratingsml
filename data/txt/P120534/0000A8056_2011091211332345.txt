                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The grant implementation has been delayed in part due to the lengthy electoral process, with three postponements of legislative and presidential elections. Elections were finally held
                         in January 2011but some seats in parliament require a second round of voting. Affected by a lengthy process of forming a new government, the macroeconomic policy framework

                         deteriorated as a result of extra-budgetary spending and non observance of the national procedures for accounting, which translated in a deteriorated fiscal position. In order to
                         ensure project objectives are achievable, authorities have to make further progress to complete the remaining second-tranche conditions and they should also take appropriate
                         corrective measures to restore fiscal discipline over the next 2-3 months, including by regularizing expenditures. To date, five of the eight second-tranche conditions have been
                         completed including: (i) payment of arrears to small and medium enterprises, (ii) report assessing compliance with the new procurement Code, (iii) adoption of a framework for the
                         national tracking system and for a national system of verification of the legality of timber productions, (iv) publication of the EITI report covering 2007, 2008 and 2009 was published
                         on CAR EITI’s website (http://www.itierca.org/), (v) administrative costs for the creation of business and costs of the transfer of urban commercial property have been reduced by fifty
                         percent through amendment of provisions included in the Budget law for 2011

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The second tranche for an amount of SDR2.9 is currently closing on September 30, 2011 but the authorities may need more time to complete the remaining actions and convincingly
                         restore fiscal discipline, in line with program objectives, and have accordingly requested another extension of the grant closing date. Arrangements are already being made to swiftly
                         fulfill the remaining three conditions including: (i) - the submission of the 2008 budget review law (Loi de Reglements) to the parliament, (ii) - the audit of the use of funds by ASRP
                         and (iii) - the adoption of the legislation on the downstream petroleum sector. A recent assessment of the ongoing work to complete the triggers suggests that implementation of the
                         remaining triggers is well advanced. The draft budget execution law is ready for a transmission to the new parliament. The draft of the legislation for the review of the downstream
                         petroleum sector has been prepared and it is ready for signature but would need further consultations with all stakeholders. The audit report of the use of funds by CAR’s Petroleum
                         Regulatory Agency has been submitted to relevant agencies and administration for comments. These arrangements aiming to fulfill the remaining actions are satisfactory but the
                         authorities also have to take steps to implement the recommendations of all reports issued under this program and address fiscal management weaknesses before the second
                         tranche can be released. For the latter, The Government would need to address the fiscal slippages over the next 2-3 months including: payment of arrears to external creditors,
                         reactivate the petroleum price mechanism adjustment, and make operational the liquidity commission to ensure that budget is executed according to national procedures and
                         standard principles. In order to prevent program slippages in the future, the Government should also ensure that the new monitoring committee (STP-REF) is operational with
                         competent staffs in charge and well equipped.
