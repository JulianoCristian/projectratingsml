(ICR) of the Adjustment Loan for the Polish\n            agriculture sector. The objectives of the project were to i)\n            maintain an adequate macroeconomic framework for\n            agriculture, including appropriate price and subsidy\n            policies and a coherent trade policy framework; (ii) carry\n            out urgent sector reforms, including the privatization and\n            restructuring of State Owned Enterprises (SOE) and state\n            farms; (iii) create an enabling environment for private\n            entry and competitive operation in agri-processing and\n            marketing; (iv) formulate a long-term land policy for\n            private farms; and (v) implement a very comprehensive\n            program of legal or regulatory reforms and institution\n            building measures, to convert the role and functions of\n            Government from management to monitoring and support.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was highly satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (i) experience since 1989 has failed to\n            confirm the expectation that the agricultural sector's\n            growth and export potential could somehow be easily\n            harnessed to lead the economy out of the transition\n            recession; (ii) it is apparent that agricultural recovery in\n            the transition economies, more so than recovery in other\n            real sectors, is severely inhibited by an unstable economy;\n            (iii) the lack of real progress in reforming rural financial\n            markets, since the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL)\n            was designed has tended to leave smaller farmers behind in\n            the adjustment process; (iv) competent expertise should be\n            available to give technical assistance in the formative\n            stages of an ambitious reform program like the one embodied\n            in the Medium Term Sector Adjustment Program (MTSAP); (iv)\n            it is probably wishful to hope that such a unit can be\n            institutionalized with a special salary scale and with\n            professional credibility while remaining above the daily\n            affairs and internal politics of its parent ministry; (v)\n            the main issues in regard to loan format concern its\n            replicability and its content; and (vi) conceptualization\n            and the design of the ASAL's policy package were\n            grounded in extensive Borrower participation, and systematic\n            efforts to involve other members of the international\n            financial community."}, "docdt": "1997-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
