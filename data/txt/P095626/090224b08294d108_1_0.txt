Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The objectives of the second phase APL are: (i) increase access to Family Health-based primary care in large, urban municipalities; (ii) raise the
 technical quality of and patient satisfaction with primary care; and (iii) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Family Health service providers as
 well as the broader delivery system.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The Second Family Health Extension Project (PROESF) was approved by the Board on April 25, 2008, signed on September 9, 2009 and became
 effective on October 15, 2009. As of June 16, 2014 US$42.4 million or 51 percent of loan proceeds have been disbursed. No additional disbursements
 are expected.

 Progress toward the achievement of the PDO at this final stage of project implementation is rated based on the overall performance of the project,
 taking into account achievement of targets across all project indicators as well as project relevance today and the efficiency with which it has been
 implemented. This is in line with how the Implementation Completion Report and IEG would access overall outcomes. In addition, the PDO rating
 reflects the extent to which the project has directly contributed to achieving the stated outcomes. On the basis of this assessment, the PDO has been
 downgraded. In terms of meeting outcome targets, the Project has not succeeded in reversing the decline relative to 2012 figures in the PDO indicator
 on number of per capita contacts with primary care providers; the PDO indicator on infant mortality has met the target ahead of schedule. Eleven out of
 17 intermediate indicators have been met. In terms of Relevance, while the objectives of the operation are still relevant, relevance of design and
 implementation is considered Modest, as reflected by a design (particularly of the project’s largest component) that is outdated given the evolution of the
 Government’s program and due to implementation bottlenecks observed throughout the life of the project. Efficiency is likewise rated as Modest given
 that at project closing only 51% has been disbursed due to major delays in critical procurement items. Lastly, while the project has nominally met
 targets, the actual achievements cannot be attributed solely to to this project given its relatively small contribution to the overall objectives.

 Overall Comments
 Though the target of 1.8 per capita contacts with primary care providers (PDO Indicator 2) was only marginally not met, it is worrisome that the
 upward trend has reversed with the number of contacts per capita declining from 1.8 in 2012 to 1.7 at last reporting. These latter figures should,
 however, be interpreted with caution as it is a partial reporting based on data from the old information system, which is gradually being replaced.
 No data was reported for municipalities that have already migrated to the new system; this may bias results downward because better performing
 municipalities may be more likely to migrate early.

               Comments
               47% of municipalities implemented telesaude serving 3,979 family health teams. Only partial data was provided so the indicator could not
               be calculated.




 Overall Comments
 Data provided for this indicator was incomplete, therefore, the proportion of basic health units that have implemented Telessaude cannot be
 calculated.
