as\n            follows: outcomes were unsatisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: a programmatic, medium-term\n            approach to financing can be very valuable to help\n            establish, and provide medium- to long-term continuity to a\n            government program. Even though a project or program\n            supported by a World Bank-financed operation does not\n            produce measurable, satisfactory outcomes, it can still have\n            a major demonstrative impact. Project implemented in federal\n            frameworks, involving three levels of government, should\n            consider more flexible procurement arrangements for the\n            acquisition of relatively small goods and services.
