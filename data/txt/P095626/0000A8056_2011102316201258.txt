                         The objectives of the second phase APL are: (i) increase access to Family Health-based primary care in large, urban municipalities; (ii) raise the technical quality
                         of and patient satisfaction with primary care; and (iii) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Family Health service providers as well as the broader delivery
                         system.

                         The population coverage by PROESF increased rapidly in the initial phase and continues to grow in the second phase, but at a much slower rate (5 percent per annum). From 2009

                         outcome targets were set in the Project Appraisal Document for this second phase of the program, the Ministry of Health established the following goals: (i) a 5% reduction of infant
                         mortality in participating municipalities, and (ii) an increase of 5% in the number of family health visits per capita in these municipalities. The first goal has been achieved--a 22%
                         reduction in 2009, according to data provided by municipalities--and surpasses the target set for phase 3. The second target, which translates into 1.5 consultations per capita per
                         year, was not met; it fell from 1.4 to 1.1 consultations per capita per year.
