                         of May 2, 2013 US$38.4 million or 46 percent of loan proceeds have been disbursed. A level II Project restructuring was approved on March 14, 2013 and included (i) a revision and
                         update of the Monitoring and Results Framework, (ii) a reallocation of loan proceeds to the federal component (component 3), and (iii) an extension of the Project closing date by 21

                         The population coverage by PROESF increased rapidly in the initial phase and continues to grow in the second phase, but at a slower rate (currently at 5 percent per annum). From
                         2009 to 2011, coverage in participating municipalities increased from 36.4% to 40.6% of the population (based on latest available verified data, December 2012), exceeding the

                         phase 2 target of 37%. Average coverage is higher among participating municipalities than non-participating ones.

                         One of the two Program outcome indicators - decrease of infant mortality per 1,000 live births in participating municipalities - has already been achieved. Most intermediate results
                         indicators (PDIs) are on track or have been achieved, including the establishment of a results-based management system at the federal level, linking finances to states and
                         municipalities, establishing performance agreements, and almost 100 percent of states and municipalities participating in quality assessment programs. Other intermediate results
                         already achieved include an increase in Family Health Program (PSF) teams applying quality evaluation instruments from 7 percent (2006) to 75 percent (2011), and an increase in
                         the proportion of patients with hypertension registered by PSF teams from 23 percent (2006) to 51 percent (2012).
