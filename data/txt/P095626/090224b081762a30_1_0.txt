                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The population coverage by PROESF increased rapidly in the initial phase and continues to grow in the second phase, but at a much slower rate (5 percent per annum). From 2009
                         to 2011, coverage in participating municipalities increased from 36.4% to 39.5% of the population (based on latest available verified data, December 2011), exceeding the target for
                         phase 2 (37%); average coverage is higher among participating municipalities than non participating ones. Though no specific outcome targets were set in the Project Appraisal
