                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The population coverage by PROESF increased rapidly in the initial phase and continues to grow in the second phase, but at a much slower rate (5 percent per annum). From 2009
                         to 2010, coverage in participating municipalities increased from 36.4% to 39.4% of the population, exceeding the target for phase 2 (37%); average coverage is higher among
                         participating municipalities than non participating ones. Though no specific outcome targets were set in the Project Appraisal Document for this second phase of the program, the

                         Ministry of Health established the following goals: (i) a 5% reduction of infant mortality in participating municipalities, and (ii) an increase of 5% in the number of family health visits per
                         capita in these municipalities. The first goal has been achieved--a 22.5% reduction in 2009, according to data provided by municipalities--and surpasses the target set for phase 3.
                         Most results indicators for components one and two are on track; achievement of component three indicators are lagging.
