1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.        In March 2002, the World Bank’s Board approved the three-phase, seven-year
US$550 million Brazil Family Health Extension Adaptable Program Lending (PROESF,
the Program), 1 together with a US$68 million loan in support of the Program’s Phase 1
(PROESF 1). The Program was meant to improve utilization and quality of publicly-
financed health services by: (i) expanding and consolidating coverage of the Government
of Brazil’s (GOB) Family Health Program (Programa Saúde da Família - PSF) in about
187 municipalities, establishing well-articulated referral and counter-referral systems, and
introducing performance-based financing and management arrangements; (ii) establishing
family health as a core element of health professional and para-professional training; and
(iii) strengthening Ministry of Health (MOH) capacity to monitor and evaluate PSF health
services, policies and training activities on a systematic basis.

2.      PROESF 1 closed on June 30, 2007 with satisfactory outcomes. 2 Phase 1 focused
on extension of population coverage, establishment of a federal transfer mechanism in
support of program-financed investments, pre-service and in-service training of family
health professionals and para-professional, development and testing of a performance-
based financing and management system, design of a quality assessment system,
strengthening of a monitoring system, collection of baseline data for impact measurement,
and development of protocols for referrals and care practices for PSF teams.

3.     With originally established policy and implementation triggers substantially met, 3
a US$83.45 million loan in support of the Program’s Phase 2 (PROESF 2) was approved
by the Board on April 25, 2008. PROESF 2 would build upon the accomplishments of
PROESF 1, while strengthening the quality of PSF care and states’ capacity to monitor and
evaluate PSF services. Beyond supporting continued extension of coverage in the 187
Phase 1 municipalities, PROESF 2 would support quality improvements, strengthen the
capacity of states to monitor and evaluate PSF, introduce the developed performance-based
financing mechanism between the federal government and participating states and
municipalities, and develop and test a results-based management system for PSF teams.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

4.     Brazil had made significant progress in human development since PROESF was
approved in 2002. While Brazil had achieved impressive gains in poverty and inequality


1
  Adaptable Program Lending (APL) was a World Bank’s lending instrument used to support long term
programs.
2
  World Bank, Implementation Completion and Results Report on a Loan in the amount of US$68.0 million
to the Federative Republic of Brazil in Support of the First Phase of the Family Health Extension Adaptable
Lending Program, Report No. ICR0000693, dated December 21, 2007.
3
  The trigger related to “an average of 35 percent of population in participating urban municipalities
registered with Family Health teams” was substantially met. At the outset of PROESF 1, the Government of
Brazil decided to expand the number of participating municipalities from 40 to 187, nearly quadrupling the
population base, but resulting in 34 percent coverage falling short of the 35 percent coverage target.


                                                    1
reduction, challenges remained. Poverty had decreased in the twelve years preceding
PROESF 2 approval. Using reference lines for Brazil’s Bolsa Família program and the
Brasil Sem Miséria Plan to track the evolution of poverty, between 1995 and 2012, extreme
(R$70) and moderate poverty (R$140) fell from 10 percent to 4.3 and 24.6 to 9.4 percent. 4
While the population’s health status had improved significantly, the PROESF 2 Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) highlighted the following shortcomings: (a) inequalities in
health status, health financing and service utilization among regions, states and
municipalities, income groups and between urban and rural areas; (b) inefficiencies in the
health care delivery system that remained hospital- and specialty-centric; and (c) quality
and effectiveness problems including the under-provision of health promotion and
prevention interventions, weaknesses in the referral system, lack of dissemination and use
of cost-effective treatments, and the absence of functional networks to facilitate the
application of case management across all levels of care.

5.      Brazil had implemented major health reforms, starting in 1988, which had
transformed the organization, financing and provision of health services, and created the
Unified Health System (Sistema Único da Saúde - SUS), while transferring responsibility
to the sub-national level. However, although states and municipalities had supported the
reforms with financial buy-in, low managerial capacity and a lack of performance
orientation compromised their ability to make continued gains. Setting performance
benchmarks regarding efficiency, effectiveness and quality, providing financial incentives
to achieve them, and monitoring and evaluating results were identified in the PAD as
important next steps in the reform process.

6.      The PSF was introduced in 1994 as the MOH’s flagship program and main strategy
for extending primary care, defining health priorities, and ultimately, improving health
outcomes. As a community-based, outreach-oriented primary health care model with
multi-professional teams delivering primary health care interventions and prevention to
households and communities, PSF is a departure from earlier, traditional primary care
approach. PSF teams serve as gateways to higher-level services, and are responsible for
enrolling a given number of families within a defined catchment area, and monitoring their
health status, risks and needs. PSF seeks to implement three essential attributes of primary
health care: first point of access, continuity of care, and coordination with the health
system. The program focuses primarily on maternal and child health interventions and
prevention and early treatment of a few noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as
hypertension and diabetes. PSF teams (consisting of a family health physician or generalist,
a nurse, nursing assistant, community health workers, and, in some cases, dental health
professionals) act as the entry point to the health system, both through outreach activities

  While Brazil does not have official poverty lines, the lines used for Bolsa Família and Brasil Sem Miséria
are frequently referred to in government documents and often serve as a de facto official poverty rate. Due
to slight differences in poverty lines and calculation methodologies, poverty rates may differ from official
numbers.



                                                     2
(e.g., household visits and community-wide health promotion events) and directing
patients to higher-level services as needed.

7.      PSF’s population coverage had increased to 45 percent by 2005, with 50 percent
coverage in municipalities under 100,000 inhabitants, and for nearly all rural areas. Further,
early research findings indicated that PSF had a positive impact on health outcomes,
including in terms of decreases in infant mortality, higher immunization rates, and
reduction in hospital admissions for preventable diseases, among others. Still, PSF
coverage lagged in the 250 large, urban municipalities (over 100,000 inhabitants), where
over 90 million people (60 percent of Brazil’s population) resided. Further, the program
faced several challenges, including: (i) low productivity of health teams contributing to
long queues; (ii) difficulties in converting traditional primary care units to the family health
approach; (iii) low prestige of family health practice among physicians, contributing to
turnover; (iv) poor quality of some health professionals; (v) weak referral systems; (vi)
lack of information on quality of care, efficiency and costs; and (vii) absence of
performance orientation at the service delivery level.

8.      Rationale for the World Bank Involvement. The rationale for involvement was
strong as the World Bank had supported the reform of Brazil’s health sector through a
series of investment and policy loans since its early stages. The Adaptable Program
Lending (APL), through PROESF 1, had already contributed to an expansion of the PSF
from 32 to 45 percent of the population. And, although World Bank financing represented
only about five percent of federal financing, it had provided significant leverage to further
the GOB’s reform agenda, as Project financing was additional to the regular federal
transfers, and most municipalities complemented financing with their own investment
resources. MOH studies had shown that PSF coverage increased in municipalities that had
participated in the Program, while coverage decreased in those that had not participated.
The expansion of primary care coverage helped to reduce inequalities and costly
inefficiencies in Brazil’s previous hospital-centered delivery system. Finally, PROESF had
promoted improvements in health system governance by specifying performance targets,
linking federal financing to performance, strengthening monitoring and promoting
systemic evaluation. Based on the PROESF 1 experience, the MOH approved regulation
that tied increases in federal grant financing for primary care to the achievement of
performance targets negotiated between the MOH and municipalities. PROESF 2 would
continue to build on this experience, introducing more advance mechanisms linking
financing to performance, providing incentives for municipalities to continuously improve
coverage and quality, and rolling out the innovative quality assessment and monitoring
systems that had been developed and tested under PROESF 1.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

9.     The Project Development Objectives (PDO) of PROESF 2 were to: (i) increase
access to Family Health-based primary care in large, urban municipalities; (ii) raise the
technical quality of and patient satisfaction with primary care; and (iii) improve the




                                               3
efficiency and effectiveness of Family Health service providers as well as the broader
delivery system. 5

10.    Progress towards the PDO was to be measured by the following APL program and

5
  The wording of the PDO in the Loan Agreement was slightly different, although broadly consistent with
that in the Project Appraisal Document. It read: The objectives of the Project are to: (a) increase access to
family health-based primary care in Eligible Municipalities (defined as “any of the municipalities with
100,000 or more inhabitants eligible for participating in Part 1 of the Project in accordance with the
requirements of the Operational Manual”); (b) improve the technical quality of, and patient satisfaction with,
primary care; and (c) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of family health service providers as well as
the broader delivery system.

  There are minor differences in the indicators, and in their wording, as presented in the Project Appraisal
Document on page 11 and in Annex 3. The Section above lists the Intermediate Results Indicators as they
appear in Annex 3.

For the Federal Ministry of Health
   16. Establishment of a results-based management system that links project financing to
       states and municipalities along the following dimensions: objectives, performance
       indicators, outputs, inputs, investment priorities and spending; this would include
       integrated information system, manual to support implementation, and monitoring
       of implementation of a results-based management system.
   17. PSF costs collected and analyzed, cost accounting system developed and
       implemented.

   22. Percentage of ESF implement results-based management system, including the
       signing of performance contracts.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.    The Project’s PDO was not revised. The Results Framework, including
Intermediate Results Indicators, baseline and targets, was revised in a Level 2 Project
Restructuring in March 2013 to increase clarity and reduce repetition by improving the
accuracy of indicator definitions and data.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     Like PROESF 1, the Project was not targeted specifically at low-income
beneficiaries since the PSF model aimed at providing primary health care for Brazil’s entire
population. Nevertheless, while access is universal, the Project was expected to benefit
mainly low-income populations that rely heavily on public providers, particularly for
health care, and therefore represented the main users of the SUS. One of PROESF’s goals
was to reach populations with limited access to and underutilization of primary health care



                                              5
services. There was already substantial PSF coverage among small municipalities with
large rural areas, as these had been the focus of the program’s initial scale up because of
the absence of providers, low population density and political interest in those areas.
PROESF 2 was to support further coverage extension exclusively in 187 municipalities
with over 100,000 inhabitants that had participated in Phase 1. About 38 percent of those
in the poorest income quintile lived in urban areas, and health indicators among the urban
poor were as bad as or worse than indicators among the rural poor. PROESF 2 would also
support states to provide technical assistance, training and managerial support to small
municipalities in rural areas, and to the MOH in strengthening the Program’s systems and
its ability to provide support to states and municipalities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13.     The Project included three components: (1) expansion and consolidation of Family
Health care in municipalities over 100,000 inhabitants that participated in Phase 1; (2)
strengthening state capacity for technical support, supervision, and monitoring of family
health services; and (3) strengthening federal policy and technical support to, and oversight
of the family health program. Municipalities and states were to submit subprojects
prepared by them on the basis of their needs for financing and implementation under
Components 1 and 2. The concept involved linking levels of financing to levels of
performance in terms of coverage extension, quality improvement, efficiency, and
fiduciary actions. The accountability arrangement consisted of signed management
contracts that specified performance indicators, as well as spending and implementation
plans. Performance was to be assessed at subprojects mid-term and conclusion.
Performance levels achieved at mid-term would determine financing levels for the
subsequent 18 months of execution. Performance levels achieved at the conclusion of the
APL Phase 2 would determine municipal and state participation as well financing levels in
APL Phase 3 (Section 2.1). The full Project description is presented in Annex 10 and
summarized below.

14.     Component 1: Expansion and Consolidation of Family Health Care in
Municipalities (US$133.45 million Total Cost, US$55.0 million Loan Financing).
Component 1 would support scaling up and strengthening PSF capacity at the municipal
level, in 187 municipalities (out of 250 municipalities) with populations over 100,000.
Coverage extension activities, aimed at raising PSF population coverage from about 34 to
37 percent would continue to focus on large urban areas that are characterized by poorly
integrated, traditional delivery system, with large numbers of families living in poverty and
confronting severe social risks.

15.     Component 2: Strengthening State Capacity for Supervision, Monitoring and
Technical Support of Family Health Services (US$17.45 million Total Cost, US$12.45
million Loan Financing). Component 2 would strengthen state capacity to: (i) support
municipalities extend coverage, improve technical quality, and manage service delivery,
with a special focus in municipalities with less than 100,000 inhabitants; (ii) improve the
quality of family health human resources; and (iii) conduct monitoring and supervision as
key functions of state health secretariats. The component would finance goods, materials,



                                             6
training and technical assistance for activities implemented by 26 states and the Federal
District.

16.      Component 3: Strengthening Federal Oversight of the Family Health
Program (US$15.8 million Total Cost, US$16.0 million Loan Financing). Component 3
aimed at strengthening PSF oversight capacity at the federal level, by strengthening the
MOH’s capacity to provide support to states and municipalities in implementing
Components 1 and 2. This component was to finance goods, training, technical assistance
and Project incremental operational costs for the development of PSF accountability
arrangements, including results-based financing and management, and support the states
and municipalities to develop training programs, research, monitoring and evaluation
arrangements, and coordination and supervision capacity. It would also finance research
and evaluative studies on specific aspect of PSF service organization and delivery as well
as institutionalize primary care/PSF impact evaluation in the MOH. Several activities were
to support implementation of interventions under Components 1 and 2.

1.6 Revised Components

17.      The Project’s components were not revised, although new activities were included
under Component 3. The Project restructuring in March 2013 (Section 1.3) introduced two
new activities—both consistent with the PDO—for financing under Component 3: an
international seminar of primary care, and deployment of e-SUS-AB. Deployment of the
e-SUS-AB entailed implementation of electronic medical records, including patients’
medical and health service history, inventory control of pharmaceuticals and supplies,
appointment scheduling, among other data of every primary care health unit. The two new
activities were in support of the new National Primary Care Policy (Section 2.2), and
represented an important attempt to adjust PROESF 2 to the Government’s new priorities.
The restructuring also reallocated about US$30 million from amounts allocated to
municipalities under Component 1 (Category of Expenditure 2) and to states under
Component 2 (Category of Expenditure 3) to Component 3 to finance these new activities.

1.7 Other significant changes

18.     The closing date was extended by 21 months from March 30, 2013 to December
31, 2014 to allow the Government sufficient time for implementation and goal achievement
of activities under Component 3 of the Project.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     As the second phase of an APL, the Project was prepared in a relatively short period,
from Concept Review on March 1, 2006 to Appraisal in December 2006. PROESF 1 was
still under implementation, and preparation of PROESF 2 was carried out together with
final supervision of the first phase project. Negotiations took place only in March 2008,
one year after the World Bank had sent the invitation to negotiate. The US$83.45 million



                                             7
loan was approved by the Board on April 25, 2008, and signed almost 17 months after that.
Delays in signing can be partially explained by a procurement issue not related to the
Project – the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts (Tribunal de Contas da Uniao – TCU)
issued Acórdão No. 2690/2008, which prevented the Borrower to adhere to the World Bank
procurement rules. 7 This fact made the Federal Government stop authorizing signing of
any new external financed loan until May 2009, when the Acórdão was suspended. The
Loan Agreement became effective on October 15, 2009, right before completing the 18-
month deadline after Board approval.

20.     World Bank support to the Government’s Project preparation efforts was provided
largely by the same team that had prepared and supervised PROESF 1. As a result, the
Project’s preparation and design benefited from the lessons learned of PSF’s earlier
implementation, which were described in detail in the PAD. PROESF 2 was an appropriate
use of the APL instrument to support a program that needed a long-term horizon required
to meet its objectives. The Project built upon the positive experience of PROESF 1, while
further refining and adjusting the Program’s structure and indicators to improve and better
measure outcomes. For example, implementation under Phase 1 identified the need for a
permanent cadre of federal- and state-based technical and fiduciary personnel to provide
support to participating municipalities. This was important for municipalities with low
capacity (as reflected in technical and fiduciary assessments of performance during Phase
1), for which capacity-building plans would be developed and implemented. PROESF 2
design gave states a greater role in monitoring program and project performance, and in
providing technical and fiduciary support to participating municipalities under their
jurisdiction. States were eligible for financing (under Component 2) to strengthen their
capacity to carry out these and other functions.

21.     PROESF 2 maintained, but further improved, the Program’s results-based
financing system to stimulate performance of participating states and municipalities.
Financing continued to be linked to levels of performance in terms of coverage extension,
quality improvement, efficiency and fiduciary actions. Signed management contracts
between the MOH and the states and participating municipalities would specify a more
manageable (than in Phase 1) number of easily verifiable performance indicators, as well
as spending and implementation plans, that would be monitored at mid-term and
conclusion, with subsequent levels of financing determined by performance. 8 Initial levels



7 With respect to the TCU decision on the need to provide detailed budgets to the bidders, the World Bank
shared its concern through a letter to the Borrower dated February 4, 2009. Confidentiality of the bids is a
policy requirement of the World Bank under paragraph 2.47 and 2.31 of the Procurement Guidelines for
Goods and Works and Consultant’s Services respectively.
8
  The performance-based financing scheme involved one health (coverage) indicator and another composite
indicator that was to measure efficiency, effectiveness and fiduciary improvement. Municipalities could
increase their subproject financing by up to 2.5 times its original amount by complying with benchmarks,
thereby providing a strong incentive to comply with performance indicators. Municipalities could also be
awarded an additional 15 percent of financing by achieving targets linked to “elective” indicators.
Conversely, poor performance could result in downgrading, and continued non-performance could result in
exclusion from Project financing. A similar scheme based on different indicators was to be applied to the
states under Component 2.


                                                     8
of financing to municipalities would be determined on the basis of performance under
PROESF 1, thereby avoiding delays in initial implementation. In addition to linking
payments to levels of performance as under PROESF 1, results-based financing under the
Project would provide bonus payments for achievement of performance targets tied to
“elective” indicators, eligibility criteria 9 and exclusion for non-execution.

22.     Phase 2 was also to continue the successful pooled financing approach whereby
loan financing was comingled with two large primary health care incentives--Piso de
Atenção Básica (PAB) fixo and PAB variável, which are the main sources of federal
funding for primary care. 10 The pooling of World Bank and GOB funding would offer
several advantages, including that it would: (i) allow for a single procurement, financial
management and monitoring system, reducing the transaction costs of parallel systems; (ii)
direct GOB and World Bank efforts to technical and fiduciary oversight, monitoring and
strengthening of the larger PSF program rather than ring-fencing a much smaller World
Bank-financed project; (iii) insert the Project into a high-priority programmatic and policy
framework; and (iv) create an opportunity to link both World Bank and GOB financing to
results. Approximately 65 percent of loan financing would be allocated through municipal
subprojects (Component 1), and about 15 percent to state subprojects (Component 2),
pooled with the MOH’s regular transfers.

23.     As support to an ongoing and well-established GOB program, PROESF 2 counted
upon the Government’s full ownership and financial commitment. Family health,
particularly expansion of PSF coverage in urban municipalities, was undoubtedly the
highest priority for the SUS. Further, the roles and responsibilities of the different levels
of government were clearly defined. Government budgetary allocations to PSF had
increased by 10 percent annually between 2001 and 2006, and the World Bank’s loan
represented a small fraction of overall PSF financing. In additions, the PSF had been
discussed and strongly endorsed by stakeholders at the state, municipal and local levels,
and the priorities and indicators to measure progress were defined based on consultations
with these groups.

2.2 Implementation

24.     Several issues impacted the implementation of PROESF 2 that resulted not only in
implementation difficulties in terms of contracting by states and municipalities, but also
and more importantly, the Project’s design losing relevance. Despite initial delays, early
implementation proceeded smoothly. A change in administration at the federal level,
resulted in greatly increased priority to primary health through a new National Primary


9
  Eligibility criteria for continued project participation for states and municipalities included: (i) presence of
a full-time coordinator for family health and primary care; (ii) application of Project financing to investments
and costs involved in primary care expansion and quality improvement; and (iii) timely provision of
documentation of at least 75 percent of eligible expenditures in the previous year.
10
   PAB fixo is a fixed amount, based on each municipality’s population, transferred monthly from the federal
health fund to municipal health funds. PAB variável is an additional amount, based on municipal adherence
to specific MOH’s health programs, such as the family health program (PSF), pharmaceutical program, health
in school program, and indigenous program.


                                                        9
Care Policy (Política Nacional de Atenção Básica - PNAB) that introduced several new
initiatives and provided greatly increased funding, but strained the capacity of the limited
staff in the MOH. The gradual evolution of World Bank investment lending procedures,
with more rigorous up-front fiduciary assessments, resulted in a slight, but important,
modification in the application and acceptance of Brazil’s national competitive bidding
procedures. Difficulties in following the World Bank’s procurement requirements (Section
2.4), coupled with increased funding under the PNAB led to decreased demand for
PROESF 2 funding by municipalities and states that eventually resulted in only about one
third of the original loan amount being disbursed. Other issues that affected
implementation included: multiple staffing changes resulting from state and local elections
and project staffing.

25.     Delayed start-up. The MOH made progress in early implementation with its own
resources, as signature of the loan only took place on September 9, 2009 and effectiveness
on October 15, 2009. The lag between approval and signature is an issue that affects the
entire Brazil lending portfolio because all projects require, among other steps, ratification
by the Senate before signature. 11 Although this delay did not impact early implementation,
it was clear that the Project’s implementation schedule would be affected throughout. As
a result, the MOH requested and the World Bank agreed, before signature, to postpone the
loan closing date by 12 months to March 30, 2013. Despite early progress towards its
Intermediate Results Indicators, several issues that surfaced early on affected PROESF 2
implementation through completion. These included:

26.     Political Environment. Implemented at three levels of government, the Project
was affected by government changes at the federal, state and municipal levels.
Gubernatorial elections in the 26 states and the Federal District were held concomitantly
with presidential elections in 2010, and municipal elections were held in 2008 and 2012.
Changes resulting from state and municipal elections invariably affected staffing continuity
at those levels (not only in the health secretariats, but in other agencies that had a role in
approving procurement and making other decisions). Perhaps the most significant impact
resulted from changes at the federal level. Dilma Rouseff of the Workers Party (Partido
dos Trabalhadores) was elected President in November 2010 and assumed office in
January 2011. Although from the same party as her predecessor, President Rouseff from
the start assigned high priority to primary health and appointed a new Minister of Health
to help design and implement a new primary health policy.

27.     Primary health care in Brazil is financed by the federal government, states and
municipalities, and delivered at the municipal level. States can establish their own delivery
programs, to be implemented by municipalities under their jurisdiction. During
implementation, for instance, the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro were pursuing a
strategy of establishing emergency and specialized units (Ambulatory Medical Care and


11
  In addition to routine delays in obtaining Senate ratification, the loan for the Project was affected by an
increase in the World Bank’s fixed spread, for which the Brazilian Treasury had to recalculate the loan’s debt
analysis and resubmit the loan to the Senate for a subsequent approval. There were also discussions on how
the external financing funds would flow to Treasury account.


                                                     10
Emergency Care Unit), and increased dramatically the funding for primary health care of
these alternative models, which competed with further expansion of PSF coverage.

28.     National Primary Care Policy. The new PNAB was approved by a ministerial
Portaria in October 2011 providing directives and guidelines on primary health, including
for the PSF (Section 3.1). The PSF remained at the center of the primary health care
delivery model, but new initiatives were introduced, including changes in federal financing
arrangements to include both equity and quality as criteria. Under PNAB, financing of
primary health now includes resources: (i) per capita; (ii) for specific investments such as
the Requalification Program for Primary Health Units (Programa de Requalificação das
Unidades Básicas de Saúde); (iii) for adopting strategic and priority programs, such as the
PSF (and others); and (iv) conditioned to results and ex-post evaluation of access and
quality according to the National Program for Access and Quality Improvement (Programa
Nacional de Melhoria do Acesso e da Qualidade - PMAQ). More importantly, resources
allocated to primary health more than doubled in five years, from R$9.8 billion in 2010 to
R$20 billion in 2014. 12

29.     Project Staffing. With a multitude of new programs and initiatives, dramatically
increased funding and heightened priority, the PSF project unit in the MOH, established
under PROESF 1 to coordinate the PSF and World Bank financial assistance, was
integrated with the Ministry’s staff in its Department of Primary Care (Departamento de
Atenção Básica - DAB). Although there were some staff that worked exclusively on the
Project, the PAD had contemplated that the PSF Project unit would be strengthened with
consultants to assist in reviewing and approving municipal and state subprojects, providing
assistance to municipalities and states for the implementation of their subprojects, carrying
out site visits, developing training strategies and monitoring Project indicators. There were
several attempts to hire additional staff, especially to provide hands-on assistance to states
and municipalities, but these did not materialize until late in Project implementation. In
2013, the MOH entered into an agreement with Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) to
provide this assistance.

30.      Issues at the Municipal Level. Municipalities also had issues that affected the
contracting of specialists to their PSF units. Several municipalities and states were affected
by the ceilings of the national Fiscal Responsibility Law, which precluded the contracting
of staff, as specified in their convenios (service delivery and performance agreements) with
the MOH. The Mid-term Review (MTR) also reported issues with availability of qualified
medical doctors in some municipalities. Several municipalities found different options to
overcome these issues and expand PSF (social organizations, short-term contracts for
health personnel, etc.).

31.    World Bank Investment Lending. PROESF 1 had introduced innovative fiduciary
arrangements in which World Bank loan funds were pooled with those of the GOB in the
grant-based financing system through which the federal government funds health services



12
     Equivalent to approximately US$3.3 billion and US$6.7 billion, respectively.


                                                     11
managed by states and municipalities. These arrangements provided inter alia for: (i)
financing a share of the government transfers instead of a share of each transaction; (ii)
disbursing against Statements of Transfers by the MOH; (iii) applying national rules and
systems for procurement and financial management; (iv) annually certifying expenditures
by states and municipalities through internal and independent audits; and (v) carrying out
fiduciary risk assessments and strengthening capacity. 13 An advantage of this approach
was that implementation support could focus on sectoral, program issues as opposed to
routine fiduciary management. PROESF 1 had been somewhat path breaking in adopting
these procedures, at least for operations in Brazil. Since PROESF 1 was prepared in early
2001, World Bank lending instruments and procedures have evolved and sector-wide
approaches and results-based lending, including the new Program for Results instrument,
have been institutionalized. As a consequence, up-front fiduciary assessments have
become more rigorous. The PROESF 1 and the PROESF 2 PADs had allowed for the
application of national procurement procedures under subprojects; nevertheless,
restrictions to fully accept national procurement legislation were introduced in PROESF 2,
causing procurement to surface as an important implementation issue for states and
municipalities (Section 2.4).

32.     Impact of changes on PROESF. With increased funding and the new programs
introduced by the PNAB, the PSF, which had already witnessed major expansion, remained
a preferred delivery model, but became only one of several programs. The revised
interpretation of the World Bank’s procurement requirements (Section 2.4) and
introduction of new MOH procedures, which made the reporting requirements for PROESF
2 different than those of the PROESF 1, resulted in the Project being managed as a ring-
fenced investment project, with separate procedures and reporting requirements. It became
a complex Project implemented by 143 municipalities, 26 states and the Federal District
and also the MOH, whose priority had changed from mere expansion of PSF to one of
improving quality and efficiency in the primary health system. The complexity of
operating in this new reality, coupled with massively increased funding from federal grant
financing, reduced demand for PROESF 2 funding by states and municipalities who saw
the PROESF 2 requirements as excessive vis-à-vis the amount of resources that could be
made available.

33.    Coordination with QUALISUS. Starting at the Project’s MTR in May 2012,
implementation support increased coordination with that of the QUALISUS Project. 14
There was substantial coordination among task teams supporting both projects, and an
especially strong effort to build on the QUALISUS experiences, and apply them to
PROESF 2. More importantly, when the GOB advised the World Bank that it no longer
desired continued funding for municipal and state subprojects, provisions for funding the
information technology equipment for the e-SUS system were included with financing to
be shared between both projects. Co-financing was an attempt to respond to the

procured under one International Competitive Bidding process that would be co-financed
through the two World Bank-financed projects: 60 percent from the PROESF 2 loan, and
40 percent from the QUALISUS loan.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.      Design. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was central to the design of PROESF
2, building upon the progress under the PROESF 1. The Project aimed to strengthen the
M&E system established under PROESF 1 while continuing to provide technical assistance
to municipalities, states and the MOH. M&E was designed not only for implementation
monitoring (and monitoring according to indicators in the Project’s Results Framework),
but, more importantly, to systematically collect performance information and data that
would be used to link resources to performance targets. Five sets of indicators were to be
monitored by the M&E system: 15 (i) PROESF 2 performance indicators included in
federal-municipal agreements, including those on coverage, efficiency, quality and
institutional capacity, that would determine levels of financing; (ii) PSF performance
indicators not included in federal-municipal agreements that constituted a broader set of
Program indicators used by the MOH to monitor primary care; (iii) Project-oriented
“institutional/managerial” capacity performance indicators not included in federal-
municipal agreements, including existence of PSF coordinating units, enrollment of
families by PSF teams, management contracts signed with PSF teams, etc.; (iv) fiduciary
indicators, including compliance with implementation plans, existence of investment
monitoring and reconciliation systems, existence of budget and bank account for project
financing, etc.; (v) environmental indicators to monitor compliance with both building and
environmental protection, and medical waste management and disposal legislation and
guidelines; and (vi) ex-post survey data for impact evaluation.

35.     There were some deficiencies in the design of the Project’s Results Framework,
however. First, the PDO was complex and there was no indicator to measure patient
satisfaction, although this was part of the PDO. Furthermore, several indicators were either
overly complex or were not adequately measuring the attainment of development goals as
both positive and negative changes pointed at potential improvements in primary care (e.g.,
hospital admissions for acute respiratory infections). The PAD, in Annex 3, did not
establish targets for PDO level indicators for PROESF 2. 16

36.     More importantly, the Infant Mortality Rate was in retrospect probably inadequate
as a development outcome indicator. It is a high level indicator influenced by many factors,
including ones that are not specific to the health sector, such as real increases in the


15
   The PROESF 2 M&E framework, indicators and arrangements are discussed in detail in Annex 3 of the
PAD.
16
   The PAD specified two outcome indicators for the three-phase APL, and included as a target an increase
of at least ten percent over (2003) baselines in participating municipalities by the end of the APL program:
(i) Infant Mortality (per 1000 births), baseline of 17.8 and target for Phase 3 of 16.0; and (ii) Per capita
contact with primary care providers (increase) from baseline of 1.4 to 1.6. It did not include intermediary
targets for PROESF 2.


                                                    13
minimum wage; a major expansion of the Government’s conditional cash transfer program
- Bolsa Familia, as well as of similar transfer programs at the state and local levels;
improvements in infrastructure, notably, water supply and sewerage, as well as
improvements in education. It would be difficult to attribute progress in infant mortality
to World Bank-financed project that represented a very small subset of all investments—
federal, state and municipal—in primary health.

37.     Implementation. M&E implementation faced challenges, not the least of which
was limited capacity of some municipalities to implement monitoring and a lack of
technical support provided by the limited MOH project staff. Additional challenges
included: (i) problems in the definition of indicators in the Project’s Results Framework,
including incompatibility with indicators required for reporting to the MOH; 17 (ii) the roll
out of primary health care information systems upgrades, and the challenges in adopting
new upgrades among municipalities, that led to lack of consistency and comprehensiveness
of reporting among all states and municipalities; and (iii) the concomitant introduction of
PMAQ, with its own set of indicators and evaluation processes.

38.     Utilization. M&E was utilized not only to monitor progress towards expected
outcomes, but also to determine state and municipal eligibility to participate in PROESF 2
and to establish the level of transfers, including a performance incentive. State and
municipal eligibility for funding from PROESF 2 was to be established in two stages.
Eligibility for funding in the first stage was determined based on performance under
PROESF 1, and eligibility in the second stage would depend on continued good
performance, and at least 30 percent execution of funding within 12 months of receipt.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39.    Safeguards. The Project was classified as Category B based on two potential
environmental impacts, including those from: (i) new construction and rehabilitation of
ambulatory health units, and (ii) medical waste management. An Environmental
Framework was prepared and incorporated in the Operational Manual to guide selection,
screening, construction and monitoring of new health unit construction. It also detailed the
development and implementation of medical waste training program and plans to supervise
the medical waste management system in family health units. No significant safeguards
issues surfaced during implementation. A thorough assessment of safeguard policies
compliance carried out during the MTR reported satisfactory compliance, with only minor
recommendations with respect to medical waste management.

40.   Fiduciary. Strengthening fiduciary capacity at state and municipal level was very
much at the center of PROESF 2. Upon completion of PROESF 1, a financial management



17
   For PROESF 1, the Government’s and the Project’s indicators were the same. When the Government
introduced the PNAB, the indicators for PROESF 2 became different, so that the Project’s indicators were
superimposed on those that the Government used to monitor progress for all of its programs.



                                                  14
assessment found that all states and municipalities had maintained an accounting and
financial management system for the specific purpose of recording PSF/PROESF
information, and recommended that it would be possible and even preferable to rely on the
MOH’s existing financial management systems. Nevertheless, in practice, implementation
of PROESF 2 represented a step backwards in terms of the fiduciary innovations. A new,
strengthened Project information system (SGP2) had been put in place early on, which
addressed planning, procurement, financial management, and monitoring. But several
steps and procedures that were adopted resulted in fiduciary arrangements under PROESF
2 resembling those of a traditional investment operation, as described below.

41.     On the financial management side, funds were transferred using the MOH’s fund-
to-fund system, but separate special accounts were established in each state and
municipality to channel loan funding. Funds were transferred to states and municipalities
only after contracts were signed for the procurement of works, goods and services, and not
against transfers as had been the case under PROESF 1. During implementation, the World
Bank repeatedly requested strengthening of inventory control of goods acquired by states
and municipalities, but the MOH was reluctant to address routine matters that in the federal
environment are the responsibility of subnational governments. Financial planning was
weak, as exemplified by the Project team’s inability to secure enough resources in the
MOH budget for loan funds to be spent in the Project’s final year. Finally, delays in
executing transferred funds by states and municipalities prevented the timely provision of
statements of expenditures, and reimbursement of funds that were transferred but not
executed.

42.      With respect to procurement, states and municipalities had difficulties applying
World Bank procurement requirements for goods and services, as well as for contracting
of consultants (they were not necessarily familiar with the World Bank’s consultant and
procurement guidelines). The Loan Agreement for PROESF 1 had explicitly mentioned
that goods and works for subprojects carried out by municipalities would follow the
“Procurement Law,” meaning the Borrower’s Laws 8666/93 and 10520/02 in their entirety.
The Loan Agreement for PROESF 2 did not make reference to the Borrower’s Laws; it
only included the standard reference to National Competitive Bidding as an acceptable
procurement method. As a result, in loco reverse auction (pregão presencial), provided
for under Law No. 10520/02, was no longer recognized as an acceptable procedure for the
loan. 18 Similarly, the e-reverse auction (pregão eletrônico), 19 which was still considered
acceptable, was allowed only if carried out through certain financial institutions, not
necessarily used throughout the country. In addition, states and municipalities were
required, by the MOH, to prepare ex-ante procurement plans. Unfamiliar and
uncomfortable to follow World Bank procurement requirements (including shopping
procedures), despite limited training provided by the MOH and the states, officials in local
governments (often in agencies outside the health sector) were presumably reluctant to not

   Pregão presencial is an open bidding process for goods and services, in which the bidders’ presence in
person is required.
19
   Pregão eletrônico is an on-line bidding for goods and services, using information systems made available
by several financial and other institutions.


                                                    15
follow national legislation. To compound the difficulties that these requirements created,
the MOH was never able to contract the additional fiduciary specialists, either as staff or
consultants, who were to provide hands-on guidance and technical assistance to states and
municipalities on these matters. Although the MOH kept a team at DAB, this did not seem
to be enough to mitigate procurement-related bottlenecks.

43.     Application of the World Bank’s procurement requirements also presented,
according to the MOH, an obstacle to completion of several activities at the federal level.
The studies planned under Component 3 were implemented with GOB resources, as the
MOH found greater flexibility in contracting universities and think tanks by following
national legislation. More importantly, the approval of the International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) contract for information technology equipment for the e-SUS system was
delayed extensively, in view of the MOH’s internal processes, especially with respect to
defining technical specifications for the system. Once the required approvals were obtained
in September 2014, there was no longer sufficient time to ensure that the goods and services
would be provided before the loan’s closing date.

44.     Difficulties in following procurement and financial management requirements
resulted in disbursements to municipalities and states of approximately US$1.4 million
against ineligible expenditures. These were detected in the 2012 and 2013 audits by the
Federal Controller General (Controladoria Geral da União - CGU). In addition, there were
approximately US$5.8 million of amounts transferred to but not executed by states and
municipalities. Thus, approximately US$7.2 million have been reimbursed to the World
Bank in May 2015.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.    The Family Health Extension APL had originally contemplated three phases.
However, the third phase will not move forward. The PSF is the Government’s preferred
model for delivery of primary health care under the PNAB. Financing to municipalities
for PSF will continue to be provided through the Government’s fund-to-fund transfer
system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.     The PSF was, at the time that PROESF 2 was approved, and remains today a high
priority for Brazil. Relevance of its objectives continues to be High. A recent World Bank
document, Twenty Years of Health System Reform in Brazil: An Assessment of the Sistema
Único de Saúde, reports that Brazil has seen impressive improvements in health outcomes,
with dramatic reductions in child and infant mortality (and maternal mortality, to a lesser
extent) and increases in life expectancy. Geographic inequalities in health outcomes were
significantly reduced, with northeastern states benefiting the most, and disparities across
socioeconomic groups also declined. However, significant inequalities in health status
remain. The report highlights five key challenges facing Brazil’s health care system: (i)



                                            16
sustaining improvements in access to health care; (ii) improving efficiency and quality of
health care services; (iii) clarifying roles and relationships across levels of government;
(iv) raising the level and efficiency of government spending, and (v) conducting more and
better health system monitoring and research. 20 The PDO of PROESF 2 responded to each
of these priorities, and especially to the first.

47.     The Government recognizes these challenges, which are a central feature of its
recently approved PNAB. The PNAB prioritizes the PSF as a successful and preferred
delivery model for the expansion and consolidation of primary health care, but it also
incorporates other programs, with financing through its federal to municipal transfer
system, to help address bottlenecks and constraints. These new programs build very much
on the design, lessons and experience of PSF, supported by the PROESF APL. The new
programs include: (i) a modification of the system of allocations of federal financing for
primary care to include both equity (based on population and quality parameters); (ii) the
PMAQ that evaluates and recognizes PSF units and municipalities that achieve previously
agreed and contracted (among the federal, state and local units) results, and rewards them
with supplemental resources; (iii) the establishment of primary care units for the homeless
through mobile street units; (iv) an increase in the number of municipalities that can
establish Núcleos de Apoio à Saúde da Família, interdisciplinary teams of medical
specialists and other professionals that provide support to a pre-defined number of PSF
teams; (v) a streamlining of procedures for establishing the PSF and other units in support
of riverside populations; (vi) strengthening intersectoral links for health through, for
example, early childhood initiatives; (vii) strengthening linkages among different levels of
health care and among units, and providing access to distance health education through
Telessaúde, that comprises integration of modern telecommunications and information
systems and a new regulation policy; (viii) through the Unidades Básicas de Saúde
program, modernizing and improving the services provided by primary health units
through the construction of new and larger units, and refurbishing, expanding and
providing information technology systems to existing units; and (ix) the Mais Médicos
program aimed at augmenting the availability of medical doctors in remote areas and
strengthening medical training through “hands-on” experience.

48.     The Project’s objectives are fully consistent with the second strategic objective of
the World Bank’s Brazil Country Partnership Strategy 2012-2015 (Report #63731-BR)
discussed by the Executive Directors on September 21, 2011: to improve the quality of
public services for low income households, and expand their provision through public and
private channels.

49.    As a follow up to successful innovations with systems, monitoring and
performance-based financing supported by PROESF 1, the Project’s was relevant during
preparation and early implementation. When the Government adopted its new PNAB in
October 2011, introduced new programs and increased funding for them, PROESF 2 lost
relevance quickly. Hence the Project’s relevance for these dimensions is rated as Modest.

Federal funding for primary health care increased almost 40 percent from 2010, shortly
after PROESF 2 began implementation, to 2012. A new program was established for the
construction and rehabilitation of health centers and the PMAQ was launched. Reporting
systems for these new programs were established, which differed from those required for
monitoring PROESF 2 implementation. For instance, PMAQ became the standard for
monitoring and evaluating performance by individual PSF units and municipalities.
Implementation support made a strong effort to keep implementation on track. Nonetheless,
demand for PROESF 2 funding by municipalities and states dropped considerably as
financing from the federal government was readily available and did not require application
of non-standard procurement procedures.

50.     The World Bank’s implementation support missions made a valiant effort to
restructure the Project to support the GOB’s priorities, to modify the results indicators to
make them more compatible with the MOH’s programs and systems and, thereby, to
maintain its continued relevance (Sections 1.3, 1.6 and 1.7). The missions also tried
repeatedly to foster the technical dialogue and contribute to activities and studies that were
being implemented by the MOH. Unfortunately, continued difficulties in dealing with
procurement bottlenecks (Section 2.4) as well as lack of interest from the Government to
engage in a technical dialogue (e.g. the World Bank offer to support the impact evaluation
of PMAQ or the analysis on costing of primary care), led to World Bank funds available
under the federal component not being utilized for technical assistance. The changes to the
Results Framework increased clarity and reduced repetition, but did not resolve the issue
that PROESF 2 was rather a small Project within a much larger program. Its indicators
still measured the Program’s results, and not specifically those of the Project. Further,
addressing weaknesses in the municipal and state components was no longer feasible as
only the federal Component 3 was maintained after the restructuring, reprogrammed to
finance information technology equipment. This was a very large contract that required
additional approvals. The World Bank implementation team made strong efforts to provide
support. Ultimately, delays in procurement precluded even this equipment from being
financed under PROESF 2 in view of the Project’s Closing Date. 21

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

51.     As mentioned before, the Results Framework did not include targets for the
outcome indicators in the second phase of the APL. However, the MOH established
indicative targets for both of the APL PDO indicators: a 5 percent reduction in infant
mortality in participating municipalities and a 5 percent increase in per capita contact with
primary care providers in participating municipalities. By the time of the MTR, both of
these targets had been met: infant mortality had been reduced from 17.8 per thousand live
births in 2011 to 13.9 in 2003, and per capita contacts with primary care providers had
increased from 1.4 in 2003 to 1.6 in 2011. At the time, PSF coverage in PROESF 2
municipalities had increased from 33.8 percent of the population in 2006 to 39.5 percent
in 2011, exceeding the target of 37 percent. By Project completion, infant mortality had

 The contract is expected to be fully financed with QUALISUS’ loan proceeds, which was extended until
December 31, 2015.


                                                 18
been reduced further to 12.7 per thousand live births in 2014. The per capita contacts with
primary care providers, however, had increased to 1.8 in 2012 but then began a downward
trend, decreasing to 1.5 in 2014, falling short of target.

52.      As described below, good progress was made towards PROESF 2’s objectives set
out in Annex 3 of the PAD, as measured by the Intermediate Results Indicators: thirteen
out of 17 indicators have been met. Yet, in considering PROESF 2’s accomplishments, a
word of caution is in order with respect to attribution of results to the World Bank’s
financing. First, PROESF 2 funding made a very small contribution to the expansion and
consolidation of PSF teams in participating municipalities and states. Of the 187
municipalities that were selected to participate in PROESF 2 based on their performance
under PROESF 1, 170 signed subproject agreements with the MOH (171 were declared
eligible and 13 were temporarily ineligible). Of these 170 municipalities that started, 55
were temporarily suspended for not having executed 30 percent of funding within 12
months (44 of these did not use any funding). Only 143 municipalities signed subproject
agreements with the MOH for the second stage, and of these 67 never utilized the funding,
seven utilized less than 50 percent, and only 32 utilized at least 90 percent of funding. All
states and the Federal District signed subproject agreements, but their level of execution
was low: only 22 percent of resources transferred were utilized, with the consequence that
15 of 26 states were temporarily suspended for not having implemented at least 30 percent
of resources within 12 months. Equally important, although there are several studies that
point to the relevance and effectiveness of the PSF, health outcomes are determined at least
in part to developments outside the health system, all of which have shown improvements
in recent years, as well: access to safe water and sanitation, quality food and education and
the economic situation of households. Finally, the Government’s increased funding outside
the scope of PROESF 2, and the priority it assigned to new programs (some of which were
incorporated in the Project, especially PMAQ), undoubtedly influenced Project outcomes
and intermediate outcomes, as well.

53.     Component 1 had three intermediate objectives, to: (i) increase access to family
health-based primary care in about 187 large, urban municipalities; (ii) raise the technical
quality of and patient satisfaction with primary care; and (iii) improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of family health service providers as well as the broader delivery system. The
achievement of these objectives, as measured by eight intermediate results indicators, was
Negligible. As described above, the number of municipalities that participated in PROESF
2, and the utilized loan funding was significantly below what had been anticipated.
Nevertheless, coverage of PSF in participating municipalities reached 48.2 percent,
exceeding the 37 percent target for PROESF 2 and even the 40 percent target for a third
phase of the APL. In addition, coverage in participating municipalities outpaced the 32
percent coverage in non-participating municipalities. The indicator on the proportion of
patients with hypertension registered by PSF teams, among estimated population with
hypertension (15 years of age and older) was 24.4 percent, falling short of the target of 35
percent. PROESF 2 met the intermediate objective of raising technical quality of and
patient satisfaction, as measured by the indicators, but none of these actually measure
patient satisfaction—they measure technical quality. A study carried out by the Institute
of Applied Economics Research (Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada - IPEA) in



                                             19
2010 found that the PSF was the highest rated strategy of the health care system: 80.7
percent of the persons interviewed responded that the PSF was “good or very good”.
Finally, the third intermediate objective of this component was largely not met, as none of
the targets for intermediate results indicators were achieved. Especially worrisome is the
deterioration in the percentage of fully immunized infants (92.3 percent against a target of
95 percent), and percentage of women with live births attended by PSF that have 7 or more
prenatal consultations (64.1 percent against a target of 70 percent).

54.     Component 2 was to support the objective of improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of family health service providers as well as the broader delivery system, at
the state level, by improving their capacity for supervision, monitoring and technical
support of PSF services. All of the states and the Federal District signed performance
agreements with all of the municipalities, 52.8 percent of states have monitoring and
evaluation plans implemented, and 94.6 percent of municipalities in 100 percent of states
participate in quality assessment programs. Although targets for the three intermediate
indicators have been met, the achievement of this objective is considered Modest as given
the extremely low utilization of funds by states; it is more likely that improvements are
linked to the establishment of the Government’s PMAQ. In PMAQ’s first cycle, 90 percent
of PROESF 2 municipalities had entered the program. By the second cycle, 97 percent of
PROESF 2 municipalities had joined, while countrywide only 91 percent had.

55.     Lastly, Component 3 was to support the objective of improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of family health service providers as well as the broader delivery system at
the federal level by strengthening federal oversight of the PSF. As measured by six
intermediate results indicators, progress was made towards this objective in the
restructured Project, as evidenced by achievement of targets for three indicators. Yet,
given the lack of updated data and the fact that it is difficult to attribute results to PROESF
2, the achievement of this objective is rated Negligible. A results-based management
system linking financing to municipalities and states was established, a study on health
care costs and tripartite spending on primary healthcare was carried out by the MOH in
partnership with IPEA, communities of practice have been established, and 88 percent of
municipalities have signed performance contracts with the MOH. However, the MOH
implemented most of these activities with national resources as part of the new PMAQ
program. The MOH has not provided information or recent data on either the number of
municipalities that have implemented the new real-time, web-based health information
system, e-SUS. Most recent data shows, that 47 percent of PROESF 2 municipalities have
implemented Telesaúde (supporting 3,979 PSF teams) which aims to expand and improve
the delivery of primary health care by promoting better integration across the levels of the
service delivery network, enhancing delivery at the first level of care and supporting real-
time learning by health teams. The financing of information technology equipment for the
e-SUS was ultimately not financed by the Project.

3.3 Efficiency

56.     A retrospective economic and financial analysis of the Project was prepared, and
Efficiency is rated as Modest. This assessment was based on review and updating of the



                                              20
analysis carried out during Project preparation, rather than a new analysis. It sought to
assess whether the assumptions and projections made at the time held true, and assess the
impact of possible changes in variables on the conclusions of the analysis. The initial
evaluation performed for the PAD estimated the incremental costs and benefits over the
Project lifetime (three years, mid-2008 to mid-2011) and over a longer period of 10 years,
because of the expected lag in Project impact and their continuation over time. Costs were
estimated at US$166.7 million, while the Net Present Value (NPV) of the net benefits were
projected at US$745 million over 10 years. The Project was expected to yield a negative
NPV during its implementation, and positive benefits thereafter.

57.      Because PROESF 2 was intended to support an ongoing program (the PSF
strategy) that expanded and evolved with or without the Project, it is nearly impossible to
assign any observed improvement in health indicators to the Project alone. Therefore, for
the purposes of this ICR, it was assumed that PROESF 2 has been a strong contributor to
the impact of the PSF strategy as a whole, and the incremental benefits of PSF in general
during Project implementation were measured. The results of this ex-post analysis, using
more recent data, are less favorable than in the ex-ante analysis of 2008, but are still within
the range of the sensitivity analysis performed during preparation. Actual 2014 results
show Project costs at US$84 million, and a NPV of US$256 million. These results reflect
recent trends in population growth and birth rate (lower than estimated in the PAD), lower
initial coverage by PSF but faster growth, and recent evidence of somewhat lower impact
on specific mortality rates; specifically, the number of births is much lower (20 percent)
than estimated at the time, thus reducing the size of the potential impact on infant and
maternal mortality.

58.    Several factors are likely to affect the results of the analysis performed for the PAD,
such as Project specific factors, changes in key variables, recent evidence of PSF impact,
and Project costs. Discussion on these factors and their implications for the results of the
analysis are detailed in Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory

59.     PROESF 2’s Overall Outcome Rating is Unsatisfactory, based on (i) a Modest
overall Relevance; (ii) Negligible achievement of intermediate objectives under
Components 1 and 3, and Modest achievement of intermediate objectives under
Component 2; and (iii) Modest Efficiency. While there is a strong body of evidence that
the PSF has had a measurable positive impact, and PROESF 2 had the potential to continue
contributing to this very important health service delivery model, its contribution to this
success was marginal at best. Perhaps the APL program’s largest impact was not the
possible immediate results in terms of health care outcomes, although it undoubtedly did
have some impact on these, but rather on piloting through the PSF a performance-based
health financing model with an emphasis on monitoring and evaluation that has now been
adopted in Brazil’s federal health care financing through the PNAB generally, and the
PMAQ specifically.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
See Section 1.4.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

60.      The most significant contribution of PROESF 2 was especially the performance-
based financing modalities for linking federal transfers to results that have now been
institutionalized in the Government’s primary health care system, especially in the PMAQ.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

61.     It is difficult to assess the Risk to Development Outcome for an operation that did
not produce expected outcomes, or better, for which contribution to the Project cannot be
established. The Risk to Development Outcome for the PROESF APL is substantial,
especially because the APL program lost relevance and the expected final phase will not
materialize. Nevertheless, the PSF program that it supported is very much institutionalized
in Brazil’s health care delivery system, has produced promising results country-wide, and
is now enhanced by several other complementary programs aimed at addressing the “next
steps” in the primary health care agenda (i.e., quality), now that coverage of PSF has
expanded considerably. Performance-based financing has been adopted as a
complementary top-up to per capita and other transfers in the Government’s fund-to-fund
transfer system.

62.     The Government remains fully committed to the PNAB, including the PSF, and
new programs such as PMAQ, as well as to the continued roll out of its new e-SUS primary
health care information system (which has already begun). Although very low, the greatest
risk to implementation of these programs is maintaining a sustained commitment to
budgetary allocations. The macroeconomic scenario has deteriorated somewhat since the
time PROESF 2 was prepared and since the PNAB was launched. Fiscal constraints,
resulting from a more constrained budget, may come to affect if not the level of existing
funding, at least the ability to maintain the past trend of increases in funding. Nevertheless,
there is no reason to assume that funding for a priority program would be drastically
reduced, and no budget cuts to primary health care programs have been announced.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                              22
63.     The World Bank’s Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory, as moderate shortcomings were observed. As the second phase
of an APL, Project preparation was carried out in coordination with the supervision of the
first phase, which was still under implementation. PROESF 2 built upon the successful
outcomes of the earlier project and was fully responsive to the GOB’s request for continued
support for the PSF expansion. The preparation team extracted lessons, identified priorities
for consolidating the highly successful PSF model, and incorporated them into the Project’s
design by making adjustments where justified. The same Task Team, based in the Country
Office, that provided implementation support to the earlier project remained responsible
for preparation of PROESF 2. The Team continued to provide constant support to the
Project in its early phases, despite the extensive lag in effectiveness, to ensure that
implementation would not be unduly affected by the delay. Yet, issues in the design of the
Project’s Results Framework (Section 2.3) resulted in difficulties in measuring the
Project’s outcomes. Also, the change in procurement procedures during preparation from
those under PROESF 1, especially not accepting fully the terms of the Borrower’s
Procurement Laws No. 8666/93 and 10520/02 (Section 2.4), was an issue that came to
affect the implementation of subprojects and the utilization of loan funds by both
municipalities and states.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

64.     The World Bank’s Quality of Supervision is rated as Satisfactory, as minor
shortcomings were observed. Supervision involved routine changes in Task Management
who were based at headquarters (although the fiduciary team remained in the Country
Office). Nevertheless, the transitions were seamless, which was all the more important in
view of the environment in the sector that involved numerous changes implemented
through the Government’s PNAB, a dramatic increase in funding for primary health and
the implications of these changes for the Project’s implementation. Despite a statement to
the contrary in the Borrower’s Completion Report, the team made attempts to engage with
the MOH in a technical dialogue regarding its new policy to no avail. During the MTR, the
team specifically suggested that in light of reduced municipal and state demand for
subproject financing, the MOH should consider requesting a partial cancellation of loan
funds. The team also responded expeditiously to the Government’s request to restructure
the Project. When the MOH opted against a partial cancellation, the team worked with the
Government to adjust the Results Framework to address issues with indicators and made
revisions needed to adapt the operation to the Government’s new priority programs, and
coordinated closely with the Task Team supporting the QUALISUS project to synchronize
the World Bank’s response for assistance to the MOH, particularly regarding support for
implementation and roll out of its e-SUS system. The Development Outcome and
Implementation Progress (IP) ratings in the Project’s Implementation Status and Results
Reports were only downgraded very close to loan’s closing date to reflect the lack of
progress in implementing actions agreed in the restructuring. However, given the
implementation challenges described in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 5.2, the World Bank team
could have been more realistic in performance reporting, especially for the IP rating that
should, in retrospect, have been downgraded earlier.


                                            23
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.     The Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory in view of the
ratings for both Ensuring Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision, and the fact that
Quality at Entry issues influenced the Project’s outcome, despite strong efforts by the
World Bank’s Task Team to address them during implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66.      The Government’s performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory, meaning
that there were significant shortcomings. Despite continued priority to the PSF, and a
continued desire for World Bank assistance in support of it, several factors impacted the
Government’s performance. First, Project preparation suffered greater than expected
delays. Project preparation began in early 2006, but the corresponding loan was only
approved more than two years later. Subsequently, effectiveness only took place almost
eighteen months after approval. Although the effectiveness delay was not necessarily
project-specific and initial Project activities were being implementing with Government
funding, the delay impacted implementation of the municipal and state subprojects,
slowing them down considerably. The new administration, which took office in 2011,
reconfirmed the priority given to primary health care and significantly increased funding
for it. The new programs adopted and implemented in accordance with the PNAB built on
and expanded the performance-based financing model developed under PROESF 1, which
was continued and improved under PROESF 2, while maintaining PSF as the preferred
delivery mechanism. Nevertheless, throughout Project implementation, MOH’s ownership
and commitment to the Project implementation was questionable, and appointment of key
staff to the Project Unit to support states and municipalities was delayed until 2013. There
was no timely resolution of implementation issues as evidenced in the Aide Memoires and
non-responsiveness, on occasion, by the MOH to management letters sent by the World
Bank, which emphasized the Project implementation bottlenecks and called for MOH’s
actions.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

67.     The Implementing Agencies’ Performance is rated Unsatisfactory. Initially, the
MOH/DAB began implementation of PROESF 2 without access to loan financing, and, as
the PSF was an established program, already had in place the mechanisms to eventually
fund PSF expansion in those municipalities that had qualified for the first round of funding
under the Project. With the enactment of the new PNAB, the demands on the staff of the
MOH’s DAB increased dramatically; they were responsible to put in place the new
programs, develop and implement new systems and manage the increased funding. The
inability to contract additional specialists to support PROESF 2 resulted in the Project’s
coordination by MOH being absorbed by the existing staff of DAB, which was already


                                            24
overstretched. In addition, administration of PROESF 2 became a low priority for the staff
in DAB in view of the importance of new programs established under the PNAB.
Difficulties encountered by municipalities and states in following requirements of
PROESF 2, that had begun to diverge significantly from routine internal government
procedures, compounded these difficulties, placing an even greater burden on the staff and
heightened the need for additional supervision. The Project’s restructuring required
excessive time for internal approval, progress reporting was weak, the contracting of
equipment for the e-SUS suffered repeated delays (to the extent that it could not be financed
by the loan) and there were large and consistent delays in addressing satisfactorily the
agreements reflected in mission Aide Memoires and in responding to World Bank
correspondences. In addition, DAB was not willing to engage in a technical dialogue with
the World Bank on health sector policies, which could undoubtedly have served to maintain
the relevance of PROESF 2 within the new PNAB.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

68.     The Overall Borrower Performance is rated Unsatisfactory in view of the impact
of the Government’s and Implementing Agencies’ performance on the Project’s outcomes.

6. Lessons Learned

69.     A programmatic, medium-term approach to financing (previously provided as in
the case of the Project through an Adaptable Program Loan) can be very valuable to help
establish, and provide medium- to long-term continuity to a government program.
However, even if the program established and supported continues to enjoy full
government priority and funding, exogenous factors can come to affect the relevance,
effectiveness and eventual results of a World Bank-financed program. Even a satisfactory
or highly satisfactory program can rapidly lose relevance in view of changes in the overall
sectoral policy environment or changes in the World Bank’s own requirements (Section
2.2). These factors have to be deeply assessed during implementation, both by the World
Bank team as by the Government, and clear decisions on how to proceed have to be taken
at the management level of all institutions involved.

70.     Even though a project or program supported by a World Bank-financed operation
does not produce measurable, satisfactory outcomes, it can still have a major demonstrative
impact. Specifically in the case of the PROESF APL, the innovative performance-based
financing model that was piloted under the Project, along with the accompanying emphasis
on monitoring and evaluation, have now been brought to scale and institutionalized in the
government’s primary health care program. Without a doubt, the PMAQ program, which
incorporates an important quality aspect to health care financing and that includes
formalized procedures for both internal evaluation and external evaluation (by universities),
inspired upon the experience of the PROESF APL. In this sense, the World Bank’s
involvement was highly successful, and could have been used to foster the technical
dialogue and other accomplishments.




                                             25
71.      Projects (and programs) that support increases in coverage produce notable results
in their early phases. With coverage increased, and more basic needs met, further progress
depends on improvements in quality of service delivery. But, quality improvements
require the simultaneous adoption of inter-related measures, including professional
qualifications, information systems, efficiency, etc., that require a longer implementation
to converge. The focus and indicators need to incorporate a longer-term horizon.

72.     Project implemented in federal frameworks, involving three levels of government,
should consider more flexible procurement arrangements for the acquisition of relatively
small goods and services. Requiring that all implementing agencies follow World Bank
procurement guidelines especially when there are differences between those procedures
and national legislation (Sections 2.2 and 2.4) can hamper implementation and increase
costs of supervision while not necessarily producing better results. First, local governments
are not familiar with World Bank procedures and dissemination of these requires a major,
non-lasting investment. Second, even if dissemination and training is provided, local
governments may be concerned that not following national legislation can have important
implications with respect to compliance with national norms.

Revisions to the Results Framework (in the March 2013 restructuring):

   •   Indicator 2 was revised to read “Increase of per capita contacts with primary care
       providers (doctors and nurses) in participating municipalities”. This definition is
       in accordance with the one adopted by the MOH. The baseline was corrected
       accordingly, and the target for Phase 2 was defined as an increase of 5 percent
       compared to the baseline;
   •   Indicator 4 was revised to read “Proportion of patients with hypertension registered
       by PSF teams, among estimated population with hypertension (15 years of age and
       older)” to better align the indicator with the GOB’s monitoring system;
   •   The baseline and target of Indicator 5 were revised to be compatible with upgrade
       of Brazil’s vaccination program to a penta-, and hexavalent scheme in children
       below one year of age;
   •   The baseline of Indicator 6 was revised to reflect actual data for 2006 from the
       SINASC information system;
   •   Indicators 10 and 11 were dropped as they were considered to not adequately
       measure the attainment of development goals as both positive and negative changes
       to the indicators pointed to potential improvements in primary health care;
   •   Indicator 12 was revised to read “Proportion of municipalities that conduct self-
       assessment to improve access and quality of primary care” to reflect the evolution
       and scale up of quality improvement instruments that besides AMQ 1&2, now
       feature two follow-on systems: AMAQ and PMAQ;
   •   Indicator 13 was revised to read “Proportion of states that establish performance
       agreements with at least 25% of municipalities <100,000 population” to reduce
       unnecessary complexity, and the target was revised to only 40 percent of states in
       2014 (since the number of municipalities was in the revised indicator itself);
   •   Indicator 15 was revised to read “Proportion of states with 10% of municipalities
       <100,000 inhabitants that implemented self-assessment” and the target was revised
       to only 50 percent of states in 2014 (since the number of municipalities was in the
       revised indicator itself). Also, the reference to AMQ was eliminated since it was
       replaced by follow-on systems AMAQ and PMAQ that were implemented on a
       large scale;
   •   Indicators 18, 19 and 20 were dropped; the GOB funded research projects and an
       impact evaluation of its major quality improvement initiative, PMAQ, with its own
       resources; Also, major research studies focusing on the PSF were carried out and
       published by renowned research institutions, hence the demand and need for similar
       studies and evaluation funded with Project resources diminished; the PMAQ
       system, inter alia, involves an external evaluation of PSF professionals, hence
       Project funding for this activity was not required; and
   •   Indicator 22 was revised to read “Proportion of family health teams participating in
       the Program of Improving Access and Quality (PMAQ-AB)” to reflect evolution
       of results-based management at the federal level, including of the AMQ system into
       the new PMAQ system; The target was revised to better reflect continued progress
       on the indicator; and
   •   Two new Indicators were added, along with baselines and targets. The first,
       “Proportion of participating municipalities that implemented the Health


                                           37
Information System for Primary Care (SIS-AB)”, was to monitor the upgrading of
information systems and integrated data systems to support performance
monitoring of primary health care and the family health program. The second,
“Proportion of primary care units (UBS) in participating municipalities that have a
Tele-health access point”, was to monitor upgrading of primary care units with
Tele-health access points that play a key role in raising the technical quality of
primary care and have a direct role in promoting continued professional learning
for family health professionals across the Tele-health network.

Outputs by Component:

Of the 184 municipalities that were selected to participate in PROESF 2 based on their
performance under PROESF 1,170 signed subproject agreements with MOH (171 were
declared eligible and 13 were temporarily ineligible). Of these 170 municipalities that
started, 55 were temporarily suspended for not having executed 30 percent of funding
within 12 months (44 of these did not use any funding). Only 143 municipalities signed
subproject agreements with the MOH for the second stage. All states and the federal
district signed subproject agreements, but their level of execution was low: only 22 percent
of resources transferred were utilized, with the consequence that 15 of 26 states were
temporarily suspended for not having implemented at least 30 percent of resources within
12 months.

The goods and services financed under the Municipal and State subproject agreements is
presented below.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Summary

1.      This annex presents the results of the retrospective economic and financial analysis
of the Brazil Family Health Extension Project APL Phase 2 (PROESF II) performed for
the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR). This assessment was based on
review and updating of the analysis performed for the PAD, rather than a new analysis. It
seeks to assess whether the assumptions and projections made at the time held true, and
assess the impact of possible changes in variables on the conclusions of the analysis.
2.        The original Project (PROESF 1) was approved in 2002, for an amount of US$550
million over 7 years. Its intended goal was to improve utilization and quality of publicly-
financed health services by: (i) expanding and consolidating coverage of the Government
of Brazil’s (GOB) Family Health Program (Programa Saúde da Família - PSF) in about
187 municipalities, establishing well-articulated referral and counter-referral systems, and
introducing performance-based financing and management arrangements; (ii) establishing
family health as a core element of health professional and para-professional training; and
(iii) strengthening Ministry of Health (MOH) capacity to monitor and evaluate PSF health
services, policies and training activities on a systematic basis. The project was closed in
2007 with satisfactory outcomes.
3.      PROESF 2 was approved in 2008 for an amount of US$83.45 million over a period
of three years, to build upon the achievements of Phase I, and strengthen the quality of care
within PSF and the capacity for monitoring and evaluation at the state level. I covered the
same 187 urban municipalities with populations over 100,000 already covered under
PROESF 1.
4.      The initial evaluation performed for the PAD estimated the incremental costs and
benefits over the project lifetime (three years, mid-2008 to mid-2011) and over a longer
period of 10 years, because of the expected lag in project impact and their continuation
over time. Costs were estimated at US$166.7 million, while the Net Present Value (NPV)
of the net benefits were projected at US$745 million over 10 years. The project was
expected to yield a negative NPV during its implementation, and positive benefits
thereafter (Table 1).
5.      Because PROESF 2 was intended to support an ongoing program (the PSF strategy)
that expanded and evolved with or without the Project, it is nearly impossible to assign any
observed improvement in health indicators to the project alone. Therefore, it is assumed
that PROESF 2 has been a strong contributor to the impact of the PSF strategy as a whole
during Project implementation and measure the incremental benefits of PSF in general
during Project implementation.
6.      The results of this ex-post analysis, using more recent data, are less favorable than
in the ex-ante analysis of 2008, but are still within the range of the sensitivity analysis
performed for the PAD (Table 1). These results reflect recent trends in population growth
and birth rate (lower than estimated in the PAD), lower initial coverage by PSF but faster
growth, and recent evidence of somewhat lower impact on specific mortality rates;




                                             40
specifically, the number of births is much lower (20%) than estimated at the time, thus
reducing the size of the potential impact on infant and maternal mortality.

7.       Several factors are likely to affect the results of the analysis performed for the PAD.
Each of these factors and their implications for the results of the analysis are discussed
below. When more recent information became available, variable values were updated to
reflect them. When no new information was available the original values were kept.


Project specific factors
8.      Project-specific variables include change in Project startup and duration and the
low disbursement of project funds. Project startup was delayed by over one year, as the
loan signature took place only in September 2009. Further implementation delays resulted
in the Project closing being postponed to December 2014. Overall, duration of the Project
was of 5 years instead of the planned three years. These changes in Project startup and
duration affect directly the projected costs and especially benefits, even more so because
PROESF 2 aimed at supporting an ongoing program that continued to expand while the
Project was delayed.


Changes in key variables
9.       Several key values in the analysis had revised or updated for more recent years
(after the baseline for the PAD analysis), and some of them are quite different from initial
values; when relevant calculations were adjusted to reflect these changes.
10.     Population estimates and projections were revised by the National Statistics
Institute (IBGE) in 2013, resulting in a slightly lower numbers for recent years (0.4% for
2009) and significantly lower birth rate and population growth (1.0% around 2010,
decreasing to 0.84% by 2018, against initially projected 1.27%). This lower demographic
growth naturally affected the projected size of the target population, reducing it by 1% in
2009 and 2.4% (or 2.5 millions) by 2017, while the number of births was 20% lower (from
1.8 to 1.4 million). The impact of this is to reduce both annual incremental recurrent costs
(at maintained project costs) and total projected benefits.

11.    The number of covered municipalities, and thus the target population, has also
changed, for two reasons. Of the 224 municipalities with over 100,000 population covered
under PROESF 1 (and considered in the PROESF 2 PAD), only 188 submitted proposals
and were finally covered under PROESF 2; of these one did not participate in PROESF II.
Even though the target population was already corrected in the PAD, the core indicators of
mortality and morbidity still referred to the larger population (for consistency with
PROESF 1). In the absence of a full list of these municipalities, we assumed no significant
change in the profile of covered municipalities (e.g. PSF coverage).
12.     PSF coverage data are available for more recent years, and are different from those
used in the PAD. This is because in 2007 the MOH changed the basis for computing
coverage, from the theoretical number of families covered by a PSF team (to actual
registration of families. This change resulted in a drop of 4.5 percentage points in the
estimated coverage for 2007 and following years. For that reason, the target of 37%
coverage by 2009 and 41% in 2010 was not reached (32.6 was the recorded coverage), but
was nearly reached according to the prior calculation method. In addition, coverage
increased further than projected in the PAD analysis, but with a longer lag. During project
actual implementation (2009-2014) and based on the new data, coverage increased from
32.6 to 45.3% in December 2014 27.
13.     Maternal morbidity data has for long been known to be imprecise. The main
available time series, published by MOH/Secretariat of Surveillance for reported maternal
deaths unadjusted for under-reporting, indicates that MMR has been oscillating between
50 and 60 /100,000 live births, with no declining trend: the mean value for 2010-2013 for
Brazil as a whole was 57, while the mean since 2000 was 55. It is very likely that the actual
rate has been declining but was compensated by improved reporting, but no recent precise
estimate was available.

Recent evidence of PSF impact
14.    New evidence of the impact of PSF has been published after the preparation of the
PAD. Generally, these new findings tend to indicate substantially lower impact than
previous studies for mortality rates, and larger ones for hospitalizations; in the case of
diabetes, a negative effect was found in one study. We summarize below some of these
new findings in the literature.
15.     Aquino et al (2009) 28 measured the impact of PSF coverage on infant mortality in
771 municipalities between 1996 and 2004, after controlling for fertility rate, income per
capita, illiteracy, access to running water, availability of local hospital care, and income
concentration (measured by the Gini index). They found that a significant impact that
increased with coverage, from 13% (incipient PSF, coverage <30%), 16% (intermediate
PSF, between 30 and 70%) and 22% (consolidated PSF, >70%). This suggests that the
larger impact is obtained when PSF is incipient, and gradually declines as coverage
increases.


27
   These estimates are based on IBGE population data, and are therefore slightly different from MOH
estimates, which use their own population estimates.

in Brazilian Municipalities. American Journal of Public Health, January 2009, Vol 99, No. 1.


                                                 42
16.     Rocha and Soares (2010) 29 confirmed that PSF coverage had a large impact on
infant mortality, but also significant - though smaller - impact on adult mortality, except
for those over 59 (where impact was not consistently significant).
17.     Macinko et al (2010) 30 and Tursi et al (2012) 31 showed that PSF also had a large
impact on the proportion of hospital admissions for Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions
(ACSC) between 1999 and 2007 in municipalities participating in PROESF: in almost
every state admissions for ACSC dropped significantly (24% on average, from 18.4/1000
inhabitants to 14.3), and more so than admissions for non-ACSC (9%, from 39.5 to 36.9).
Hospitalizations for ACS chronic diseases (asthma, stroke, other CVD, hypertension,
Diabetes, and COPD) fell twice as fast as for all other conditions. In municipalities with
high PSF coverage, ACSC rates were 13% lower than in those with low coverage, after
controlling for other factors. However, the opposite was true for diabetes: hospitalizations
increased with PSF coverage, possibly due to either increased detection and access,
weaknesses in disease management, or data classification errors.

Project costs
18.     Of the original project funding of US$166.7 million (50% each for the Bank and
GOB), 42.44 million were disbursed from the World Bank´s commitment, or 51% of the
total. We assume that GOB disbursements followed those from the Bank, thus spreading
between 2010 and 2013.
19.     Recurrent costs arising from the project were calculated in the same way as for the
PAD (on the basis of US$5.46 per capita per month), but starting in 2010 rather than 2008
due to Project delay, and computed on the new population and coverage data.
20.     The resulting total costs are shown in Table 2.

21.    Consistent with the initial Economic Analysis, this assessment concentrates on two
major impacts that are easier to measure: the expected reduction in hospitalization rates

(direct benefits) and mortality rates (indirect benefits) from selected conditions. Direct
benefits are those accrued from savings in hospitalizations, and indirect benefits were
measured in Potential Years of Life saved from educed mortality. The detailed indicators
used for the assessment are shown in Table 3, with their original values (in the PAD) and
revised/updated values.
22.     The resulting benefits estimation applies these new findings without assessing their
strength or reliability relative to previous studies; this means that the new impact
estimations are not necessarily better than those used for the PAD, but tend to be on the
lower range of impact.

        3- CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED

   Project Design - PROESF

        Phase 1 of the Expansion and Consolidation Project for the Family Health Strategy (PROESF),
   launched in 2003, was based on a realistic diagnosis of the Primary Health Care situation in Brazil.
   In 2003, coverage of the Family Health Program, the main core of the primary health care model
   funded by the Federal Government, was at a low level in the urban centers. By the end of PROESF
   Phase 1 in 2007, however, the number of family health teams had increased, serving the 184
   municipalities that participated in the program. The main goal of the project was thus achieved.
       Work on Phase 2 of the PROESF began in 2007, but this phase was not initiated until October
   2009 for reasons related to negotiating and approving the loan agreement with the Brazilian
   Government. In 2011, under the new government, the National Primary Care Policy underwent
   major improvements, and new goals were set that led to some inconsistency between the original
   PROESF goals and the new Primary Care targets and incentives.
        In 2012 the Project restructuring proposal included making the necessary adjustments to
   bring the project more closely into line with the Ministry of Health´s interests regarding Primary
   Care. The aim of the restructuring exercise was to implement the new Primary Care information
   system (the e-SUS-AB) in the Primary Health Units in the areas covered by the QUALISUS Networks
   Project. However, the deadlines for implementing this proposal were too tight, since
   administrative formalities needed to be completed prior to publication of the official public
   announcement. In the event, these procedures began in 2012 and were not completed until the
   end of the third quarter of 2014.

Project Implementation

    At the beginning of Phase 2 the Project´s financial execution structure was especially focused
on the municipal and State components (55% and 12%, respectively). In other words, the Project
was not to be implemented directly by the Ministry of Health, despite the fact that the Union was
accountable for the loan agreement. We thus depended on other entities to deploy the Project
resources. The Ministry provided support and incentives to the States and municipalities to enable
them to use the resources for implementing the planned actions, but circumstances beyond MoH
control made it difficult to achieve better results.
     Brazilian bidding rules, plus World Bank rules, also impeded the financial execution and
implementation of the agreed Project actions. In this respect, we can point to certain rules that
caused misgivings and doubts among the managers, such as the use of the shopping modality and
Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) for funding execution. A significant outcome of this was,
for example, the use of funds to purchase vehicles (25%).

    A further important question was the dissipation of resources on action plans that covered
many different activities. This led to low-value amounts being transferred, causing considerable
extra work being devoted to activities of limited effectiveness.
    Finally, the Federal management of the project was put in the hands of an exclusive team (the
Project Management Unit) which, to a certain extent, led to the PROESF and other Primary Care
Department projects being sidelined.

Financing

     The amount financed by PROESF became increasingly irrelevant for the municipalities over
the Project period in view of the amounts of Federal Government monies transferred to them.
     In 2003, Federal Government transfers to the municipalities to fund Primary Care activities
amounted to over US$3 billion. This figure gradually increased over the years to over US$12 billion
in 2012 and US$14 billion in 2014. Meanwhile, PROESF funds amounted to US$68 million in Phase
1 and US$83 million in Phase 2.



                                                             58
Results Achieved - agreed commitments

        This report has referred to the agreed actions to be carried out under the PROESF, and
the detailed strategies adopted to achieve those (items 3.0 and 4.0).

        The achievement of most or virtually all the agreed actions resulted especially from the
Federal Government´s own-resource investment efforts and is not attributable to the use of
PROESF resources.

Weakness in the Brazilian Information System

        The information system used as a data source for calculating indicators in Phase 2 of the
PROESF was the SIAB (Primary Care Information System), which has been in use in Brazil since
1998. This system has for long been the target of efforts aimed at improving or replacing it, given
its many identified weaknesses. Since 2011, the Ministry of Health has invested in the SUS-AB
strategy for Primary Care (SISAB, detailed in topic 4.4).

         When analyzing the agreed targets and indicators committed to by the PROESF, it is clear
that there are weaknesses in the production of SIAB data such as: lack of a mechanism for avoiding
wrong numerical values being entered; value-added capture leading to lack of confidence in the
data; no institutional obligation to fill in the data; and little use-value for workers and managers.
One example is the indicator “Average number of visits by Family Health Team doctors and
nurses.” The historical series shows that the average number of visits peaked in 2007, alleging 4.4
consultations per inhabitant/year, while the average for 2003-2006 was only 1.8 consultations
per inhabitant / year.

Relationship with the World Bank

        The oversight of PROESF implementation tended to focus more on monitoring physical-
financial requirements than on providing technical support for actions that could have
contributed to correcting the issues identified in this report, principally those concerning the
improvement of management procedures.

         The meetings between the DAB/PROESF team and the World Bank were restricted to the
routine missions, and there were no opportunities for sharing analyses on Brazil´s Primary Care
situation with a view to understanding how the new programs and actions designed to enhance
the Family Health Strategy could be used to improve the Project actions.

Annex 10. Detailed Project Description

Component 1: Expansion and Consolidation of Family Health Care in Municipalities
(US$133.45 million Total Project Cost, US$55.0 Loan Financing)

1.     Component 1 would support scaling up and strengthening PSF capacity at the
municipal level, in 187 municipalities (out of 250 municipalities) with populations over
100,000. Coverage extension activities, aimed at raising PSF population coverage from
about 34 to 37 percent, would continue to focus on large urban areas that are characterized
by poorly integrated, traditional delivery system, with large numbers of families living in
poverty and confronting severe social risk.

2.      The component would finance works (new construction and rehabilitation), goods,
training and technical assistance for the following four sets of activities:

   (i)        the extension of Family Health to municipalities where this model was in an
              initial phase of implementation, and continued expansion of the model in
              municipalities that had already made significant headway on family health, but
              had yet to attain coverage targets. This activity would also support the
              conversion of traditional health units to the PSF model;
   (ii)       consolidation, quality improvement and innovation in municipalities that had
              shown significant progress in coverage extension during Phase 1, including
              strengthening supervision and managerial capacity, establishing links to higher
              level services for care management, and introducing the PSF quality assessment
              program;
   (iii)      support for municipal-based in-service training, the financing of which would
              be decentralized to participating municipalities through the MOH’s grant
              transfer subsystem (fundo à fundo); and
   (iv)       improvement of monitoring and information systems.

3.      This component would focus on improving management of primary health care in
selected municipalities. Capacity building activities would include development and
implementation of activities aimed at strengthening PSF teams (training courses;
instruments and methods of supervision of teams; new health care practices, work
processes and protocols), PSF management (performance-based management systems;
instruments; capacity building of Family Health Coordination Units; and performance-
based contracts between managers of eligible municipalities and Family Health teams), and
PSF M&E (information systems to manage data, track results and assess performance, and
M&E systems).

4.     Funding would be made available to municipalities, under the pooled funding
approach, on the basis of the following criteria:

          •   Eligibility. The 187 municipalities that participated in PROESF 1 would be
              eligible to participate, once they: (i) complied with fiduciary obligations; (ii)
              maintained or increase the number of PSF teams since 2003; (iii) presented a


                                               62
              investment plan by the announced date; (iv) presented revised investment plan
              addressing recommended modifications by the announced date; (v) had
              appointed a technician responsible for project coordination; and (vii) had sent
              representatives to project launch and training workshops.
          •   Subprojects and Results-Based Agreements. The 187 municipalities that
              participated in PROESF 1 were divided in groups according to technical and
              fiduciary risks. This grouping would determine the initial level of financing
              available to each municipality under the Project. Each municipality would sign
              PSF agreements with the MOH that would specify 12 results indicators.
              Achievement of these indicators would determine future levels of financing,
              including possible additional funding for elective bonus indicators.
          •   Municipality Exclusion. Municipalities that did not initiate financial execution
              of their subproject 12 months after receiving the transfers would lose eligibility
              for further funding until the issue was resolved. The state and federal levels
              would provide technical assistance to solve the financing or technical issues
              that impeded execution of municipal subprojects. Irregular use of project funds
              and/or low execution of project financing would exclude a municipality from
              subsequent financing.

Component 2: Strengthening State Capacity for Supervision, Monitoring and
Technical Support of Family Health Services (US$17.45 million Total Costs, US$12.45
million Loan Financing)

5.      Component 2 would strengthen state capacity to: (i) support municipalities extend
coverage, improve technical quality, and manage service delivery, with a special focus in
municipalities with less than 100,000 inhabitants; (ii) improve the quality of family health
human resources; and (iii) conduct monitoring and supervision as key functions of state
health secretariats. The component would finance goods, materials, training and technical
assistance for three sets of activities implemented by 26 states and the Federal District, as
follows:

   (i)        Organizational structuring of state health secretariats to play a central role in
              oversight, monitoring and quality improvement of municipal AB/PSF delivery
              systems. Activities would include: establishment of State Family Health
              Coordination teams to provide technical support and monitor the performance
              of primary care and family health services implemented by municipalities under
              their jurisdiction; managerial training of AB/PSF coordinators; development
              and training of teams to supervise small and medium-sized municipalities,
              implementation of the MOH’s quality assessment of Family Health providers
              in small and medium-sized municipalities; and equipping offices for State PSF
              Coordination teams.
   (ii)       Support for continuous education of family health professional and para-
              professional staff.     This would involve, among other activities, the
              establishment of partnerships with universities and other training institutions to
              develop in-service courses for Family Health professionals and para-
              professionals, such as community health agents and dental hygiene assistants.


                                               63
   (iii)   Institutionalization of monitoring and supervision functions in state secretariats.
           This would involve the development of a program for management and
           evaluation based on targets and performance, and the development of state
           plans to measure and evaluate municipal performance in Family Health.
           Specific activities include: (a) establishment of monitoring teams to assess, on
           a regular basis, the performance of municipalities in the operations of their
           primary care systems; (b) upgrading of information systems to manage data and
           track performance of municipal family health services; (c) equipping offices for
           monitoring and supervision teams; (d) development of skills required for
           monitoring and evaluation of family health services; (e) implementation of
           evaluative and operational research to measure the performance of municipal
           primary care providers; and (f) supporting implementation of information
           systems, including the development of a database with information to establish
           and track primary care indicators.

6.      Funding would be made available to states, under the pooled funding approach, on
the basis of the following criteria:

   •   Eligibility. The 26 states and the Federal District would be eligible to participate
       once they: (i) presented an investment plan by the announced date; (ii) presented a
       revised investment plan addressing recommended modifications by the announced
       date; (iii) had appointed a state AB/PSF coordinator; (iv) had appointed a technician
       responsible for project coordination; and (v) had sent representatives to the project
       launch and training workshops;
   •   Subprojects and Results-Based Agreements. States and the Federal District would
       be grouped according to technical and fiduciary risks. This grouping would
       determine the initial level of financing available to each under the Project. Each
       state would a sign PSF agreement with the MOH that would specify 6 results
       indicators. Achievement of these indicators would determine future levels of
       financing, including possible additional funding for elective bonus indicators.
   •   State Exclusion. States that did not initiate financial execution of their subproject
       12 months after receiving the grant would lose eligibility for further funding until
       the issue was resolved. The federal level would provide technical assistance to
       solve the financing or technical issues that impeded execution of the state
       subprojects. Irregular use of project funds and/or low execution of project
       financing would exclude a municipality from subsequent financing.

Component 3: Strengthening Federal Oversight of the Family Health Program
(US$15.8 million Total Cost, US$16.0 million Loan Financing)

7.      Component 3 aimed at strengthening PSF oversight capacity at the federal level, by
strengthening the capacity of the MOH to provide support to states and municipalities in
the implementation of Components 1 and 2. This component was to finance goods, training,
technical assistance and project incremental operational costs for the development of PSF
accountability arrangements, including results-based financing and management, and
support the states and municipalities to develop training programs, research, monitoring


                                             64
and evaluation arrangements, and coordination and supervision capacity. It would also
finance research and evaluative studies on specific aspect of PSF service organization and
delivery as well as institutionalize AB/PSF impact evaluation in the MOH. Several
activities were to support implementation of interventions under Components 1 and 2,
including: (i) development of inter-municipal cooperation agreements; (ii) development
of a new monitoring system for federal performance assessment of states and
municipalities; (iii) introduction of results-based management practices (e.g., performance
contracts between municipal managers and PSF teams); (iv) development of results-based
management system for federal financing to states and municipalities; (v) development and
testing of cost accounting systems for AB/PSF; (vi) development of clinical guidelines for
primary care case management of specific diseases and conditions; (vii) strengthening of
formation of family health professionals through supporting specialization, and research
for Family Health professionals; (viii) training and capacity building activities for Family
Health Teams; and (ix) special initiative to share experiences and innovations of PSF teams.
