                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Building on the current NSP, the NSP II will scale up the program to "lay the foundations for strengthening of community level governance, and to support
                         community-managed subprojects comprising reconstruction and development that improve access of rural communities to social and productive infrastructure
                         and services."

                          Reaching out to an estimated additional 4,318 new villages, the NSP II will (i) establish a framework for village level consultative decision making and
                         representative local leadership as a basis for interaction within and between communities on the one hand, and with the administration and aid agencies on the
                         other, (ii) implement social and economic productive activities addressing the basic village needs, and (iii) develop human capital and livelihood which will
                         improve household welfare.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR was prepared based on the supervision mission carried out from September to November 2010. The mission was extended over a period of many months because of a
                         very detailed FM review which included review of the MRRD Incremental Operation Costs. The keyachievements by NSP during this period are as follows:
                         1.       Since November 2009, 4,897 communities have fully utilized their block grant, totaling 16,785 communities. In addition, 7,979 subprojects have been completed during this
                         period totaling 42,512 subprojects.
                         2.       NSP's Decentralization Strategy is being implemented, the regional offices have been closed and additional staff are being transferred to the provincial offices. NSP's
                         relationship with FPs has improved. Monthly Tri-partite Meetings (NSP, FP Representative Group and WB) and monthly FP Coordination Meetings continue to take place.
                         3.       There has been a significant increase in the number of engineering trainings provided to FPs by the Engineering Department. There has also been an increase in the
                         number of field visits undertaken by the Eng. Dept.
                         4.       Implementation Monitoring (IM) and Post Implementation Monitoring (PIM) reports are produced regularly, Community Participatory Monitoring has been rolled out to 610
                         communities and a CPM operational manual has been developed.
                         5.       FP input monitoring system has been developed which will allow NSP to monitor the number of FP staff deployed at the district/provincial levels as well as the training
                         provided by FPs to CDCs.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1.       Closing communities. The recent supervision mission observed that the project disbursements are low with US$ 35.5 million disbursed in SY 1389 so far, averaging a
                         disbursement of approximately US$ 7.1 million per month. This reduction in the disbursement of block grants is mainly attributed to the completion of physical work in communities.
                         There are 1,397 NSP I and II communities that have not yet received any block grant funding and an additional 2,395 communities that have only requested and utilized a part of their
                         block grant allocation. The key reasons for slow progress in these communities are deteriorating security or community level conflict. The mission strongly recommends that NSP
                         submit a proposal to the Bank for closing these communities and amending FP contracts accordingly.

                         Until the process of closing is finalized, NSP should defer further support to the 1,397 communities to NSP III when they are ready. This way, the project can (i) avoid another
                         extension of the NSP II grant closing date come September 30, 2011 and (ii) avoid requesting a significant amount of additional money for NSP II while waiting for these problem

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                               Report No: ISR1809



                         communities to be ready. NSP must be seen as a continuum and there should not be a demarcation wall between NSP II and NSP III.

                         2.       Closing the District School Rehabilitation Window (DSCRW) - This component with a budget allocation of US$ 10 million has been in implementation since May 2007. The
                         mission strongly recommends that the DSCRW be brought to a closure as soon as possible. Any contracts for DSCRW schools not yet awarded should be dropped and the
                         component not extended beyond September 30, 2011.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
