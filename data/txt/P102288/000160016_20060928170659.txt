ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  
 
Project Objective  
 
Building on the current IDA operation, the proposed project will expand to new areas to 
lay the foundations for a strengthening of community level governance, and to support 
community-managed subprojects comprising reconstruction and development that 
improve access of rural communities to social and productive infrastructure and services.  
 
Reaching out to additional 4,316 new villages, the outcomes will be (i) the establishment 
of a framework for village level consultative decision making and representative local 
leadership as a basis for interaction within and between communities on the one hand, 
and with the administration and aid agencies on the other, (ii) social and economic 
productive activities implemented and maintained by the communities, addressing the 
basic village needs, and (iii) the development of human capital and livelihood which will 
improve household welfare. 
 
Project Components 
 
The proposed IDA Grant will finance about 23 percent of the total projected cost of the 
National Solidarity Program in the next three years and for the following components: 
 
(i) 
Block Grants for communities
 (US$94.3 million) to carry out 
Subprojects involving reconstruction and development activities through a 
facilitated participatory planning process. This will cover about a third of the 
amount estimated to complete block grant disbursement to existing and new 
communities (US$288 million) for the whole program. While the use of block 
grants is demand-driven following the Community Development Plan priorities, 
based on the experience gained in the program to date it is expected that block 
grants will be invested mainly on community-based productive and social 
infrastructure.     
 
(ii) 
Community Facilitation and Subproject Preparation
 (US$9.7 
million) to support local communities through: (i) facilitation exercises to 
establish inclusive community institutions, and identify local development needs 
and priorities; and (ii) assistance for preparing subproject proposals.  The FP 
cycle of support to CDCs has been reduced from three years in the first phase of 
the program to two years.  The two year timeframe will allow the FPs to support 
communities with mobilization and the establishing and functioning of CDCs as 
inclusive community institutions; the formulation, through a consultative process, 
of community development plans, identifying local needs and priorities; and 
assistance and capacity building for the implementation of priority subprojects, 
based on the community development plans utilizing the block grant.

(iii) 
CDC Capacity Development
 (US$14.4 million) to assist CDCs in 
carrying out subprojects for which block grants have been made available, and 
capacity building for members of local communities. These services will 
strengthen local communities’ capacity in financial management, procurement, 
and technical skills. 
 
(iv) 
Implementation and Management Support
 (US$1.5 million) 
comprising provision of consultants’ services for capacity building in, 
implementation support to, and incremental operating costs for the MRRD.  The 
project will also augment the MRRD’s human and physical capacity to supervise 
and implement the project.   
 
At the end of the three years, it is expected that: (i) the NSP will have covered all districts 
across the country making available basic social and productive infrastructure and other 
services resulting from receipt of block grants, and (ii) that 21,600 CDCs (90 percent of 
an estimated total of 24,000 villages) will be performing as representative bodies to lead 
community development planning and financing in their areas per the CDC by-laws. 
Potential impacts of various components 
Activities envisaged under the project should not entail significant and negative 
environmental and social impacts, provided they are designed and implemented with due 
consideration of environmental and social issues.  Rather, most subprojects envisaged 
under the project should contribute to improving environmental and social conditions in 
rural Afghanistan.  Adverse impacts may arise due to depletion or degradation of natural 
resources such as stone, earth, water etc. used for construction of small-scale 
infrastructure.  Construction activities may cause limited, temporary, and localized 
negative impacts that can be mitigated through the implementation of an appropriate 
social and environmental management plan.  Certain types of investments with negative 
environmental or social impacts cannot be undertaken and are included in a negative list 
of prohibited investments.  In terms of social impacts, the proposed project falls in the S-
3
category of the Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements, and 
Compensation (Attachment 3). 
 
No land acquisition
is anticipated.  In the current socio-political context in the rural areas, 
involuntary land acquisition is unlikely for the kind of small-scale activities that will be 
undertaken under the proposed project for two reasons.  The first is, that local authorities 
do not have access to funds to purchase land or other assets if land acquisition were to be 
undertaken.  The second is, that the political costs (in terms of opposition from affected 
landowners/users) would in all likelihood deter the government apparatus from 
attempting to acquire any land against the will of those affected.  If any minor areas of 
land would be needed for a project (e.g. realignment of an irrigation canal, or land for a 
school), such land could only be obtained through either private voluntary donations, 
compensation paid by the community (i.e. transaction between willing buyer-willing 
seller), or from available government land.  Private voluntary donations and community 
purchases would be documented as required by the Framework, and for government land, 
Page  3
3
documentation would be needed that the land is free of encroachments, squatters or other 
encumbrances, and has been transferred to the project by the authorities.  
 
The design for the proposed project defines a strategy, which will ensure that ethnic 
minority groups
are included as beneficiaries, and that their concerns are addressed in 
compliance with the requirements of OD 4.20.  The key elements of this strategy are (i) 
the project is national in scale and coverage, and consequently reaches all the country’s 
different ethnic groups, (ii) the facilitated participatory planning process at the 
community level includes an approach for election of Community Development 
Councils, which will provide for representation of all sub-groups in the community, (iii) 
both internal monitoring and external independent evaluation will assess the 
inclusiveness of Community Development Councils and thus provide information that 
would constitute the basis for corrective actions, if necessary, and (iv) independent 
monitoring by civil society (NGOs and the press) will provide another mechanism to 
identify cases where ethnic minority would have been bypassed or marginalized. 
 
Chance finds of cultural property
(archaeological artifacts) during implementation of 
subprojects involving civil works will be reported to the provincial or district governors, 
who then will inform the Archaeological Committee. 
 
Compliance with the safeguard provisions and the negative list will be ensured through 
an environmental, social and mine risk screening procedure (check lists) required for 
subproject proposals, and by internal input, process, and output monitoring, independent 
external monitoring by consultants, and by Bank supervision missions. 
 
Purpose of the Environmental and Social Management Framework 
Currently social and environmental management in Afghanistan is suffering from critical 
capacity constraints.  Since there is potential for adverse environmental impacts, albeit 
limited, from the proposed activities under the NSP, their mitigation and management is 
key to the wholesome development of rural communities throughout Afghanistan.  
Hence, keeping in view the existing management capacity, as well as the flexibility 
required due to the demand-driven nature of the project, a framework approach is 
adopted.  It provides for early identification of potential adverse impacts, without the 
requirement of rigorous analysis through quantification, and also provides broad 
guidance for their effective mitigation.  Consistent with existing national legislation, the 
objective of the Framework is to help ensure that activities under the project will: 
·
Protect human health;  
·
Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;  
·
Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects or 
their cumulative effects;  
·
Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and, 
·
Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.

General Principles 
Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed reconstruction operation, and the 
related need for providing assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in 
managing potential environmental and social risks, this Framework is based on the 
following principles: 
 
1.  The proposed project will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs of 
which is known at appraisal.  To ensure the effective application of the World 
Bank’s safeguard policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to 
be taken during implementation for the selection and design of subprojects, and 
the planning of mitigation measures; 
2.  All proposed subprojects will be screened (using Matrix 1) to ensure that the 
environmental and social risks can be adequately addressed through the 
application of standardized guidelines (using Matrix 2); 
3.  The design of the NSP aims at ensuring regional balance in terms of coverage of 
ethnic and religious groups, as well as gender equity with regard to decision 
making on subproject selection and project benefits.  Employment opportunities 
within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the basis of 
professional competence, irrespective ethnic or religious group affiliation.  In all 
projects which require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, 
gender-separated consultations will be conducted to elicit the views of the female 
population, along with that of the male population; and,   
4.  Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special 
needs of these operations.  Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this 
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in 
Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto, and in the World Bank Infoshop.  
 
Safeguard Screening 
Additionally, the selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects 
will be consistent with the following guidelines: 
 
·
A
negative list of characteristics that would make a proposed subproject ineligible 
for support (Attachment 1); 
·
Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation 
(Attachment 2); 
·
Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance discovery 
of archaeological artifacts, and unrecorded graveyards and burial sites 
(Attachment 3). 
Page  5

Mitigation measures 
Sound design will if not eliminate, then at least diminish to the extent possible, most 
of the potential adverse impacts of project activities.  Good Engineering design will, 
in most cases, have a positive impact on the environmental conditions in the project 
area.  Construction and operation stage impacts will be addressed through a 
simplified Environmental Management Plan. The EMP is provided in measures 
identified in this ESMF such as the Attachments, Matrices and other provisions of 
this ESMF. Social and environmental guidelines and codes of practice satisfactory to 
the Bank will need to 
be
included in the Project’s Operational Manual at all time.  
 
Environmental Guidelines for Communities,  FPs and Contractors 
 
The following guidelines should be added to the ESMF and included in the contractual 
agreements: 
·
Installation of the work site on areas far enough from water points, houses and 
sensitive areas. 
·
Sanitary equipments and installations if needed appropriate 
·
Site regulation (what is allowed and not allowed on work sites) 
·
Compliance with laws, rules and other permits in vigor.

Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation 
 
The overall responsibility of project implementation rests with the Ministry of 
Rehabilitation and Rural Development (MRRD).  A designated Safeguards Nodal Officer 
will be identified with responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the 
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework and Management Plan within the 
Project Management 
Team (PMT) at the MRRD. The Ministry’s Focal Point will be 
supported by the Oversight Consultant firm managing the implementation of the project, 
which will be responsible for (i) appraising subproject proposals, and (ii) monitoring that 
subproject implementation is in accordance with the provisions of the social and 
environmental management framework  
 
Capacity Building  
As part of the social and environmental capacity building that will be provided for 
implementation of IDA-financed operations in Afghanistan, the Safeguards Focal Points 
and relevant staff of the MRRD and implementing agencies/Consultants will receive 
training in the application of the Safeguard Framework.  It is proposed to prepare specific 
materials, hold a workshop, and arrange site visits to other countries in the region on 
similar projects in progress to provide hands-on training to the Ministry and 
implementing agency staff.  Specialist training modules may be considered after an 
acceptable level of base knowledge has been established. This capacity building activity 
will be implemented under a separate Technical Assistance program for Environmental 
and Social management.  
 
Page  7
7
During supervision of the proposed project, IDA will assess the implementation of the 
Framework, and if required will recommend additional strengthening. 
 
Environmental expertise within the implementing and executing bodies will be 
strengthened. Training programs will designed and implemented with the assistance of a 
local or international expert and will target two levels: 
 
MRRD/NSP OC and FPs
:
At the initiation of the PFO, a one day workshop will be 
provided to the Staff of the MRRD/NSP OC and FPs to raise environmental awareness 
and to clarify the specific Environmental requirements related to design and 
implementation of the CDP. 
 
A
three days workshop will then be provided to the MRRD/NSP OC environmental 
specialist and to the environmental specialist/consultants of the FPs and will cover the 
following topics: 
·
EIA techniques 
·
Screening projects for environmental review 
·
Use of practical checklists 
·
Best environmental practices in design and implementation of projects 
·
Effective implementation of mitigation measures 
·
Project supervision 
·
Monitoring and evaluation 
 
Local NGOs and Contractors
:
Training would be provided through 1 or 2 days workshop 
for local NGOs and contractors, focusing on public awareness, case studies of      
environmental issues experienced in similar projects, use of environmental guidelines and  
implementation of mitigation measures. 
 
Consultation and Disclosure 
 
This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework will be disclosed by Islamic 
Republic of Afghanistan in both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be 
made available at the World Bank’s Infoshop. It is worth noting that Islamic Republic of 
Afghanistan intends to make all project documentation publicly available through the 
Afghan Information Management System (AIMS). 
 
Extensive consultations have been held with the Facilitating Partner NGOs regarding the 
NSP approach and implementation arrangements.  Subprojects will involve consultations 
within the communities regarding (i) the holding of secret ballot elections for 
representative community development Councils, (ii) prioritization of community needs, 
(iii) identification of projects corresponding to these needs, (iv) development and costing 
of subproject plans, and (v) arrangements to ensure disclosure of budget and 
expenditures.  The following information on the project would be posted on IRA’s web-
site:  summaries of quarterly NSP implementation progress reports, summaries of annual 
project financial statements and audit reports, and summaries of findings from monitoring 
and supervision teams (after a reasonable period for internal review). 
Page  8

Environmental and Social Monitoring 
 
Environmental and Social Monitoring will be the responsibility of the FPs and will 
include: 
·
Compliance monitoring during construction 
·
Monitoring of significant impacts during the operation of the subproject. 
 
The Environmental and Social specialist of the MRRD/ NSP OC will also conduct 
periodic monitoring by visiting the sites of the various programs at least twice a year. 
 
Monitoring indicators shall be developed for both the construction and the operation 
phase of the subprojects. Monitor of construction activities will have to ensure that 
mitigation measures of construction impacts are being implemented properly, while the 
monitoring of operation is to ensure that no unforeseen negative impacts are arising.  
Typical examples of monitoring plans are given in the table below.

Indiscriminate installation of irrigation wells using motorized extraction of ground water have in 
some areas contributed to lower the ground water table, and constitute a threat to the traditional sustainable 
irrigation by 
karez
.
Until water resource assessments of a particular catchment area or basin has been 
undertaken and has established that  irrigation is feasible, investments in motorized irrigation wells is not 
permitted.

Thus, investments involving an expansion of the command area of an irrigation system can only 
take place with agreement from the owners (or users in case of tribal common land) of the land brought 
under new irrigation.

Attachment 2
Guidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation
I. Objectives 
 
Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum and no person will be involuntarily displaced under 
subprojects financed by the proposed emergency reconstruction operation.  Subproject proposals 
that would require demolishing houses or acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed 
to minimize or avoid their impacts through alternative alignments.  Proposals that require more 
than minor expansion along rights of way should be reviewed carefully.  No land or asset 
acquisition may take place outside of these guidelines.  A format for Land Acquisition 
Assessment is attached as Attachment 2(i). 
 
These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons to ensure that 
all such persons negatively affected, regardless of their land tenure status, will be assisted to 
improve, or at least to restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to 
pre-project levels.  
 
Categorization 
 
Based on the number of persons that may be affected by the project (Project Affected People, 
PAPs) and the magnitude of impacts, projects may be categorized as S-1, S-2, or S-3 projects: 
 
a. 
S-1 projects are those that will involve the resettlement of more than 200 PAPs and 
where a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) must be produced.  Such interventions 
will be ineligible for support under the proposed emergency reconstruction 
operations. 
b. 
S-2 projects are those which will involve the resettlement of less than 200 persons. In 
such cases, the following documentation is required: (1) a land acquisition 
assessment, (2) the Minutes or record of consultations which assess the compensation 
claimed and agreement reached, and (3) a record of the receipt of the compensation, 
or voluntary donation, by those affected (see below). 
c. 
S-3 projects are not expected to have any land acquisition or any other significant 
adverse social impacts; on the contrary, significant positive social impact and 
improved livelihoods are expected from such interventions. 
 
II. Eligibility 
 
PAPs are identified as persons whose livelihood is directly or indirectly affected by the project.  
PAPs deemed eligible for compensation are: 
 
(1) 
those who have formal legal rights to land, water resources or structures/buildings, 
including recognized customary and traditional rights; 
(2) 
those who do not have such formal legal rights but have a claim to usufruct right 
rooted in customary law; 
(3) 
those whose claim to land and water resources or building/structures do not fall 
within (1) and (2) above, are eligible to assistance to restore their livelihood. 
 
Acquisition of Productive Assets and Compensation 
 
Page  12
12 
 
PAPs are eligible for replacement costs for lost assets as described below:
 
a. 
Voluntary contributions
.
In accordance with traditional practices, individuals 
may elect to voluntarily contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or 
permanently from their land without compensation.   
b. 
Contributions against compensation
.
A
contributor/asset loser considered 
"affected" will be eligible for compensation from the local community or 
alternatively from the Government.  A PAP shall lodge his/her claim for 
compensation to the local community representatives/shura head and it shall be 
verified by the implementing agency.  The claim shall be lodged within 2 weeks of 
completion of the consultations with the concerned community, and before project 
implementation begins. 
 
Voluntary contribution, or contribution against compensation, should be documented.  The 
documentation should specify that the land is free of any squatters, encroachers or other claims.  
A
format is attached in Attachment 2(i), which includes a Schedule to be followed to assess any 
compensation claimed and the agreement reached. 
 
III. Compensation Principles 
 
The project implementing agencies shall ensure that any of the following means of compensation 
are provided in a timely manner to affected persons: 
 
(1) 
Project affected persons losing access to a portion of their land or other productive assets 
with the remaining assets being economically viable are entitled to compensation at 
replacement cost for that portion of land or assets lost to them. Compensation for the lost 
assets will be according to following principles: 
a. 
replacement land with an equally productive plot, cash or other equivalent 
productive assets; 
b. 
materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures that will be demolished; 
c. 
replacement of damaged or lost crops and trees, at market value; 
d. 
other acceptable in-kind compensation; 
e. 
in case of cash compensation, the delivery of compensation should be made in 
public, i.e. at the Community Meeting. 
 
(2) 
Project affected persons losing access to a portion of their land or other economic assets 
rendering the remainder economically non-viable, will have the options of compensation 
for the entire asset by provision of alternative land, cash or equivalent productive asset, 
according to the principles in (1) a-d above. 
Consultation Process 
 
The implementing agencies will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets located in 
a
proposed subproject area are consulted.  There will be gender-separate community meetings for 
each affected 
mantaqa/gozar 
(urban infrastructure) or village (other projects) to inform the local 
population about their rights to compensation and options available in accordance with these 
Guidelines.  The minutes of the community meetings shall reflect the discussions held, 
agreements reached, and include details of the agreement, based on the format provided in 
Attachment 2(ii). 
 
Page  13
13 
 
The implementing agency shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected persons and confirm in 
discussions with each of them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements 
reached, and any eventual complaint.  Copies will be recorded in the posted project 
documentation and be available for inspection during supervision. 
 
Subproject Approval 
 
In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the implementing 
agency shall: 
 
a. 
not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed 
between the affected person and the local community; 
b. 
not allow works to start until the compensation has been delivered in a satisfactory 
manner to the affected persons; 
c. 
if more than 200 persons are affected and require compensation, the subproject shall 
be deemed ineligible for support under the emergency reconstruction operations.  
 
Complaints and Grievances 
 
All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the local community/village 
level.  If this falls, complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation of the 
agreements recorded in the Community Meeting Minutes or any alleged irregularity in carrying 
out the project can also be addressed by the affected persons or their representative at the 
municipal or district level. If this also fails, the complaint may be submitted to the relevant 
implementing agency for a decision. 
 
Verification 
 
The Community Meeting Minutes, including agreements of compensation and evidence of 
compensation having been made shall be provided to the Municipality/district, to the supervising 
engineers, who will maintain a record hereof, and to auditors and socio-economic monitors when 
they undertake reviews and post-project assessment.  This process shall be specified in all 
relevant project documents, including details of the relevant authority for complaints at 
municipal/district or implementing agency level.

Attachment 3 
Protection of Cultural Property
Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works of art, or sites of "outstanding universal 
value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point of view, 
including unrecorded graveyards and burial sites.  Within this broader definition, cultural 
property is defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical, 
architectural, or religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values.  
 
The proposed emergency reconstruction operations are unlikely to pose a risk of damaging 
cultural property, as the subprojects will largely consist of small investments in community 
infrastructure and income generating activities, reconstruction of existing structures, and minor 
urban public works.  Further, the negative list of attributes, which would make a subproject 
ineligible for support (Attachment 1), includes any activity that would significantly damage non-
replicable cultural property.  Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection 
from theft, and treatment of chance finds should be followed and included in standard bid 
documents. 
 
Chance Find Procedures 
 
Chance find procedures are defined in the law on Maintenance of Historical and Cultural 
Monuments (Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and responsibilities 
of cultural heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered in the course of project 
implementation.  This law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural 
artifacts are state property, and further:   
 
1. 
The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment of historical and cultural 
monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry of Information 
and Culture, which has representation at provincial level. 
 
2. 
Whenever chance finds of cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are 
made the Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation of 
work endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended 
until a solution is found for the preservation of these artifacts. 
 
3. 
If a moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact is found in the countryside of a 
province, the provincial governor (
wali
)
or district-in-charge (
woluswal
)
should be 
informed within two weeks, and they should inform the Archaeological Committee.  In 
case the immovable historical or cultural artifact is found in a city, the provincial branch 
of the Department of Maintenance of Historical Values of the Ministry of Information 
and Culture should be informed within two weeks (art. 18).  If the find is made within the 
center, the Archaeological Committee must be informed directly within one week (art. 
25).  
 
4. 
Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punished with a 
fine or imprisonment for a period of one week or up to one month (art. 72). 
 
5. 
If someone intentionally damages a historical or cultural artifact, the culprit shall pay 
compensation in accordance with the value of the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period 
of one month to ten years depending on the gravity of the crime (art. 71). 
Page  18
18 
 
In case of a chance find of moveable or immovable historical or cultural artifact, the 
implementing agency is responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage 
until the responsibility has been taken over by the relevant authorities as specified above.  
 
These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when 
applicable.  During project supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above regulations 
relating to the treatment of any chance find encountered are observed.   
 
Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and 
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness of the project’s 
cultural resources mitigation, management, and capacity building activities, as appropriate.
