These are some of the negative\n            environmental impacts and their proposed mitigations. Land\n            subject to plant removal will have vegetation restored,\n            including a greenbelt set up along roadsides. Drainage works\n            will include ditches to prevent soil erosion, run-off,\n            floods, and interference with irrigation. Earth borrowing\n            and waste disposal will comport with design requirements and\n            topsoil will be reclaimed and restored. Dumped earth will be\n            arranged and compressed in tight layers according to the\n            height of the retaining wall. Construction during the rainy\n            season will avoid the rainy season. Oil from vehicles and\n            construction machines will be collected and disposed of in a\n            landfill. Soundproofing windows will reduce noise. Noise at\n            construction sites will be controlled by restricting time\n            and place of activity, and by consulting residents who will\n            be impacted when necessary and compensating them. Workers\n            themselves will wear protective helmets and ear-plugs. Dump\n            sites quarries, and mixing plants will be located beyond\n            residential areas, material covered when hauled, and sites\n            sprayed in order to minimize dust."}, "docdt": "2000-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
