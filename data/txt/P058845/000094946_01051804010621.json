{"cdata!": "The Second Jiangxi Highway Project aims\n            at providing more efficient, and safe transport\n            infrastructure in support of social, and economic\n            development in the Province. The components will: 1) expand\n            highway capacity through the construction of the\n            Taihe-Ganzhou Expressway (TGE), partly traversing\n            mountainous areas, to serve Ganzhou, the province second\n            largest city, and, substantially reduce travel distances to\n            Guangdong Province. TGE construction includes tunnels,\n            interconnecting roads, toll stations, and service/rest\n            areas, as well as equipment supply. Furthermore, a\n            management, and maintenance center, and monitoring centers\n            will be included, in addition to electrical/mechanical\n            facilities for telecommunications, lighting, and monitoring\n            activities; 2) include a road improvement program, designed\n            to help people in poor counties, increase their income,\n            through better access to product markets, employment\n            opportunities, social services, and facilities. This program\n            will improve forty roads sections, and eight selected\n            sections located in four counties. Performance indicators\n            include average daily traffic, availability, and cost of bus\n            services, number of days the road is closed/non-available,\n            number of school children, number of people visiting\n            hospitals/clinics, and, increases/decreases in the County\n            per capita income; 3) enable highway safety, through safety\n            measures at roadwork sites, safety audit checklists, and a\n            pilot project to identify hazardous locations; and, 4)\n            restructure institutional framework to adapt to the changing\n            economic, and competitive environment in China. It includes\n            studies on organizational changes, supply of equipment, and,\n            related training programs. Land acquisition will take place,\n            thus resettlement issues are further discussed in the\n            Resettlement Action Plan."}, "docdt": "2001-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
