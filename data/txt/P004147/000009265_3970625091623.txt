MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIlE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
PUSAN CITY GOVERNMENT, REPUBLIC OF KDREA, FOR A
PUSAN URBAN MANAGEMENT PRWOECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Pusan City
Government (PCG) with the Guarantee of the Republic of Korea for $50
million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be on standard Bank terms and would help finance urban services in
Pusan City.
2.       Background.  With a population of 3.5 million, Pusan is the
second largest city in Korea and has 14% of the Country's total urban
population. It is an important industrial, commercial and educational
center, and has the largest port in Korea. During the last five
years, Pusan's investment centered in constructing 110 km of subway
lines at a cost of $3.5 billion. The subway and other large
investments, mainly for highways, water supply and pollution
treatment, averaged $400 million p.a. between 1983-86. These
investments, however, lacked adequate prioritization, and have not
been undertaken in the context of a well-formulated strategy linking
long-term plans and programs with available resources. In some
projects, the demand, investment phasing and resulting benefits have
been inadequately planned. The subway investments forced a long
postponement of smaller but higher priority investments, which would
allow the completion and full utilization of existing infrastructure.
Financial constraints, exacerbated by short-term financing and the
revaluation of the loans in yen, have forced PCG to lower its sights.
Plans to extend the subway beyond a single main line have been
postponed indefinitely and major cuts have also been made in other
planned investments. A major cause of these problems has been the
city's inappropriate institutional arrangements which hinder urban
management.  A framework for investment planning and financial
management is urgently needed, as well as organizational improvements,
which would apply to other cities as well.
3.        Project Objectives.   The proposed project would focus on
improvement of the city's urban management and finances. The project
objectives are to: (a) improve the city's organization and
coordination; (b) strengthen project selection and investment
planning; (c) coordinate and optimize transportation planning and
investments, now the city's most critical problem; (d) strengthen the
city's financial, planning and managerial systems; and (e) support
priority investments and the balanced development of the city.
4.        Project Description.   The proposed project would support
the implementation of a comprehensive program of institutional and
policy development for PCG, included in the Policy Statement and
Institutional Development Program (PSIDP) adopted by PCG (para. 7).
The project would finance about one third of the investments included
in the city's Investment Plan, with emphasis on small, complementary
works which complete the benefits of existing infrastructure. The
project comprise about 330 subprojects each over W 0.4 billion and



many smaller investments including the expansion and improvement of:
(a) priority roads (expansion, rehabilitation, paving); (b) a
comprehensive program of low-cost transportatlon improvements under
the Transportation System Management (TSM); (c) drainage, flood
protection and sewerage works; (d) embankment and steep slope
protection; and (e) city services (markets, landfill, equipment,
community facilities).  Most of these works are in low-income areas.
Road improvements are particularly important by providing access to
many urban services.
5.       The proposed loan of US$50 million equivalent would finance
26S of the total project cost of US$194 million equivalent, less
duties and taxes (US$ 2 million).  A breakdown of the cost and
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Korea are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map (IBRD No. 20210) is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6524-KO, is being distributed separately.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The urban management project
now proposed for Pusan City capitalizes on the experience gained under
previous Bank-assisted projects in urban transport, water and
sewerage, and land development, and brings to bear the lessons learned
under those projects in a comprehensive way, both for city
institutions and policies, as well as for the overall management of
the city. Bank support would facilitate the introduction of
improvements to centralize dispersed transportation activities,
optimize urban transportation, prioritize urban investments, and
ensure sound long-term planning. With its past involvement with urban
development in Korea and wide experience elsewhere, the Bank is well
placed to help Pusan to achieve these objectives. It is hoped that
the improvements fostered under the project would serve as models for
other cities in Korea.
7.        Agreed Actions.  PCG has defined its policies and programs
to strengthen its urban management, organization and finances in a
PSIDP approved by the city in March 1987. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that the any changes on the PSIDP would be discussed with
the Bank, and that PCG would annually review with the Bank the
progress achieved in implementing its Institutional Development
Program. PCG confirmed at negotiations that under its PSIDP it would:
(a) establish by December 31, 1987, a new Bureau of Transportation and
Tourism, (which would include the recently created Traffic Planning
Division), to consolidate planning of all transportation systems and
investments;   (b) establish a TSM unit by December 31, 1987 to
implement small but important improvements to optimize existing
transport  facilities;   (c) establish by December 31,  19B7 an
Investment Management Unit to critically review and evaluate large
investments and improve the guidelines for prioritizing small
projects; (d) establish by December 31, 1987 a long-term planning and
management information system, including performance monitoring of
PCG's General Account and Special Accounts; (e) review yearly with the
Bank the city's Investment Plan and Long-Term Financial Plan, to set



a                                             - 3-
priorities and maintain a satisfactory financial position; (f) expand
existing in-house training programs to provide training in
transportation management, urban planning, computer applications,
budgeting and financial planning; (g) complete and review with the
Bank before December 31, 1987 studies for a Pusan Fund Management
Special Account, to foster cost recovery, integrated financial
management and better use of the city's cash resources and (h)
establish joint management of water and sewerage services by December
31, 1988 to improve the efficiency, coordination and financing of
these services.
8.       Justification.  By strengthening the organization, planning,
policies and management of PCG, and implementing a priority investment
program, the proposed project would improve the standard of living of
the population, and strengthen the finances and provide a reliable
base for the development of Pusan City. These improvements would be a
model for other cities in Korea, expanding the project benefits. The
improved coordination of transportation through the introduction of
transport system management techniques and organizational improvements
would have high payoffs both in economic terms and by the reduction of
accidents and saving of lives through improved road safety. The
project has already resulted in the definition of a priority
Investment Plan, postponement of lower-priority, large investments and
emphasis on small works needed to achieve the full benefits of
existing infrastructure or to allow the provision of other urban
services. Since most investments would be constructed in lower-income
neighborhoods, it is estimated that at least 20% of the project cost
would benefit persons from the poverty group (which totals about 16%
of Pusan's population). The project would also improve the health and
environmental living conditions of the population through the
provision of improved services of sanitation, drainage, water supply,
solid waste, roads, transportation, and the promotion of balanced
development of the overall city. PCG's Investment Plan has been
evaluated to produce high economic and social returns. The economic
return of investments in social services are difficult to quantify,
particularly for small subprojects. The Economic Rate of Return for
subprojects representing two thirds of project investments average
24%.
9.       Risks.  There are no serious risks to the project.  The risk
of some delay in central government approval of the institutional and
policy reforms is minimized by PCG's commitment to the proposed
institutional programs and its intention to implement these measures
in less than one year.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
