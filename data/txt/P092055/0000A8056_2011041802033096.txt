                         Implementation Status Overview
                          Although the power distribution system has been completed, tests required under the construction contract, of the quantity and quality of available gas for the pilot power generation
                         plant have determined that the gas resources are insufficient to meet the design criteria for the plant. With this development, the Timorese power utility, the Electricite de Timor Leste
                         has decided not to proceed with the generation part of the project and will now explore other options for use of the distribution lines already completed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          In view of the decision not to proceed with the entire project as originally envisaged, the additional financing that the Bank was preparing to cover cost overruns has now been
                         dropped and Timor-Leste plans to request cancellation of the unused portion of the grant proceeds.
