were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was high,\n            the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the significant impacts of the realization of the\n            risk, even if the probability is low, should be seriously\n            considered. The risk of lower than expected gas yields was\n            rated as modest based on the feasibility study. Due to the\n            relatively low cost pilot nature and the urgency to provide\n            electricity services to the poor, the decision was made to\n            implement the project to take the risk. However, the\n            impacts, should the risk occur, were so high that stronger\n            confirmation of this critical project assumption should have\n            been made during preparation. There is a need to ensure\n            adequate implementation capacity when the Bank embarks in a\n            small country. The required support to capacity of people\n            and environments need to be carefully identified and\n            sufficiently addressed not only regarding project\n            management, but also across the whole range of skills\n            including procurement and financial management. The Bank\n            should be more flexible to the changes in Government\n            strategy to power development in the project area. As soon\n            as the Bank learned that the national power development plan\n            included the national transmission lines covering the\n            project areas, which making the project redundant, the Bank\n            could have restructured or even cancelled the project."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
