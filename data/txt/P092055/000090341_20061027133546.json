Where\n            involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, resettlement\n            activities should be conceived and executed as sustainable\n            development programs, providing sufficient compensation,\n            assistance and rehabilitation to the displaced persons (DPs)\n            so that they would be at least as well off as they would\n            have been in the absence of the project. DPs will benefit\n            from the project by maximizing number of families to be\n            connected to distribution system and subsidize for\n            vulnerable groups in connecting to project distribution\n            network. Project stakeholders (including DPs) are consulted\n            and given the opportunity to participate, as practicable, in\n            the design, implementation, and operation of the project;\n            and DPs should be assisted in their efforts to improve their\n            livelihoods and standard of living or at least to restore\n            them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels. The\n            compensation and entitlement policy will apply to all\n            displaced persons regardless of the total number affected or\n            the severity of impact. Particular attention is paid to the\n            needs of vulnerable groups among those displaced: especially\n            those below the poverty line, the elderly, women and\n            children, and ethnic minorities."}, "docdt": "2006-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
