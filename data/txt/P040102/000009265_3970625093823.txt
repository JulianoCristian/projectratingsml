Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators): The project seeks to increase private financing
and management of infrastructure within competitive market structures in sectors including toll roads, transport, power, natural gas
distribution, telecommunications, water supply, and waste water treatment. Achieving this objective will help the country to improve
the quantity and quality of infrastructure services through the development of an effective policy and regulatory framework and
adequate practices.
2. Project components: To achieve its objective, the project would finance studies, consulting services, training and equipment to
improve the regulatory framework, including the environmental regulatory framework, and to promote private participation. The
project is designed as a "wholesaling" operation in which specific activities to be funded have not been defined in advance, except
for the initial six-monthly pTogram (see Annex 2). Eligibility critena have been defined for screening proposals. This approach will
provide the necessary flexibility to achieve the project's strategic objectives and to respond to existing demands.

3. Benefits:
The main benefit will be a consistent global approach of Government to increased private participation in the development and
financing of infrastructure, resulting in:
(i)  Accelerated pace of the privatization program.
(ii)  Sound and competitive market structures in infrastructure.
(iii) Lower Government risk exposure and contributions in individual transactions, and lower bids on expected tariffs.
(iv) Coordinated and strong regulatory agencies to ensure competition and equity in the infrastructure sectors.
(v)  Strengthened enabling environment for private sector power generation, transmission, and distribution.
(vi) Reallocation of scarce Government resources to investments in social sectors.
(vii) Clearer priorities for public sector actions.
(viii) An integrated plan for roads infrastructure that identifies potential roads to be offered in concession to the private sector.
Target population:
The direct beneficiaries of the technical assistance will be central, sectoral and municipal government agencies, including DNP and
MHCP, as well as the Ministries of Transport, Mines and Energy, Communications, and Environment; Civil Aviation Authority;
Regulatory Commissions for Energy and Gas, Telecommunications, and Water and Sanitation; Superintendency of Ports; National
Institute of Roads; and other departmental and municipal entities asking for assistance for pilot projects. The ultimate beneficiaries
will be the users of infrastructure facilities, who will benefit from the improved quantity and quality of infrastructure services and/or
lower tariffs resulting from improvements in operational efficiency. Through new investment opportunities investors, entrepreneurs,
and workers will also benefit.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period:                          Four years.
Project oversight: To ensure cross-sectoral consistency, a Project Committee composed of the head of the infrastructure unit of DNP
and the Director General for public credit of MHCP will set the strategic direction of the project based on the policies decided by
"Comite de Participaci6n Privada" (CPP). The activities included in the work plan will have to comply with agreed criteria,
including that they help to establish a consolidated policy, regulatory and institutional framework and help build examples of best
practice for private participation in infrastructure. This would ensure that the sum of project activities continues to meet the
Govermnent's overall development objectives and supports the chosen strategy.
Project coordination: The Project Committee will: i) select requests for TA according to preestablished criteria and procedures;
ii) review periodically, together with the Bank's and IDB's task managers, the project implementation plans (initial plan was
reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory); iii) reach agreements with beneficiary entities on the specific activities to be carried
out and their counterpart contributions. The two lead agencies (DNP and MHCP) will coordinate with each beneficiary seeking
technical assistance and will be responsible for agreeing on the terms of reference, schedule, and costs for each activity. As a
condition of disbursement, beneficiary entities outside Central Government will enter into a written agreement with the Project
Committee on the objectives, issues to be addressed, performance indicators for the requested activities, and commitments by the
beneficiary entity; and iv) guide the implementation of the project, including approval of TORs, selection of firms, and award of
contracts. At the time that a specific activity is approved for support under the project TA, the Project Committee will decide
whether DNP or MHCP will be responsible for the activity.
Executing agencies: The division of responsibility between DNP and MHCP will be in line with their functional specialization and
mandate: DNP will manage the activities related to the development of the regulatory framework, structuring of infrastructure
projects targeted for concession or privatization, direct support to entities planning concessions and privatization, institutional
strengthening of entities granting concessions and privatizing, and establishing an adequate environmental management system.
MHCP will manage the activities for the transactions support component such as background feasibility studies, valuation of assets,
concession design, and bidding process support. Each agency will be solely responsible for the management of the respective
activities within the scope agreed with the Project Committee. The Project Committee will also designate, in consultation with the
beneficiary agency, a technical team (from within the central ministries) to supervise the execution of the activity. This technical
team, in consultation with the beneficiary agency, DNP, MHCP, IBRD and IDB, will be responsible for evaluating and approving
the consultants' reports.
The two lead agencies will be supported by two Project Coordination Units (PCUs), which in turn will work with line ministries,
different levels of government, and other beneficiaries. These units will pursue agreement with the beneficiary agencies on the

scope of the proposed technical assistance, terms of reference and their submission for the approval of the Project Committee, and
identification of consultants and/or consulting services, including the preparation of short-lists, publication of notices, evaluation of
proposals, ensuring participation of the beneficiary institutions in the assignments, the auditing of contracts, as well as the necessary
reporting requirements to the Project Committee and IBRD and IDB. Based on previous successful experiences, the Government
will contract a procurement agent to provide administration support services to undertake procurement, and manage contracts.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Because the proposed project will be cofinanced by the World Bank
and the IDB, it will need to fulfill the accounting, reporting and auditing requirements of both institutions. DNP and MHCP will be
responsible for meeting the accounting and reporting requirements of both the IBRD and the IDB for the activities executed and will
obtain from the procurement agent all financial information of procurement it performed. Each agency will maintain records and
accounts to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources and expenditures for each project
activity. The accounts will be consolidated annually to prepare financial statements for the project as a whole. Project financial
statements will be prepared in accordance with Bank guidelines and models. Supporting documentation will be maintained and
made available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. For expenditures incurred on the basis of statement of
expenditures, all records evidencing such expenditures will be retained by the PCU for at least one year after the Bank has received
the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account is made.
Project records and accounts, including the SOEs, will be audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing standards
consistently applied by auditors acceptable to the Bank, with terms of reference for auditors and reports approved by the Bank.
Auditors will be guided by the Bank's Financial Accounting, Reporting, and Auditing Handbook (FARAH), published in January
1995 and other Bank guidelines. Audit reports will be furnished to the Bank within four months after close of the Government's
fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Within the Government, monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken by the Project
Committee and will be done continually with six-monthly missions scheduled by the IBRD and the IDB. These consultations will
provide a mechanism to evaluate the impact of the activities undertaken in the previous six months and to define in detail the
activities planned for the following six month period. The evaluation of the project will look at each sector separately both in terms
of development impact and implementation progress, aggregating the results in summary assessments. Based on comments by the
beneficiary agencies about the consulting services, a summary assessment of these services by sector will be prepared. The project is
also provisioning for third party technical audits and assessment of outcomes.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective supported by the project: Colombia's private sector has identified poor and  Document number and date
deteriorating infrastructure as a critical constraint to economic growth. Consequently, a key CAS  of latest CAS discussion:
objective is to improve the quantity and quality of infrastructure services in several sectors by  P6070, December 16, 1993
encouraging and facilitating private investment in infrastructure. The project supports the CAS
objective by helping to design and put into place regulatory frameworks that will reduce bottlenecks
and promote private participation in key infrastructure subsectors. Other issues such as mobilizing
private finance of adequate maturity and cost of funds for infrastructure projects to be feasible would
be addressed by a complementary operation: the Private Infrastructure Finance Facility. Project
specific constraints to mobilizing project financing that may require partial risk guarantees would be
addressed by other operations such as the El Vino- Tobia Grande Toll Road project.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Since 1989, the Government has initiated wide-ranging policy and legal changes to invite private participation in
infrastructure. GoC monopolies in shipping, railways, airlines, ports and agricultural marketing have been eliminated by allowing
private entry or by liquidating or reorganizing public monopolies. Recently, CONPES Document 2775 (April 26, 1995) clearly
defined the objectives of inviting participation in infrastructure - to increase efficiency, to mobilize additional resources, to reduce
risks assumed by the public sector, to obtain benefits of competition, and to channel public resources into social sectors. The
Development Plan (1994-98) reflects this policy stance and estimates that 40 percent - i.e., $13 billion of the anticipated $32 billion
- of new investments in infrastructure would eventually be provided by the private sector. The legal framework has been amended to
facilitate private participation in infrastructure.

Country: Colombia                                                           Project Title: Regulatory Reform Technical Assistance Project
Initial results of the Government's policies have been successful in mobilizing private finance for more than 25 concessions in
roads, ports, power generation, oil and gas pipelines and cellular telephony. These projects have mobilized more than $ 3 billion
from private financial markets, two thirds of it from international and domestic banks and about one third from the international
bond markets.
However, there is inadequate institutional capacity within the government agencies to implement the privatization and
concession process for maximum benefit to the economy. Insufficient progress has been achieved toward the Development
Plan's ambitious objectives. The process of privatization is complex and needs substantial skills and experience in a large number of
technical areas - for example regulatory framework, concession design, procurement rules, contracting practices, and rules for
issuing government guarantees. Lack of adequate skills and experience in dealing with these issues, particularly at the regional and
municipal levels, has been a major constraint in designing the most efficient processes for inviting private participation and in
negotiating concessions to get the best terms for the Government. Thus, procedures have been unnecessarily prolonged.
Govermnent has agreed to substantially greater risk exposure than it had anticipated There is, therefore, an urgent need to
strengthen institutional capacity at the sectoral and regional government entities and the central ministries to provide adequate
technical support to mobilize private capital under the most favorable conditions.
The regulatory framework needs further development for greater clarity and harmonization across sectors. GoC has made a
number of recent legal reforms to support its policy of private participation in infrastructure: Public Contracts Law' (Law 80 of
1993); Transport Law2 (Law 105 of 1993); Residential Public Services Law 3(Law 142 of 1994); and Electricity Law (Law 143 of
1994). Each of the laws, taken on its own, represent important progress in elaborating effective regulatory frameworks for private
participation in infrastructure in Colombia. However, progress achieved in each sector's regulatory framework varies greatly and
the overall regulatory framework remains a complex combination of laws, decrees, regulations, decisions by regulatory entities, and
concession contracts, not all of which are fully compatible. In some cases, implementing regulations have not yet been elaborated.
Some sectors still require further analysis and refinement of regulations to fully take into account the issues of competitive market
structures, enforcement of regulatory arrangements, and concession design. Lack of clarity about these matters has been a major
obstacle for a more accelerated pace of infrastructure privatization and the conclusion of financeable deals.
The regulatory institutions responsible for enforcing the regulatory framework need to be refocused and coordinated. To
face the new regulatory demands induced by increasing private sector participation, the Government abolished the old National
Tariff Board and created regulatory commissions for telecommunications, water and sanitation, and electricity and gas. These three
conunissions are in charge of setting rate formulas, fees, conditions for auctions, and technical and commercial conditions for
competitive market development. Though the Government had initially proposed fully independent regulatory commissions, these
have emerged as semi--independent, with representation both from government officials and technical experts, which has entailed
that the regulatory agencies are not independent from the ministries. There is no regulatory commission in the transport sector.
Instead the regulatory framework is managed under the umbrella of the Ministry of Transport. Actual supervision and monitoring
of the rules established by the commissions is carried out by the Superintendency of Public Services, which has substantial degree of
discretion in the way it operates. The Superintendency has little track record in this area, so the institutional capacity can not yet
be assessed. A significant issue concerning the regulatory agencies is the need to refocus their efforts from their past mandate of
using their regulatory powers to control internal management decisions of public sector entities to more strategic regulation of the
external environment to ensure the competitive pressures in the sectoral market.
Adequate and clear environmental requirements and procedures are needed. GOC passed an Environmental Law (Law 99 of
1993) and issued an Environmental Licenses Decree (Nr. 1753 of August 1994), and the norms are still being amended and
modified. The environmental regulations need to be brought to a stage at which they facilitate the planning and costing of
implementing and operating infrastructure projects while ensuring sustainable development.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project seeks to address regulatory, institutional, and environmental issues. The nature of these issues varies among sectors.
This was confirmed in a recently completed Bank review (Private Participation in Infrastructure: Considerations for Colombia,
October 1996). In the more advanced sectors like power, telecommunications, and ports, project activities will focus on
consolidating markets, revising regulations for emerging services, deregulating tariffs, and promoting competition. In the less
' Law 80 defined the concession contract and differentiated it from public works contracts and sets out rules in public contracting such as requiring
competitive bidding on major contracts.
2 Law 105 allows private road infrastructure through concessions.
3Law 142 sets out the basic regulatory framework for public services.

advanced sectors like water and roads, the support will focus more on creating the required capacity, developing new regulations,
and designing adequate procedures for concessions.
The strategic options to address the issues above were to give project based assistance or to base Bank assistance on the ongoing
policy dialogue. The project based option was chosen because of the large indirect costs arising from the delays in Colombia's
infrastructure investment program that led to the Government's request for Bank assistance. Another strategic decision was to
cofinance this operation with the IDB. Given that the technical assistance supported through this project will lay the groundwork
for the development of the policy framework in a number of key sectors of the economy, close collaboration on this operation will
contribute to a coordinated policy dialogue and conformity of approaches in both institutions.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The technical assistance operation to support private provision of infrastructure in Colombia faced two main options: to support
transaction contracts with the objective of achieving contract based regulation, or to strengthen the regulatory framework and
support a few transactions to provide examples of best practice and identify weaknesses in the framework. The second option was
chosen because the option of contract based regulation would be very costly: in Colombia's legal system it would require a very large
number of contracts without really establishing enforceable precedent.
A decision was also taken on how to provide technical assistance, whether as a component of another operation to support the
private provision of infrastructure services - such as the Private Infrastructure Financing Facility, El Vino- Tobia Grande Toll Road,
and Power Loan- or as a separate project. A separate technical assistance operation was chosen for two reasons:
*   The proposed technical assistance operation, while complementing and supporting other operations, would provide a
framework within which to address the policy and implementation aspects of private infrastructure issues
comprehensively and systematically. It would bring together as well as develop further the work of other operations,
achieve synergies in the many discrete initiatives undertaken so far, and coordinate assistance so as to mainstream
private provision of private infrastructure services across all sectors and levels of government.
*   For operational reasons we want to keep each investment lending operation focused and simple. This would be much
easier to do with a separate operation. In addition, preparation is quicker and easier, and supervision is simpler.
requirements that indicate the need for.
Another choice was between a technical assistance approach that identifies all activities upfront and one that leaves substantial
flexibility for the activities within a well-specified scope of activities. The second option was chosen - a "wholesaling" operation
with predefined criteria for considering requests for technical assistance - because it provides the necessary flexibility to achieve the
TA's strategic and development objectives and to respond to emerging demands.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The design of this project draws on the lessons learned from the experience of the Bank in the delivery of technical assistance and in
support of privatization to many countries, including Colombia. Among the Colombian experiences are a technical assistance loan
to promote energy markets (currently being implemented) and a completed "Public Sector Reform Loan" (which was instrumental in
getting much of the deregulation and privatization work started). The lessons drawn are:
* Need for Government ownership and priority, flexible project design, and regular supervision accompanied by substantive
policy dialogue. This lesson is built into the design of the operation, which provides for the project activities to be considered every
six months by a high level Project Committee and the technical missions of both co-financing institutions.
*  Need for adequate project scope. The activities to be supported through the program emphasize support for adequate cross-
sectoral coordination, sound privatization strategy and the establishment of adequate regulatory systems. These include streamlining
bidding documents, identification of privatization best practice, and transactions support. These are all activities shown to be crucial
for long-run success and ones in which the Bank has potentially the greatest impact. In later stages of the privatization process
assistance from investment banks and other technical advisors will become more important.
*  Need for adequate coordination among beneficiary entities. The establishment of a high level Project Committee structure takes
this lesson into account.
*  Need for a strong implementing agency. This lesson has been taken into account by placing project execution in units that
already exist, are operational, and have a good track record of managing projects of this kind. In the past procurement has delayed
project implementation, the project will address this problem by using a procurement agent.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
*   GOC sent a written request requesting the Bank's support for the work considered in the project, has authorized the borrowing
from the Bank, and has already included resources in its budget for counterpart funds.
*  GOC has publicly and officially committed itself to expand and modernize the country's infrastructure through private
participation. For this purpose CONPES ("Consejo Nacional de Politica Econ6mica y Social" - the ministerial-level economic policy
body) established a committee ("Comite de Participaci6n Privada"- CPP) to handle issues related to private sector participation in
infrastructure projects.
*  The ambitious goal is to obtain private financing for 42% of the infrastructure requirements for the period 1995-1998.
*  The Government is advancing at a fast pace in preparing the various sectors for privatization and concessions. Concessions have
been granted for ports,4 airports, roads,5 gas transport, cellular telephony, and power generation.6 As part of the program the
Government has announced its intention to accelerate private participation in infrastructure, with a view to enhancing efficiency and
improving the competitiveness of the Colombian economy.
* Municipalities have expressed their interest in being part of pilot operations.
475% of cargo is handled by the private sector.
Eleven roads concessions worth US$566 million have been granted (three with foreign participation) of which seven are under construction.
e Four PPAs have been signed and five more are under negotiation.

12. Value added of Bank support:
*  The Bank's input, based on its worldwide experience in privatization, particularly in the areas of competition, industry and
sector structure, and legal and regulatory issues will enhance the development of the regulatory framework.
*  The Bank's participation in the program can enhance the credibility of the Government's efforts. Investors are closely
scrutinizing the Government's comnuitment to privatization and will carefully assess the legal and regulatory framework, concession
design, and the transparency of the privatization process. Project finance is a relatively new area, one in which skills are relatively
difficult to find in-country.
*  The Bank can assist in defining a regulatory framework that minimizes risk exposure assumed by Government through
guarantees or other financial obligations to private agents.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments
13. Economic Assessment   E    Cost-Benefit Analysis: Not Applicable   |  Cost Effectiveness Analysis:
Most cost effective project alternative as explained in sections 7 and 8. The potential economic gains from a successful project are
very large. For example in June 1995, a 26 year operations and maintenance contract for Cartagena's water company was signed
with a private operator. The operator aquired 45% of the shares of the company. In a year operating revenue increased by 20%,
gross income went from negative US$2.5 million to positive US$1 million, metering increased from 47% to 62 %, and service
coverage is expanding. The potential gains are such that even if the project is only partially successful the benefits clearly outweigh
the cost of the project.
Fiscal impact: The proposed project will have minimal direct fiscal impact. However, as shown by the privatizations in Colombia
and other countries in the region, a successful project could contribute to reducing fiscal transfers to loss making enterprises,
decreasing fiscal outlays for infrastructure projects, and increasing privatization revenue.
14. Financial Assessment: The project does not lend itself to the calculation of financial rates of return. However, just a 1%
reduction in the cost of the Government's infrastructure investment plan resulting from efficiency gains through private
management would yield benefits of more than US$300 million. For individual transactions a detailed financial assessment will be
prepared by investment bankers.
15. Technical Assessment:   The technical merits of individual activities will be assessed by the Project Committee. The criteria
include the extent to which they help to establish a consolidated policy, regulatory and institutional framework and help build
examples of best practice. (Also see aide memoire on criteria and process for selection of activities available in the project files,
Annex 6).
16. Institutional Assessment:
a. Executing agencies: Both DNP and MHCP have existing and operating project implementation units that will also manage
the technical assistance to be provided through this project. Activities to be executed by MHCP will be coordinated through the
existing Coordinating Unit for IDB's Program of Sectoral Investments (PSI) and those of DNP through the Coordinating Unit of the
Financial Management Modernization Program (also coordinated the successful Public Sector Reform Loan) supported by the World
Bank. The considerable project execution experience of these two agencies will be reinforced with the hiring of a procurement
agency to manage the contracts expected under this project.
b. Project management: The two members of the Project Committee are experienced project managers, are supported by a
qualified team, and will be working in close cooperation with IDB and Bank staff.
17. Social Assessment:    Any social issues arising out of privatization and business reorganization would be evaluated in the
context of individual proposals submitted for financing under the project. Activities to design schemes for orderly enterprise
liquidation, management of labor liabilities, training and worker ownership schemes are included in the project.
18. Environmental Assessment:  Environmental Category         I  A  [E  B       z        C
The project will include: a) activities to design and put in place: i) systems to integrate enviromnental and economic policies; ii) an
improved licensing process and procedures to undertake and evaluate EIA and audits; iii) mechanisms to improve coordination
between national, sectoral and territorial environmental agencies; and iv) standard procedures to include environmental components
in public bidding documents; b) preparation of TORs for environmental evaluations of new concessions and environmental audits
for existing installations to be privatized that are identified to have significant environmental impact will be prepared. TORs for

20. Sustainability:
The project is expected to have a lasting impact on Colombia's business environment and infrastructure sectors. By supporting
both a comprehensive policy for the privatization of major infrastructure sectors and the implementation of the privatization process,
the project will help the Government improve the economy's competitiveness. The project emphasizes designing adequate
regulatory systems, a matter often neglected in the rush to privatization; identifying best practices (streamlining bidding documents,
etc.) for achieving results at the lowest cost for the Government; and releasing public funds for alternative uses - all crucial for
arriving at sustainable policy solutions. In addition, the project's sustainability is enhanced by the ongoing economic dialogue on
private infrastructure issues that is taking place in parallel.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects: None foreseen at the moment. However, some of the activities could lead to enterprises being
restructured and to retrenchments. The impact is expected to be small in light of the process described in sections 17 and 19 and
because participating enterprises will mostly self-select.

Regulatory Reform Technical Assistance Project
Detailed Project Description
The project is designed as a "wholesaling" operation in which specific activities to be funded by the project
are not defined in advance, but criteria are spelt out for eligibility. Govemment entities can submit proposals for
activities to be funded through the technical assistance for approval by the Project Committee on the basis of these
pre-determined criteria. This approach will provide the necessary flexibility to facilitate the achievement of the
project's strategic objectives and to respond to existing demands.
The main criteria for the selection of activities would be that they help to establish a consolidated
policy, regulatory and institutional framework and help build examples of best practice. Other criteria would
be the commitment and interest of the beneficiary, policy and institutional prerequisites are fulfilled, environmental
issues are being addressed, the impact of the outcomes can be monitored and disseminated, and those other agreed
between the Project Committee and the Bank. Based on this, the Project Committee, in consultation with the two
co-financiers, the IBRD and the IDB, will meet every six months to agree on the activities to be funded during the
next six month period. The following examples provides a description of the activities that would comply with
criteria and qualify for assistance:
*   Expert legal, financial and economic advisors to help ensure consistency among pnvatization approaches in
the various subsectors. Such consistency relates inter alia to foreign investment regulations, rules goveming
concessions, application of anti-trust regulation, tax, accounting and valuation issues, labor issues, treatment
of debt restructuring and other liabilities including pension liabilities, implications of environmental issues,
alternative dispute resolution procedures for different levels of disputes, approaches to design and
implementation of regulatory institutions and financial regulations. In general, the consultants would assist in
the analysis of sector structure, the development of strategic options, policies and regulations;
*   Consultants (investment banks) to design and participate in the privatization process;
*   Special studies and training programs for the staff of the regulatory agencies would be supported in the above
areas to develop effective and sustainable policy approaches;
*   Promotion and dissemination of experiences in private participation; and
*   Procurement of necessary software, hardware and related equipment to strengthen institutions and facilitate the
monitoring of the privatization of infrastructure.
Activities included in the first six-monthly plan of the project and their estimated total cost is attached:

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of consultant's services would be done according to the provisions of the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" (August 1981) and of goods
according to the provisions of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans" (January 1995, revised August 1996).
A procurement agent would be hired under a Management Service Agreement with DNP and MHCP to expedite project
implementation. The administrative expenses would be paid with loan proceeds directly to the procurement agent.

Seminars
Note: Identical thresholds for prior review for consulting services for firms and for individuals were defined because of the
nature of the expected activities and to be consistent with IDB's parallel operation.
Disbursement
The Govemment through the executing agencies will request an initial disbursement to be deposited with the
procurement agent. The procurement agent will make payments directly to consultants and suppliers. Expenditures for
individual contracts of goods or services, for which prior review by the Bank is not required will be disbursed against
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). Detailed supporting documentation for expenditures will be kept by the procurement
agent and submitted by the borrower to the Bank. The application for withdrawal submitted by the borrower to the
procurement agent will be in amounts of about $500,000. Full documentation for all contracts requiring Bank's prior
review will be submitted. Disbursements, representing mainly expenditures under short term technical assistance, will be
made over a 4-year period, which is the average disbursement profile for technical assistance projects in the Latin
America and Caribbean Region. Since the implementation of reforms has already started, retroactive financing not to
exceed US$1 million (i.e., 8% of the loan amount) would be applied to finance eligible expenditures made after October
31, 1996 but no more then a year before loan signing.
