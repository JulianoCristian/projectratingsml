Reform Technical\n            Assistance Project seeks to increase private financing and\n            management of infrastructure within competitive market\n            structures in sectors including toll roads, transport,\n            power, natural gas distribution, telecommunications, water\n            supply, and wastewater treatment. Achieving this objective\n            will help Colombia to improve the quantity and quality of\n            its infrastructure services through the development of an\n            effective policy, regulatory framework, and adequate\n            practices. The project will finance studies, consulting\n            services, and training and equipment; ensure a consistent\n            and effective legal and regulatory framework, including the\n            environmental regulatory framework; and promote private\n            participation and competition by addressing specific issues\n            and removing constraints. The privatization component will\n            identify and develop projects for potential private\n            participation, structure deals, design model bidding\n            documents and implement demonstration projects in priority\n            sectors; develop models to make bidding procedures efficient\n            and transparent; help develop institutional capacity within\n            sector agencies to structure projects suitable for private\n            participation; prepare environmental audits and evaluations\n            for existing installations identified as having significant\n            environmental impact; and carry out marketing and\n            information dissemination activities."}, "docdt": "1997-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
