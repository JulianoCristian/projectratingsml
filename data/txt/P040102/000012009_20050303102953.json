Lessons related to project design\n            issues, stipulate a demand-based technical assistance\n            project, covering many sectors and cross-sectoral issues is\n            a preferred option over a design with predefined activities.\n            In this case, it provided flexibility to accommodate\n            priorities within the defined criteria. This flexible design\n            was essential to facilitating the transition between\n            administrations. As for lessons relating to implementation\n            issues, it is suggested the learning process promoted by\n            this technical assistance loan improved institutional\n            capacity among National Government agencies, several\n            municipal governments, and, investment banking firms and\n            consulting firms are also familiar with these privatization\n            procedures. This resulted in shorter periods for awarding\n            concessions, smoother processes, lower costs in structuring\n            projects, and overall better rules for private participation."}, "docdt": "2005-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
