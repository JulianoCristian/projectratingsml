F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The proposed Credit, the first in a proposed three tranche, programmatic series, supports policy and
institutional actions to improve the results of Program 135, Phase 2 as an entry point to a wider,


                                                            2
emerging agenda for systemic change in the way national targeted programs (NTPs) in Vietnam are
conceived and implemented. This reform agenda aims broadly to promote informed participation and
civic engagement at community level in the Government's poverty-targeted public investment programs
as a primary means to improve the results of these programs. Given that a number of the originally
defined indicators at appraisal were not sufficiently clear to allow for measurement of progress, these
were updated using information from the baseline survey and mid-term review, and reflected in the
revised policy matrix which was formalized in the documentation for DPC2. The revised indicators,
where applicable, are specified in the comments section for each indicator in the tables below along with
the percentage level of achievement.

This ICR was prepared after the first operation, rather than at the end of the planned programmatic series
of three development policy credits because the second operation was presented to the Board of
Directors of the World Bank more than 24 months (26 months) after the presentation of the first
operation. As the preparation of the ICR followed the mid-term review of the P135-2, and coincided
with the process of preparation of the second operation, the revised outcome indicators discussed during
the MTR and agreed and used for the second operation are reflected as such in this report in order to
provide a more precise indication of progress in each of the key policy areas supported by the series.

        1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

        1.1     Context at Appraisal

        1. Country Background. Vietnam has experienced rapid and consistent growth and poverty
        reduction since launching its transition towards the use of market mechanisms (Doi Moi) in the
        late 1980's. The reforms improved the security of individual land tenure, enhanced the provision
        of agricultural extension services and permitted freer trade in agricultural products, resulting in a
        dramatic increase in farm production and a reduction in rural poverty. At a macro level, Vietnam
        has aggressively pursued a trade-led growth strategy with both exports and imports increasing as
        a proportion of GDP. In 2007, Vietnam was granted accession to the WTO which is driving
        further liberalization of the economy. GDP growth has averaged over 7.5 per cent over the past
        ten years, and the overall poverty rate has declined from 58 per cent in 1993 to 16 percent in
        2006. Vietnam is now well on-track to achieve most, if not all, of its Millennium Development
        Goals (MDGs).

        2. Poverty Reduction Challenge. While poverty rates overall were declining rapidly in Vietnam,
        rural poverty was declining much more slowly, particularly in those areas in which ethnic
        minority populations are the predominant ethnic group, in particular those in the more remote,
        upland areas of Vietnam. Data collected through the Vietnam Household Living Standards
        Survey (VHLSS) showed that the percentage of households living in poverty fell from 58 per
        cent in 1993 to 19.5 percent in 2004. However, this impressive achievement in poverty
        reduction sat alongside much slower progress in poverty reduction for ethnic minorities. In 2004,
        although the ethnic minorities only accounted for 13 percent of the population, they accounted
        for nearly 4 out of 10 of the poor. Government efforts to accelerate poverty reduction in these
        areas focused on increasing the flow of central government funding to the poorest provinces and

districts through national targeted programs covering infrastructure investments, education and
health. Under these programs, funding was channeled through Vietnam's increasingly
decentralized planning and budgeting system which focused planning and implementation at the
commune and district levels and oversight at the provincial level through the Provincial People's
Committees (PPC). The most significant of these was the Program to Reduce Poverty in
Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas, known as
Program 135 which attempted to address regional disparities in access to essential basic services
and markets that could be effectively carried out in remote and dispersed locations. P135 was
lead by the Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM), Government's lead agency for ethnic
minority affairs whose role was rapidly evolving towards coordination of development support
targeted to ethnic minority communities. At the same time, however, responsibility and capacity
for direct implementation remained largely with the line agencies and provinces. Government,
as it considered a second five year phase for P135 (P135-2), was seeking means to increase its
effectiveness so as to both accelerate poverty reduction as well as to improve the capacity of
poor communes to assume their responsibilities under Vietnams decentralized fiscal system.

3. Donor Support. At the time of appraisal, donor support was primarily channeled through
specific investment projects which generally covered one to several provinces. Donor supported
projects increasingly utilized community-driven development (CDD) approaches to strengthen
local participation in investment planning, implementation and oversight. This experience was
generally viewed as successful by both Government and donors, leading to increased interest in
means to "mainstream" these approaches into Government's National Targeted Programs (NTP)s
and decentralized fiscal systems which were channeling several times the amount of donor
financed resources to the poorest districts in the country. In particular, UK DFID initiated
reviews with Government, several implemented by UNDP, of the NTPs, and P135 in particular,
as potential mechanisms for direct donor support and introduction of the lessons learned from
smaller investment projects into the national poverty reduction agenda. These studies indicated
that the basic targeting, fiduciary, decentralized implementation and investment categories
provided a good basis for donor support, though there was significant scope for improvement
based on both international and Vietnam experience with CDD programs. Several other donor
agencies ­ in particular AusAID, Finland, IrishAID, IFAD, UNDP and UNICEF indicated
interest in supporting a follow-on five year phase of P135 (P135-2) through periodic budget
support.

4. Rationale for Bank Assistance. At the time of project identification, the Bank was working
very closely with Government to support Vietnam's Poverty Reduction Strategy Process and its
implementation through technical cooperation in poverty analysis, donor coordination and
budgetary support through a series of Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs). There was
general consensus amongst the Bank, Government and donors that the PRSC approach was
effective as a means to focus dialogue on substantive policy and institutional reforms in support
of the poverty reduction agenda, particularly given the high level of leadership and capacity
demonstrated by Government. At the same time, the Bank was financing two major CDD
projects ­ the Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project (CBRIP), and the Northern
Mountains Poverty Reduction Project (NMPRP) ­ both of which focused on poorer provinces
and were considered successful in introducing more participatory and transparent
implementation processes at the level of communes and villages. In considering how best to



                                            7
leverage up the experience from CBRIP and NMPRP, and given the successful experience with
the PRSCs, the Bank was a key participant in the discussions with Government, DFID and other
donors on the potential to align financial support through NTPs in general and P135 in particular.
The Bank's role was seen as particularly important in strengthening the quality of M&E and
fiduciary aspects of the program, as well as strengthening linkages to the broader CG and PRSP
processes. While there was early endorsement within the Bank for support to the planned P135-
2 as a means to "nationalize" and mainstream experiences from CBRIP and NMPRP, there was
significant discussion regarding whether to channel support through a traditional specific
investment credit (SIC) or budget support instrument. After considerable discussion within the
Bank and with its partners in Government and donors, it was decided to utilize a multi-tranche,
programmatic development policy credit operation as this would continue to ensure that the
majority of funding would come from Government's own revenues and therefore maintain full
Government leadership and accountability; increasing the likelihood of their widespread
adaptation in the decentralized investment process and providing a more constructive donor
coordination context similar to the experience with the PRSCs. Given its extensive experience
with the PRSCs, the Bank took a leading role in assisting Government with the development of
the policy matrix for P135-2 which was the common basis for common progress reviews and
tranched disbursements by donors.

1.2   Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5. The Bank's financing of a programmatic series of DPCs aimed to support policy and
institutional actions to improve the results of P135-2 in the following four main `meso-level'
policy areas: (i) improved the poverty targeting of program resource allocation; (ii) deepening
and scaling-up of community-driven approaches to planning, managing, operating and
maintaining basic rural infrastructure; (iii) enhanced fiduciary transparency and accountability in
program implementation through wider use of "social audit" approaches; and (iv) process
monitoring and impact evaluation. The first development policy credit (DPC1) was focused on
the initial policy and institutional reforms which would introduce the basic revisions in P135-2's
operating arrangements in each of these policy areas. Annex 2 sets out the original Operation
Policy Matrix, which lists the thirteen Program Development Objectives and associated
Indicators.

1.3    Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification:

6. No formal revision of project development objectives (PDO) was required during project
implementation. However, following the MTR, as the baseline data became available, the key
indicators were reviewed and more measurable indicators were defined to allow for clearer, more
quantitative assessment of progress towards objectives. As a result, the program matrix was
revised and is reflected in the program document for DPC2.

1.4   Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

7. Of the 12 specific areas, or objectives, agreed in the four policy areas detailed in the original
program matrix, ten had specific policy and institutional actions carried out prior to DPC 1. A




                                             8
number of these actions were contained in Inter-Ministerial Circular 676, signed by the Prime
Minister, which provided the basic guidance and framework for implementation of P135-2.

8. Poverty Targeting. This policy area focused on addressing the shortcomings in basic
program design, identified in the assessment of P135, which directly impact the ability of the
program to reduce poverty in the target areas. The policy actions taken introduced changes
which reflected the experience of the smaller area programs in Vietnam as well as international
best practice in targeting and areas of program support.

9. Commune, Village and Household Selection. The criteria for identifying poor households
varied considerably between provinces, complicating the allocation of resources amongst
localities based on the number of poor households. As a prior action for DPC1, Government
issued Decision 393/2005/QD-UBDT which introduced verifiable, poverty-based criteria for
selection of commune and villages included in P135-2. More specifically, the criteria developed
by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLISA) was adapted and used by all provinces as
a common and verifiable basis to determine poverty incidence for qualification of communes and
districts for support under P135-2. Application of this criteria was to be verified, in part, by the
decision to be issued in 2007 on the communes to graduate from P135-2 in 2008.

10. Program Resource Allocation. Evaluations of P135 Phase 1 (P135-1) suggest that the basis
for commune selection did result in the inclusion of the country's poorest communes and the
exclusion of non-poor communes. However, under Phase 1, central resources were allocated to
provinces at a fixed level of VND 500 million per participating commune. More importantly,
there were no clear pro-poor criteria on how provinces should pass on funds to participating
districts and communes ­ this seemed usually to be done on an ad hoc rather than a formula
basis. In addition, household level housing and production support elements were found to be
only weakly targeted. Furthermore, most P135-1 investments were infrastructure investments in
or close to commune centers, and so did not necessarily benefit the more remote or poorer
villages. Government therefore introduced inter-ministerial circular 676/2006 a policy
requirement that by 2007, provinces develop and implement transparent, verifiable formula for
allocation of resources amongst participating communes and villages based, in part, on the
number of poor households.

11. Enhancing sustainability of program investment. The evaluations of P135 found, similar to
other CDD programs, that maintenance of infrastructure works was generally poor, particularly
given the difficult conditions in the highland areas where steep slopes and heavy rains
contributed to significant erosion and rock falls on rural access roads. O and M was supposed to
be covered through community contributions and district and provincial funding, but given the
resource constraints in the poor communities these funds were generally insufficient if available
at all, and lacked a framework for effective management in any case. Government introduced the
concept of dedicated O&M funding into the design of P135-2, and in 2007, O&M groups with
recognized legal status were to be formed in participating communes and villages, and a clear
plan with monitorable actions formulated on measures to build their capacity. In addition, an
assessment of O&M quality and adequacy of O&M funding from different sources was to be
initiated as input to the following year's MTR.

12. Pro-Poor Orientation of Production/Livelihoods Support. Support to production, particularly
agriculture, under P135 and other Government programs in the uplands areas had traditionally
focused on provision of subsidized inputs based on the decisions of the district or provincial
agricultural extension staff. This top-down approach was based on the belief that the priority in
all of these communities was enhanced food security at the household level through food self-
sufficiency, requiring improved inputs and household level processing equipment. Experience
under a number of donor supported area projects had demonstrated that food security in many
households and communities was more likely to be achieved by a focus on ability to acquire food
rather than produce it oneself and hence offered a broader range of production support options,
including market-oriented crops, based on farmer consultations, which increased the purchasing
power of the poor. While there was support for this approach in several areas of Government,
there was some reluctance in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to move away
from the food self sufficiency approach, and in the process of policy matrix formulation, the
debate became confused as a conflict between belief in food security versus market orientation.
As a result, a planned circular on strategy for providing support services in upland communes
based on farmer demand and market orientation was delayed and the general guidance under
Inter-ministerial circular 676 was ambiguous in terms of providing a clear reorientation of
production support. This was to be addressed, in part, through the issuance of operational
guidelines in 2007 for delivery of market-oriented, pro-poor production/livelihood support under
P135-2 including the planned phase-out of input subsidies.

13. Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment. These policy and institutional
reforms were intended to accelerate and increase the participatory nature of the fiscal
decentralization process in the poor areas covered by P135-2. The reforms drew upon a
combination of international good practice and experience from projects in Vietnam. While
potentially politically sensitive, the actions aligned well with Government's strong interest in
supporting the capacity of poor communes to assume greater control over public investment.

14. Informed public participation in program planning and management. Vietnam has a well
developed planning and budgeting system which initiates at the local level. However, the ability
of citizens to participate in the process is limited in the poorer villages and communes,
particularly amongst women, by linguistic differences as many if not most people speak
primarily ethnic minority languages. While Government is committed to ensuring broad fluency
in the Vietnamese language, given the desire to rapidly increase participation in P135-2 planning
and decision making, Government developed a communication strategy to guide planning and
implementation of communication activities under P135-2 by CEM and by implementing
agencies at the province, district and commune levels. In 2007, specific indicators were to be
developed to measure progress in practice and user-friendly outreach materials were to be
disseminated in ethnic minority languages and audio visual formats to support informed
participation at grassroots level.

15. Devolution of investment ownership. Government was committed to ensuring that
investments undertaken primarily to the benefit of a specific commune should be fully managed
or "owned" by that commune which would also be responsible for O&M. However, concerns
regarding the capacity of poorer communes to comply with the administrative requirements for
investment ownership limited the transfer of ownership from the districts to these communes



                                           10
relative to the non-poor areas of Vietnam. P135-2 was seen as a major vehicle for increasing
investment ownership amongst poor communes but experience under donor funded projects
indicated that in some districts there was reluctance to relinquish investment ownership to the
communes, so Government issued guidance under Inter-Ministerial Circular 676 to relevant
ministries, agencies and provinces on transparent criteria to be used to determine commune
readiness to assume investment ownership responsibility. In 2007, all P135-2 communes with
prior experience in investment management under State or ODA-supported projects (at least 35%
of the total) were to be granted ownership for P135-2 investments.

16. Local institutional capacity-building support. Both the quantity ­ in terms of number of
communes with investment ownership ­ and quality ­ in terms of grassroots participation ­ in
decentralized development were constrained by the limited capacity in poor villages to engage
the formal administrative processes through, inter alia, participation in the planning process and
expression of satisfaction with development activities. Government recognized this as a major
challenge and given P135-2's expected catalytic role, included in Inter-Ministerial Circular 676
the requirement that at least 7% of the total program cost be allocated for capacity building of all
kinds at the central, provincial, district and local levels. In 2007, Government committed to
adopt an institutional capacity building plan to support commune investment ownership and
grassroots democracy.

17. Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability. The assessments of P135 had identified
several areas for strengthening the efficiency and integrity of resource management under the
program, particularly in terms of local level procurement, transparency of financial reporting and
auditing and the role of community contributions. While the approaches taken had reflected the
standard national procedures, P135-2 was viewed as an opportunity to introduce improvements
drawn from projects in Vietnam and international good practice, consistent with Government's
interest in more transparent program implementation and donor concerns regarding the use of
Government systems to channel resources to the poor.

18. Procurement for small scale infrastructure. Under Vietnam's Procurement Law, small-scale
public works (up to 1 billion dong) could be directly contracted given belief that a full
procurement process would be to expensive relative to the size of the contracts, and that there
would in any case be few interested bidders. However, experience under numerous donor-
funded projects indicated that streamlined procurement processes were able to function relatively
cheaply and rapidly as well as attract significant interest from qualified bidders. Further,
Vietnam's Procurement Law did not recognize "community contracting" whereby the
communities themselves can organize to carry out simple constructions and pay themselves as a
means to generate labor opportunities ­ something which had worked well in several donor-
financed projects. While Government was interested in broadening the use of these methods in
P135-2, Inter-Circular 676, reflecting the Procurement Law, continued to provide for direct
contracting without significant limitations. Accordingly, it was agreed with donors to issue a
supplementary regulation in 2007 requiring open, competitive bidding in all but exceptional
circumstances and community contracting for all small works, as well as introduce guidance on
the use of community contracting.




                                            11
19. Public financial management ­ financial reporting. Given the multi-tiered level of financial
flows through Vietnam's decentralized fiscal system, transparent reporting is particularly
important to identify constraints and verify efficiency in resource flows. Experience with its
own-financed and donor-financed programs had demonstrated the difficulties in assessing
accountability for implementation when there are delays in transfers from the central to the
implementing levels. In order to provide a clearer basis for monitoring and assessing resource
flows under P135-2, Government issued Ministry of Finance (MOF) Guidance No. 2849
governing public financial management for P135-2, and instructed MOF to prepare processes
and procedures for fund flow reflecting the provision of funds from the state budget to each
spending agency at central, provincial, district and commune levels, and quarterly financial
reports and reconciliation of expenditures under P135-2 between spending units and State
Treasury (STV). In 2007, program-wide quarterly expenditure and funds flow reports were to be
issued, as well as six monthly reports on the allocation, transfer and use of P135-2 funds to
provincial level disclosed publicly on the MOF website.

20. Public financial management ­ independent audits. Government's own auditor, the State
Audit of Vietnam (SAV) was recognized by donors as a capable and independent audit authority,
however the scope of its standard audits was considered to be insufficient to provided an overall
assessment of a highly decentralized and wide ranging program such as P135. Rather than
engage private auditors, donors indicated their preference to enhance the quality of SAV to build
capacity and establish good practice which could be applied to other programs. Accordingly,
Government committed to strengthen SAV's audits for P135-2 by issuing and sharing with
donors a multi-year audit plan for P135-2 that provides for increasing the number of sample
provinces by 20% per year, submitting the final reports within six months of the end of the
audited year, and engaging independent external auditors as needed. In 2007, it was expected
that the first P135-2 audit would be completed, including at least 8 provinces, and would be
publicly disclosed through the media and SAV's website.

21. Community contribution. Public investments frequently required a local contribution ­ often
in-kind labor. However, it was recognized that in poor communes this requirement could be
particularly onerous on poor families either as direct taxation of their limited cash incomes, or
reducing the time available for paid or self-employment labor. Further, experience under donor
supported projects and other public programs had demonstrated the value to the very poor of
paid labor opportunities in public works schemes. In order to address these issues more broadly,
Government included stipulations in Inter-Ministerial Circular 676 that compulsory local
contributions are affordable, the poorest households are exempted from compulsory cash
contributions, and mechanisms are developed to promote paid local labor in civil works, with
priority given to poor households in wage-earning opportunities. By the following year, it was
expected that at least 50% of infrastructure investments under P135-2 would include local paid
labor, and that the value of unpaid labor contributions would be captured in the MIS and
commune accounts.

22. Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring and evaluation under all NTPs, including P135,
tended to focus on either very high level indicators, such as poverty rates, or output indicators
such as number of kilometers of road reconstructed. In addition, there were few qualitative
indicators to assess quality of outputs and citizen satisfaction. In large part, this reflected the



                                            12
absence of a dedicated system for carrying out these assessments, including preparation of a
baseline survey and use of control groups. In terms of day to day program management, a highly
decentralized program, such as P135, involving numerous provinces, required a consistent and
comprehensive monitoring system to allow the centralized coordination unit to quickly identify
implementation problems and respond accordingly, as well as identify opportunities for sharing
innovations and good practice amongst provinces.

23. Impact evaluation. P135 had largely reported its effectiveness based on the poverty rates in
the participating communes. Given the difficulties of attribution and significant factors beyond
the control of the program, including broader economic shifts and the impacts of weather, it was
not possible to analyze the program's contribution and scope for strengthening its design and
implementation. As the effectiveness of P135-2 was a shared concern of both Government and
donors, a set of outcome indicators and an overall M&E framework were agreed and adopted by
Government. Further, Government, through its statistical service, had significantly improved its
capacity for poverty diagnostics, and a baseline survey was designed which included a matched
control group which would be completed in 2007.

24. Process monitoring. Government and donors were working together to strengthen the
monitoring of the ODA portfolio, including the development of a MIS based approach to ensure
consistent reporting and basic indicators. P135-2 presented an opportunity to apply this
experience to specific program management, and Government issued an action plan to adapt its
ODA portfolio monitoring tool to create an MIS for tracking and reporting on P135-2 inputs,
outputs and intermediate outcomes. It was expected that in 2007, the MIS would be in place and
used to track and report on inputs, outputs and intermediate outcomes, and that this would be
complemented by the design and introduction of participatory M&E approaches and mechanisms
for cross-learning between participating localities.

1.5   Revised Policy Areas

25. There were no revisions to policy areas.

1.6   Other significant changes

26. There were no significant changes in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements
and funding allocations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1   Program Performance

27. Government achieved all of the prior actions recognized by DPC1, but implementation was
uneven across policy areas. The first funding tranche of USD 50 million was disbursed straight
after the Funding Agreement was declared effective on August 15, 2007. There were no changes
to the design of P135 Phase 2 during the operation of the P135-2 DPC1. The credit or program
was not restructured, nor was program implementation ever at risk. Through the end of 2008,




                                               13
P135-2 had budgeted over $400 million in support of almost 2000 "extremely difficult
communes", and an additional 3,000 "extremely difficult villages" in 47 provinces.

28. Program implementation started slowly and has been variable. Only 57% of the budget was
expended) in 2006, due to a slow start to implementation and delays in issuing required
guidelines. The investment backlog was partially addressed in 2007, with disbursement of 107%
of the 2007 P135-2 budget, enabling around $100 million of donor funds to be disbursed in 2007.
By October 2008, 62 percent of the total program funding allocation for the whole 5 year phase
had been disbursed, implying a program execution rate of over 80 percent.

29. Initially, there was significant variation in implementation amongst the program components,
though this gap has been closed more recently. The infrastructure investment component, most
familiar to provinces from P135-1, has generally executed fully and rapidly. The newer Phase 2
components, such as living standards improvement (including education and sanitation),
capacity-building and production support initially encountered significant delays, with
significant budget carry-over between years, due to lack of clarity or understanding regarding the
administrative procedures for implementation, but have generally increased their pace and
eliminated the backlog. From 2006 to 2008, the infrastructure component disbursed VND Bil
4215or 40%, while the other components disbursed from 40 ­ 50%. Total program disbursement
has reached VND Bil 7038, or 44% of the total budget of VND Bil 16039.

30. In terms of progress on the reform program, the policy matrix included actions for 2007
which were used by Government and development partners to assess progress. These
benchmarks were used by Government and Development Partners to support joint monitoring of
progress towards agreed program outcomes, and by some development partners to inform their
decisions on disbursing budget support. Table 1 provides the status of these benchmarks at the
end of 2008, as well as the status of the revised indicators developed and agreed following the
MTR in November 2008.

2.2   Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

31. A number of factors have influenced the implementation of P135-2 to date:
Government at all levels has maintained strong political support and commitment to P135-
2 as a core instrument for poverty reduction. Donor support is equivalent to less than a third
of program costs and transfers to provinces. In addition, the Ethnic Minority Commission of the
National Assembly closely reviews the progress under P135-2, including specific field visits and
issuance of reports which highlight areas requiring additional attention. As a result, there is no
absence of interest to find ways to improve performance, and even in the context of delays of
delays in provision of central guidance on procedures, provinces have often taken initiative to
accelerate implementation.

32. While commitment to P135-2 was very high, there was inconsistent commitment to the
specific reforms supported by Bank and other donor engagement. Implementation progress
in the first two years of P135-2 was stronger in areas where the reforms were most clearly in line
with broader Government efforts, such as improved resource targeting and support to commune
ownership, or where the reforms could be centrally implemented such as the baseline study and
citizen report cards, and enhanced financial reporting and auditing. Conversely, those reforms
which introduced significant changes relative to existing practice, such as communications in
ethnic minority languages and the market oriented approach to agricultural assistance, and
particularly those implemented at the local levels, such as procurement practices, progressed
much more slowly.

33. Extensive background studies which reviewed experience under P135-1 as well as other
donor-financed community development programs provided a consistent and common
basis of experience to discuss implementation issues. The documentation helped to maintain
continuity regarding the basis for strategic decisions in the design of the policy matrix as donor
representatives changed and avoided useless repetition of discussions carried out during
preparation and a focus on finding solutions.

34. The additional complexity of P135-2 due to new components and activities contributed
to initial delays. Although P135-2 was officially initiated in January 2006, the principle
document guiding implementation ­ Inter-ministerial circular 676 ­ was not issued until August
8, 2006, resulting in significant delays for some components. For example, in 2006, no
production support funds were disbursed as provincial and district authorities needed to gain a
better understanding of the administrative and technical requirements for these activities and
official guidance from central agencies was delayed in terms of the issuance of Inter-circular 676
and clarifying guidelines. In some cases where provinces did attempt to implement these
activities using procedures from P135, Phase 1, the subsequent SAV audit identified this as "mis-
spending" as they were not consistent with the procedures subsequently issued.

35. Capacity risks were correctly identified but not sufficiently addressed given the
introduction of additional activities as well as reforms to Government procedures. P135-2
introduced a wide range of reforms across sectors ­ horizontal complexity - which changed



                                           16
standard Government procedures which were to be introduced at the central level, supported by
47 provinces, and implemented by 1644 communes ­ vertical complexity. While CEM and other
agencies and provinces had some competent and motivated staff addressing these complexities
through their coordination role was a daunting task. This was recognized, and partially
addressed through the support to CEM provided through UNDP, but it is not clear that a
comprehensive capacity assessment of CEM vis a vis its horizontal and vertical coordination
roles was carried out , and the anticipated deployment of TA, while invaluable to the extent it
was able to mobilize in a timely manner, did not effectively address these multiple roles ­
particularly as CEM's field presence was reduced through Government's decision to eliminate
district level CEM officers.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

36. Overall M&E rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

37. The M&E system design arrangements are rated moderately satisfactory. The Operation
Policy Matrix and the Letter of Development Policy are the main reference documents for
monitoring and evaluating the performance of the operation and the P135-2 program. The Policy
Matrix defines the four-year outcomes of the operation (2007 ­ 2010) and identified indicators
for monitoring progress toward the development objectives, however, as indicated above, these
were generally not specified in measurable terms, leading to a focus on only subjective
assessments of progress during joint review missions, such as "satisfactory" or "partially
satisfactory", rather than percentage completion of achievement.

38. One area of policy action was the development and implementation of the Aligned
Monitoring Tool (AMT) to serve as the basis for the program's management information system
and to facilitate monitoring at the central level, across ministries with a consistent set of
variables. However, in practice, design and implementation of the AMT has been focused with
the CEM and MPI with the result that it has been difficult to roll out to local levels which have
incomplete understanding of the tool. In retrospect, a better approach to design could have been:
to build upon existing reporting by government at commune, district and province levels; to
systematize more effectively, to facilitate consolidated reporting at different levels; and then
introduce some relatively small, additional information requirements needed by central
ministries. This would have reduced training needs, as local levels would already know what the
majority of variables referred to, so that any TA could focus on computerized entry and a few,
additional variables.

39. M&E implementation is rated moderately unsatisfactory (MU). A rating of `MU' is given
to reflect the late implementation of the baseline and MIS. While the M&E design was
undertaken in 2007, the Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM) Decision on the P135 Phase 2
M&E system was not issued until August 2008, training of provinces and districts in use of the
system only occurred in October 2008.

40. A baseline study to permit impact evaluation was also conducted in 2007 in a representative
`treatment' sample of P135-2 target communes, and in a matched `control' sample, and analysis
of the baseline study was completed in time for the MTR in November 2008 ­ a first for an NTP.



                                           17
The survey results were matched with results from other independent assessments, including the
field reports from the National Assembly Commission on Ethnic Minorities, donor partner field
observations and State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) audit results and shared and discussed in an
open forum with Government, donor and civil society representatives ­ a prior action for DPC2 ­
as the basis for agreeing on additional policy actions and institutional measures to strengthen
progress towards agreed program objectives and outcomes. Evaluation of the results of the
baseline survey and use of the broad set of information tools for end-of-program assessment is a
trigger for DPC3.

41. As a result of delayed system launch, the M&E system was still not fully functioning by end-
2008. The AMT and Program Monitoring Tool (PMT) have been put in place, but not all
provinces could enter data and run the system by end-2008. CEM has recently completed
provincial training in operating the system and has repeatedly asked for more TA support to
target poor performing provinces. Overall, the P135-2 M&E arrangements have helped to
demonstrate the potential for the use and institutionalization of district level MIS systems, but
several localities are still struggling with the system such that it is not yet possible to produce a
consolidated report for the program.

2.4   Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

42. In the original Project Appraisal Document, it was envisaged that this operation would be the
first (DPC1) in a programmatic series of three Development Policy Credits over the life of P135-
2 (2006-10) to support the sustained implementation of reform elements of P135-2 in a
progressive, and phased manner. The DPC2 of USD100 million was approved on May 21, 2009
to support additional actions identified through the MTR and ICR process to reinforce the reform
agenda. A proposed DPC-3 will support the additional reforms required to accelerate progress
towards objectives in each of the policy actions, as well as to generate lessons learned for
application in follow-on NTPs, including a proposed third phase of P135. Based on the lessons
learned during the period covered by DPC1, Government and its development partners have
placed emphasis on support at the provincial and district levels to strengthen understanding and
capacity to implement reforms, and to ensure effective reporting and utilization of the M&E
system, as reflected in the revised policy matrix included in DPC2.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

43. The objectives of poverty targeting, decentralization, participation and empowerment,
fiduciary transparency and accountability and M&E remain highly relevant to the Government
and Bank's development priorities and strategies. The DPC1 , as designed and implemented, has
been fully aligned with the Government of Vietnam priorities for poverty reduction and
decentralized rural development, and the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2007-2011,
which is based on the Government's Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010,
which embodies the main principles of a poverty reduction strategy, including a clear results
orientation.



                                                18
44. DPC1 is most strongly aligned with the second CPS pillar ­ namely to `strengthen social
inclusion' ­ under which it directly addresses two CPS outcomes of `better access to services and
infrastructure for the rural poor', and `ethnic minorities in rural areas more fully integrated into
development processes'. It also contributes to the fourth CPS pillar ­ `strengthened governance
systems' ­ particularly with respect to the outcome `modernized planning towards development
objectives, with more participatory approaches'.


3.2   Achievement of Program Development Objectives

45. As DPC1 covers only the initial years of P135-2, this rating relates to progress towards
outcomes which are rated as Moderately Satisfactory, reflecting delays in implementation of
several important reforms. However, as there is clear acknowledgement by government and
development partners of the need to address those lagging areas, there is a good opportunity to
increase the likelihood of meeting objectives over the remaining years of implementation.

Objective 1: Strengthened Poverty Targeting

46. Overall, progress towards this objective has been moderately satisfactory. P135-2
beneficiary selection and fund allocation methodology have been fruitful areas of government
and donor collaboration. All 47 provinces are applying improved targeting mechanism and 44 of
47 provinces have developed criteria to favor poor villages in communes in resource allocation.
In addition, the government (CEM) has taken active steps to disseminate guidance on commune,
village and household selection and an improved resource allocation methodology.

47. Another clear success in this policy area has been the creation of a central budget line for
Operation & Maintenance (O&M). However, experience from the World Bank's Northern
Mountains Poverty Reduction Project (NMPRP) suggests that ensuring sufficient O&M is likely
to remain a challenge as an allocation of 6% of investment funds for O&M may not be sufficient.
In addition, only a small proportion of communes have so far developed O&M plans.

48. P135-2 is working towards diversifying the livelihoods and increasing the incomes of poor
upland households to enable them to work their way out of poverty, and there has been progress
towards reaching target crop income levels. However, MTR observations were that communes
remain dependent on district extension staff who continued to encourage communes to purchase
machinery, cattle and other inputs such as hybrid seed varieties, rather than gaining access to
governmental or non-governmental agricultural extension and advisory services who could guide
a more market-oriented agricultural production approach. Nonetheless, the MTR noted that there
is some evidence that this component is bringing about some changes in the way of thinking (but
not yet practice) among DARD and other commune and district officials.

Objective 2: Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment

49. Progress towards this objective has been satisfactory. There has been important progress in
increasing the proportion of commune investment owners, and participation rates appear high.



                                            19
At the same time there are remaining challenges in strengthening broad based participation
through communications and capacity building.

50. P135 is leading the way in Vietnamese NTPs in decentralizing investment ownership and
budget management to communes. The target that 60 per cent of communes would be acting as
investment owners under the program by 2008, has been largely achieved: in 2006, 18 percent of
communes were investment owners; by end-2007, 35 percent of communes became investment
owners of infrastructure projects; and by 2008, 55 percent of communes became investment
owners for at least one component (e.g. Production Support or Infrastructure) of P135-2.
However, as the MTR noted, challenges remain in achieving objectives in this area. According to
reports and discussions at commune level during the MTR, many communes are investment
owners for production investment, but relatively few communes are yet acting as full investment
owners for infrastructure investments.

51. Although the Citizen Report Card Survey Report noted that the percentage of households
aware of P135 projects and infrastructure is high, implementation by provinces of the P135
Communication Strategy has been variable. Several challenges remain: implementation has been
hampered by the lack of a separate budget line for communication activities at a local level; the
vast majority of communication is still done in the Kinh language, which limits the awareness of
the program by ethnic minorities.

52. Further progress towards full commune investment ownership has been hampered by the lack
of easily accessible implementation manuals, the complexity of legislation and the turn-over of
staff at commune level. These issues will need to be borne in mind. They are addressed in DPC2
prior actions and in the triggers and benchmarks leading to proposed DPC3. However the
effectiveness of these actions, triggers and benchmarks will depend on how well decentralized
technical assistance provided can reinforce capacity improvement amongst the poorest and most
remote communes covered by P135-2.

53. Progress on grassroots capacity building has been limited. Some support to communes by
districts has been forthcoming, but more needs to be done: the MTR Aide Memoire noted that
more continuous support from districts to communes is crucial, including rotation of district
officials to work as facilitators in communes. The MTR noted that CEM and local level
authorities should provide more training in order to enhance commune capacity ­ specific
manuals will need to be formulated in the areas of participatory planning, procurement,
construction, financial management and accounting.

Objective 3: Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability

54. Overall, progress towards this objective has been moderately satisfactory. Progress on
financial management and auditing has been substantial, however progress in the areas of
procurement and community contributions face significant lags towards their achievement.

55. IDA and other donor support have helped to put a greater focus, and improve P135-2
financial management and procurement systems and audit arrangements. The practice of
undertaking quarterly reconciliations of program financial reports has assisted fiduciary



                                           20
transparency and provided assurance to donors that funds were being spent as intended. In
addition, regular and independent financial audits for P135-2 are carried out by SAV, including
clear indications of areas of weakness and recommendations for further strengthening which
provides greater fiduciary scrutiny and assurance.

56. The revisions in Circular 01/2008 have introduced the provision for a more competitive
bidding process for projects valued from VND 300 million to VND 1 billion. However, the MTR
noted that there is still room for improvement regarding transparency of P135-2 procurement.
The Bank has raised concerns about the application of the current Procurement Law. While
Government procurement laws and procedures under P135-2 have taken into account the lessons
from NMPRP, such as competitive bidding and community procurement, the desirability of
competitive and open tendering has not gained wide acceptance yet at provincial level. Inter-
ministerial Circular No. 676 makes provision for small-scale, labor-intensive works to be
contracted directly with local communities to help them generate local employment
opportunities.

57. The objectives on community contributions included: such contributions should be
affordable; the poorest households should be exempted from compulsory cash contributions and
that mechanisms should be developed to promote paid local labor in civil works, with priority
given to poor households in respect of wage earning opportunities. Progress towards these
objectives has only been partial to date. Although some communes and districts are requiring
external contractors to use local paid labor as an integral part of construction contracts, this
practice is far from widespread. A `road map' to address the issues of recording community
contributions and requiring more use of local labor would assist implementation of objectives in
this area. Community contributions are not yet fully equitable, nor are these contributions yet
formally recorded in the program M&E system (AMT and PMT).

Objective 4: Monitoring and Evaluation

58. Progress towards this objective has been moderately unsatisfactory. Impact evaluation has
been approached systematically through the undertaking of a baseline survey in 2007 ­
effectively the second year of the program, as planned, though it has taken longer than
anticipated for the data to be collected and fully analyzed ­ an analysis was only presented in late
2008, just in time for the MTR. Data has been generated on ethnic minority poverty and an MIS
system has been put in place to monitor outputs and intermediate indicators on a regular basis,
along with the use of community report cards to assess beneficiaries' satisfaction with program
outcomes.

59. Section 2.3 noted that, while M&E system design was partially satisfactory, M&E
implementation has been moderately unsatisfactory, due mainly to the late implementation of the
MIS (in late 2008). On the positive side, some of the achievements of P135-2 have provided
proof that more developed reporting systems are possible and others have represented firsts for
Vietnam e.g. full devolution of ownership of program funds and investment to the commune
level, the use of community report cards, and the creation of a dedicated central budget for
infrastructure O&M. These innovations have the potential, once bedded in to local




                                            21
implementation practice, to improve development planning more broadly across Government
programs and within the country.

3.3   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

60. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

61. There is some evidence that policy and institutional changes secured in Phase 2 have acted as
an entry point to a broader agenda to impact on the way that NTPs more widely are conceived
and implemented, and the program is largely on-track to achieve its objectives in key areas
including: resource allocation and poverty targeting, decentralization, and public financial
management and auditing, and in some areas of evaluation.

62. However, achievements in the above areas need to be set against less than expected progress
in the areas of procurement, production and livelihood support, communications support to
ethnic minority communities, and monitoring. There are also ongoing management issues related
to the size and complexity of the program. Specific weaknesses remain in the following areas: (i) the
use of TA; (ii) the effectiveness of the production support component and (iii) the limited local level
capacity building and information dissemination in ethnic minority languages.

3.4     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63. Reported poverty levels have declined by 3-4 percent in the poor ethnic-minority regions
targeted by P135-2. However, the sustainability of this trend and the ability of ethnic minorities
to match the rapid reductions in poverty reduction amongst the majority Kinh populations will
require continued focus on locality specific strategies and participation approaches.

64. The DPC1 program document acknowledged that women and ethnic minority population
would face obstacles to participating in and benefiting from P135-2 unless special attention was
paid to their issues and needs. The design of the Living Standards Improvement component was
partly in recognition of needs of women for improved sanitation, education etc. At Mid-Term
review, it was acknowledged that specific efforts were needed to ensure more balanced
participation by women in planning, prioritization and oversight of investments under P135-2,
but also noted that the cultural variability of gender relationships would require that the specific
approaches for implementing this agenda be developed at the local level, working directly with
communities, with direct support from donor-financed technical assistance.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development):

65. The credit has supported policy and institutional actions to improve the results of P135-2. In
particular, donor support to P135-2 activities has enabled: (i) a significant expansion of the
support provided by central government to poor and remote provinces, with a consequent impact
on infrastructure and services provision; (ii) an improved policy dialogue between ODA
providers and central agencies, helping to improve the way NTPs are managed; (iii) a greater
harmonization and alignment of ODA with government goals and policies; (iv) a number of


                                              22
policy reforms and innovations such as improved resource allocation formulae, more frequent
reconciliation of expenditures between spending agencies and the state treasury and dedicated
program O&M funding.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

66. There were no unintended outcomes and impacts.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

67. Rating: Moderate

68. There are five main risks, which although individually do not pose a significant risk, together
are likely to pose a risk to securing the desired program development outcomes. There are two
important risks to achievement of the poverty targeting outcome. First, there is a sizeable risk
that program infrastructure will continue to be patchily maintained due to the vulnerability of
remote, upland areas to flooding and adverse climate-related events. Adverse weather events are
growing in frequency and Vietnam is highly vulnerable to flooding due to its long coastline and
rugged mountainous areas. In order to address this risk, the program has placed strong emphasis
in 2009 on supporting communes and districts in effective use of O&M funding, and to
strengthen supervision of O&M both as part of the community monitoring activities as well as by
CEM and the relevant technical agencies at the provincial level with significantly increased TA
support.

69. The second risk under the `Poverty Targeting' objective is that livelihoods will not be
diversified in a sustainable, market-responsive manner due to the continuing lack of
disbursement of the production support component and inappropriate production support
methods being continued. The dialogue between MARD, other Government agencies and
development partners has been intensified as a result of the MTR and the preparation of the
circular and guidelines included in the revised policy matrix, with support from IFAD, to reach
common understanding of when food self-sufficiency approaches are more appropriate and when
market oriented options should be introduced. This is an area of close monitoring by the
development partners.

70. A third risk relates to the devolution of fiscal and administrative authority from provinces
and districts to the commune level of administration. Progress requires provinces and districts to
relinquish authority and, more importantly, control over resource allocation. Such a power shift
is unlikely to be simple or quick, especially in Vietnam where power has been shifted to
provincial and district chairmen in recent years, and these authorities are not always going to be
willing to cede power to lower (and as they see it, less capable) tiers of government.
Government has nonetheless provided a clear message to sub-national entities of its expectations
to see progress, and under P135-2 is working with districts to increase their role as supporters,
rather than overseers, of commune implementation.

71. A fourth risk relates to achievement of the `Decentralization, Participation and
Empowerment' objective is that participation of poor ethnic minority households in planning,



                                            23
        implementation and monitoring of program achievements remains inconsistent due to varying
        enthusiasm among local officials to distribute information and materials in ethnic languages.
        This is an area of priority for TA support at the national, provincial and district levels in order to
        achieve the policy actions and benchmarks in the revised policy matrix related to the availability
        of appropriate communications materials, as well as the Government-donor joint progress
        reviews (JPRs of attitudes and behaviors in the use of ethnic minority languages in planning
        processes.

        72. The final two risks lie in the achievement of objectives in the area of `Fiduciary
        Transparency and Accountability'. The fifth risk is the continuing resistance among local ­ and
        to some extent, central ­ officials to more competitive procurement procedures. Resistance to
        adopting more competitive methods is still significant in remote areas and most P135-2
        procurement is still done through direct contracting. This resistance may be partly for good
        reasons ­ namely the lack of contractors willing to work in remote areas and the relatively weak
        institutional capacity at local level. However it may also be due to the existence of corruption,
        mentioned as the highest risk in the original program documentation. Vietnam still scores poorly
        on most international transparency and corruption indices. Government and development
        partners agreed to strengthen attention to procurement reform implementation through enhanced
        TA support at local levels and requirements that districts and provinces report on the
        procurement procedures approved a priori for use by the communes in order to increase their
        responsibility for supporting implementation of competitive and community contracting
        approaches. It was also agreed that specific, thematic supervisions regarding procurement will
        be carried out as part of the JPRs.

        73. Finally, the slow adoption of new practices, and possible contracting and corruption issues,
        poses a risk that excessive unpaid labor, and possibly cash and material contributions will
        still be required from poor households. There is relatively little evidence that P135-2
        contracting is utilizing the labor of ethnic minority villagers at adequate wage rates. Provision of
        some minimum level of contribution to match production subsidies could be progressive to the
        extent that subsidies are poverty targeted, though the ability of the very poor to contribute is
        clearly limited. Specific reporting on the use of paid or unpaid labor is required in the MIS and
        is an area of focus of JPRs.


        5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

        5.1   Bank Performance
        (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

        74. Rating: Satisfactory

        75. The design of the Program reflected significant Bank support, and the quality of the program
        documentation at Quality-at-Entry stage was commented on very favorably by Bank reviewers1.
        Bank staff effectively facilitated the program preparation and actively engaged in ongoing policy

 For example, World Bank Group Office Memorandum: "Vietnam: Program 135 Phase 2 Support Credit, Minutes of
Regional Management Review, November 10, 2006"


                                                       24
dialogue. Very careful thought went into the decision to adopt a Development Policy Loan rather
than an Investment Lending modality. The program was designed explicitly to complement and
build on PRSCs and ongoing investment operations.

76. A very positive aspect of Bank performance was the close working relationship during
program preparation with other development partners, in particular with DFID, Finland, UNDP
and Australia (see Annex 4). The World Bank's ability to usefully draw on its extensive
experience in designing poverty-reduction programs and its experience with rural development
programs was much appreciated by both the government and other development partners. The
design of the program took careful account of the risks and lessons from Phase 1 of P135 and
other Bank projects, such as the Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project and the
Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project.

77. In retrospect, a stronger focus on the ability of CEM to effectively coordinate the program
and secure inputs from other government ministries, might have dictated greater caution in
widening the scope of P135 in Phase 2, by including production and livelihood components, and
more discussion with MARD and other implementing agencies at local level, as well as greater
attention to the design and mobilization of technical assistance ­ particularly at the provincial
and district levels to reinforce the understanding and implementation of agreed reforms..

78. An area of weakness at the entry was the absence of a clear set of measurable indicators,
including baseline and end of program targets. These were discussed and addressed in the
process of moving from MTR to DPC2, using the results of the baseline survey as inputs,

(b) Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

79. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80. In total, four Joint Progress Reviews (JPR) and associated supervision missions, including
the Mid-term Review conducted in November 2008, have been carried out. An appropriate focus
on development outcomes and fiduciary aspects was maintained throughout the supervisory
period. However, in retrospect, the issues raised by implementation of the production component
and need for additional capacity building and participation at local level could have been pressed
harder before the MTR, since implementation of these components has proved consistently
problematic.

81. In addition, supervision did not address the short-comings in the M&E arrangements,
particularly the need to agree on more specific and measurable indicators and targets in each of
the policy areas. As a result, the JPRs provided subjective ratings such as "satisfactory",
"partially satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory" which were contentious with Government, fueled
disagreements on their interpretation amongst donors, and did not support a consensus on the
need for action in some critical areas. On the other hand, TA provided by the Bank and other
donor partners (e.g. UNDP) in drawing up the MIS and the program fiduciary framework has
been much appreciated by the government (see Annex 4 for details).

82. The seamless transition of task managing from country office to headquarter as a result of
staff moving was managed well. The World Bank participated in all joint progress review events
and pro-actively led policy dialogues. Washington-based Task Team Leader and country office
Co-Task Team Leader coordinated well for timely interventions and relevant inputs as needed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

83. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84. This rating follows from the fact that performance during lending phase was satisfactory in
supporting a highly innovative approach to Vietnam's poverty reduction initiatives in a manner
which fully respected Government leadership and broader harmonization and alignment
commitments. The Bank's supervision effectively supported and sustained this innovative and
challenging approach through transference of task management responsibilities, though the
weaknesses in the M&E framework and technical capacity support elements of the program
should have been addressed prior to the mid-term review.

5.2   Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance:

85. Rating: Satisfactory

86. There has overall been strong government commitment to, and ownership of, the program as
evidenced by various Prime Ministerial decisions and vigorous assumption of responsibility for
CEM as the nominated implementing agency. In addition to CEM, other Government agencies,
notably MOF, MPI and SAV were effective partners in the preparation of P135-2 and the
achievement of key policy actions for DPC1.

87. Overall, Government pro-activity and coordination amongst agencies and with donors has
been effective in supporting implementation. Government has overcome the initial disbursement
delay caused by the late issuance of implementing guidelines, and has generally followed-up its
initial policy actions with further reforms or revisions as required, particularly where this could
be implemented from the central level. There has been a very positive presence of MOF and
other central agencies (SAV, SBV, MPI etc) in supervisory missions and in taking follow-up
actions. However, the role of MARD at central level has not been generally satisfactory. The
MARD Circulars were not deemed satisfactory by provinces, CEM and development partners.
The biggest hurdle in introducing a reformed policy on production support came form MARD
rather than from provincial institutions.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance:

88. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89. CEM, as program coordinator, has fulfilled its assigned responsibilities creditably, given its
initial weak capacity. JPR Aide Memoires have commented favorably on the efforts made by
CEM in preparing for the various JPRs, although it was noted in several cases that the


                                            26
   documentation and reporting available for some of the missions has been unsatisfactory. Over
   the last 3 years the CEM central P135-2 coordination office has been under-staffed and CEM
   officers have been stretched in delivering the implementation of such a large (over $1 billion)
   program. In response to the workload, CEM has recently appointed new staff to the Policy
   Department.

   90. Provincial implementation performance has varied considerably, reflecting the delayed and
   insufficient implementation support from the central level during the first two years of the
   program. Those provinces experienced with donor financed projects, and therefore with a
   number of the new program components and policy reforms have generally performed better
   than those without prior exposure. This has highlighted the importance of operationalization of
   the MIS to better target the nature and location of central level support.

   91. CEM has had a productive engagement with UNDP under P135-2, and has utilized TA from
   Finland. However, given the pressure on its own staff resources and the need to provide more
   direct support to provinces, CEM could have done more to facilitate more rapid mobilization of
   existing TA, and to guide additional TA resources to the provincial level. This was recognized at
   the mid-term review and CEM has worked closely with the partnership group to strengthen the
   programming and deployment of TA, particularly at the provincial level, including additional TA
   being provided by IrishAID.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

   92. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

   93. Government performance which was critical to initiating a highly innovative approach
   nationwide, with multiple development partners, has been satisfactory. However implementation
   performance was rated moderately satisfactory due to initial delays and insufficient support to
   provinces and districts. The national agencies have largely caught up in terms of overall
   implementation progress and CEM's acknowledgement of the key constraints at the mid-term
   review and work with its Government and donor partners to address these issues suggest a
   positive trend in terms of its performance.

   6.     Lessons Learned

   94. At the time of approval, the use of a DPC to support a public investment program was
   viewed as an innovative approach. While it is still too early to determine if the expected ability
   of a DPC series to result in broader and more sustained reform impact than a traditional SIL has
   been borne out, several lessons have been learned regarding the design and implementation of
   such an operation:

   Accountability for the program should be clearly with Government. A Government
   designed program, ideally already with some implementation experience, with significant
   funding from Government's own revenues is important to ensure sustained ownership and
   leadership.




                                              27
   The primary implementing agency needs both administrative and donor engagement skills.
   There needs to be sufficient capacity at the center of Government to simultaneously administer
   the program, interact with donors, and coordinate amongst ministries and levels of government.
   Different reforms will require different time frames to move from agreement to
   implementation. Sensitive areas of institutional or policy reform ­ in this case communications
   in ethnic minority languages, local procurement and shift towards market linked production
   support ­ require sufficient time frames for dialogue and agreement, and to gain traction and
   demonstrate results ­ usually beyond any specific DPC operation or even program of operations,
   so several incremental steps should be anticipated over a longer period.
   Joint monitoring of the program requires clear indicators agreed prior to implementation.
   Specific indicators for monitoring progress in each policy area should be defined and agreed, and
   informed by a baseline survey, during the preparation phase to provide a more objective basis for
   joint monitoring. Of course the use of a DPC series provides scope for adjusting indicators with
   experience.
   Cross-sector programs require a clear understanding of incentives faced by all
   implementing agencies. In the case of multi-ministerial programs, in addition to the
   coordination capacity of the lead agency, incentive structures need to be understood to determine
   how those who benefit only tangentially from the program will be motivated to pursue the
   reform agenda.
   Formal mechanisms are required to ensure that sub-national entities are on-board with
   both the program design and implementation of reforms. In the case of decentralized
   programs, contracts or similar mechanisms should be used to ensure ownership and
   accountability of provinces, states, etc. to implement the reform agenda.
   TA is critical to reinforce reforms at the local levels charged with implementation. Donors
   should pay particular attention to ensuring provision of a strong, sub-nationally focused TA
   program to reinforce capacity and understanding to implement reforms, as well as to support
   better information and experience sharing between provinces and between levels of Government.

   7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

   95. Both Government and co-financiers provided written comments to the draft ICR, as well as
   having held detailed discussions during its preparation. Regarding the draft ICR, Government
   emphasized its concerns that P135-2 is still a program in progress and therefore that any rating
   be recognized as preliminary given the progress to-date in several critical areas, as well as the
   joint commitment by Government and development partners to strengthened implementation
   over the remaining years of P135-2. A summary of the comments from Government and co-
   financiers is provided in Annex 4. No comments were provided by other stakeholders, however
   comments by other parties were sought and made in the context of the Mid-Term Review of
   Program 135-2 completed in November 2008 which is summarized in Annex 3.

Annex 3. Summary of Mid-Term Review Findings

Summary of Results of Mid-Term Review of Three Years Implementation of P135 Phase 2

Background: An extensive mid-term review of P135-2 was carried out in November 2008 in order to assess
progress with implementation over the period 2006 to 2008, as well as identify lessons learned and areas for
focusing additional program reform and institutional measures to strengthen progress towards objectives and
outcomes over the remaining two years of Phase 2 implementation. The mid-term review drew upon the
following key inputs:

       Results of baseline survey of 266 P135-2 communes and 134 control communes conducted in late
       2007 and analyzed in 2008.
       Independent studies commissioned by donors on "Drivers of Good Practice", "O&M" and
       "Participatory Planning" completed in November 2008
       People's satisfaction (citizen report card) survey conducted with 480 households in four provinces in
       late 2008.
       CEM conducted 4 assessment missions to 21 provinces over 2008.
       Consolidated report of three evaluation missions carried out from November 5 to 12, 2008 by the
       Committee for Ethnic Minorities of the National Assembly in six provinces.
       Results of joint Government-Development Partner field missions to all three regions carried out
       between November 5 to 13, 2008 in six provinces
       Annual audit results of State Audit of Vietnam performance audits in 8 provinces in 2007 and 10
       provinces in 2008.
       Provincial reports prepared as input to above field visits.
       Workshop held from November 24 to 25, 2008 with participation of national, provincial and district
       officials, development partner and technical assistance representatives, civil society and press to
       discuss findings of above and recommend specific measures for strengthening program
       implementation.

Key Findings from Mid-Term Review: The review emphasized the following areas of progress and where
additional, focused efforts are required to achieve program objectives and outcomes:

Program Implementation

       In 2008, P135-2 provided investment support to over 2,500 poor communes.
       In 2009, 107 communes will have "graduated" from P135-2 support.
       From 2006 to 2008, P135-2 supported 11,765 investment projects with a total of 4.7 billion VND, or
       almost 70% of total program plan for the five years.
       Initial implementation was slow (57% of plan in 2006) due to delays in issuing national policy
       documents and the need to then revise policy documents and guidance based on experience.
       Provincial level procedures vary in terms of requirements for price verification, financial accounting,
       etc. ­ need to work with provinces to review and streamline procedures to accelerate implementation
       Targeting at household and provincial level has improved substantially under Phase 2. MOLISA
       now uses household poverty criteria and 42 of 47 provinces have developed criteria for allocating
       funds amongst communes to reflect differential poverty rates and numbers. The baseline survey
       indicates that targeting is more pro-poor than non-P135 programs which allocate on equal basis
       amongst communes, however there is a need to reinforce use of allocation formulae in all 47



                                                     36
       provinces and to identify the scope for further improvements in provincial criteria through
       comparison of P135-2 commune level expenditure data with updated poverty maps expected to be
       available in early 2009.
       Infrastructure, education and production support are highly valued by beneficiaries, but there is a
       need to strengthen implementation of production support by unifying budget lines, improving
       household targeting (requirements) and focusing on demand driven approach with wider options of
       agricultural activities and vocational training.
       Capacity building plan is in-place but implementation is slow at national and provincial levels.
       Capacity is critical to supporting commune ownership as communes without investment ownership
       are generally those with lower levels of administrative capacity which will make achieving 100%
       target very difficult.
       Communications efforts are insufficient at local levels, particularly in terms of providing sufficient
       materials in ethnic minority languages ­ it is deemed critical to expand communication efforts as
       basis for strengthened participation and transparency.
       The procurement process requires clarification as many provinces and districts believe that existing
       practices meet competitiveness criteria, although field visits and SAV audit indicate problems with
       transparency and bid evaluation ­ critical to issue procurement guidelines in format accessible to
       communes and reinforce with capacity building activities and enhanced supervision particularly for
       community-based approach which is new to most localities.
       O&M funds allocation was not sufficiently utilized in 2008 due to lack of clarity in some provinces
       regarding guidelines to be followed ­ critical to review with provinces so that communes form O&M
       committees and utilize funds accordingly.
       Community contributions are not being effectively accounted by communes though this should
       improve with use of AMT/MIS. In addition, villagers in the central and southern regions indicated
       limited interest in obtaining paid work under infrastructure projects due to other work priorities,
       suggesting that priority for promoting this outcome should be in Northern Region.
       Roll-out of AMT/MIS was late but extensive training has been carried out and some provinces are
       already using the system well ­ it is critical to reinforce training to ensure 100% utilization of the
       system.
       SAV performance audits are of high quality and results coincide with conclusions of other,
       independent reviews (Council for Ethnic Minorities, Government-Donor joint monitoring missions)
       however there is scope to strengthen the follow-up by preparing reports indicating progress of
       provinces and central agencies in carrying out recommended actions ­ including reimbursements ­
       identified in audits.

Priority Actions/Next Steps

       Issuance of key implementing documents in support of new Inter-Circular 01 ­ Procurement Manual
       and Production Support Instructions
       Review and revise technical assistance plan with development partners to reflect need to urgently
       increase support at sub-national levels in support of commune ownership capacity building, O&M
       and communications, and to integrate additional TA support recently made available to Government.
       Preparation of first SAV audit follow-up report to assess status of actions by provinces and central
       agencies.
       Produce first, draft consolidated AMT/MIS to verify ability of system to consolidate inputs from
       commune, district, provincial and national levels.
       Update/revise P135-2 policy matrix to reflect changes in timing of key actions as well as to
       incorporate priorities identified as result of mid-term review.

Annex 4. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

1. Comments of Government of Vietnam agencies
Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM)

Role of the World Bank in P135 Phase 2
Several aspects of the World Bank's role were mentioned:
    World Bank activities in improving management capacity. Technical assistance during 2005 for
        preparation of Phase 2 document was much appreciated and useful. P135-2 development learned
        much from Vietnam's CDD experience;
    World Bank financial support to P135-2 was seen as very valuable. The Bank provided the largest
        donor contribution and the impact of its financing was therefore larger than other donors;
    Role of the Bank in the P135-2 Partnership Committee and in coordinating donor inputs and views
        appreciated ­ Bank involvement helped to speed up the resolution of issues. The Bank was very
        active in Consultative Group meetings in 2006 and 2007 and played a key `facilitator' role;
    The World Bank Team Leader played a key role in preparing other donors (Finland, IFAD etc) to
        undertake budget support.

Lessons Learned
Key lessons learned include:
    Getting a common `single voice' across donors is important where donor TBS constitutes nearly a
       third of the P135-2 budget, as it allows agreements to be reached and misunderstandings avoided. A
       mismatch between donor and GoV priorities is best avoided by getting up-front agreement on actions
       to improve programme management. More difficult issues will need to be faced during program
       implementation;
    A common (GoV / donor) system of information sharing on programme implementation is required.
       This should be pluralistic (allow a variety of inputs);
    In the case of policy-based lending, TA should be provided in a systematic, not fragmented, way.
       Capacity building is needed for local agencies, as well as at the central level. ToRs for TA should be
       shared widely with stakeholders, bearing in mind the needs of the organization, relevant policy
       actions etc.;
    Programme management tools are required e.g. management toolkits and Policy Matrix etc. CEM
       have valued donor assistance / TA in developing MIS tools, fund allocation formulae etc.;
    An audit `roadmap' should be developed during programme design that is linked to GoV plans and
       commitments;
    The strength of programme coordination with a decentralized NTP modality depends on the capacity
       of provincial leaders, so appropriate incentives and guidelines at provincial level are required.

MARD
In discussion, the World Bank made the point that the current production support component did not
sufficiently encourage integrated pest management or market-based rural development practices since
budgets and extension activities at local level were highly programmed, limiting local discretion. MARD and
the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) representatives made the following comments
in response to these points in relation to P135-2:




                                                     38
       MARD Circular on implementation of the Production Component, following Inter-Ministerial
       Circular 01/2008, along with Manual and Guidebooks, have now been issued and was very
       supportive of decentralization and commune investment ownership;
       MARD's view was that market-orientation is an "option" ­ available if communes choose to explore
       this approach;
       IFAD stated that they may not have pushed MARD strongly enough to adopt integrated pest
       management;
       GoV like projects and wanted to use IFAD expertise to `handhold' provinces in implementing
       agricultural service provision;
       MARD were designing a new NTP on Rural development, which would incorporate a new rural
       `model' and support for rural development.

2. Comments of Co-financiers

DFID Vietnam stated that it was very positive that World Bank was part of the group of donors supporting
P135-2. World Bank was able to usefully draw on its extensive experience in designing poverty-reduction
programs and its experience with rural development programs.

DFID completed a Project Completion Report (PCR) for P135-2 in late-2008, in parallel with the P135-2
Mid-term Review (MTR). The Project purpose (`Poverty reduction in the poorest communes and villages') is
given a rating of `2' ("Likely to be `largely achieved') in the PCR. The PCR justifies this rating as follows:

           "Sector budget support to P135 phase 2 has ensured donor harmonization and
           alignment to the main government programme for poverty reduction amongst the
           poorest and most excluded groups. The programme tackles exclusion by: raising
           awareness of the conditions in ethnic minority communities, promoting good data
           collection, analysis and regular supervision by central government, investing in the
           infrastructure necessary to promote human development in the poorest communes and
           villages, deepening decentralization, and empowering ethnic minorities to participate in
           policy planning and implementation. It also strengthens aid effectiveness by using and
           strengthening government systems and promoting donor harmonization around a single
           instrument.

           DFID started funding the last year of P135 phase I, in order to influence the design of
           the new phase; and has only funded the early years of P135-2 to help institutionalize
           reforms. Government acknowledges DFID's role as `catalytic' in encouraging other
           donors to engage in the second phase of the programme. Donor commitments are for
           $300 million over five years, and the total resources allocated to the programme stands
           at over US$1 billion at the end of 2008. Donors' focus on improving poverty targeting,
           strengthening capacity, and promoting policy and institutional innovations in the
           programme, have influenced performance even though Government still provides the
           bulk of the funding.

           P135 was designed to be `transformational' and the policy matrix emphasises
           institutional changes to make Government service delivery systems more responsive to
           household needs, and more effectively targeted at the poorest and most marginalized
           communes and households. P135 has made some remarkable achievements over the
           last few years, especially given the conclusion of the independent review of targeted


                                                     39
           budget support in Vietnam - that the timeframe for such changes needs to be 10-20
           years, rather than 2-3 years. Achievements include: introducing a policy framework
           which is results focused, and evaluated bi-annually, creating a central budget line for
           O&M, a new baseline survey and comprehensive data on ethnic minority poverty, an
           MIS system to monitor outputs and intermediate indicators on a regular basis (and
           proof that such local-central reporting systems are possible), a process audit,
           community report cards to assess beneficiaries satisfaction with programme outcomes,
           and devolving responsibility for investment ownership to communes. Many of these
           are firsts for Vietnam, and have the potential to improve development planning more
           broadly in the country.

           Other [P135] innovations include: (1) establishing good cross-Ministerial coordination
           in managing and supervising P135, a perennial problem in Vietnam. Five Ministries
           now regularly, and actively, participate in supervision missions. (2) Over the past two
           years significant improvements have also been made in strengthening the Committee
           for Ethnic Minorities' ability to lead and oversee the programme, including
           management of joint donor-Government reporting. (3) In response to its' success in
           achieving programme outputs, and to increase understanding of the nature of ethnic
           minority poverty, Government has further refined its targeting of P135-2 resources in
           2008 - to include 3,000 of the most marginalized villages, where the bulk of the poor
           live. This is in addition to the almost 2,000 communes in the 47 Provinces covered by
           the programme."

In addition to completing an internal PCR, DFID participated actively in the P135-2 MTR. The key concerns
expressed by DFID in the course of the MTR included a need to: (i) mainstream improved P135-2
procedures across Government; (ii) improve geographical targeting of the programme; (iii) improve
programme administration; (iv) disseminate best practice; and (v) engender more public participation and
engagement in the programme.

Key points raised by DFID in the course of finalizing the P135 MTR Aide Memoire are given below:

Mainstreaming of Procedures piloted under P135-2
    The rationale for P135 was one of transformation and innovation, and progress made needs to be
       consolidated both to improve systems, and ensure that the policy objectives of the next two years will
       be met. Discussions therefore need to take place between central level agencies in order to
       mainstream some of the procedures piloted under P135 into broader Government of Vietnam (GoV)
       systems drawing on the findings of the planning / participation study commissioned for the MTR,
       which suggested that P135 planning mechanisms are an improvement on SEDP.

Improved Programme Targeting
    CEM should consider, along with other Government agencies, how to improve targeting in P135.
       Some Provinces have less than 5 communes in the programme. It is difficult to achieve the
       `transformational' aspects of P135 with such low coverage of communes within a Province. The
       additional procedures for implementing P135 will be particularly burdensome if they are to be
       applied only to a very small percentage of communes within the Province. Government should focus
       on how to `graduate' these communes, or to integrate them under other poverty programs;




                                                     40
       CEM should conduct a study to improve the methodology for determining poor households. This
       study should be done in coordination with researchers and officials already working on the issue, and
       piloting new methods e.g. MoLISA research institute, GSO & GAPAP team in World Bank;
       The P135 policy matrix needs to take better account of recent studies of ethnic minority poverty and
       the constraints to poverty reduction, as well as existing analysis of gender and development issues in
       ethnic minority communities;
       Communes / provinces should be recording community contributions and Provinces should keep
       track of financial contributions for communes over the Province as a whole. Community
       contributions need to be assessed more closely to determine that they are affordable, and that
       exemptions are applied and recorded for poor households, as specified in the guiding legislation.

   Improved Programme Administration
    The Government new NTP for 61 Poorest Districts should encourage the use of the same systems and
      decrees as in P135-2, to avoid increasing the burden on local and provincial government;
    A further study should be carried out comparing procedures, and practice, regarding the flow of
      funds to communes (in line with MoF guidance 2849);
    Partnerships with other organizations would improve the quality of reporting, and ensure better
      accountability in Provincial reports (eg CEM report states 66 out of 81 communes are investment
      owners in Lao Cai ­ the mission found little evidence of such ownership.

   Dissemination of Best Practice
    Lessons learnt from other programs need to be used and applied, rather than expecting P135 to
      reinvent the wheel. For example, the P135-2 production component could benefit from the lessons,
      innovations and examples of successful initiatives for market integration, small-scale market
      production and value-chain linkages developed under the `Markets for the Poor' programme in
      Vietnam;
    A framework of `best practice' for the objectives of the policy framework could be constructed from
      notes of the 18 Provinces visited under the past three evaluation missions, and used to demonstrate
      `what can work'.

   Improved Public Engagement and Participation
    Communes/districts could be encouraged to open up discussions on priorities across the district to
      broader participation, and engage people in helping to set priorities and timelines;
    CEM should facilitate better support for participatory planning, including by clarifying the definition
      and understanding of `participation', and piloting the use of experienced community facilitators (in
      cooperation with other organizations, including civil society) as recommended by the P135 planning
      study to improve public engagement and participation in P135.

The Embassy of Finland made the following comments about P135-2:

Role of the World Bank in P135 Phase 2
    Finland was satisfied with P135-2 and the partnership with the World Bank, other donors and GoV.
        The remaining challenges are documented in the MTR Aide Memoire /discussions and in the recent
        LMDG report on the effectiveness of donor support to P135-2, but the results achieved in terms of
        infrastructure built and poverty reduced in areas where P135-2 operates are clear;
    The World Bank (and the Task Team Leader in particular) has played a key role. The Bank was
        valued for its influence in the design of the support instrument, the provision of the donor co-

       ordination `backbone', high-quality analytical inputs and as the largest donor financier. The role of a
       locally-based Task Team Leader was also seen as important and appreciated, but not crucial;
       Finland noted that the World Bank tended to think at the `macro' level. The issues of whether
       adequate capacity in key agencies exists or can be built, together with which donor can or will
       provide technical assistance (TA), is however a key `micro' issue that needs to be addressed.

   Lessons Learned
    The main lesson noted in relation to future support is the need to maintain a results-focused way of
      working, given that P135-2 is a very broad-based rural development programme. The results from
      P135-2, the new NTP for 61 Poorest Districts and other relevant Government programs should be
      discussed with relevant Government ministries;
    The Embassy also noted that CEM was not the Government leading agency in key programme areas
      such as infrastructure provision or agricultural production support, and its role in these areas needed
      to be supported. CEM also needed more resources to improve its performance as programme
      coordinator;
    Post-2005, donors were clear that TA should focus on implementation capacity, both at the centre
      and within a number of provinces. However, TA implementation had often been delayed for short-
      term reasons, such as the agency wanting to operate in a `nationally-executed' rather than through a
      `donor-managed' modality, which has limited the productivity of TA. A number of lessons had been
      learned from this experience:
          o In future, all donors should focus on the management capacity of the leading agency (CEM,
              in this case), and the agency should be requested / assisted to draw up an explicit plan to
              undertake the tasks of delivering the programme;
          o TA needs should then be aligned to requirements to deliver these tasks and the agency's
              capability;
          o TA should be planned ahead of the project design document, not behind its development;
          o Controls and limits should be placed on nationally-executed TA to overcome drawbacks in
              terms of quality and effectiveness of such TA.

The Government of Australia (AusAID) made the following comments relevant to the ICR:

Role of the World Bank in P135 Phase 2
    Australia believed that the World Bank had played a `very good role' in P135-2. P135-2 has been
        quite effective and positive actions have been accomplished;
    The Bank played a key role in bringing donors together, ensuring there was discussion between
        donors and then co-coordinating a discussion between donors and CEM. This process followed the
        principles outlined in Hanoi Core Statement and involved very frequent discussion between
        stakeholders over a period of more than a year;
    The Bank listened to stakeholders and took account of their comments;
    Points of tension arose when the Bank seemed to be making very high demands of Government
        counterparts and at one point seemed to be suggesting a different ministry should take the lead in co-
        coordinating P135-2 on the Government side. However, these issues were satisfactorily resolved.

Lessons Learned
    Government and donors should base TBS on detailed practical discussions, so that programme
       specific circulars and guidance can be based on specific features of beneficiary groups;




                                                      42
   Donors should be firm, but also fair and flexible e.g. regarding procurement, to avoid
   misunderstanding and a lack of realism among donors, a definition of "adequately competitive"
   procurement should have been drawn up initially;
   It is important for donors and Government to be very clear on precisely what policy has been agreed
   to e.g. regarding production support, MARD and donors did not understand the term "market-
   linkage" in the same way;
   The programme, procedures and management mechanisms should be simplified and research work
   relating to agricultural production support in mountainous areas should be strengthened;
   In hindsight, the Livelihoods component was very ambitious and in future the support offered should
   be amended to make the component clearer and more implementable;
   The Annual Monitoring Tool (AMT) and the M&E system was put in late, due largely to delays on
   the GoV side. In future, systems and guidelines should be in place prior to the start of support;
   There has been a positive change in thinking in some localities, but this needs to be reinforced by
   enhanced participation and further training of staff;
   A Work Plan should be devised for capacity building at the national and local level, including a
   practical way for donor staff / TA to work with Government agencies;
   In developing Phase 3 support, it would be desirable for there to be a headquarters discussion among
   donor partners at a senior (AusAID Executive, World Bank Management Board etc) level on
   meshing various objectives and policies including on poverty-relief, food security / safety and
   climate change;
   The lack of incentive for Government to use technical assistance, and lack of tight management
   controls by some donors over TA, had been key systemic problems that had hampered use of TA. As
   the lead agency, CEM needs sufficient staff to translate TA demands into `on the ground' support
   and CEM's Policy Department should be empowered to co-ordinate the programme.
