Operation for Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in\n            Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas for Vietnam had a\n            moderately satisfactory outcome and a moderate risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and the borrower\n            performances were moderately satisfactory. Several lessons\n            have been learned: (1) Accountability for the program should\n            be clearly with Government.  (2) The primary implementing\n            agency needs both administrative and donor engagement\n            skills. There needs to be sufficient capacity at the center\n            of Government to simultaneously administer the program,\n            interact with donors, and coordinate amongst ministries and\n            levels of government. (3) Different reforms will require\n            different time frames to move from agreement to\n            implementation. (4) Joint monitoring of the program requires\n            clear indicators agreed prior to implementation. (5)\n            Cross-sector programs require a clear understanding of\n            incentives faced by all implementing agencies. (6) Formal\n            mechanisms are required to ensure that sub-national entities\n            are on-board with both the program design and implementation\n            of reforms. (7) TA is critical to reinforce reforms at the\n            local levels charged with implementation."}, "docdt": "2009-09-21T00:00:00Z"}
