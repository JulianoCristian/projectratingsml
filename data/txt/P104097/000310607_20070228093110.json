It\n            has become increasingly integrated with the world economy,\n            and formally joined the WTO in January 2007. This first\n            credit in a programmatic series of three, would support\n            policy and institutional actions to improve the results of\n            one of Vietnam's principal National Target Programs\n            (NTP) for poverty reduction: the re-designed Program for\n            Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme\n            Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas\n            (2006-2010), known more familiarly in Vietnam as Program\n            135, Phase 2 (P135-2). The credit would support policy and\n            institutional actions to improve the results of P135-2 with\n            particular reference to: (i) improved poverty targeting of\n            program resource allocation; (ii) deepening and scaling-up\n            of community-driven approaches to planning, managing,\n            operating and maintaining basic rural infrastructure; (iii)\n            enhanced fiduciary transparency and accountability in\n            program implementation through wider use of social audit\n            approaches; and (iv) process monitoring and impact\n            evaluation. Critical aspects of this reform agenda have\n            already been demonstrated at scale under ongoing IDA- and\n            other ODA-supported initiatives in Vietnam covering at least\n            a half of all the provinces, districts and communes targeted\n            for inclusion in P135-2 (see maps and Annex 7). Those\n            elements of the reform agenda supported by the proposed\n            series of operations are described in the attached Letter of\n            Development Policy (Annex 1)."}, "docdt": "2007-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
