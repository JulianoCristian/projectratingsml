TRANSPORT REHIABILITATION PROJECT
CREDT ANI PROJWEr SUMMARY
Borrower:         Mongolia
Bendeary:         Ministry of Infastuc   Development (M), Mongolian Railways
(MR), Ulaanbaatar Municipality (UM, Motor Carriers
Credit Amount:   SDR 21.6 ($30.0 million equivalent)
Terms:            Standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity
Project Objectives: The proposed project would address some of the key constaints in
the transport sector, particularly by: (a) arresting the deterioratin
of the quality and quantity of tnsport services in railwys, urban
,tansport, trucking and roads; (b) strengening sectoral instituional
capacity; and (c) contributing to macroeconomic reforms through
complementry measures at the sectoral level.
Description:      The project consists of four sectoral subprojects (railways, urban
trnsport, road freight tansport and roads), each with a physical and
technical assistance component, and a component to advise on sector
policy and assist in the im enion of the projecL The proect
would focus on: (a) rehailitation of the transport fleet in railways,
uran transport and trucking; (b) rehabilitation of paved roads;
(c) preparation for restructuring of selected tansport enterprises; and
(d) policy advice, technical asstance and training to related sectord
agencies and private trucking opeators. The project has been
designed to complement the efforts of other donors acfive in
Mongolia. Hence, it excludes the aviation sctor (where the Asian
Development Bank-ADB-is active in improving the airort
facilities in Ulaanbaatar) and does not focus on construcion in the
highway sector (where ADB is prepaing a Road Master Plan
Study); and includes railway investments not covered by OECF
assistance.
A. Railways Subproject: The physical component cnsists of
major overhul of locomotives; the purchase of spare parts for
locomotives, freight wagons and passenger coaches; converon of
wooden fight wagons to steel bodies and the purchase of workshop

equipment. The technical assistance aims M imprving WR's coal
transport and its related costs, its financial performance, and at
formulating options for restucturing. The coa transport study
complements the coal pricing study (C0edit 2321-MOG), which
focuses on coal production costs and prices.
B. Urban Tranport Subproject: the physical component consists
of the purchase of new vehicles and spare parts. The technical
assistance focuses on establishing a policy frmework for the
planning, prcing and financing of urban tansport. services;
improving urban transport operations and maintenance of the fleet.
C. Road Freight Transport SubproJect: the physical component
consists of the rehabilitation of trucks. The technical assstance
component focuses on aiding recently privatized large motor cariers
to become financially idepndent and effectively competitive
eepris, and at improving managerial and logistics skills of motor
care' management.  Ts subproject aims at assistng the
Government in rebuilding the tcking sector in line with its
prvatization policy.
D. Roads Subproject: the physical component consists of the
purchase of bitumen for the repair of short, severely damaged
sections of paved roads, maintce equipment, computers, printrs
and software, and laboratory equipment. The technical assistance
aims at strengthening maintenance planning, budgeting and
implementation.
E. Sector Policy and Project Implementation Support: this
technical assistance component would include the hiring of an
Implementation and a Policy Advisor, a training program for senior
officials and professional staff of MID not covered in taining
progams in the subprojects.
Benefits:         Ihe expected improvements in trnsport services would help
Government's efforts to restore industial efficiency and facilitate
export diversification, as well as help maintain essential public
services, such as heating, power and urban transport in the capital
city, Ulaanbaatar, and also reduce, albit slightly, envrnmental
degrdation of air. The proposed project's main economic benefits
would be to improve utilizton of transport assets and reduce
operating costs. More broadly, the project would: (a) help to
improve operations and maintenance of transport infrastructure; (b)
strengthen the sector's institutions in operations and maintenance,
including training, technical assistance; and (c) assist the



Goveament In the transidon frm a cently planned economy to
a market economy.
Riusk:            The proposed project would be the first IDA operation for a specific
sector in the country. Mongolia's unmilia  with IDA's project
cycle poses an implementaion risk, exra ted by the project's
compleadty.  The rsk will be migated partly by funding an
Implementation Advisor and a Policy Advisor (to work closely with
staff of all insttutions under MID) and by making expienced staff
in the Ministry of Trade and Industry rponsible for pmocurement.
In addition, several other actions would take place: (a) tue creation
of an interagency Project Steering Group (PSG) under the
chairmanshp of MID; (b) the commitment by MID to assign a full-
time counterpat to the Project Implementation Advisor; (c) the
commitment by MID to give the Advisors access to higher-level
government officials; and (d) the preparation of a critiral path
program for project planning and scheduling.

1. THE ECONOMY
A. BACKGRCUN
Geogrphy
1.1         Mongolia is a large but sparsely populad country, landockd bewee
Russia to the north and Chna to tbe east, west, and south.J/ ts total land area
(1.6 milion km?) is about half the se of India and four dmes larger than Japan. It is
2,400 km long from WeSt to east and 1,250 km from north tD south  With an averag
eevation about 1,600 meters above sea level, the cimate is semiard conital
Mogola's winters are long and sever, with average ten  es  low feezing from
Oobea to March. The average t m         in Janm    is about -2C, with lows often
beow -40C.
Natural Resources
1.2         Mongolia has Wabudant agricultual land and is rich in mineral resources,,
including coa, copp, molybdenum, fluorite, gold, iron ore, lad, oil, Fh, tin,
urnium, and wolfram, of which t  first thee ar the most importat Coal resee tota
an estimated 20 bllion tons. Ie main copper and molybdenum mines, at Erdet, are
maaged as a joint ventue beween Mongolia and Russia. The ret mine produces
copper concentrate for export mainly to the fmer Soviet Union and is by far the
country's largest export earner. Thermal power, generated from domestc coal and
iported diesl oil, is sPplmented by elctcity iWorts from the Russian gdd,
especially for the Erdenet co    plant.
1.3         About 80 percent of the land is suitable mainly for animal husbandr.
Mougolia's 26 million head of livestock (1989) include: sheep (58 percent), goats
(20 percent), catte (11 percent), hor   (9 percent) and camds (2 percent).  Cwp
culmat  begn on a inificant scale ondy in th 1950s with the dV nt fv
land. Ag      e is consaind by the svere cliAte, whch pem    only a 90-day
gWwing and harvestng seas  and caues lare crop lse becaus of sap fluctuadt
in tmpertu  (as much as 30C in a day). Forests cover about 10 percent of the teritory
(15 mllion ha).

Demography
1.4        With a total population estimated at 2.2 million in September 1993,
Mongolia's populton density, at 1.3 persona per Ian2, is one of the lowest in the world.
About 58 pcnt of the population lives in urban aeas, 27 percent of it in the capita city
of Ulaanbr. Nearly 90 prcent ar Mongols, of which the Khakha-Mongols compise
the largest subgroup (about 75 percent of the total). Other ethic groups include Kazakhs
(5.3 percent), Chinese (2 percent), Russians (2 percent), Tuvins, Uzbes, Uighurs, and
otes (1.5 percent). The official language is Kakha Mongol.
1.5        With an esdmated birhi rate of 4.6 childrenrp women and an esdmated
death rate of 8.0 per 1,000 in 1991, Mongolia's 2.7 percent rate of popuation growth Is
one of the highest in Asia. Its populaion has more hn doubled since 1960 owing, until
recently, to the government's pro-naalist policy. Life expectancy at birth was 63 years
in 1991.
Ptical and Economic History
1.6        After the collapse of the Mongol Empire (esablished by Genghis Khan in
1291), Mongolia was a frontier province of China from 1691 until early this century and
beame an independent state on July 11, 1921. Following three years of  itnal
monarchy, nominally headed by Buddhist leaders, the Mongolian People's Republic was
founded in 1924. Its capital was renamed Ulaanbaatr (Red Hero).
1.7        After World War II, Mongolia became a centaly planned command
eonomy,  artd  by fve-yearpls tat emphazed the development of industry and
energy. Mongolia begn an ineasingly close association with te Soviet Unio with the
sgning of a Treaty of Fiendship and Mutual Asstan  in 1946. After joining the
Council for Mutual Economic Assstance (COMECON) in 1962, Mongoia's trade
exanded, and its parter nations became involved in building Mongolia's in frructr
and developing some of its large productive enteises and mining complexes, in effect
laying the foundation of a modern industdal sector.
1.8        Tsedenbah was MongoLa's leader dunng much of tis perod.  is removal
from power in August 1984 marked the beginning of the economic and political refrms
now under way. Dissatisfaction with the rigidity of the centally planned economy was
mountng and, pary influenced by the Soviet Union's glasnost' and 'pestW
polcies, Mongolia launched its own progrm  of political openness and economic
restructring in 1986.
1.9        Since independence in 1921, Mongolia has evolved from an underdeloped,
pimarily patoal economy to one with a grwing idustrs  sectr. Its main but not sole

Sigificant investment in the social sectors has resulted in near-universal adult litey, a
fre health care system, and life expctancy apprhing the span in developed counties.
1.10        Some indusiaton, made possible by large investments by the Soviet
Union, led to rapid growth during the 1960s and 19QOs. Net material product grew nearly
8 pec ' annually during 1970-75, and by a further 4.3 percent amually in 1975-80.
Gross i.dustrda production re  by about 70 percent between 1960 and 1980, but
adcture lagged behind, with little change in the size of the livestock herd for the la
30 year. Industrial investments also pemitted a growing volume of foreig  trade as
copper-producing capacity came on steam, but expo  growth could not kwep pace with
Mongol's rising import dependence.
1.11        Untl the early 1980s, MongoLa had fairly robust growth, despite the
distortions and ineficiencie of the centrally planned economy. Since then, however, the
economy has unden   incrsing stins because of growing difficulties in the former
COMECON countries and the indequacy of domestic resources to sustain eficient growth
policis. This was reflected in the flling growth rate of rea GDP,21 from 7 pet in
1981-86 to 4.6 percent in 1987-89. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
COMECON system, Mongolia suffered a sudden withdrwal of extemal support As a
consequence, the  economy  fell into  severe  receson  (real gross domestic
product-GDP--declined by about 8 percent in 1991 and about 10 percent in 1992) and
high inflation (at an annual rate of about 320 percent by the end of 1992) caused frther
dislocations.
1.12        Since 1990, Mongolia's Government has gadually lilized the economy,
a process which has accelerated following political reforms in early 1990 and the deisn
by the Government to establish a market system. Important accomplishments since then
include: (a) freeing of almost a retail and wholesale prices fom ad ve contrls
and application of a more reasc pricing policy to goods and series sfill st     to
administered pr    (ener, rents, and public utilites and services); (b) elimination of
madtory state production or purbas orders; (c) priv aion of over 95 peet  of
small- and medium-size public   pises and of about 450 large public entapdses;

1.13       ITe Govenment's immediate aims are to restore GDP growth sarig in
1994, and to reduce inflation to single digits by 1995. This will requie recory of te
agricultural, industrial and svice sects, especially in ewxort-relaWd acvities. This
recovery in urn wil depend on substantial restructuring of enterises in the sector
concerned to make them more effient. Equally important is the development and
maintenance of a suportive business environment including relistc exchange rates, an
efective payment and credit systen and liberal tade controls.
1.14        Finaly, govnmentl fctions and commercal activities that will

a resut, a PFP for the next three years was agreed in June 1993. The resoratio  of
nport senvices and their mainteance are important elements in the Goverment's
pram, and public investment between 1994 and 1996 will focus on upkeep and

2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. BACKGIOUND
2.1         Mongia's  sport inf             which cosists of railways, roads and
airways, is sriously inequat in relaion to the astuess of the yteitory and the ded
for tasport services. Since 1946, when the ties to the former Soviet Union became close,
the demand for transport serces increased substandally as imports and exports grew
(almost exclusively with the ex-COMECON countries until 1991) and transit trade betwe
Russia and China developed. The cunrent trnsport network focuses on the duee lget
cities containing most of the industi activty (Ulaanbaatar, Darhan and Erdenet) and on
two border cities (Suhbaatar at the border with Russia in the north and Zameen-Uud, the
transshipment point with China, in the south).
2.2          Trasport is  cUCi to Mongola's economy, both     intefr al and
interional movements, becase it is a large, landlockd country and it is healy
dependent an coalbased energy producto. However, as a result of the economic
recession during the last three years, and the lack of foreign exhange, ptically no
renewal of tanot equipmet has been made, and spare pas needed for mantenanc an
laldng. Consequently, udlizaon of equipment and quality of sevice have deteroated
dramatally.  Ihe down-dme of essential equipment such as loooives, buses,
trolleybuses and  trucks is 30 to 60percent, compared to a normal rge of 15 to
25 percent Bus loadings in Ulaanbaatar exceed 2,500 passeners per bus per day
compared to a nol level of 1,200 passengers.  Since 1992, Miongo's export
perform ance stared to improve, and new mares are being developed. Intena markets,
as well, are developing. Such raunching and rsitoning of the economy urgently
reqWres resoration of the transport system's capacty and laying the basis for the
development of new services.
2.3         Mongolia railways cares some 70 percent of the country's freight and plays
a key economic role: (a) it is Mongolia's link to Russia, China and,,tugh them, to
other counties; (b) it connwcts Mongolia's three larest ciies; and (c) the bulk of its
transport is the movement of domestic coal for the power plants in  a atar, which
provide about two thids of the country's eney for industrialpens and fo  eating.
2.4         About 60 percent of road freight consits of onmstructon matedals; te
maid  is coal, wheat, dring water, fuel and other goods. Mhe state and povincil
road sysms ompe rpecvely about 1,200 km and 112 km of pavd road and some
1,550 km and 1,530 klm of grvel road. These roads are cmleby tacks made
by motoized vehiles tveling    the steppe and desert



- 6-
2.5         Geographically, the paved roads are witin, and ennate essendally fhm
Ulaanbaatar; northwards to Darhan and the Russian border, eastward to Bganuur,
southwest to Availheer and short lengths elsewhere. The gravel roads comprise tie road
from Darhan to Erdenet and other sectaons that are either generally extenions of the paved
roads, or else are 'natural" roads in gravel basins. The road situation is serious, as fight
transport by trucks, both interational transport (to Russia and China) and internally, is
becoming more important.
2.6         The transport system was developed with ownerip and control in the strit
pattern of centrally planned economies. Prior to 1991, al transport assets were owed by
the state and opaated ether as adjuncts of enterptises in the production or service sector
or as public cariers. Freight was centrally aocated to the different modes; inputs for the
sector (spare parts, fuel) were  rnged through specily desigated official entie
controled by the state; repair and mainenance sevices were rendered by st-wned
enterprises; financial management was limited to budgeting and reportng the use of
allocated public funds; tariffs were officially set pnces. Current economic reorms are
chaing this pattern (paa 2.11).
2.7         Transport equipment in Mongolia is of ex-COMECON countries' origin;
technical assistance in the construction of railways and roads also orginated from these
countries. Much of the equipment was provided on favorable tams.
B. TRAmic
2.8         Similar to Easte  European countries, transport in Mongolia was int ve
in relafion to GDP. The tansport sector grew relatively rapidly during the 1980s,
averaging about 5 percent annually. In 1990, the sector accounted for about 11 percent
of GDP and employed about 48,000 people. This intensity was due to: (a) the economy's
emphasis on mining and indus   ntalizaion; (b) a elatively high level of foreign tade
with ex-COMECON countries; (c) Mongola's important role as a transit country betwee
the former Sovit  Umon and, more recendy, Cmina; and (d) tnsport services being
heavily subsdized.
2.9         Since 1991, the Mongolian economy has been in tanon from a centAy
planned to a market economy and is in recession. These cmsaces, together with the
dismantling of COMECON and the scamity of spare parts and fuel, resuted in feight
traffic demand for al modes and types of traffic droppng from 1989 to 1992 Cable 1);
passenger taffic has been unaffected primarily due to the sharp increa  in the acty of
individual traders in Mongolia, Russia and Chia, and becuse buses and troleybuses ar
the tansport means for the majority of people. The aggrgte freit pe ve,
however, masks the fact that tanwort cpacity shortages have developed for specif
commodities (especially coal), and services in the newly developing intnal markes
Supply of ansport services has declined more sharply than  e drop in demand. Te
reduced demand for tansport affords an opportunity to corect physial, instdtuonal and
policy shortngs (see paa 2.12) in the sector befre the economy rewvers and
ansport demand resumes.



-7 -
2.10        Future trffic volumes will depend on the pace of economic refbrm and the
structure of the economy in Mongolia, on foreign trade flows betwe  Mongoiha, Russia
and China, and on the transit routes Russia and China will use for their tade. All these
facts are difficult to predict reliably. However, it is expect  that, overal, transport
demand would increase with economic growth in China and the resumpton of growth in
Mongolia and possibly Russia.
C. TRANPRT REFORMS
2.11        The Government's stegy for the transport sector reflects its new market
orientation. It gives priority to reducing price distortions and priateg commecal
activities where competition is possible, such as trucldng. The Govenment also intends
to improve the efficiency of public utilities and istrucure opertons and make them
more commeriay oriented. Consonant wihi these goals, the Govement has:
(a)  increased fuel prices, as of June 1, 1993, with curent official prices of
$1.00 per gallon equivalent fc. gasoline and $1.30 per gallon for diesel,
respecdvely, thus deiminating government subsidies;
0b)  introduced an increase in urban transport tfs in Ulaanbatar f*om Tog 3
to Tug 10 as of mid-June 1993;
(c)   pnvauized truckng companies, with the first round of piva
completed in the  ird quarter of 1993J1
(d) reduced its role in the allocation of traffic among trucldng companies-now
limited to vital products in specific seasons (harvest products, hay in
summer and fall; meat in winter);
(e)   further reduced price controls on intercity truckng services; and
(f) reduced its role in the procurement of spare parts for the road transport
fleet
D. KEY SECIOR CONSTRANI
2.12        The tranport sector is faced with physical, qoetnal, instio   and
policy constmints:
(a)   Physcal and Operational Constraints.  The key problem  is low
availability of equ;pment despite reduced traffic in recent yean, most
notably in the railways and urban tnsort, and caacity containts in
domestic and intemational tansport, caused by:

- 8-
(i) Shortages of spare parts and equipment, and defeal of ovhaul of
the transport fleet and equipment due to the lack of freig
exchange;
(ii) The poor condition of maintenance and repair shops for all tasport
modes: their equipment is inadequate; technology is obsolete and
needs replacement; and staff need tanig in moden tecques;
Qiii) Fuel supply shortage and continued rationing, which despite recent
price increases affects competition as the estaed trucking
companes have easier access to officially pnced fuel than the newer
and smalier companies and owner operators;
Civ) Poor condition of the road network with only 3 percent of the total
roads paved and inadequate capacity to maintain the network;
(v) Insufficient ficilites at the Russian and Chinese bordeas that hamper
cross-border transport;/ and
(vi) Condition of the principal airport: Ulaanbaatars, aiport will need
to be improved to handle the expected increase in intationa
traffic smoothly and efficiently.
(b)   Institional and Policy Constraints are:
(i) Limited experience of the Ministry of Infuc    Daelopment
(MID) in policy setting, planning, resource mobilzadon and
budgetng in a sctora context, and in construction and maintenance
planning in a national context;
(il) Limited experience in commercial and financial aspects of operns
in all Mongolian twasport institutions;
(iii) High share of Govent (from  30 to 51 percent) in many
pnvatized trucking compaies where the Govemment, even when it
has a minority share, has effective control because of the diffsed
ownership of the private share; and

2.13        The Government strategy, supplemented by investments from OECF, ADB
and IDA, is expected to mitigate some of the physical, operational, institutional and policy
constraints the transport sector is curretly facing.
E. FOREIGN AsswSrANcE TO T   TRANSORT SECTOR
2.14        Japanese official aid is assisting Mongolian Railways (MR) to: (a) improve
railway transfer facilities at the Mongolian and Chinese borders; (b) maintain the track;
(c) acquire freight wagons to decase MR's leasing charges now paid m foreign curency;
and (d) purchase passenger coaches. ADB assstance focuses on improving the airport
facilities in Ulaanbaatar and on preparng a Road Master Pla feasibility study to update
the Road Master Plan produced in 1990 by MID and Russian gineers. The Road Master
Plan Terms of Reference focus on planning new investments, not on maintenance nor on
the role of the Road Department within MID. Through the IDA Economic Rehabilitation
project (Credit 2320-MOG, December 1991) MID could purchase bitumen for road
maintenance and tires for road transport vehicles; fte country is also receiving technical
assstance through Credit 2321-MOO, December 1991, while the Economic Transidtion
Support Project (Credit 2551-MOO, November 1993) is providing aid through mid-1995
for the maintenance of tracks and traction and rolling stock of the railways. The poposed
Transport Rehabilitaton Project complements OECF's and previous IDA opertions in the
railways by focusing on traction needs until 1998 and on technical assistance not covered
in previous opeaions; it complements ADB's investment in roads by focusing on road
maitenance, not covered in the ADB study. It also addresses botdenecks in urban
transport, and trucling, and sectoral policy issues not addressed by other donors.
F. RAILWAYS
Infasrcure
2.15        MR comprises two unconnected systems (Map: IBRD 25768). The main
part (1,571 km, including sidings) provides the link between the Russan FedeAton and
China, through Ulaanbaatar, connecting with fte Russian and Chinese national railway
systems at the borders. It provides rail access to the three principal cities of the country-
Ulaanbaatar, Darhan and Erdenet. The second system is a separate section (349 kmn) in
the east of the country connecdng only with the Russian system. The constrction of
railways from the Russian border to Ulaanbaatar was completed in 1950 and from
Ulaanbaatar to the Chinese border in 1956.
2.16        All the main and branch lines (except 5 km) are single tracks with a gauge
of 1,524 mm, which is the same as the Russian gauge to which it is linked in the north just
beyond Suhbaatar. In the south, the line connects with the narrower (1,435 mm) sandard
gauge railway line of China at Zameen-Uud in Mongolia and Erelenhot in China, the latter
being the main transshipment point at present.
2.17        Locomotives. The railway has 105 diesel locomotives of tee types of
Ukminian make. The inventory and age profile of the fleet are given in Table 2. Of this



- 10-
fleet, the main line locomotives are 64 of 4,000 horsepower (hp) and 13 of 2,000 hp, the
latter being used only for short distances or light services. The main backbone of the fleet,
however, are the 2M62 type 4,000 hp locomotives. About 58 percent of these locomotives
are inoperative due to lack of spares and overhauls. The locomotives are distributed over
six locomotive depots for operational purposes, Ulaanbaatar being the main depot.
2.18        Roiling Stock. The rolling stock consists of 250 coaches and 1,813 freight
wagons of (East) German and Russian make, respectively (see Table 2). The passenger
coaches are primarily based in Ulaanbaatar, the focal point of passenger taffic. The
freight wagon fleet operates primarily in the northern half of the system with a few trains
going south to the Chinese border. About 63 percent of the fleet consists of open wagons
used for carrying coal, mainly to power stations. The freight wagon fleet is substantally
augmented by between 1,200 to 2,000 freight wagons leased from Russia on any day
depending on the intensity of traffic requirements.  eang charges are denominated in
Swiss Francs (SFr) and averaged $123,000 per month in 1992. A recent agreement on
lease charges will raise the daily rate nearly sixfold by 1998. Availability rates of freight
wagons (93.8 percent) and coaches (93.2 percent) are slightly below normal levels. These
rates disguise, however, the fact that some coaches and wagons currently in use are
decrepit.
2.19        Track strcture, signaling and teleco     cations characistics are
given in Annex 1. They are not the focus of the proposed project.
Organization
2.20        Mongolian Railways (MR) is ajoint venture, initially between Mongolia and
the (former) Soviet Union, curently between Mongolia and the Russian Federation.
2.21        MR functions as a "quasi-independent department' under MID  (see
Annex 2 . General oversight of the railway is entrusted to a Board of Directors.
Operation of MR is the responsibility of the Chairman, who is assisted by a Chief
Engineer, a first Deputy Genergal Manager, a Deputy General Manager (operations) and
a Deputy General Manager (civil engineering and welfare).
Traffic and Operations
2.22        MR plays a key role in Mongolia's economy. It carries about 70 percent
of total freight ton-kilometers (ton-km) and about 30 percent of passenger traffic.]/ Coal
delivery to power stations, about 5 million tons per year, accounts for more than
40 percent of the country's freight ton-km. This freight is vital since coal is the prncipal
source of energy for power and heating.
3/  MR's main business is the taport of codl (fmm h mimes at Baga-Nur, Shar-Gol, Bagagnm
Shovee-Ovoo and Nalaikh) to power stations (i UlanbaataW, Dsahan and Erdmnet), of conseu_i
material and other products witina Mongolia; and of copper ore, fluorsper, coal and ma   expoft.



- 11 -
2.23        In 1992, MR handled 8.5 million tons and 2.8 billion ton-km of f
This compares with 16.8 million tons of freight and a tumover of 6 billion ton-km in 1989.
On average, 329 wagons are loaded every day compared to 625 in 1988. MR ascribes this
to a drop in demand; other reasons are a progessive slakening of discipline, increased
failures of locomotives in operation, speed restrictions and other operational problems.
The average tumaround distance has however inreased from 603 Ikm in 1991 to 656 kn
in 1992.
2.24        In 1992, 2.75 million passengers were carried with a tunover of 636.2
million passenger-kilometers (pass-kIn). Despite substantial staff reductions, productivity
fell more than 40 percent from its peak in 1988 to 236,800 traffic units per employee.4/
However, counting the staff employed on average in railway acdviis only, productivity
in 1992 was 513,000 trffic units per employee, which is good in comparison to most
railways in developed countries. The salient operational features and indices of Mongolian
Railways are given in Table 3.
2.25        MR operations are divided in two groups: operational and nonoperatonl
activities.  The operational activities relate only to train opaions; nonoperatonal
activities embrace all other venbures needed to support train operations, such as track,
locomotive, rolling stock and sgnaling maintenance; manufactuing of sleepers, brake
blocks, ballast; construction; and a range of social and welfire commitments. At the end
of 1992, employment was 6,697 in operational activities, and 7,658 in nonp l
actvities, totaling 14,355 employees.
Problems
2.26        The design of MR was predicated on full support from the Soviet railway
ystem and lack of commercial orientation. In general terms Soviet equipment, roling
stock, infrasitrctr and practices were sound, although not as efficient as those in other
major milways. Hence, MR from the outset was reasonably sound from an opertonal
viewpoint, cerainly while the full support of the Soviet railways was readfly and cheaply
available. Since 1991, however, this dependency on the now-Russian system has become
a disadvantage; a fall in earnings and the requirement that all support from Russia be paid
for in SPr have resulted in a progressive deterioration of the physical plant. The proposed
project will tackle the deterioration of traction and will assist MR to position itself within
the new market economy emerging in Mongolia.
G. URBAN TRAN RT
2.27        The urban trsport subproject focuses on the capital city, anbat, a
city of 630,000 inhabitants that is gowing at 2.2 percent annually. Sity percet of the
population are in the economically active age ranges of 15 to 60 years. The avage
household size is 4.1 persons. Buses and trolleybuses are the modes of anport for the
.41IT   is I ftc  unit - 1 paskm + 1 tou-kzn

majority of people. Darhan and Erdenet are relatively well served by urban tanport
services. The promotion of bicycles (which could only be used during six months of the
year because of severe winters), originally considered in the project, was drop    became
private entrepreneurs are already promoting their use.
2.28        Urban transport semices are heavily subsidized and it will require significant
industry refonn and restructug to prepare them for more efficient, market-led
operations. The reform process is lily to require:
(a)  the development of operaons under full cost-recovery principles, and
(b)   some degree of industry deregulation and the encouragement of competio
between operators.
Infratucture
2.29        Network. The route network has 26 bus routes and 7 trolleybus routes, 43
designated route terminals, and a citywide network of clearly identified bus stops. Route
responsibilities are assigned to the bus companies on a geogaphical (zonal) basis. There
are currently two bus zones, and the intention is to create a third zone as the size of the
vehicle fleet increases. Trolleybus routes are based on a central corridor through the city
with some radial spurs to adjacent high-traffic areas; preparatory work has been aexaeted
(installation of power lines, etc.) for an extension of these routes. Target servce
frequencies on the network are 3-5 minutes in peak hours, 5-10 minutes in off-peak and
15 minutes in low-demand coridors. Bus stop distances are a maximum of 1 km and
target joining distances to the tansport system (home to bus stop) are 0.7 to 1 km.
2.30        Feet. The exising urban passenger fleet toals 432 buses and troleybuses.
Bus Company No. 1 has 131 buses (96 Karossa buses manufactured in PtWge, Czech
Republic and 35 Liaz buses manufactured in Lildnov, Russia); Bus Company No. 2 has
151 buses (87 Karossa and 64 Liaz); the trolleybus company has 150 ZIV-9 trolleybuses
manufactured in Russia and Bedars. The existing vehicles are well suited to the rigomus
operating conditions in Ulaanbaatar.
2.31        Average fleet avalability levels achieved in 1992 for the duee companies
were 56 percent for Bus Company No. 1, 51 percent for Bus Company No. 2 and
58 percent for the Trolleybus Company, compared to levels of 80 to 85 percent norma in
a reasonably efficient urban tansport system. Thus, 237 buses were in service during the
daily peal. If operating company maintenance prfomance was improved to sWort
vehicle availability levels of 80 to 85 percent, it would be possile to put betwn 346 to
367 buses in service daily, thus increasing service capacity by 61 to 82 buses from within
the exsting fleet.
2.32        The average age of the Ulaanbatar vehicle fleet is 3.6 years, with 3.4 year
for Karossa buse, 4.5 yeas for Lian bus and 3.2 years for ZIV-9 tolleybuseL Cities
in the former Soviet Union, operating similar vehicle types under similar conditions,

achieve 10- to 12-year vehicle opeatg lives. The existing fleet, therefore, still has
siificant potental operang life remarng. The age profile of the existing fleet and the
implications of the age curve of the fleet on future replacement needs are given in Table 4.
2.33        Maintenance. Each operating company has its own maintenance facilties.
Maintenance bays are enclosed and weather-proofed with sufficient heating and lighting to
permit year-zound maintenance activity. Maintenance procedures are labor-intensive and
little use is made of modern equipment for maintenance or diagnostic tasks. The majority
of vehicle maintenance takes place in work bays equipped with inspection and repair pits.
Little or no use is made of vehicle lifts or ramps. Maintenance facilities are sufficient and
adequate for the vehicle types operated. Technical assistance under the proposed project
wil review maintenance methods and requirements (see Anne&x .
Organiation
2.34        The Dparment of Urban Transport (DuTi) of ulaanbaat Municipalit has
administtive responbility for all public transport services in the city. The head of DUT
nominaly reports to the vice-mayor of Ulaanbaaar but in practice works in close liaison
with and is under the stategic direction of the road transport division of MID. Atpresent,
DUT has littIe financial autonomy and investment decisions are made by MID with funding
from MOF; this latter ministry also regularly provides operating subsidies. DUT has a
staff of approximately 20; about a third of them did technicai studies in institutes of the
fornmr Soviet Union. They carry out studies of urban tranort needs but lack access to
computers and have no tMining in cost analysis techniques necessary to improve efficiency
of urban transport operations. DUT defines the passenger transport route network and
seice frequencies to be operated on the urban network. There are three opert
compaies (two bus companies and one trolleybus company). The managers of the
opeating companies report to the head of DUE. Staffing levels within the opeting
companies are broadly in line with international standards (see Table 5).
Tariffs
2.35        Tariff levels are controlled by DUT and are set following Centri
Govnment (Council of Minists) approval. Tariff levels in July 1993 were raised from
Tug 3 to Tug 10; they are a flat rate irepective of distance traveled and DUT estimates
that they cover only about one fourth of operating costs.
Public Transprt Demand
2.36        Analysis of Ulaanbaat statistics of public transport passengers tansprted
between 1985 to 1992 indicates that the average daily public tansport demand is esmated
to be some 693,000 passenger-trips per day.5/ At present, loading figures in excess of
A/  At noma passeger loading leves of 1,200 passenger trips per vehicle per day for a tandad single-
dwk vehicl (AMtg-Wright & TI z-Wodld Ban, 1987), this would       a a dily
vehcles-in-sec r ement of 577 sadad buses or tollybusu   peak see daly.



- 14-
2,500 passengers per vehicle per day are common in Ulaanbaatar. DUT wishes to reduce
vehicle loadings to a more reasonable level of 1,500 passengers pvr vehicle per day. This
would return serce levels to 1990 standards and require 462 busas in peak srvice. At
aiability levels of about 80 percent, a total fleet size of 554 would be necesay to
sustain this service target.
2.37        The problems in passenger operations in Ulaanbaatar may be sumnumized
as followis:
(a)   operationally:  an accelerating decline in availability of buses and
troLeybuses due to a shortage of spare parts. A fare structme grossly below
that required to cover running costs compounds the problem and may be
contributing to unnecessary trips; buses are heavily overloaded most of the
time, and up to 100 percent overloaded at peak; and
(b)  institutionally: an overly centralized structure where authority needs to be
devolved to the operting companies while establishing adequate OPeAtona
performance targets and reporting systems; bus compnie  short of
manaerial and opertonal skills.
The physical and technical asstance elements of the urban tansport subroect in the
proposed project will address these problems.

2.38        Network. A hub-spoke distribution networkc, with Ulabaatar at the cente,
has emerged in Mongolia. Most products and commodities move to and from the capita
where the six large distribution and trading companies (such as the Consumer Food Supply
Company, Agricultural Supply Company, Equipment Supply Company) are based. Thee
companies receive products both from inside and outside Mongolia's borders and hold
them in storage in Ulaanbaatar for subsequent delivery and use.
2.39        Fleet. There were about 23,000 registered trucks in Mongolia in 1993, 97
percent maufacted in Russia or Belarus. They include primarly the ZIL-130. They
are gasoline-powered with a hauling capacity of five tons maximum, and normaly opae
in tandem with twailers, also typically of five-ton capacity.

rebuilding engines, chassis,  miss, axle work etc. However, truck mai_ntn
has been poor since 1991 due to lack of foreign cre    required topud spare parts
from Russian and Bela m   cts. In 1991 and 1992, some replacement parts were
acquired on a barter basis. Since December 1992, this trade has prccally come to a hal.

as the Russian Government discourages private barter in an attempt to curb tax evasion and
the export of still subsidized products.
Organiztion
2.41        Before privatzation began in 1991, the public trucking industry consisted
of 43 large carriers (wich also offered bus services), all reporting to the then Ministry of
Roads, Transport and Communications, now MID. Thirteen of them were based in
Ulabaatar and the remainder in the aimaks  rovinces). The carris  in Ulaanbaatar
handled a significant share of total intercity freight; carriers based in the aimaks provided
both cargo hauling and passenger tansport services (see Annex).
2.42        As part of its privation efort, the Government first divided the large
carriers into bus and trucking component units and subsequently into two or more mediim-
scale carriers. The resulting road freight transport structure includes several segments:
(a) six large (with 100 or more trucks each) for-hire long-haul camers located in
Ulaanbaatar and controlled by MID; (b) medium-size, for-hire carriers, primarily
concerned with local freight distribution within the aimak, based in the aimaks and
reporting to the aimak authorities; (c) small-scale 'own-account carriers, which were
formnerly affiliated with agricultual cooperatives, manufictuing and distribution
companies; and (d) small-scale, for-hire cariers-the new private entrants into the market.
It is estimated that currently 80 percent of the commercial trucldng fleet is in companies
that are either fully privaized or where the private sector owns at least 49 percent of the
equity. A small private freight brokerage company and swveal freight fowarding
companies have recently emerged.
2.43        MID has also control over severl units that provide essential support
serices to the trucinag industry (the Fuel Supply Company, AVTODMPORT for spare
parts, and the Trade and Supply Exchange-TSE). In 1992, ISE became a Government
agency and adjunct of MI; prior to 1992, TSE's predecessor agency was located within
MID. The current TSE (with 150 employees) has expanded its services-from load
management and filling empty return trips between Ulaanbaatar and other cities-to motor
carriers to include: (a) prement and distribution of fuel purchased from the Fuel
Supply Company; 0) financi  of freight charges and management of credit relations
between carriers and state-owned distribution companies (shippers); (c) maintenance and
rpair serices in certain territories; (d) development and publication of a general
commodities reference tariff; and (e) development of service contact terms on behalf of
the large, state-owned distribution companies. The role of these support units and their
rlationship to MID will be examined by the Policy Advisor to be financed under the
proposed project.

2.44        The taffic that suports the trucidng industry has substally eroded,
except for the informal tading of import and wxport products with Russia and China,
during the past three yeas from the peak levels in 1989. Official sscs fumnished by



- 16-
MID indicate that the ton-kn carried declined from 1,960.6 million ton-km in 1989 to
roughly 555.2 million ton-kn in 1992. Over the sane period, domesdc highway fieight
fell from 40.48 million tons in 1989 to 23.66 million tons in 1991 and eportedly to
roughly 6.33 million tons in 1992. lhese data exclude military traffic. The declne in
demand is principally due to a sharp dechne in movement of constuction goods. Traffic
data on informal trading is absent.
2.45        Traffic began to increase in fte third quarter of 1A93 following an upsuge
in economic activity and good harvests of wheat and hay. Official statiscs are not
available, but the traffic growih is cited by the management of several motor carrie, the
TSE and evidenced by the increased volume and diversity of imported goods in hard-
curency stores. Ihe privatiaion of trucking and the development of new markets served
by road transport wil likdly result in increaing amounts of tcking taffic going
unrecorded i offia statscs.
2.46        The dechne in demand for road freight serces in recent years has been
accompanied by a decline in capacity supply; between 20 and 30 percent of the tucking
fleet is out of operation for lack of spare parts.
Problems
2.47        The road freight services industry faces the following problems:
(a)   Lack of effective compeftiton because (i) the six large stat-owned tcking
firms continue to dominate the market segments that they served under the
centrally planned economy; and (ii) support seces to the trucing
companies are controlled by MID;
(b)   Limited manageril and operational sklcls, needed in the emeging
market-based economy, in the motor carrier companies.
Ihe trucdkng subproject in the proposed prqect wil address tie key problems acing this
industy.

Netwolt
2.48        Roads in Mongolia (see Table 6) are classified as:
(a)   wstW  roads, connecting Ulaanbaatar with the two other major cities
(Darhan and Erdenet), and with the 18 aimab;
(b) 'local' roads, connecting the centers of aimaks with centers of somons; and



- 17-
(c)   UnmteraI  roads, comectng centers of sormns with Se farms and
agocultual and industi enterprises.
2.49         The paved road system is in good condition, with te excepton of localzed
and generally short lengths in need of urgent repair. ITe disuessed sections are typically
in cuttings, where lack of attention to drainge, particularly the side drainage, has led to
watrlogged pavement structures-a recipe for failure in any conditions, but parcularly
so in the frezing weather of Mongolia. In addition, it is understood that a bacldog of
maintenance is caused by a shortage of bitumen./
Orpnizton
2.50         The Road Department is one of four departments within MID. It comprises
departmental (headquarters) staffing, and a number of offices," nominally privatized
constrction units, maintenance uiits, a research and development institution and a
technical school.  Ihe detment struc    allows for a Director General and 10
professional positions (all enginees and economists), which cover  (a) policy, including
privatizaion  policy; (b) pamming and budgeting road activities (constucon,
maintenance); (c) funding road actives (specifically mangement of the road fund);
(d) resarch and new technology; (e) bridge engineerng; and (f) maintenance opeations.
2.51         Consucton. Contruction works are not carried out trough competiton
and bidding; rather, the nominally ptivatized road and bridge consruction companies are
assigned work. For stae roads, MID awards contracts and supevies the work; for loci
roads, MID awards the contracts, aimak units execute the work and the Ministry
supeises; for nahtua roads the work is done by force account. Output of the consucton
units is modest and of below average quality. In 1992, for example, new constuction
toted three bidges and 20 to 25 km of new road (a few km of gavel but mostly earth).
There were no paving works in 1992 because of a shrtage of bitumen; development of
the indigenous rock asphalt is not yet at the point where this material could be used for
large-scale paving.
2.52         Ma      a   is carried out almost exclusively by MID units.7I These
units, on average, have 40 to 50 staff, including the director, engineer, economist,
accountant, technicians/drivers, mechanics, road and seasonal workers. Nominaly, the
ßI  Survival of to pveme  has been hlped by tho fact that many actos (f example, t cement

mventory of maintenance equipment is ample, given the relatively modest size of hie
network. There are, for example, 24 pavers that Mongolia has acquired over the year,
- ough to pave and maintain all the highways in a state/province of a developed country.
Shortage of fori  currency, however, resulted in lack of spare parts to repair
maintenance equipment and in defering of  tenance. Consuction and maintenance
are funded from the Road Fnud (Table 7), which is managed by MID and was established
in 1991 (pama. 4.13).
Traic
2.53        A spot count ornized by ADB staff and  kn  countywide by MID
personnel shows that significant traffic occurs mainly M the vinty of Ulanbaatar, west
and northwards, with the only other significant activity near Hovd in the far west. All
counts indicate modest levels of traffic. It should be emphasized, however, that the counts
were taken over a very limited period.
Problems
2.54        The problems facing MID are:
(a)   OperationaL MI) lacks the means, in terms of both staff capability and
procedures, for rational planning of road consuction and maintenance.
The maintenance program is reactive rather than proactie, and litde
preventative maintenance is caried out. Large potholes and strucrally
failed sections on paved roads need urgently to be reaired.
(b)   Physlal: While the inventory of road mainteance equipment is lge, it
is scattered throughout the country and will never move again without
repairs; in addition, drainage maintenance and laboraty equipment are
lacking.
(c)    ltuonal  the Road Department in MID does not have a clea
understanding of the appropriate role of a road authority in a market
economy, and snecfically in terms of policy and regulatory maters,
planning and budgeting, design, procurement of works, goods and senrices,
construction and supervision, operations and maintenance. in general, it
lacks a clear undersnding of the future role of the public and private
sectors in the area of construction, maintenance and administration of the
road system.
The proposed project will provide assistance in roads, but will focus on the most urgent
needs only.

3. I  PROJECT
A. PRojEcT FORMAON AND PREPARAToN
3.1         Mongolia became a member of the World Bank in February 1991.
Discussions between the Mongolian Government and Bank Management idendfied, among
others, the transportt, energy and agicultual sectors to be in urgent need of attention.
3.2         The project was prepared by Bank Group staff, complemented by
consultants, in collaboration with Mongolian Govemment institutions, ommcial banks
and privatized trucking companies. The proect has been designed to complement the
effar of other donors active in Mongolha. Hence, it excludes the aviaton sctor (where
ADB is active); deals relatvey little with the highway sector (where ADB is preparing a
Road Master Plan Study); and includes railway investments not covered by OECF
assistance (para. 2.14).
B. RATIONALE FOR IMA INVoLvEMENr iN PRoposED PRtojEC
3.3         The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Staegy
presented to the Board in October 1993 and takes into account the subsequent discussion
of stategic options for Mongolia's development. The stategy being followed by IDA
centers on asssting the country in: (a) creating the institutions required by its passage
fiom a planned to a market economy; (b) designing appropriate policies in key sectors; (c)
meeting its critical, medium-term sectoral import needs; and (d) spplemenig biatera
and multil   donors' aid, initally through quick-disbursing assstance to be followed
by conventional invetment opons such as the proosed project. The selecon of the
transport sector as a sarting point for IDA investmet assstance is most relevant because
of: (i) Mongolia's limited tAnsport infrasttur (ii) its geographical isolation, (iii) the
sector's vital role in supporting the restart of the economy and notably the improving
otS, (iv) the curt precarious conditon of he tanwsport system followig years
without adequate maintenance and new investments after the loss of support from the
forme Soviet Union, (v) the nessity to complement investments in the transport sctor
by other donors, and (vi) the sector offering an opporunity for micosectoral development
in privatization of the trucldng industry. In this context, and bearing in mind other ongo-
ing and planned donor activity in Mongolia, the project would be supportive of Mongolia's
insdtutional development and industrial restrcuring efforts through measures targeted
twward four key subsectors (see project description) of Mongolia's land tansport industry.
The expected improvements in transport sees would help Goement's efforts to
restore industrial efficiency and facilitate export diversification, as well as help maintain
essential public sevices, such as heating, power and urban transport in the capital cit,
Ulanbaatar, and also reduce, albeit slightly, environmental degradation of air.



-20 -
3.4         The proposed project draws and builds on the exeience gained through the
ERC (Credit 2320-MOG), which also fimanced the purchase of cmbles (such as te
and bitumen) for the tranport sector. Experience under the ERC, now almost fully di-
bursed, confirmed the utlity of technical assstance in puement, the advanta  of a
well-prepared procurement plan and monitoring system, and the need to ensure that local
curncy counterpart funds are available when project-financed goods and seices are
received. Another important lesson was that timely implementation of technical assstance
is crucial to secure the expected positive impact of some of the components.
C. ftozEcr OBJ0[VES
3.5         The proposed project would address some of the key constraints (see para.
2.12) in the transport sector, particularly by:
(a)   reversing the decline of the quality and quantity of tansport services in
railways, urban transport, trucking and roads;
(b)   strengthening sectoral institutional capacity; and
(c)   contributing to macoecmnomic reforms through complementary measures
at the sectora level, such as the implementationoa transport sector policy
and promotion of the owner-operator concept in the truclkng subproject.
D. PROJECT DRSCRIMON
3.6         The project consists of four sectomal subprojects (railways, urban trnsort,
road freight services and roads), each with a physical and technical assistance component,
and sector policy and project implementation support. It would focus on: (a) rehilitation
of the transport fleet in railways, urb  transwort and trucking; (b) rehabilitation of paved
roads; (c) preparation for restruuring of selected transport enterprises; and (d) policy
advice, technical assistance and tining to related sectoral agencies and private trucking
operators. The proposed technical assistance has as its objective to prepare and implement
action plans that have been developed for the railways, urban transport, road freight
transport, and roads subprojects, and for the transport sector (action plan guideln  are
given in Annex).
Railways Subproject
3.7         Physal Component. The railways physical component compises the
following six items: (a) major overhaul of 24 locomotives; (b) spare parts for locomotives;
(c) spare parts for freight wagons; (d) conversion of wooden feight wagons to steel
bodies; (e) spare parts for passenger coaches; and (f) workshop equipment.
(a)   Major overhaul of locomotives, and spare parts for locomotves.
Maintenance of locomotives currently requires: (i) the import of all spare
parts (even nuts, bolts, filters, gaskets, etc.) from Russia; (ii) the periodi



-21 -
ovehaul of locomotives (due after 720,000 km and 1,200,000 kn) in the
Ukraine; and (in) repai to cri    asemblies (wheel sets, electric motws,
relays, etc.) in Russia, all to be paid for in hard currency.
Shortge of foreign excange since 1991 resulted in: (i) a baddog in
replacments of fagued and worn-out pms; (ii) a backlog in repairs of
damaged assemblies and locomotives; and (iii) failure to send locomotives
to the Ukraine manu s' repair shops on time for major ovedLra.
This siuation has resuted in an increase in faiures of main-line
locomodtves duing opetion, deeioon in pefomce and a high
downtime of locomotives (58 percent in 1992). Locomotives that are
rning are doing so through  ib       because, since 1992, MR has
only been able to import 4 percent of its annual requirement of spare parts.
The bacldog of overhauling of locomotives is rising. bstead of the normal
annual 10 to 15 locomotive overhauls, 10 were sent to the Ukraine in 1990,
and 9 each in 1991 and 1992. The proposed financing of the maj7or
overhau of 24 locomotives in 1995 to 1997 would help to reduce the
backlog.
(b)   Spare pars for frei*t wagons. The freight wagon fleet has deficiencies
resulting from an acute shortage of spare parts for couplers, door locks, air
brks, and funds for repairs for wheels and mainteace of wagons.
(c)   Conversion of wooden freight wagon bodies to stedebodies. Of the 1,149
open wagons that form a majority of the total fleet (1,813 wagons), 421 are
wooden bodied wagons that are prone to mag while being mechanially
loaded and unlaed with coal. Each empty tranaing at the coal mi
is carefuly inspected, and damaged wagons have to be Waken out of the tain
set, causing delays in the tunaround cycle. The most cost-effctve way to
alev    the problem is to replace the wooden side walls and doors with
steel plates. Tbe conversion woud be carried out in a MR workshop,
which has expience with this type of worL
(d)   Spare parts for pasenger coaches. The passenger coach fleet suffers
similar problems as the locomotive and freight wagon fleets, although to a
lesser extent because of less complex equipment. A shortfall of 40 coaches
is resulting in shorter passenger trains and overcrowding. Spare parts in
short supply are: shock absorbers, brake equipment and coach fittings
including locks.
(e)   Workshop equipment. MR's workshops were not desgned for major
overauls of tracton and rolling stock or their   es. Since such
repairs must be camied out by foreign contacto  and paid for with scare
foreg  xchmge, assemblies requiring rea have acmulated, epecially
faulty wheels. The proposed purchase of a flange-weding machine and
ulftsonic flaw detector and magnaflux equipment focuses on the reducto



- 22 -
of foreign repairs of wheel sets. The flange welding machine would add
material to the wheel rim, thus allowing more reproofings and, theefore,
prolong the life of wheels; ultrasonic flaw detectors and magnaflux
equipment would reveal serious flaws in the axles.
3.8         Technical Assistance. The Railways Action Plan consists of: (a) improving
MR's coal transport and its related costs; 0b) improving MR's financial operations; and
(c) formulating options for MR's restructuring. In the context of a frmework established
by the Action Plan, a program of technical assistance and training would be carried out as
folows:
(a)   A study of MR's coal transportation functions and related costs (Coal
Study). Tbis study would complement the coal pncing study (which focuses
on coal production costs and prices) funded under the Economic Transition
Support Project (Credit 2551-MOG) and should take its finding and
recommendations into account. The objectives of the study would be to
analyze MR"s coal transportation activities; the assets and staff involved;
and the cost attributable to each step of the coal transportation; and
(b)   A follow-up study in two phases: the preparation of a multiyear business
plan and multiyear cash flow plan for MR in a first phase, and the
development of restructuring options for MR in a second phase. The
findings of the Coal Study would be used as a model to assess MR's general
operating cost structure and would be an inplit in the preparation of the
business and cash flow plans. These plans would be the groundwork for the
proposals on how to restructure MR. This proposal should be speciAc to
the characteristics of MR, and the charcteristics of the econ,mic and
political environment in which it operates.
Summary tenns of reference for the Coal Study and the Business Plan and Restrucrn
Options are given in Annex 6. (Detailed terms of reference for this and the other
subprojects and for the tranwsport sector are in the proqect file.)
Urban Transport Subproject
3.9         Physical Component. This component comprises the purchase of new
vehicles and spare parts, aimed to reverse the detenoration of fleet capacity over the last
three years. The proposed investment will meet cntical needs but will represent no fleet
expansion over earlier conditions.
(a)   Purchase of new vehicles (50 buses and 10 trolleybuses) would result in an
urban transport fleet of 492 vehicles and return average daily vehicle
loadings from the current levels of above 2,500 passengers per vehidcle per
day to 1,800 passengers per vehicle per day, by 1998.



-23 -
O)   Spar parts, estimated to be required for a period of three years, would be
purchased for buses and trolleybuses. Distribution of the spare parts among
vehicle types (per year) would be: trolleybuses ($1.2 million), Karossa
buses ($1.1 million) and Liaz buses ($0.8 million).
3.10        Technical Assista. The Urban Transport Action Plan focuses on:
(a) establishing a policy framework for the planning, pricing and financing of urban
transport services (see Annex ; (b) improving urban transport operations and financial
management, including developing operating guidelines; and (c) improving maintenance
of urban transport equipment. An urban transport drft policy statement is in Annex 5.
ITe program of technical assistance and taining would aim to achieve:
(a)   Complete devolution of the institutional responsibility for urban passenger
services to the Municipality. This process is already parally under way in
Ulaanbaatar, but the DUT personnel responsible for urban transport require
asistance to acquire the skldls and systems necessary to operate an effecttve
passenger transport unit and procure services cost effectively. Consultants
would be appointed to provide technical assistance and training in
developing these skills and systems within DUT;
0) Institutional separation of the grant-supported urban transport operators in
Ulaanbaatar from DUT, the agency responsible for disbursement of the
trsport subsidy. It is the intention of the Govemment of Mongolia to
achieve this by restructuring of the opeating companies and through the
introduction of operaing guidelines between the Municipality and the
opeators. These guidelines, with performance targets, coupled with
measures to make subsidies transparent, will be a key aspect of reforming
urban transport. At negotations, an initial simplified version of these
guidelines for 1995 was submitted to IDA by MID. It was agreed that IDA
would review the guidelines and that these operating guidelines would be
finalized during the forthcoming supervision mission to Mongolia. In a first
stage, and untl economic conditions in Ulaanbaatar improve and allow tariff
increases in real terms, such guidelines will help reduce subsidies through
lowering operating costs and enhancing efficiency of revenue collection.
The technical assistance to the operators would improve the ability of the
opeators to meet the service performance targets to be introduced in the
revised guidelines between the Municipality and them. Technical assistance
would include aid to implement operator restructuring; improved
maintenance systems, sevice efficiency improvements; revenue-collection
improvements; marketing and finance skills, and managerial training.
Summary terms of reference for the technical assistance are given in Annex 6. Agreemnt
was rached with the Government at negotations tha MID would cause the Uaabaar
MwdcpaUly (UM), by Novemr 30 every year starting i 1994, to establish operatng
gfdde , including perfomance targets satifactory to the Associaton, for operadng bus
and tilkeybus companies owned and/or managed by UM.

Road Feight Transport Subproject
3.11        The road freight subproject, through a physical investment component and
a technical assance component, aims at assisting the Govenment in rebuilding the
truckdng sctor in line with its policy of privatzing the sector. The anticipated impacts of
implementing the subproject include: (a) reducing attrition in the trucking fleet;
(b) promoting the individual opsator concept; (c) stimulating price competition; (d)
improving liquidity of motor carriers; (e) promoting financial intermediation in Mongolia;
(f) aiding rectly privatzed large motor cariers to become financially independent and
effectively compedtive entprises and (g) improving manager  and logistics skills of
motor carriers' management (see pam. 3.13 for details on (a) to (e) and para. 3.15 for
details on (f) and (g).
3.12        The physical component would be implemented through the Mongol Bank
(MB), participating commercial banks (PCBs), motor canriers and individual operators.
It would involve onlending from: (a) the Government to MB; (b) MB to PCBs; and
(c) PCBs to the motor cariers, which would repair nonfunctional trucks. In addition,
PCBs would provide loans to individual operators to purchase repaired trucks from the
motor carriers. The onlending process and terms, the criteria for selection of PCBs, motor
cariers and vehicles to be repaired (which were agreed upon between the Goverment and
IDA) are descrid in Annx 3-
3.13        Phycal Component. The road freight trspor physical component has
as objectives to restore nonfunctonal trucks, currently held by large, former state-owned
motor carriers, and to develop owner-operator senice. The anticipated effects of this
component are list  below.
(a)   Reducng Attrition In the Trucking Fleet: currently there are about
23,000 registred trucks in Mongolia; the annual attrition is estimated at
3,000 trucks. The project would allow to gradually reach repair levels and
reun  to service 130 to 260 trucks annually (assuming that truck
rehabilitation would cost $7,500 to $15,000 per truck). It would restore
hauling capacity that is needed for distributing critical commodities (such
as meat and hay) in the Mongolian economy and for export to Russia and
Chia.
(b)   Promoting the Owner-Operator Concept: would take place through the
sale of repaired trucks from motor carriers to individuals. To stimulate sale
of nonfunctional or underutilized trucks to individuals, MID intends to
prepare a report on the adequacy of the current annual tax on trucks and
make recommendations, if needed, on changes in this tax.
(c)   Stilating Price Competition: tucing efterises are currtly subject
to Little price competition and the industry continues to opeate as a cartel.
State-owned enteise traffc is 'aportioned' by the TSE to large cariers;
the TSE also publs gidelin for tar. The truck rehabilitat



- 25 -
subproject would intmduce pressure into the market to set prces based on
demand and supply of trucldng services.
(d)   Inproving Motor Caniers' iquidity: motor carrier are currently
iUiquid because demand for services for most carriers has declined moe
rapidly than costs, and stawt-owi  enterprises fail to pay their bills to
shippers (i.e., motor carriers) in a timely fashion. The main assets that
motor carriers can turn into cash are their trucks. Te truck eabin
component of the proposed project would prvide motor ca    a chance
to convert their excess tru   into cash.
(e)   Promoting Finanl               :   PCBs would gain addidonal
cxperience in developing  ionships with customers, extending and
colecting loans.
3.14       At negotiatons, agreem     was reaced with the Govnent and MB, as
appropriae, that they will:
(a)   G) prepare a report on the adequacy of the cuvt  annul tax on tnxck;
rii) by June 30, 1995, funush the report to and discuss the resus and
recmmendadons thereof with the Associaon, and Ciii) thereqfter, take
appropriate steps to implemenr the reconmendations in a manner
sadgactory to the Association,
)b)  select PCBs forpartcpaton in the implmtation of roadfright transport
subprojects in conulaion and in accoAmce with cria agreed with the
iA dadow,
(c)  in conulaton wih the Associon, sekct motor can1ersfor rhabditon
of their out-of-service tcs  in accorance with criteia agreed with the
Assocadon and keep records, sadsfactory to the Assocdation, of ls for
tmck rehabilttion made by PCBs to the motor carriers;
(d)   onrend the proceeds of the Subsidiary Crd to PCBs uder FPing
Agreemes to be entered into between MB and the PCs, under tenms and
conditions satifactory to the Associaon,
(e)   cause PCBs tofiurther onlend the proceeds of each Subsidiary Cedit to the
motor camers wtder Subsidiary Fiancig Agreem     to be eaed bno
between PCBs and the nwtor camers, under terms and conditions
satsfactory to the Association.
3.15        Technical Asstnce.   The Road Freight Acton Plan, thrugh
de-onstration projects and development of human resources, would: (a) aid reetly
priatd  large motor aiers to become financialy indepnt and effectvely



-26-
competitive enterprises and (b) impre managenial and logistics skills of motor cartier'
management. 
(a)   Demonsaon projects. Exte  management consultants would develop
a business strategy and a business pln for three motor cariers (one that is
49 percent privately owned and the others that are 100 pent pnvately
owned), to be used as models for the rest of the industry. The three
caiers, which represnt a good cross-section of the recently privaized
tansport enterpnses, were selected using the followng cnteria:
(i) demonstrated disappointing financial and business development
performance since full or partial privatzation;
(ii) are of criti  impoltnce to the funioning of the Mongolian
economy (i.e., handle essential commodities and support production
and distribution actvities, which are strategically impotn to the
natonal interest) and for that reason continue to be supported by soft
loans from the Govemment; and
(iii) are willing to act on recommendations emerging from the statgy
and business plan.
Summary terms of reference for the business stategy and plan are gin in
Annex. At negoaxions, agrem t was reached with the Gowvenmnt ta
it wil (a) by Novmber 15, 1995, prepare a business plkmfor selected motor
cawers in accordmace wth tenns of rference agreed with the Ansocato
(b) thereer iemetn the plan in a manner sat4faory to dse
Assocation  (c) by November 15, 1996, take acdtons, agred with die
Association, to further pivaze Motor Carrier No. 1; and (d) dsmnate
iWfomation about the business plan to other notor carers as  qired by
the Associadon.
(b)   Development of Human Reore consists of:
(i) development of a three-week course to improve managerial skills of
members of the boards of motor carriers, and address the fiduciary
responsibiliies of board members, the role of the bord in
overseing carriers' management and in key stategic decisions that
affect the interests of shareholdes; and
(Tn) development of an eight-week curricuum to train motor caer
managers in making, sales management, financial management
The training woud be provided through the Tansportaion Engineering
institute in Ulaanbaatar, which has committed to offer professional

3.16        PhysIc  Component. The physical component includes the purchase of:
(a) 1,000 tons of bitumen; (b) maintenance equipment; (c) computers, printers and
software; and (d) laboratory equipment.
(a)   Btuen. Although bitunen has been supplied under IDA's Bconomic
Rehabilittion P  m, shotges wIlU liMely occur agan in 1995 and later
because bitum  has to be imported and paid for in foreign currency. The
proposed supply would allow for repair of short, severely damaged secdons
Of the paved roads dudng 1995 to 1998.
(b)   M tanc equipment would include       parts for existing machinery,
traor-mounted excavators, small compaction equipment, trails for
tanspordng hot bitumen for spot repairs (tageted to facilitate spot repars
in bituminous pavements) and mechanical excavators (to encourage
maintenance of drains and berms).
(c)   Computers, pnters and software for each Road Maintennce Company
to fciltate preparation of an inventory of priritied maintenance needs, as
wel as the development of a more solid finacil managemet base.
(d)   Laboratory equipment woud be provided for a network of 10 smal
maters testig laboies, including the cental laboraory AVTOZAM.
Basic equipment woud include glass lab equpment, equipment to test
granular mateials for sealed and unseaed roads, and equipment for testing
aphalt quality.
3.17        Technicl Asssne. The Roads Action Plan focuses on: (a) developng
specificaons and instructions for sealed roads; (b) developing training matials for Usting
laboratories; (c) collecting basic data for prioritizing maintenance activities; (d) preparing
maintenance requirements budgets; (e) developing accounting and buess mt
practics; and (f) developing standards of maintennce for unsealed roads. The technical
assisance and trning aim at implementng the acton plan and they would complement
the acqutin of maintenance and laboray equipment under the subproject's physical
component; moreover, it would be amed at all levels (MID, design institutes in
laalbutar, road mainteance companies), but with particular emphasis on the road
maintenance companies. To implement the objectives, the following steps would need to
be undertake.
(a)   prepare repair and maineance stadards for sealed roads, and provie
formal and on-the-job trning in their application;

3.18        MID's Sector Policy Action Plan focuses on: (a) defiing MID's role,
adaptin govnment policy objecdves and institutional responsibilities in the tansport
sector to the needs of transition to a market economy; (b) adopting transport regulations
that promote equitable compettion among transport modes, help to develop small- and
medium-size private transport oeators, and promote safe and environmentally a ble
tanspt operations; (c) reducing price dislortions in the trsport sector; (d) developing
the transport component of the public sectr investment progam; and (e) modifying
existng  transportaion  procurement procedures for strategic commodities and
recommending appropriate market-oriented methods to meet requirements.  This
oomponent would include:
(a)   Advlsors. The Project Implementation Advisor wod assit MI), the
Ministry of Trde and Industry MTI  and beneficiary agencies with the

3.19        The project is estmated to cost $36.7 million equivalnt, including phycd
and prce contnge . A Project Cost Summaty is presented in Table 3.1; full details
are given in Table 8. The foreign exchange costs of the project are estmated at $30.0
milion equivalent, representing about 82 percent of the project cost. Base costs are
estiated in January 1994 prices. Loca  costs are expessed in US dollars only becue
te are unprdicale for the ime when they will oocur if exrssed in Tugrk, because
of highfinflation. Physical contingencies are calculated at 10 pecent of the base costs of
works and equipment (20 percent for the subproject compising conversion of wooden
feight wagons). Prce contingencies have been calclated both for foeign and local costs,
expressed in US dolls in accordance with BankfIDA guidelines, for each year 1994
through 1998, as follows: 3.4, 2.9, 3.0, 2.7, and 2.7 percent. Identfiable taxes and
duties amount to $4.7 million equivalent.
3.20        Costs of ovahaul of locomotives, and reoabilitatin of buses and
trolleybuses are estmated on the basis of unit costs of similar works carried out in 1992.
Unit costs for buses and trolleybuses are estimated on the basis of recent quotio
obtained by UM and of purchases in neighboring countries. Costs of spare parts are based
on curent Lst prices, and workshop equipment on current world market prces. Costs for
the truck rehabilitation component are based on an esfimate of $7,500 to $15,000 per truck
to be rehilitted. Costs of spot imprvements of eisig paved roads are based on
current local pices and world market prices for goods to be imported. The costs for
152 person-months (p/m) of tecal assistance, ttaining and stues are based on current
avr    fees per month in Mongolia and on current costs for travel, subsistence,
interrtes, drivers and equipment to be suppled and left in the country. The proposed
proect, with the exption of tchnical assistmce, taining, and sdies, is not eempt from
import taxes and customs duties.

3.23        MID would be rponsible for overall management, admion and
coordination of the project and would form a project management unit with full-time staff,
agiste in these mas by a Project Implementaton Advisor, funded under the proposed
proect. For this purpose, MID established a Steeing Group, chaired by a senior staff of
MID, and comprising a representative of MTI, MOP, MR, UM, MB and PCBs. The
Steering Group had its opeing meeting in February 1994 and will meet periodically to
execute its functions.
3.24        After completion of conul agements, locomotives woud be seat
to the Ukraine for their maijor overhau. Spare pars for locomotives, freight wagons and
coaches would be used in MR's workshops in Ulaanbaatar and Zuunkhaa during three
years following delivery. The conversion of 421 freight wagons to steel bodies would be
caried out in MR's workshp in Angolan near Ulaanbatar, which is qualified for this
type of work, at a rate of three wagons per week. The conversion of the wagons is
planned to be completed in the second quarter of 1998. Workshop equipment would be
instled in the Ulaanbaatar and Zuunkhara worlkhops by MR's own workforce, which is
still asisted by Russimn engineers.
3.25        UM would be the xecuting agency for the urban tansport subprojecL The
new buses and trolleybuses would be purchased as soon as possible and added to the fleets
of Bus Company No. 1, Bus Company No. 2, and the Trolleybus Company. These
companies would also receive spare parts for maintenance of the eisting fleet in 1995 to
1997.
3.26        MB would implem - t the road freight subproject through two commerl
bank and motor ca s.

3.27        MID would be the executing agenc  for the road  ubrecL   As
maintenance is canied out almost xclusively by MID units, bitume to be financed under
the project would be supplied for the repair of loclzed and short-length spots of paved
roads during 1995 to 1998. MIis type of works depends beavily on weather conditos
Spare parts for existng maintenmce equpment would be provided to MID for distributin
to its maintenance units in the aimaks. Basic laboatory equipment would be purchased
for 10 smal mateials-testing laboratories and the central laboraty. Computs, printers
and software would be purchased for each Road Maintenance Company.
3.28        Procurement of goods, to be caried out under international compedtive
bidding (ICB), Inteonal Shopping and Direct Contacting, would be handled by MTL
For contrcts ur Intr          Shopping and Direct Contrating up to $2,500 equivalent,
the beneficiay agencies woud use normal commercial channels to the extnt possible, and
carry out pr  ent under the general supervision of MTI. MTI woud also procure the
techiclassistance component ralated to the Project Advisos  AUl other tecica
assistance components of the project would be handled by each benefidary agency, with
asessa    from the ImplementationAdvisor. In implementingteical asstance, priority
woud be given to hire the Transport Plicy Advisor, the Impementatin Advisor and
Wacnical  ance for the railways (starting with the Coal Study) and roads subprojects
when the credit becomes effective. Technl assa    to te urban and road freight
subprjects are scheduled to st in the first quarter of 1995.
3.29        An early st  of techical assistance i the roads subproject is cucial
because of the severe winter that starts end-October. Road mamtemce works need to be
carried out before the strt of winter. Technical asistance to the railways would be sarted
early to fit it in between technical assistance for the coal picing study under the METS
credit and OECF technical asistance.
3.30        General, commercial and technical specifications are now being prepared,
with the assstance of an Inteim Impmentation Advisor ired under previous IDA
prects and aLso available for this project until end-1994)2 to permit completon of the
bidding process for the first year's pement requirement and contact signg when the
credit becomes effective. Impmeni  of the prqject as a whole is estimated to spread
over a period of four and a half years, with a proect completio date of Decmber 31,
1998, and a loan closing date of June 30, 1999. The IU plent   schedule for the

3.34        Goods, such as workshop equipment, steel plates for the conversion of the
bodies of 421 wooden freight wagons, 50 new buses and 10 trolleybuses, road matedal
(bitumen) and maintnance and laboratory equipment for roads would be procured under
ICB, in accordance with the World Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Lan
and IDA Credits dated May 1992. Bank standard douments would be used. The ICB
process would cover seven bid packages for goods valued betwee $100,000 and $2.55
million. In bid evaluation, Mongolian manufactus would be allowed a preferential
margin of 15 percent of the CIF costs of competng imports, or the relevant prevailing
level of customs duties the beneficiary agency would have to pay, if it were not exempt
from import duties and local taxes, wbichever is lower. Sixty percent of spare parts for
rebilitatiorioverhaul of buses and trolleybuses covered by eight bid packages, esmatd
to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount
equivalent to $4.0 million, would be arranged through  terationa Shopping (IS) (price
quotations obtained from at least hee suppliers eligible under the Guidelines). Forty
prcent of spare parts for rehabiliion/overal of buses, up to an aggreg  amount
equivalent to $2.5 million, would be ranged through Direct Conacting (DC). Spare
parts for railway traction and rolling stock would be procured through DC to original
suppliers due to their propnetay nate. The overhaul of locomotives would be cared
out under three technical service contracts esimated at $1.8 million each, up to an
aggregate amount equivalent to $5.4 million, through direct negoaion with suppers.
The rehabiliton and sale of about 520 out-of-service trucks would be camied out under
technical service contracts through direct negotiation with sevices' suppliers. Motor
ariers would request fiDancing to repair trucks from PCBs. PCBs would padage servce
contracts and submit them to MB for financing. All IDA-financed contracts would be
subject to prior review.
3.35        Consulting sevices for instional s ening, teical assistance and
trainn  woud be aried out by quaifed and expeeed cosuants apinted in
accordance with the World Bank Guidines for te Use of Consultants of August 1981.
All documens rlated to purement of casulting survices would be subject to prior
review and approval by the Association.
3.36        MTI would handle prcueent of goods and of the Project Advisors. Al
other technical assistance components of the project would be handled by each beficiary
agency, with assistance from the Implementaton Advisor.

3.37        Disbursements of the IDA credit would cover the:
(a) Railways subproject: 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the C]F
costs of imported goods and servces, and 100 percent of consultants'
services and training;

(e)   Sector polcy and project   pmtia          technical componet:
100 percent of consultants' sevices and tainig.
Domesic tansport costs from the border or fctory, which are provided for as part of the
local costs of the project, would not be eigible for IDA financing.
3.38        A Schedule of Disbursements is given In Table 10. Sectoral disburt
pofils for Mongolia are not available, the project being the firt DAassid tsp
project in the country. Therefore, the China ansor disursement profile was used as
a rrence. However, te urgent need for ovehaus, rehabi      and spareprt req
procurement of about 70 percent of the total foreign costs as soon as possile, resutng in
an atypical concan of disbursemenduring the fint two years. Auming an
mplementtion perod of four and a half years, the proposed credit would be fuly
disused by Dember 31, 1998.
3.39        During  5Ap   , the Government confirmed that:
(a)   aUl disbursements except for the track  abilon subproject would be
done by direct payment to suppliers of goods and services. MID would be
resonsible for sending to the Association all witrawal appications for
funds. Dsbursements for the truck   abil   bpoect would be made
through MB; and

would be requred during the implemenion period. A higher frequency of missiou may
be necesary during the project's initial phase due to the inexperience of the user agencies
withi IDA procedures-especially those responsible for procurement. It is esdmated that
over the implementation period of the project, the total time expended on supevision
would be of the order of 67 staff-weeks (able 11) or 15 staff-weeks annually. This
estimate is below the actual expeience of 19 staff-weeks spent annuay on superision
under previous IDA projects in Mongolia. However, previous IDA projects did not fund
an Implementation Advisor to the same extent (14 months) as under this project, nor was
an interim Implementation Advisor stationed in Mongolia before the projects became
effective. The estimate for this project also incotporates staff-week savings epected from
combining supervision of the proposed project with that of missions to China. Details,
such as the format of the quarterly progress reports, would be established at the first ful
superion mission. This format would include parameters for progress monitoig
purposes. Project progress will be monitored against the acdon plans (&An , the
implementation plan (Fable 9) and perfoce indicators in Tables 12 to 14. A Project
Completion Report would be prepared and submitted to the IDA not later than six months
afaer the loan dosing date.
3 ACoUomNG AND AummIG
3.42        MID has confirmed that:
(a)   stg on the effectiveness date of the Credit, with assist     of the
Implementation Advisor, and in acordance with sound accounting practices,
it would maintain separate accounts covering expendihms for the various
elements of the project, and reflecting the contributions from IDA and the
Government;
(b)   project accounts, including stamt of ependitures, would be audited by
independet auditors acceptable to 1DA and that audit rpot would be sent
to IDA for review within six months of the close of each fiscal year.

4. FINANCLAL EVALUATION
A. RAILWAYS
Introduction
4.1         MR's financial pformance  ales 15-17), based on its income stteum
and selected balance sheet items, detrioratd since 1991; was weak in 1993; and is
proected to rmain weak in the immediate fute.
Pat and Present Situation
4.2         MR's deteriorting opatng results (Table 4.1) are due to:
Table 4.1: SuEm   F aCIAL  ICATORS FOt MR La
1991             1992              1993

Profit Margin (%)                 35                 8               -49
LA  The  tos  are undestad because MR defaered repairs and  -
es~.
(a)   a substantial decrease in freight traf:  traffic voblme fe  from 5,088
million ton-Ian in 1990 to 2,998 million ton-km in 1993 (able 18).
03)  large increases in  put pnces [notably for rei and    inte     asing
of freight wagons (see Tables 19-20), fuel] not compensted by increases in
tarffs. For example, since 1991 averge opatig exp     per ton-km
incased by 92 percent, while averae    increased by 5 paeent
Repairs,  tenance, and leasing of frei  wagons are no longer cheaply
available from Russia and have to be paid for in bard cuwrency, fuel pre
doubled in 1993 (from Tug 65 per liter to Tug 130 per liter). Purt ,
40 percent (or 1,100 million ton-kn) of freight caried in 1993 is coal for
which the tarff per ton-km oOvers only 50 percent of costs (Le., a tadff of
Tug 1.60 per ton-km compared to a cost of Tug 3.20 per ton-km);



- 38-
4.3         MR's liquidity in 1991 and 1992 was nil because cash balanca were zero
and receivables ($1.2 million at end-1991; $10.0 million at end-1992) mainly fom cod
mines, which are cash short, are not collectible.
4.4         Implications of Deteriorating Fancdal Perfonnance. MR's deterirtg
financial performance resulted in:
(a)   Deferral of Repairs and aintece. Repairs and maintenamce of roling
stock and track has become a serious problem. Since 1991, about
50 percent (or $2.5 million) of repair and maintenance expenses have been
deferred annually;
(b)    nese   ln Payables. MR is not in a position to pay all of its hard-
currency expenses to Russia. Outstanding payables were $6.1 million at
end-1991; $7.8 million at end-1992; and
(c)   Low Fuel Inventries. MR's fuel reserves were zero as of Septmber 30,
1993 (compared to a fuel reserve target of 4,500 tons or 45 days of needs)
for lack of cash.
Futue Prospects
4.5         Financial projections take into account assitance provided by OECP and
IDA and are based on the assumptions, given in Annex 8. The proected opeatng results,
opeting and profit ratios are given in Table 4.2.
Options to liprove MR's Iandal Situation
4.6         To improve MR's opeatng results and liquidity, actioms will need to be
undertken to increase revenues and reduce costs. Alternatives to improve MR's finacal
stuati  will be examined in the context ofthe coal transportati  study, the praon
of the business plan and the formulation of  uctg options for the wlway. For
example, the coal   o   n         study wi examine the costs and revenues for co
tanort; in the pratin of the business plan, altnative leaig pti  for fright
wagons will be examined. The ultimate objective of improving MR's financial situto
is to achieve full cost recovery (i.e., recovery of capial costs in addion to operto  and
maintenance costs). An inital step during the project durto tward this objective woud
be the implemention of tariff adjustments to meet the full costs of  mop    and
maintnce. At negotadons, agremn  was reahd hatMR and the Goemae wold

saefactory to the Assocation, and (I) take appwprioe steps to implemenw tw
remmedowns of the studes, taking into account the vws thereon of the Associa

not sufficit to keep MR's taction and rolling slock, and tracks in good opea_t

B. URBAN TRANSRT
Present Situation
4.8         Urba transport senrices are heavily subsidized. The controled tariff of
Tug 10 (n effect since mid-June 1993) is a *flat-freu tadff with no dffentdatio for
distance traveled. Repesentaives of the Ulaanbaatar DUT esfimate that the cost per urban
passenger carried is close to Tug 40. The esdmated cost recovery ratios (for oprti
costs and indluding subsidy payments) for the three oprtng companies, based on thidr
income statements (rables 22 and 23) in 1992 were: (a) Bus Companies No. 1 and No.
2, 60 percent; and (b) Trolleybus Company, 100 percent (see Table 21). Current
accounting and financial procedures do not allow to prepare standard financial stments.
Consultants, assisting urban transport operators, will asist the companies in develping
basic cost accounting and opeating statistics, and standard financial statements (see
AnncZc 0.
4.9         Care must also be taken when maldng any inference from the apparently
satisfactory cost recovery ratio for the trolleybus company. The traction current for the
trlleybuses is supplied from within a system that heavily subsidizes both the coal burned
to generate electricity and the actual electricity consumed. In consequence, fuel costs are
only 16 percent of total costs in trolleybus operations wbile, in Bus Companies No. I and
No. 2, fuel costs are 33 and 42 percent, repectively. Full cost-absorption prciples
appied to troLleybus traction power would significantly increase this company's operatng
costs and hence reduce its cost recovery.
Future Prospects and Concusion
4.10        The Govertnment of Mongolia intends to imprve cost recovery levels in
urban transport services through the phased introduction of ineases in passenger trffs
and other measures. Tatiff increases would be combined with increases in passenger
revenues achieved through increased vehicle availability, and inpoved efficiency in
revenue collection procedures. This would increase direct opating income and reduce
the level of subsidy requirements.
4.11        At this time, it is not possible to define precisely either the scale of taiff
increases or the speed of their introduction. In June 1993, the fare in Darhan was Tug 13
per ride compared to Tug 10 in Ulaanbaatar. In Table 24, an example of potential revenue
improvements at different tarff and revenue collection levels has been illustahtd. At
negotiaons, agreent was reached with the Government that uan transportfaresfor
the folowing year ill be adjwed by December 31 every year ommedng In 1994. to
keep pace with biaon, In accordance with afonmuda agreed with the Asociaton
C. ROADS

-41 -
trsport sctw.  before 1991, a tax on vehicles was the source; since 1991 the revenue
is fom the fld tax. Ten percent of the tax on gasoline is eanmarkd for the Road Fund.
4.13       As of Stmber 1993, funds deposited in the Road Fund amounted to
Tug 2.0 billion ($5.0 milLion equivalent). Current practice in MID is to allocate arbitarily
60 percent of available funds to nww construction, 20 percent to maintance (both routine
and periodic), 10 prcent to equipment and 10 percent to training. The 1993 allocation for
maintenne, $1.0 million, ompa  with 34 and 27 percent allocated for maintenance in
1991 and 1992, respeidvely (deails are gim in Table 7). The avaible funds for road

5. PROJECT BNFT
A. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Objectives
5.1         The proposed project would support Mongoia's goals to establish a market-
oriented economy, and would specMically aim to support the country's effort to exp    and
diverify domestic and extena trade. In view of Mongola's large size and landlocked
situation, a well-functioning transport system is an essential condition for succw l trade
development. The project would help rehabilitate the system's physical plant, which has
suffered from hee years with practically no equipment replacement or new investments.
The prosed instutional components and physical investments will help adapt
management of the transport sector and related agencies and enterpris  to the new maret-
oriented economic environent.
Bensand Ben
5.2         The main benefits of the proposed investments would be savings in oeatng
costs for railway and road feight, passenger svices and for urban tavel m l tar
and increased utilizaton of the existing trucking fleet. The physical investments, s d
by the project's technical assistance, will also result in imprvements in quality of services,
efficiency and enhanced safety in all the trsport modes overed by the project. The
proposed railway components will also result in important savings in foreign exchange
through the reduction of sevces contracted abroad, particularly leasing of wagons and
repairs of equipment.
5.3         The benefits of the project's institutional st ing compo , while
not quantifiable, are expected to be significant. They include, notably, m  of
management methods, prepaaton of buiness plans, incrng acotability and
autonomy of transport enteprises and assitng the tansport and central economic
authorities with the design and implementain of tansport sector refrms. In adon,
the truckdng investment component will help create private, owner-operator  ucidng
businesses.
Economi Analys
5.4         The economic evaluation of the project subprojects is based on 1994 prc
for aU costs and benefits, net of taxes. Investment costs are net of price contigencie.
As is the case with all trann  economies where prices are sverely disurted, in some



-43 -
cases it is not possible to assess reliably the costs of local rsurces necessary to quantify
benefits; in such cases, international prices have been adopted.
5.5         Most of the physical components will help reto  exstng assets and wil
mainly reduce costs rather than creating new transport capacity. Under the prent,
transitional economic conditions, it would be difficult to predict economic recovery and
its impact on future transport demand, and therefore only modest taffic increases have
been assumed (the detailed assumptions are given in A=m£X0
Railways Subproject
5.6         Locomotives: Overhaul and Spare Parts. These two subprojects aim at
icreasing the utilization of existing locomotives. These investments will help increase
locomotive availability-which has decreased steadily over the last thiee years and was
only about 58 percent in 1993-and therefore the railways' traction capacity. Without this
investment, locomotive avaiability will continue to decline and some railway traffic would
divert to trucks at higher costs. It is estimated that each available locomotive can carry
106.3 million net ton-km per year. The economic rate of return for this investment is
estimated at 28 percent.
5.7         Freight Wagons and Passenger Coaches: Spare Parts and Convadelon
to Steel Bodis. This investment would alow Mongolian Railways to augment firight
wagon capacity, by repairing existing wagons and reducing wagon damages and
breakdowns that occur to currmnt wooden fames in the transport of coal; it will also
inreas avaability for passenger coaches. The alternative for the railways wold be to
lease wagons from Russia, which are paid in SFr at rates that bave been   led  to
inrease to about six times the 1993 ate by 1998 (from SFr 5.81 per wagon per day to
SFr 32.0 per wagon per day). The savings for MR are substantial, even after t     into
account the additional maintenance costs required by the newly repaired wagons. In the
case of the passenger coaches, the increased availability would reduce overloading and
increase revenues from the increasing number of traders traveling to and from Chia and
Russia. On this basis, the economic rate of return for these subprojects is estimated at
20 percent.
5.8         Workshop Equipment. The main impact of this investment will be to
reduce rpairs made in Russia and paid in foreign exchange, substituting for lower cost and
fa  rezpirs made in Mongolia. The economic rate of return for this component is
estimated at 19 percent.
Urban Transport Subproject
5.9         Spare Parts for Urban Tra     rt Fleet and New Vedes.  Thes
investents aim to reverse the decline in the urban passenge fleet in Ula r, by
incrasing the avaibility levels of the exsting fleet and by finacng essential fleet
renewals. The main benefits of the spare parts will be to restore cacty of the existg
uban tansport fleet though overhaling of broken-down equipment needing major repairs



-44 -
and hough providing the spare parts for caryng out systematic fleet maintenance. The
latter would be expected to substantally increase the operating lives of the fleet. Under
the cunrent planned replacement cycle every five years, about one fifth of the existing fleet
(some 57 buses and 30 trolleybuses) would necessitate replacement every year. This would
require an investment of about $7.5 milion per year. The spares to be provided would
substandaly reduce the need for renewals. For the purposes of the economic evaluation
of the investment in spare paru, it has been consevively estimated that avoided fleet
renewals resulting from the increased availability of exsting vehicles thank to the new
spare parts would amount to 40 percent of the required renewals.
5.10        The rate of return for the spare parts investments, based on the quandfiable
benefits of increased fleet availity and oeatng lves of existing urban tsport fleet
and resulting avoidance of vehicle rwals, is esmed at 16 pecent.
5.11        The roation of urban transport capacit that would be expected from the
new vehicles and the spare parts to be iinanced under the project will also substantially
increase service levels. The project will allow the city of Ulaanbaatar to have an
additional 144 vehicles opeating at peak times (84 released from workshops and 60 new),
which will reduce waiting times and totaljoumey times, an important user-benefit of travel
time saved. In addition, the investments will allow vehicle loadings to be brought down
to a safer level of 1,800 passenger per vehicle per day by 1998. Ihe lower loadings and
the increased vehicle availability will also increase trwport companies' revenues.
5.12        While the service levels benefits can normally be expressed in economic
ms (value of travel and trips time saved and increased net revenues), insufficient data
exist to estimate these benefits through project implementtion.  Also, while the
Govemnment of Mongolia has made a commitmet to im   cost-reovery levels in uban
tansport services thrugh a phased introduction of increases in passenger fas,
complemented with finrase  vehicle availability and improved revenue coecdon
procedures, it is not possible to define either the scale of fre increases or the speed of
their introduction. Thereore, it is not possible to properly detmine the economic rate
of retn of the invem t in new vehicles.
Road Fkeit Transport   project
5.13        Thick Rehabitation. This proect component will put back into service
trucks curently immobilized due to lack of spare puts and will provide additonal
tansport capacity. Some 260 trucks would be expected to be repaired as a minimum
through direct application of project funds. Tis is small compared with the esdmated total
annual replacement needs of 3,000 trucks and will ensure that the rehabilitated truck are
used to full capacity.
5.14        The economic analysis for this investment is based on economic gains at the
national leveL The financial return for trucldng compaes that wiU repa and selltruc
under the project is guaranteed since the companies will be reqWred to present a sales
contract against each truck to be rpaired in their loa application i oder to receive

funding under the project through the intermediary commercial banks. Based, on average,
on a survey of net revenues per available trudc, an estmate of truck repair costs, and a
service life of three years for the rehabilitated trucks, the estimated economic rate of turn
on this investment is 21 percent.
Roads Subproject
S.15        Masenace and Reabtion of Paved Network. This investment will
repar short, severely damaged sections of the Mongolia's paved road network. The
evaluation has been done usig the World Bank's Highway Design and Maintena
Standards Model (HDM-M version), using the HDM Manager module. The basic
hypothesis 's that the proposed project will repair all major potholes over the 1,300 kn of
the country's paved network, and that without this investment the Crrsponding road
sections would continue to deteiorate. Improvement under the project will consist of
(a) patching the smaller potholes and (b) structural rlacement of locized damaged
pavements where patching is not sufficient to repair the damage to the pavement.
5.16        Savings in vehicle opang costs are the quantifiable and main benefits of
this invesnt. Savings in road accident costs, which coiud be significant in Mongolia,
have not been quantfied due to lack of data. Traffic data were obtained from a survey
canied out in the summer 1993, which also provided information on vehice composion
of the traffic. Traffic increases were projected at 2 percent annually during 1995196 and
4 percent thereaftr. Due to lack of reiable data and distorted prices in Mongolia, vehicle
opeaing costs have been based on inteational standards.
5.17        All component costs, including spot improvement, equipment and technical
asistance that will assist in this programn have been considered in the evaluation. On this
basis, the economic rate of return for this component is estimated at 57 percent.
B. ENVIRONMENTAL IMeACrS
5.18        Improvements in the mantenance of locomotives and buses resultng from
the pr¢ect, and the procurement of new urban transport equipment that will employ
modern emission control technology will make a contribution to reducing vehicleinduced
air pollution. Road worki, consisting of repairs of short and most-damaged sectons of
Mongolias paved road network, are not ly to pose any significant risks of adverse
impact on the environment, and do not entail any    Iement fiurthermoe, such repairs
will reduce the risk of traffic accidents. Nevertheess, it was agreed during project
appraisal that, as a precationary measure, the maintenance companies of MID executing
these works will be instucted to follow a Code of Envionmetl Pactice for Road Works
(see AnnL n. Ar negotto, agenen was reacied dw the Borrawr wiU, by
June 30, 1995, adopt and put Infowe a Code of Envronental Practicefor Road Work,
as agreed with the Assocdaon.

C. OvitALL PIOJECr RUVI AND RJsxs
5.19        The project's overall economic rate of retun, based on the weighted avep
of thw individual mponents' retun, is esdmated at 23 pert AU project wmpoents
have first-year retuns above 10 percent, confirming that none of these investments is
p_maue.
5.20        Since practcaly al project investments are intended to rehabilitate existig
assets at low investment costs to meet current demand, the project's economic risk are
minimal. The most important risk is the implemenion of the ucking component, sine
this component involves fincial intermediation that will affect many beneficiarie.
However, the tuck to be repaired under the project are a very small part of truck
replacement needs, and detailed arangemets have been made to ndtigate any rk  elated
to the financial intemediation procedure. These arangemet, which were confirmed at
negotations, are considered satisfactory.

MONGOLIAN RAILWAYS: TRACK STRUCTURE,
SIGNALING AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
CHARACTERSTICS
1.          Trwk SUctnre. The track s etuctu  consists of R 50 rails of Russian
Standard (50 kg/m) except for nearly 210 km in the southern pat and in the eastern part
where it is R 43 rails (43 kg/m). All over wooden sleepers are laid at a density of 1,840
to 2,000 per kn. Crushed stone or a mixatre of sand and pebbles are used as ballast, but
a major portion of the track, partcularly the northern portion, uses a mixtr of sand and
pebbles. The track is laid on a well-formed substrucure and is being used for nning of
freight wagons of up to 23-ton axle load. The track alignment has many sharp curves and
gades. This calls for more intensive track maintenance. There are, however, very few
bridges, culverts and high embanknents.
2.          Signaling and Telecommunicatlons. The signaling system largly consis
of color light signaling, relay interlocking and electrically operated points, and funtos
well. The telecommunication system depends on the telephone circuits through bare wire
lines for communication between fte centrl control and the various stations. The
telephone exchanges used are mosdy outdated of the crossbar type. Addilly,
however, radio communication equipment is insalled on  ocomotives and direct
communicaton from Central/Section dispatce to the locomotives is practced.

ROAD FREIGHIT SUBPROJECT
A. BACKGROUND
1.          OrganizatIon. Befoze privatzation began in 1991, the public trucg
industry consisted of 43 large carers, all reporting to MBD. Thirteen of them were based
in Ullanbaatar and the rmainder in the aimaks provinces). The cafrirs in Ulaanbaatar
handled a significant chare of total intecity freight; carriers based in the aimak provided
both cargo hauling and passenger trnport sevices.
2.          Privatzaton was iniftated in 1991 (Table Al). As part of its privion
effrt, fte Government first divided the large carrie  into bus and trucking compone
units and subequently into two or more medium-scale caiers. By the tird quart of
1993, ownebip of most cariers had been fully or ptaly uansfed from the publc
to the pivate sector. However, the for-hire motor carrier industry remains highly
concantrated and includes following segments: (a) six large (with more than 100 truc
eah) for-hire long-haul caniers conlled by MID; (b) medium-size, for-hire carriers,
pimarily concemed with local freigt distibution within the aimak, based in the aimaks
and reporting to the aimack authorities; (c) small-scale 'own-account' cariers, which wer
fornerly affiliated with agricultural coopatives,  nufacturing and distibution
companes; and (d) small-scale, for-hire carriers-the new private entrants into the madrt
it is estmated that curently 80 perct of the commerial truckdng fleet is in companies
that are either fully privatzed or where the private sector owns at least 49 percn of the
equity. A small private freight brokeage company and severl freight forwarding
companies have recently emerged.
3.          Aside from control over the six large for-hire long-haul carers, MID has
also control ove several units that provide essential support to the trucking industry (the
Fuel Supply Company, AVTOIMPORT for spar parts, and the Trade and Supply
Exchange-TSE). In 1992, TSE became a Government agency and adjunct of MID; pdri
to 1992, TSE's predecessor agency was located within MID. The curent TSE (with 150
employees) has eaned its services-from load management and fing empty return trp
beteen UIlaabaatar and oer cties-to motor carriers to include: (a) p    and
distrbution of fuel purchased from the Fuel Supply Company; (b) financing of freight
charges and management of credit relations between cariers and ste-owned distribution
companies (shppers); (c) maintenance and repair services in certain teritories;
(d) develoment and publication of a general commod   reference tarff; and
(e) development of service contact terms on behalf of the large, statowned distrition
cop_e.

L   Including the six large (with more than 100 trucks each) for-hie long-l!aul caris
controlled by MID. These carriers own 1,197 trucks.
&   Several of the original 46 motor carriers were split into smaler units.
4.          The heavy concentraion in the truckilg sector, MID's control over several
units that provide inputs to the industry and TSE's role contribute to limited competition
in the sector.
5.          Fleet. There are about 23,000 registered trucks in Mongolia in 1993,
97 percent man    d in Russia or Belarus Crable A2). They include primarily two
models (the ZEL-130 and the KRASS). They are gasoline-powered with a hauling capacity
of five tons maximum, and normally oprate in tandem with trailers, also typically of 5-ton
capacity. Twenty percent of the registered trucks are out of operation due to lack of spare
parts C(able A3). The decline in supply capacity has been offset by declines in demand
startng in 1991 and continuing until mid-1993. Traffic growth began to pick up in the
third quarter of 1993. Any major economic rebound would quickly encounter the
constraint of limited road hauling capacity.
6.         Maintenance. Motor carriers in Mongolia operate excessvely large repair
and maintenance facilities, which also serve as parking garages during the severe winters
because they are heated. The facilities are well equipped with tools and machinery for
rebuiding engines, chassis, ransmiions, axle work, etc. However, truck maintenance
has been poor since 1991 due to lack of foreign currency reqwred to purchase spare parts
from Russian and Belarus manufacturs  able A3). In 1991 and 1992, some replacement
par were acquired on a barter base. Since December 1992, this trade has practcally
come to halt as the Russian Government discourages prvae barter in an attempt to curb
ta evasion and the export of still subsdized products.

B. IMEErNTAMION OF THE SUBPROJECr
7.          The road freight subproject consists of a physical component (i.e., the
reston     of nonfional truck, currently held by large, former stat-wned motor
cariers) and a technical assiae  component (i.e., the preparation of a business stategy
and plan for three motor carers, and the development of human resources in motor
carriers).
Phya Compoent
8.          The restoration of nonfunctonal truck would be implementhrough the
MB, mmaeal bank, motor cariers and individual operators. It would involve
onlendi from: (a) the Govenment to MB; (b) MB to PCBs and (c) PCBs to the motor
camers, which would repair nuca   trucks. In addition, the commercial banks
would provide loans to individual operators to purchase repaired trucks from the motor
camers.
9.          Onbudig Aae         s. There would be three onlending agreements:
(a) from the Govenment to MB; (b) from MB to PCBs; and (c) from PCBs to the motor
cariers. The proposed onlending terms for the credit are as follows:
(a)   From the Government to MB, at IDA terms, except for durton which
would be two years. MB would assume the foreign exchange nsk
(b)   From MB to PCBs, at commercial terms (a draft contact between MB and
PCBs is in the project file).

Interest. PCBs shall pay interest at a rate which is one percentage unit
lower than the monthly Base Rate (BR). The BR is equivalent to the
average quoted rate of the five largest commercial banks in the country on
their two-month Tugrik time deposits, for the two months preceding the
issuance of the Special Time Deposit (SID) from MB to PCBs.
Matuity. The maturity of the STD shall be matched with the maturity of
the batch of subloans it is intended to finance subject to the following:
(i) each STD shall have a maturity not exceeding one year, or such
penod that would allow ample tme for PCBs to recover sublos
based on the maturity of the corresponding subloans covered by a
particular SM; and
(ii) MB shall set the maturity of an STD to not more than one month
beyond the maturity of subloans covered by the STD.
Risk. PCBs would assume the commercial risk.



-87 -                         ANNE  3
(c)   From PCBs to the motor cariers, at a intert rate not to exceed the
previous month's Loan Rate: Commercial Los to Private Business Units
(shrt term, less than one year)," as published in MB's monthly sadstical
bulletin. The maturity of each subloan shall be based on tem  of the truck
sales agreement, but shall preferably not exceed one year.
10.         Criteria for Selection of Commercial Banks. On the basis of discussions
with the Government and MB, three PCBs bave been identified as suitable for participating
in the implemetaonof the project They are: (a) Ardyn (Peole's) Bank, (b) Investment
and Technoogical Innovation Bank; and (c) Mongol Horshoo (Coopertive) Bank. A
description and comprehensive assessment of these banks is in the project file. Tne three
banlks are capable of participating in the project as they possess the following basic
features:
(a)   Latest reported financial ratios are substanially in compliance with the
minimum standards set by MB;
(b) Existing portfolio of small loans (less than $5,000) equivalent to at least
20 percent of total loans;
(c)   Past-due ratios on loans (especly tose granted to the pnvate sector) of
not more than 10 percent;
(d)   Basic accoumting and control tems in place, with balance sheet accounts
and rcoding standudized by MB;
(e) Established internal audit system;
(t)   Exercise of the fundametals of project appraisal, credit and chter
checidng on borrowers and collateral valuation;
(g) Exercise of the basic principles of approval levels of authority with full-
service branches, given a level of approval authority to allow decentliz
lending opations; and
(h)   Eper ed bankes at the top and middle management levels.
11.        MB would provide the loans to the commercial banks in installments. The
actu  siz of the installment would be based on the following:
(a)   Number of commercial bank branches with full baning services opeating
in and around Ulaanbaatar;
(b) MBWs assessment of the operational and financial performance of the PCB;



-88-                           A
(c)   The number of motor carriers whom the PCB qualifies and the etmated
financial resources required to repair trucks;
(d)   The PCB's report on the pipeline of loan aplications for truckepa  and
on truck sales (to be fimanced from the lo  from MB to the PCBs) within
a three-month period.
12.         CrteIa for Selecti= of Motor Cariers. PCBs shall prequaf motor
carers for partiipaion the t ng re           program, based on following critia:
(a)   Motor card    sll own fieight hauing truck fleet of 40 or more tucks
and a sgnificant percentge of these trucks (5 percent) wil require repair;
(b)   Motor crier shal have truck repair fities and shall demonstate 
ability to socure parts and  bs  lies ad te to rea  and restore
trucks;
(c)   Motor carriers shall decla  their wilingess and ability, as part of this
program, t  sell trucks from  th   eisting fleet to individuals and
enterises t  may requie repa  and restoation;
(d)   To this end, motor canriers shal advertise in local newspapers and in posted
notices the availability of trudks fr sle;
(e)   Motor cariers will etend to t he purchaser of tuk  a waranty of
workmanship and a guarantee of reliable opention of resred trucks for one
year fom the date of the sale;
(f)   Motor caiers sball agree to use the proceeds of subloans made under this
program only for the repair, restoaon and sale of truck equipmnm
13.         Qualified motor carrers will execute a fomal sals agreement that will be
develped and apoved by the PCB in advance of inividual subloan applications. Sales
agreement will include as a minimum, the following tm  and conditions:
(a)   Identfication of tucks to be sold;
(b) Specific repairs and restoration work to be completed as a condition of the
sale;
(c)   Sale price;
(d)   Closing date for sale, including adeque tme for the completion of aU
necessary repair work;



- 89-                         ANN  3
(e)   Eanet payment from purchaser of 10 percent of the sale price, which wil
be held in an interest-bearing escrow account by the commercial bank and
poceeds from which will be held aganst fina payment at cloing;
(f)   Ackowledgement of the pior claim of the commercial bank against
ownership of the truck(s) and escrowed funds in the case of a sale default
for any reason; and
(g)   Statement of warty and guarantee.
14.         CWterIa for Selectlon of Veices to be Repaired. The slected vehicles
would be based on following criteia:
(a)  loans woud be made only to large caries   with excess equipmet;
(b) loams would be made only for trucks for which a sale contract (between the
motor carier and the individual  eator) exists. The sale contract would
pecify the sale price and the cost of rpairs, as well as the closing of the
sale;
(c)   repair loans would be $15,000 per truck maximum or the esdmated cost of
repairs, whichever is less;
(d)   PCBs will be assigned tide to trucks whose repar they finance whe the
commercial loan is made; banks would trnsfer ttle when the vehicle is sold
to the individual opeator and the full amount of the loan is repaid.
Techdical Assistance
15.        One item of the technical assistance component is the preparaion of a
business ategy and plan for three motor carriers (one that is 49 percent privately owned
and the others that are 100 percent privately owned) to be used as models for the rest of
the industry. The motor camris were selected using the following criteria:
(a)   demonstaed disappinting financial and business development prman
since full or partial pr on;
(b)    are of cridtcd importance to the functoning of the Mongolian economy
(i.e., handle essential commodities and support production and distribution
activites, which are sategically important to the national interest) and for
that reason continue to be supportd by soft loans from the Govemment;
and
(c)   are willing to act on rcommendations emerging from the strategy and
business plan.



-90-                          ANNE 3
16.        The motor carers that were selected, using above critera are Motor Carrer
No. 1, Mongol Diesel (one of the six companie that emerged when the former Motor
Carier No. 27 was brokln up during privaizain) and Motor Cader No. 22. A
desacpon of the motc carrers follows.
17.        Motor Carrier No. 1. Motor Carier No. 1 was founded in 1933 and
pily privadzed (51 percent state ownership and 49 percent ownership by employees
and management) in 1991. The company has a board of eight directors, including the
company's four top mnagers, two repesentatives of MID and two outside diretors.
18.        The carier has 453 employees and operates 310 tank trucks, and 255 tank
truck trailers. The average age of the fleet is 6.5 years and about one third of the carer's
fleet have opeated more an 360,000 km.
19.        The carier moves 60 percent of the fuel consumed in Mongolia. It serves
one customer, the State Fuel Supply Company (which, since 1993, no longer has an
exclusive franchise to merchandise fuel in Mongolia) and one third of the country's total
teitory-the Central Economic Zone. Its longest haul is 1,100 km (from Ulaanbaatar to
the Gobi aimak); the average haul is 320 km. Ulzation of equipment aeaed in 1990
to 1992 86,000 ton-km per year per trucks and 65,000 ton-km per year per trailer.
20.         Since March 1993, trsport prices have been determined in arms length
neotiatios with its customer, the State Fuel Suply Company (which opeates its own
feet of 24 tank trucks). Total revenues for 1993 were estmated at Tug 593 million and
net income after tax at Tug 21 million. Profit is iadequate to justify the purchase of new
equipment to replace the old trucks.
21.         Mongol Diesel. Mongol Diesel is one of six companies that emerged when
the former Motor Carier No. 27 was broken up during privaDzatio. It is 100 percent
privately owned. It has a board of five directors, all senior company managers (who only
own 3 percent of the company's stock). The company expects to choose two outside
director at a future stockholders meeting.
22.         The carier bas 113 employees and 45 trucks. Mongol Diesel trucks are aU
20- and 30-ton (large-capacity) trucks. Originally the cier specialized in hauling heavy
onstruction materials oike its predesor crer No. 27). However, due the economic
recession in construction since 1991, the crier has diversified its bauling into food and
buk commodities. The company receives most of its freight allocation from TSE. Te
cariers estmated revenues for 1993 are Tug 2.2 million; profits are negligible.
23.         The carier has entered into a joint venture with Russian and Chinese
partne  to set up an all road transit and transfer opeatn  to connect China and Russia.
The joint venture has a capital of $500,000, of which the Mongolian share is $100,000.
Ihe company enjoys a cost advantage compared to most other Mongola motor caries
because its large, diesel-powered truck are more fuel efficient (thus reducing operaig



- 91 -                        AtN=    3
costs). However, in the current semireg d environment, the arrier has chosen not to
compte on a price basis but instead to develop new markets.
24.         Motor Canier No. 27. Motor Carrier No. 27 was founded in 1963 and is
now 100 percent prvately owned. Managers and employees hold jointly 88 percent of the
company's stock. The swven-member board includes thr  outsiders.
25.         The company opetes 302 truck and 293 taie, and is the largest long-
haul carier based i Ulaanbaatar. The trucks are S-tons gas-powered ZL-130s; the
tailrs have a 5.5-ton capacity. The truck fleet is obsolete and fdel inefficient.
26.         The caier haus bay, vegetabls, coal, ieou agrcultual products,
construion  materals betwen maof cities. Seventy percent of its business is with large
distribution compnies-the Consumer Food Supply Company, the indust  Supply
Company (IMPEX), and the Agricultural Supply Company. Traffic bandled for the state
owned distribution companies is controlled through TSE, which also furnishes the camier
with its fuel supply. The company has a smal profit despite the fact that the its state-
owned customers lack quidity and are slow paying for the tucking services. However,
the latte causes liquidity problems for the carmer, it has recently received loans from the
Government to bridge its liquidity problems and has taken commercial loans to repair some
of its fleet.

URBAN TRANSPORT: DRAFT POLICY STATEMENT
Relationships between the Govem renu  and the Urban Passeger Transp_t
Companies
1.          The policy of the Govenment is that onsibilit for urban ansport policy
will be devolved to municipal authoxities. There will be a detiled charter establishing thc
relationships between the municipality and tfie operating companies. The charter will set
out the main responsibilies of the compaies, the principles under which they opea   and
their gener organization.
2.          The operatig companies will be automous and free to tak eal  cutive
deisios regrding their intnal organization, caing out service operations and
maitenance, purchas  of spare paru, choice of suppie  and mateals, finacal
tansions and personnel maters.
3.          There wi be a detiled cont    bween the my and the 
management of the companies setting out the objecdves of the compan  in terms of
servie (particularly route networks, frequencies, os) and effidency targets. There will
also be similr contracts between the senior manage  of the companimes and the managers
of the depots. Achievement of these objecdves wil be measured through agreed indicat
and target values.
4.          The exsdng charters and contracs will be im ed to take account of he
_hanges in the operating and economic structu in Mongolia (especially changes in
natonal esonomic policies and company laws). Improvements will include measurab
performance objectives and will stamline the companies' reoting rments and
orational su     ion procedures. The capability of the muicpal govenments to
supervise the companies will also be imprved. For these purposes, recomm   will
be prepared before mid-October 1994, and deciionsan on an improved system of
contractual relaionsips as soon as possible threafter so that it can be used sarting on
Janu   1, 1995. The phased introducion of compettion between opatig cmp      for
the award of urban service contacb will form part of utban tansort policy.
Urban Pmnger Tansport Tafs
5.          The poly of MID is that th price of the nma pssengr tict should
be established as soon as possible at a level that recovers 100 percent (cludipg
inestment cost) of the opraig costs of urban tranport For this purpose, te ptice of
he tiket will be iceased steadily above the rate of inflabon, while st tading account
of the ave_g income of the popWlat, especially in rlon to the price of food and



- 99 -                        AM=e  s
other basic items. It is the Government's iong-term objective of achieving ful cos
rewovery for urban transport ethgh its fire pricing iolicy.
6.          The system of fare empt    or low  fares for special gups will be
reviewed and, if necessary, revised so that special f    ae limited to the most needy
groups and no one dse. The cost of any remaining exempos a discounts for special
groups wi3l be clearly idendfied and recovered from the rdevant agencies. Mh ollection
of ares will also be impoved and a more ffective control system put in place. For these
purposes, an implementation pln will be ppred before December 31, 1994 and
measues taken as shown necessary by the plan, duing the fiscal yea 1995.
Subsidy Support to Urban Transport
7.          The poLicy of the Govment is tat the urban pasger tanpot
companies will be provided in a tmely fashion with funds sfficent to operate under
reasonable echcal standards and at minmum acceptable levels of quality of servce. The
Govement will conside methds by which municipal goverments can create special
taxes and tansport development funds to finance Urban  snger transport.
8.          Urban tasport support funds will be allocated monty in advance to the
companies on the bais of previously agreed            operting and invatment
budgets.  he oprtg budgets will be p      in advance for each year on the basi of
t  actual costs of specfi  leves of    taking  to acount agreed impts in
effidency (for example, impoved revue collcon, impoved          n reducto
of fuel           and redon of ponel). le budgets wi be adjusted monly
to take account of general conomic cdions.   e investment budgets wil be prpared
and appov  each year on the basis of an agreed shtte  for impvemet and rew
of the companies' fleets and equipment as necesary under reanable standards to mantain
or impre fte levs of sevice. Techn    assistac  wi be provid to all the
compnies during 1994, to help them improe  the pepaaon of their opeaing and
investment budgets.
Competto
9.          The future policy of the Government is to encourage competion in the
provision of urban passenger tanport services and to encourage the growth of altne
supple  of tranport services. Any pern or company wiling to povide any tpe of
service will therefore be audtoized to do so, provided they meet naional standards
regrding safety and pollution and can show evidence of a mnimum evel of professional
capability. Ilie will not be any othr restctive rule, and tariffs will be set freely by the
provides of these alternative services.

1.         TIle: Technical Assistance to Urban Transport Institutions
2.          Benefdwiy Agency: UM and its urban tranport companies.
3.          ObJectves: The objectdve of the urban transport technical assstance is to
proide additional exrse and the transfer of kmowledge and experience to assist the
Ullaabaatar Muncipal Authoity and transport operators with the plannig and
implementation of passenger transport industry reform programs in Ulanbaatar. A key
objecdve of the technical assistance to the operating companies is the improvement of
maintenance systems, budgeting procedures and maintenance managment within the urban
operators to achieve and sustain effective utilHzation of both the existing passenger ansport
fleet and the additional vehidcles that will be purmased during the project.
4.          Content/Description of Outputs: The scope of work envisages throe main
activity areas: (a) assisance in prcurement; (b) assstance to the municipal Department
of Urban Transport (DUI); and (c) assisnce to operating companies, plus associated
taining.
S.          Assrtane In Procurement. The consutant will be expected to asst DuT
and opeaing companies in preparing geneal, commercal and technical specti for
the p     tof buses and trolleybuses. In pping the pefications, attention  so
be paid to the apprpriate level of emission contl for new buses. With regard to the
latter, the consultnt should liaise with the Ministry of nimronment, which issued a draft
Envirnmental Action Plan on November 24, 1993.
Asistance to the  unIcpality
(a)   A key factor in the reform of Ulanbaatar urban transport will be the clear
sepaation of subsidy supported urban tAnsport opeators from the funding
agencies (nafional and municipal govemment) responsible for the allocation
of subsidies. It is the intention of the goverment that responsibility for
urban passenger services will be more fully devolved to the muicpaity.
This will reqwre that the municipality develop the ability to take ful
rsonsibility for the planning, development and fiscal oversight of urban
passenger transport services. The consultants will assist the municipality to
develop this process to the point where the municipality has the capability
to efficienly procure cost-effective passenger tansport se A ssistance
will be given to develop the range of skills necessary within the municipality
to oprte an effective municpa page  htansport unit and achieve the
cost-effective  procurement  of  passenger  transport  services.
Recommendations should be made on methods by which the municipaity
and MI) can intrduce competibe bidding between operat  and modes
as a means of intoducing commercl pressures on opertors to reduce total
taso  costs.



-112^ A-
(b)   Specifically the technical assistance will cover:
(i)  Assistance to the municipality in ting over responsibility for
planning and policy direcdon of passenger  rnspor    The
consultants will be expc   to ast and guide the municipaity
through this change process. The solutions developed in Ulaanbaatar
will be expected to be replicable in othe cities in fiue and to serve
as a model for these cities.
CiH) Prepaation of a definition of the role of a typical municipal
passenger  ansport unit and an organization stcure  with
identification of the tpes of exrse required. The   sultats will
prepare a specification for the Ulaanbaatar unit tailored to local
needs. They will then pecify the taining progam necessary to
augment exisdng local expertise and to introduce international Tbet-
practice' worldng methods into urban transport planning in
Ulaanbaatar.
(iii)  Monitor the implemenion of mitial service contra'ts between the
municipality and urban transport operators and prepare the second
round of service contacts aimed at aceving frther impovemts.
It is epeed that the contacts will incoworte intnain  best
prctice adapted to specific local conditions.
(iv) The consultants will assist the passenger transport unit in developing
an improved financial control of uban tansport. This   incude
the raonalzatin of subsidies away from the present cost-drven
disburs  method to a sstem whereby the operto  receive agreed
funds against adequa  peromance of service-delivery contract
The consulants will assist the m  it in negoation  with
MID, the Ministry of Finance, and other government agencies tO
develop and implement raonized subsidy systems.
(v)  Assistance wil be given by the consultants to the municipi  to
carry out a network reviw of passenger tansprt services in
Ulaanbaatar. This review will highlght any current ine
and duplicadon of services. These will be eliminated and a new
route network will be deigned assigning modes and opertors in a
way that best utilizes the caistis of buses and trolleybuses.
This can then be reflected in the service contrc with the indindual
operators through the prammed introducton of redigned routes
under contract on a 'value-for-money' basis.

skls, etc. are sufficient to increase the availabiliy of exsting a
additional vehicles and sustai the levels of service opetn  hat
wil be required under service contrats with the municipalit.
(mii)  The consultants wil work with the oeator to prepare basic cost
wounting and operat  stics, and standard financal stements,
thus enabling the opators to take managemet desons based on
clear cost and financial information. As part of the resti
process, the consultants wil assist each operator to prepae a ree
year busiess pan.
(iv)  It is the intention of the govement that the orat   wll  w
begin to opert on a more commercial basis. The consultnts will

CODE OF ENVIRONMAL PRACTICE FOR
ROAD WORKS
1.         All temporary and penmaent fillspoil placement sites and exposed batten
are to be protected against erosion by use of mulch, frario and/or planting of vegetaton
as soon as possble (especially duing rany seasons).
2.          Materials stores (especally fuel storage and dispening areas) should be
protcted by a ring drain and collection pit to prevent spills and mobilization f runoff
water. All bitumen, cement, chemicals and fuels should be properly stored and covered
to prevent spills and mobilizion by runoff water. All lubrcants should be collected and
recycled (if recycling is possible, otherwise disposed into an acceptable location).
3.          Periodically water down temporary roads, exposed road sufaces during
constuction, fill/spoil sites until such can be vegetated, and all other exposed surfaes
from which dust could be mobilized in unacceptably high volume.
4.         Instalion of adequate temporary drainage along construction wok, spol
disposal, quarry and borrow sites.
5.          Temporary store and stabilize all topsoil removed along the right-of-way
(ROW), in preparaion to the opening of new bonrow and quarry areas, and other areas
wherever possible (to be used in rehabilita of constructin sites, quaries, borrow pits,
etc.).
6.          Rehabilitate, where possible, to previous land use those areas used for
borrow pits, quarries, and spoil disposal. Where this is not possible, rehabilitate to the
most appropriate land use possible, considering surrounding land use.
7.          Provide tffic control at areas where road constuctn support fcilities
(office, workshops and stores, maintenance yards, etc.) and quarries/borrow areas could
cause traffic impacts. Post and control speed of construction-related vehicles along access
and within the ROW.
8.         Ensure all construction eqwpment is fitted with proper equipment for the
control of noise and engine exhaust.
9.          Constrction activities in sensitive areas (for example, resdential areas,
hospitals, bird nesting and other areas where noise and human activity may disupt animal
life cycles) should be imited and/or prohibited during evening and early morg hours

10.        Prohibit illgd hunting under terms of employment of construction staff.
11.         Adequate tempory pedestrian and vehicle crossings are to be provided,
controlW and maintained during construction.
12.         Spoil from excavation (cut to spoil, tunnels, etc.) in areas with slope greater
than 40 percent should be trucked to a suitable spoil disposal area, not 'side-tipped in
steep terrain.
13.         Spoil disposal sites should have bottom (seepage) and uphill intercepto
drains installed. Spoil should be placed and compacted and the downslope side stabilized
to prevent Slips.

traffic.
3.          E rt volume (ton-kmn) is projected to reach only 80 perc   of the 1990
level by 1998 beas of the sgficant (50 pect) decline from 1990 to 1993.
4.          Import volume (ton-kin) is projected to top the 1990 lavel by 1998, pardy
due to the momentum of forign aid flows to Mongolia in te next several yeas.

5.          Domestic volume (ton-kin) comprised of 80 percent coal in 1993. Two key
assumptions were made in projecting the volume of coal transported by MR. One is that
total coal production in Mongolia will reach the 1990 peak of 8 million tons in about five
years (i.e., by 1998). (The 1992 and 1993 figures were each 6 million). The second is
that MR will tsport 80 percent of the incremental 2 million tons to be prduced between
1994 and 1998 (of which 0.8 million is to come from the Shive Gobi mine in 1994, and
the rest incremental between 1994 and 1998 from other mines). The balance of domestic
transport is expected to increase only marginally as foreign exchange-arning raffic will
be given preference in capacity udlization.
6.          Tans volume (ton-kn) is expected to increase substanially between 1994
and 1998 as a result of increased economic activity in China and RussL, and increased
handling   pacity at the transshipment station of Zameen-Uud.  Consequently, the
assumption is that, by 1998, it will exceed the 1990 level by 38 percent.
7.          Passengers (passenger-km) consist of domestic and international. Both are
projected to increase only maray due to the capacity constraints crated by sizable
increases in freight traffic.
8.          Traffic volume projections are shown below:

Tariff
9.          The tariffs for 1992 are used as the basis for the projections. Except for
domestic, tatiffs for each group of traffic are increased by 1.5 percent per year, the
prqected real growth ae of the Mongolian economy during the 1994-97 penod. The
atmual increase is delayed for trans freight and intaonal passengers until 1995, the



-129 -                         ANNEXi
expected date by which the signatories to the international tariff treaty will have more
autonomy in tariff-setting.
10.         Domestic tariffs (including for coal) are increased by 2.5 percent per year
to maintain MR's cost recovery ratio of 50 percent on coal tansport.
Operating Revenues
1.         Revenues are derived by multiplying the traffic volume by the tariff for each
group of taffic. Other revenues decrease substantially after 1992 because tnsport of
Russian military personnel, their families and equipment vitay ended m 1992.
Nonoperating Income and Expe_e
12.         After 1994, increased activities and prices of the income-genadtng units
(workshops, trade and procurement, and other units) are expected to produce a small profit
after subsidy payments to the nonincomgenegating units, such as schools, housing,
hospitals and the Railways Academy.
Opeati  Expen_
13.         Wagon rental is based on a schedule of leasing charges agreed to by MR
and Russia, and taking into account the Japanese mvestment in 455 wagons scheduled for
completion in 1996 (Table 15 of Apaisal Report).
14.         Repairs and main    ce are based on half of Western pnces for MR-
owned rolling stock (i.e., $0.25 million for coaches, $0.1 milion for luggage vans, and
$.02 miLlion for wagons) and 63 percent for locomotives ($0.9 million), and assumed
repair and maintenance rates for each class of assets (i.e., 5 pent for locomotives,
2 percent for coaches and luggage vans, and I percent for wagons) (Table 19 of Appraisal
Report).
15.         *Other* ese.s are held constant at their 1992 levels.
16.         Personnel costs are based on wage increases of 1.5 percent per year in real
terms, and following projected railway operAons staffng numbers.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. RAILWAYS
Locomotives: Overhauls and Spare Parts
1.         Fifteen locomotives wi}l be overhauled over a three-year period. All
released locomotives will be utilzed for freight. It is esdmated that, without the project,
every year one locomotive out of each group of five to overhaul, would go out of service
and would remain out of servce. Locomotives affected would range from 1 in 1996 to
15 in year 2002. Based on the railways' opeating efficiency indicators, each locomotive
does 106.3 million net ton-km per year. If the overhauls are not done, traffic that could
not be caried by the railway would be diverted to trucks at substantially higher cost It
estimated that the differential in economic cost between the rail and the road, for the kind
of traffic that would be diverted from the rail due to lack of locomotives, is $0.005 per
ton-km. For the purposes of the economic analysis, a life of five years is assumed for
each of the overhauled locomotives. On the basis of an investment of $5.2 million and
benefits calculated as noted above, the rate of return for the overhauls would be
48.0 percent.
2.          Mongolian Railways has been seriously affected by the need to conduct
unscheduled maintenance, which has been the result of lack of spare parts. While often
the cost of the spare parts involved in the repairs is small, the effect of the unscheduled
maintenance durng the recent past years has been a substantal amount of locomotives
immobilized for periods of several days. The cumulative losses in locomotive availability
and corresponding taction capacity are substantial. Due to the smal uit cost of repairs,
the investment in spare parts would have a return per dollar invested at least equal to that
of the investment in overhauls.
Freight Wagons and Passenger Coaches: Spare Parts and Conversion to Steel Body
3.          Mongolia Railways rents a substantial number of wagons from Russia every
year. Until recently, rental fees have been substantially below accepted international level,
but MR has been informed that a progressive rate increase will take place between 1993
and 1998. The projected rates are as follows:

4.          Spare parts to be purchased with project funds will allow MR to service
about a third of the needed repairs and overhauls per year. Without such funding, MR
would not be able to ret   to service 40 wagons per day duing the first year, and this
effect would be cumulative. The altenative would be to lease these wagons, incurng net
additional yearly costs equal to the value of the lease minus the maintenance costs of MR's
wagons returned to service. On this basis, and assuming an economic life of dght years
for the repaired wagons due to the spare parts provided under the project, the economic
rate of return for this component would be 24 percent.
5.          Conversion of wooden walls in wagons used for coal would prevent damages
and reduce the number of wagons out service. Some 5 wagons out of 421 wooden-wall
wagons for coal are continuously out of service due to damaged walls.  he alteative is
to lease wagons from Russia duing the time the wagons are being repaed. The benefit
from the proposed conversion is to reduce leasing costs as well as wagon repair costs of
the damaged wooden walls, which include the workshop repair costs as weUl as the costs
of tking wagons out of trains and reuing them to service. Assuming an eoonomic life
of eight years for the repairs, the economic rate of retun for this investment is esfimated
at 16 percent.
6.         Lack of spare parts contributes to a shortage of passenger wagons, currently
es-mated at 40 coaches. This results in overcrowding and increased deteioration of the
coaches. Since it is difficult to quantify the economic benefits from lower service qualiy
where passenger have no altenative transport means, a separate economic evaluation has
not been conducted for this component. However, its costs are included in the overall rate
of return for the railway component of the project.
Workshop Equipment
7.          The workshop equipment will mainly allow to conduct repairs in Mongolia
that otherwise would be done in Russia, where they cost more and require substially
higher downtime due to transport time and longer repar time. A detiled culon has
been made of the flange welding equipment, which is takn  to be repesentaive of the
return of the investment in workshop equipment. his equipmt would allow to reduce
from 200 to 100 the number of pieces of locomotive wheels that would need to be repaired
in Russa every year. This would generate annual gross savings of $97,000 per year, and
net savings of $29,000 when opeting costs are tak  into account. Assming a life of
five years for the repaired wheels, this investment would yield an economic rate of return
of 19 percent.

Overal Retum for away Component
8.          The overall economic rate of retun for the proposed railway investment,
including all physical investments costs under the project would be 41.9 percent.
B. URBAN TRANSRT
9.          The quanfiable economic benefits of the spare par stem from extension
of vehicle operatng life and deferl of renewals. A very conseratve assumption has
been made to esimate these benefits. The main assumption is that benefits fom this
investment will have a limited life of five years only from compledon of the vehicle repairs
and rehabilitaon and hat savings from avoided purchases due to the new spares will be
some 40 percent of the average avoided investments in annual equipment renewalL The
investment savings are thus estmated at some $3 million per year, although at the the peak
of project impact some 84 buses (with a total investment cost of 84 of about $7.5 to $8.0
million) would be released from the workshops thanks to the new spares. Under present
repair cycles, 88 new vehicles (buses and trollyebuses) would be required to be purchased
annualy for replacements alone. On this basis, the eoonomic rate of return for the spare
pars investment is esdmated at 16 percent.
10.        The incremental tansport capity resulting from the supply of spares parts
and from the new vehicles to be financed under the project will have ignificant additional
benefits that are difficult to quantify in economic values. These benefits ognate
pmurly from increases  n srvice lee. The increase in tsport capacity will allow
to reduce loadings from the cunrent overcrowded levels of about 2,500 passhvebday to
about 1,800 pass/veh/day. A summary of projected  rvice quality benefits from project
implemenaion is shown on the next page.
11.        The inceased capacity orgintng in the provisin of new buses will also
allow the urban tasport companies to geneate additional revues. Under normal
conditions, the increased revenues may be taken as a proxy for economic benefits.
However, given the transitional phase of Mongolia's economy and large distortions both
in input and output prices, coupled with lack of data to assess time and trip values, it is
not possible to make a reliable estimate of such benefits; thus, it is not possible to conduct
a sound assessment of the economic rate of return for the investment in new buses and
trolleybuses.
