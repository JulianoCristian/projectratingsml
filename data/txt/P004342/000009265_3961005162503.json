The project\n            consists of four sectoral subprojects, (railways, urban\n            transport, road freight transport and roads), each with a\n            physical and technical assistance component, and a component\n            to advise on sector policy and assist in the implementation\n            of the project. The project will focus on: 1) rehabilitation\n            of the transport fleet in railways, urban transport and\n            trucking; 2) rehabilitation of paved roads; 3) preparation\n            for restructuring of selected transport enterprises; and 4)\n            policy advice, technical assistance and training to related\n            sectoral agencies and private trucking operators.
