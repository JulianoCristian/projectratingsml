institutions\n            (Agricultural Bank of Turkey -TCZB- and the Agricultural\n            Credit Cooperatives -TKK-).

Institutional\n            development of TKK will focus on improved lending policies\n            and procedures. The project credit program will consist of\n            incremental short term production credit and medium/long\n            term investment credit in the 45 provinces where a core\n            extension services is in place and the capacity of the\n            credit institutions is considered adequate."}, "docdt": "1989-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
