                        Amendments
Dear Mr. Selekler:
            We refer to Mr. Kilic's letter of May 29, 1990 wherein
he has requested that the special account referred to in the Loan
Agreement for the above Project be opened in TCZB.
            I am pleased to inform you that we agree to his request,
and therefore we propose to you the following amendment to the Loan
Agreement dated June 28, 1989:
            The words "in the Central Bank of Turkey" which appear
            in paragraph (b) of Section 2.02 are replaced by the
            words "in TCZB".
            Please indicate your agreement to the foregoing by
signing and dating the attached copy of this Letter and by returning
said copy to us.
                                    Sincerely yours,
