Background:
The onset in 1999 of Colombia's first recession in seventy
years exacerbated a series of social and economic difficulties
that threaten to undermine the progress made in both economic
and social development. To strengthen economic recovery and
provide a foundation for sustainable growth, the Government of
Colombia (GOC) has pursued a series of structural adjustment
measures supported by an IMF program and a World Bank-financed
Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan (SFAL). These measures aim
principally to control the growth of public expenditures through
improving the country's fiscal and financial stability.
The proposed SECAL, a one tranche loan to be completed
before the end of the current Administration, seeks: (i) to
complete the current stage of Colombia's Bank supported social
sector strengthening program begun in 1998, which includes among
others the promulgation of regulatory measures to enable the
implementation of recently approved education and health
reforms, as well as the establishment of an integrated social
risk management policy framework; and (ii) to promote greater
social sustainability (tolerance) of the SFAL supported fiscal
reforms.
This SECAL is being proposed after taking into account its
importance to the Bank's country assistance strategy, GOC's
short term financial needs, and the reform measures it has
recently initiated to control public spending. In this regard,
the CAS Update recently discussed with the Board confirmed the
strategic importance of this SECAL. Furthermore, during the SFAL
discussions the Board expressed the need for the SECAL to ensure



fiscal space for social protection and sustainability of fiscal
reforms.
