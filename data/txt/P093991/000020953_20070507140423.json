The\n            additional financing is required to complete the original\n            project activities in view of a new financing gap that has\n            emerged over the past year related to expected parallel\n            financing for primary education. The original project\n            development objective remains the same: to increase the\n            proportion of Malian children completing a quality first\n            cycle of basic education and improve the overall efficiency\n            of resources used in the education sector.
