Mali is a vast\n            landlocked country located in the heart of the Sahel, a\n            region threatened by drought and desertification. The vast\n            majority of the people were directly dependent on the\n            environment for their livelihoods through herding, farming,\n            or fishing. The International Development Association\n            supported Mali through various projects, in addressing its\n            economic challenges with a focus on education, health,\n            agriculture, and energy. The Fostering Agricultural\n            Productivity Project improved productivity of targeted\n            horticultural and livestock products and better access to\n            markets, financing, and commercial infrastructure. Energy\n            Support Project increased access to electricity through the\n            interconnected network and promoted regional integration and\n            energy diversification"}, "docdt": "2011-04-25T05:17:02Z"}
