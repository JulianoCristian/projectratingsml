                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The completion rate has increased substantially from 46% (in 2004) to 55.7% in 2008, achieving the target (56%). This is an important achievement as at the same time the Gross
                         Enrollment has increased substantially to 82%, exceeding the end program target (80%). While still an issue, the gender gap has been reduced both in primary and secondary and
                         the index parity has increased from 0.76 to 0.8. The quality of education has improved as evidenced by the increased completion rate as well as the significantly reduced repetition
                         rates (from 18 to 14.2% close to the target of 13%). There are however many remaining issues including further improving the learning achievements, reducing the number of
                         teachers per student, and increasing the efficiency of school construction. In terms of improving the overall efficiency of the sector, the target for reducing the ratio of non-teaching

                         staff was substantially achieved (19% as compared to the target of 20%) as was the increase in the Governments budget allocated to basic education.
                         In spite of these achievements, the project has experienced delays in activities implementation for two main reasons: (i) the low level of the special account initially fixed at USD 2

                         million (CFA 1 billion). This has delayed disbursement which has, in turn, impacted on school construction; (ii) there is no PIU or staffs dedicated to the project fiduciary management,
                         which has delayed disbursement processes and has made it difficult to train staffs who would be dedicated to the project. As a consequence of this second issue, until now the 2009
                         audit report has not been submitted to the Bank.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project will be closed with a large unused amount, showing poor performance of the project, mainly for fiduciary and implementation related issues. Slow disbursement (40%
                         after 4 years) was observed until the first extension when it picked up to reach 80%. Given that the 2009 audit report was not delivered in December 2010 (6 months after the
                         deadline), there is no ground for extension of closing. The project will be closely monitored for the closing process.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
