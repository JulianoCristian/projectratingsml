SUMMARY
1.      This request is to restructure and amend the Grant Agreement (the Agreement) for the
Basic Education Project (BEP) in order to: (i) extend the closing date of the BEP by 12 months
from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012; (ii) amend the institutional arrangements related to
procurement and civil works supervision aspects of the project; (iii)revise some of the targets
related to the Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators; and (iv) reallocate the Grant
proceeds amongst the categories of expenditures.



PROJECT STATUS
2.      The BEP was approved on 9 July 2009 and became effective on 30 September 2009. To
date, $7.54 million have been disbursed, which represents 50 percent of the overall grant amount.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the BEP is to increase access to improved basic
education in four selected states in northern Sudan. Several of the expected results have been
achieved, leading to a moderately satisfactory PDO rating. Despite initial delays in the school
construction component, 40 of the originally targeted 206 classrooms have been completed and
construction is ongoing in 28 of the targeted 30 schools. The delays in school construction are a
result of several factors including; (i) delays in finalizing the bid documents and evaluations
given that these were prepared by a separate entity, i.e. by the Community Development Fund
(CDF); (ii) schools are inaccessible to the contractors and supervising entities during the rainy
season in two of the four states. In these states, construction comes to a halt for five to six
months of the year; and (iii) cancellation of some contracts due to non-performance of
contractors. However, all 30 schools are expected to be completed by December 2011. In
addition, there has been a four percent increase in student enrollments in the targeted schools
since baseline.

3.      The project trained close to 90 percent of the targeted number of teachers by the end of
March 2011. The training, which seeks to enhance the quality of teaching in basic education in
the four states, is expected to be complete by June 2011. An assessment of the knowledge gained
by teachers through the training program is ongoing though it only reflects whether trainees
learned the content of the training. A follow on in-classroom survey is planned for September
2011 to attempt to garner the possible effect of the training on teachers’ in class abilities and any
improvements in students’ learning outcomes.

4.       Related to improving basic education, is the construction of four teacher training
institutes (TTIs), one in each of the four states.     The construction of the TTIs accounts for
around 25 percent of the total grant amount and it is this component that has been the main
challenge for project implementation. Given the Ministry of General Education (MoGE) has not
built any TTIs since the 1950s, there appears to be a lack of capacity amongst architecture firms
to develop designs for the TTIs which are appropriate in the present context. Two separate
contractors were hired by the CDF to develop the designs of the TTIs for three of the four states,
but neither produced designs nor bills of quantities (BoQs) of acceptable quality.

                                                 4
5.      Unlike the three states where CDF was enlisted as the supervising entity, in the Red Sea
the construction of the TTI has been going relatively smoothly under the supervision of the Red
Sea Engineering Consultancy Center (RSECC). The TTI was close to 30 percent complete at the
end of March 2011 and the full construction is expected to be completed by October 2011. In
view of its demonstrated capacity in the design of the largest TTI under the program, the MoGE
hired RSECC to develop the designs for the remaining three TTIs. In addition, an international
procurement advisor has been hired by the project to provide support on developing the bidding
documents and the bid evaluation. The procurement of the TTIs will thus be centralized in order
to speed up the process given there is insufficient procurement capacity at the state level. It is
expected that contracts will be signed with successful bidders by August 2011 for two TTIs, one
in South Kordofan and one in North Kordofan. The TTIs are expected to be completed by May
2012. If the contracts for the TTIs are not signed by August 2011, the financing for this
component will be diverted towards additional schools construction and textbook
procurement/distribution.

6.      The location for the third TTI in Blue Nile state presented a challenge given that the soil
conditions are unsuitable for foundations. Moreover, the location is not well connected by a road,
which raises the question of whether teachers can feasibly be trained there. In addition, given the
existing TTI in Damazine is not being adequately utilized; there is insufficient justification to
build another TTI in the Blue Nile state, in a more remote location. The state MoGE agreed that
the finances allocated towards the TTI ($364,000) would be channeled towards the construction
of an additional school in the locality where the TTI was to be constructed.

7.      The intent of the curriculum review vis-à-vis the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA) might have been overly ambitious at the design stage of the project given the uncertainty
surrounding the outcome of the referendum and the potential impact it would have on curriculum
reform. As a result, the curriculum component experienced delays as well as ad hoc investments
which did not contribute towards a cohesive output. However, since the referendum and the
imminent secession of the South, Sudan has embarked upon a clear curriculum reform process
across the sub-sectors. The proposal is to revise the English curriculum from Grade 3 through to
the end of secondary school utilizing BEP financing.

8.       Monitoring and evaluation of the project has been moderately satisfactory. Though data
is collected on a regular basis by the central and state coordinating units, there have been some
inconsistencies in the data reported by the schools which has required additional verification and
cross-checking against school records to ensure consistency and reliability. Despite some of
these inconsistencies, the data is by and large complete and provides a good picture of project
performance to date.

Institutional arrangements
10.     Under the institutional arrangements at project design, the Community Development
Fund (CDF) was delegated to provide procurement and supervision support for civil works
activities to the BEP in three of the four targeted states (South Kordofan, Blue Nile and North
Kordofan). However, the quality of support provided by the CDF has been variable across states.
The bank education team has noted deviations from the technical specifications contained in the
bidding documents; poor quality of bricks; and a general lack of site supervision. The main
constraint to effective construction supervision by CDF is its heavy workload (given the CDF has
its own projects in all the targeted localities) combined with a shortage of adequately qualified
staff to support all the site constructions.


                                                   7
11.     During the mid-term review of the BEP in October 2010, it was agreed that the CDF
would reinforce its supervision of the 15 schools1 that had begun construction across the three
states, while the MoGE proposed alternate supervision arrangements for the remaining 12
schools. The State Ministry of Engineering Affairs in South Kordofan and North Kordofan is
now responsible for civil works supervision of the remaining schools and the TTIs and for the
Blue Nile, the responsibility rests with the State Ministry of Education’s engineering office.

12.      Given this new arrangement, the size and relative complexity of the bidding documents
for the TTI exceed the capacity of the three state coordination units (SCUs) to manage the
procurement process in compliance with agreed National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procedures. The procurement of these works will now be undertaken by the central coordination
unit (CCU) of the Ministry of General Education (FMoGE), with the support of an international
procurement adviser hired by the CCU. In particular, the procurement advisor will assist in
finalizing the bidding documents, based on the final designs and Bills of Quantities (BoQ)
prepared by the Red Sea Engineering Consultancy Center (RSECC), advise and assist in all
phases of bid opening and evaluation and in the finalization of the awarded Contract. By
centralizing the procurement of the TTIs and ensuring the quality of the bidding documents and
bid evaluations through hiring an international procurement adviser, the procurement of the TTIs
in the three states is expected to proceed expeditiously.

1.      Proceeds for Sudan Basic Education Project (BEP), Project ID: P112096 will be
reallocated as follow:

Category of Expenditure             Allocation              % of Financing
 Current       Revised          Current     Revised        Current   Revised

Kordofan                       3,465,000     3,375,000
South                                                        24%          25%
Kordofan                       3,543,000     3,730,000

Red Sea                        3,435,000     3,400,000       23%          23%
Total by state                14,842,000    14,850,000
Non-allocated                   158,000      150,000         1%            1%

2.       Project implementation thus far has been moderately satisfactory and despite
initial delays, the development objectives continue to be achievable. School construction
has been progressing with contracts signed for 28 of the 30 targeted schools. 40 of 206
classrooms were completed by the end March 2011, with a visible increase in
enrollments. Most of the delays in construction are the result of poor weather conditions;
non-performance of some contractors or delays in finalizing bidding documents and bid
evaluations. Teacher-training is progressing steadily with close to 90 percent of the
targeted number of teachers trained by the end of March 2011. While this component
will be complete by June 2011, the extension will allow for a more thorough in-class
assessment of a teacher’s ability to teach following the training.

3.      The construction of the teacher training institutes (TTIs) experienced delays in
three of the four states due to the lack of capacity to develop good quality designs for the
TTIs. The design of the TTIs have thus been commissioned to the Red Sea Engineering
Consultancy Center (RSECC) based on its unique capability in this area and an
international procurement advisor has been hired by the BEP central coordination unit to
support the procurement of these TTIs. Lastly, the curriculum component has picked up
momentum since completion of the referendum with a clear mandate to revise the
existing English curriculum within the support of BEP financing.

4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to complete all remaining activities within
the project. The original budget allocated to South Kordofan was insufficient given the
large scope of the work in the state (12 schools in South Kordofan as opposed to 6
schools in North Kordofan and 9 in the Blue Nile), whereas there cost of activities in
Blue Nile was less than expected. In addition, the central level of the MoGE requires
additional finances to cover the costs of curriculum reform, which has become a priority
since the secession of South Sudan.

1. The closing date for the Sudan Basic Education Project (BEP), MDTF-N and Project
   ID: P112096 will be extended from June 30, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2.       Project implementation thus far has been moderately satisfactory and despite
initial delays, the development objectives continue to be achievable. School construction
has been progressing with contracts signed for 28 of the 30 targeted schools. 40 of 206
classrooms were completed by the end March 2011, with a visible increase in
enrollments. Most of the delays in construction are the result of poor weather conditions;

assessment of a teacher’s ability to teach following the training.

3.      The construction of the teacher training institutes (TTIs) experienced delays in
three of the four states due to the lack of capacity to develop good quality designs for the
TTIs. The design of the TTIs have thus been commissioned to the Red Sea Engineering

support the procurement of these TTIs. Lastly, the curriculum component has picked up
momentum since completion of the referendum with a clear mandate to revise the
existing English curriculum within the support of BEP financing.

4.     The proposed extension is necessary to complete all outstanding activities under
the project in order to facilitate achievements of its development objectives. The
Ministry of General Education has prepared a workplan and related procurement plan for
the remaining period in order to have a clear schedule for project activities to be
completed by the end of June 2012.

5.        This will be the first extension of the project.
