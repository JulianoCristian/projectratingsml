                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is in the process of a proposed second restructuring that involves an extension, reallocation of activities, and consolidation of project management. The proposed
                         restructuring is aimed at consolidating institutional resources given that several of the key project activities are completed. In addition, the restructuring seeks to reallocate finances

                         from states affected by conflict to more secure areas. Approval of this will only come after a decision has been made on the MDTF as a whole – donors will be meeting with
                         Government in April to discuss potential of extension of the entire MDTF to June 2013 to address halted activities in conflict affected states (Blue Nile and South Kordofan).

                         A new implementation structure calls for consolidation of five stand-alone coordinating units into a single Project Implementation Unit (PIU) adequately staffed and assigned core

                         programmatic and administrative responsibilities. During the last mission, critical staff for the new PIU were hired, such as the Program Manager and Monitoring and Evaluation
                         officers. At the time of this ISR, an offer had been made for the procurement position and all that remains is the FM specialist recruitment. The new team is working urgently to
                         compile the relevant FM, procurement and M&E data for the project together and to develop a new workplan.

                         At the time of the February 2012 mission, the overall achievement of project development objectives was moderately satisfactory, with the exception of states impacted by the
                         conflict. School construction across the project is 67% complete (21 out of 31 schools) with varying degrees of progress across the four states- 8 of the 10 incomplete schools are in
                         the two states affected by conflict, South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Although an 11 percent increase in student enrollment has been recorded by the Project in the target schools,
                         surpassing the targeted increase of 5 percent from baseline, the numbers for South Kordofan and Blue Nile cannot be verified. The project is not due to collect data on the average
                         number of days targeted schools are open annually until the end of the school year in March 2012, progress in this area will be difficult to assess as eight of the 15 schools target
                         schools in South Kordofan and Blue Nile are currently closed due to the conflict.

                         On teacher training, almost 100 percent of the target numbers of teachers have been trained in Math, Arabic, English and the Core program. The results of the pre and post tests for
                         teachers who took the training show mixed results, with teachers surpassing the target of a 20 percent improvement in subject knowledge and teaching skills for the Core Program
                         and Arabic, but falling short of the target for Math and English. The construction of Teacher Training Institutes has been slow, but the Red Sea and North Kordofan TTIs are expected
                         to be completed by project closing. The construction of the TTI in South Kordofan has been suspended given the conflict in that state and discussions are underway with the
                         Government regarding alternate use of funds in remaining time.
