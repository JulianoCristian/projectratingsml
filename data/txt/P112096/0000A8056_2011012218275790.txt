                         Implementation performance of the Basic Education Project (BEP) at mid-term was moderately satisfactory. Student enrollment increased by about 1% overall from baseline (8884
                         students overall), while enrollments for girls alone increased by about 6% since baseline. The project had trained 62% of the targeted number of teachers in Arabic, English,

                         While there has been substantial progress in the construction of the targeted schools as well as a sustained increased in the number of teachers being trained, the construction of
                         three of the four teacher training institutes has continued to lag as has progress with the curriculum reform component. The mission noted concerns with the quality of the schools'
                         construction in the three states where the CDF has been delegated to provide procurement and supervision support to the BEP. In all three states, the Mission noted deviations from
                         the technical specifications contained in the bidding documents; poor quality of bricks; and a general lack of site supervision.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the persistent delays in finalizing the technical designs for the teacher training institutes, the project will not achieve all its objectives on schedule, by 30 June 2011. The
                         mission discussed the possibility of extending the project by six months, through 31 December 2011 (once the overall MDTF project has been officially extended), with the MoGE.
                         Further, the mission discussed amendments to the current institutional arrangements in order to reduce the scope of CDF's responsibilities on the BEP by limiting the number of
                         schools it would supervise construction on as well as transfer responsibility for the procurement and supervision of the teacher training institutes to the MoGE. Further, CDF's
                         capacity to adequately supervise the ongoing school's construction will be reinforced. Some of the key performance indicators and associated targets for the project have also been
                         reviewed in line with the baseline information collected and projecting forward in terms of what can reasonably be achieved by the close of the project. These changes will
                         necessitate a second order restructuring of the project, which will be processed by February 2011.
