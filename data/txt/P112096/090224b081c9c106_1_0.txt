                         The Basic Education Project is set to close at the end of May 2013. While the project still has approximately $1.2 million to disburse, most of the funds are committed towards school
                         construction, completion of the Teacher Training Institutes and the purchase of furniture and learning materials for schools. At the current rate of implementation, more than 95% of

                         The project has tracked enrollment numbers in all targeted schools since the beginning of the project. On average, the enrollment target of a five percent increase from baseline has
                         been surpassed with an overall increase of 11.5 percent since baseline.

                         The second PDO indicator measures the number of school days Category B schools were open annually. Category B schools are not open during rainy and extremely hot months
                         (depending on where the State is located) due to the quality of school infrastructure. The project supported the construction of school infrastructure for both Category A (open 175
                         days) and Category B (open 124 days) schools. By the end of the Project, Category B schools were open for 149.6 school days missing the PDO target of 160 days. However, the
                         average across the Category B schools was brought down by one outlier school in the Red Sea which was only open for 91 days of the school year due to major challenges around
                         teacher retention in the very remote location of the school. If this school is excluded from the analysis, then the average number of days category B schools were open under the
                         project meets the target of 160 days.

                         The Project also met its target for the third and final PDO indicator related teacher's knowledge of subject materials following a pre and post training assessment (overall increase of
                         22 percent against a target of a 20 percent increase). Following the in-service training, an in class observation was carried out to assess the impact of the in-service training on
                         teachers’ ability to teach. Preliminary results from the study found that there was an overall positive impact from the in-service training on teacher knowledge and teaching skills.

                         Project management has improved since the institutional arrangements for the Project were restructured last year. The PIU has been proactive in communicating with all the schools
                         under the Project and raising issues/challenges to State and Federal Ministry officials. Since the restructuring, disbursements have increased drastically and the quality of
                         implementation (on construction, the textbook development and procurement of goods and services) has greatly improved.
