1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country context

1.     The legacy of the civil war, limited infrastructure and the inequitable distribution of public
goods and services put Sudan (unified Sudan and South Sudan before 2011) as one of the least
developed countries in the world, with over 46 percent of the population living below the statutory
poverty line of SDG114 per month (approximately US$30). Displaced populations, nomadic groups,
rural populations, children, and female children in particular, were especially vulnerable to higher
incidences of poverty, and poverty related health problems. The interaction of high levels of poverty,
social exclusion, spatial inequality and fragile social cohesion underpinned rivalry over scarce
resources, mass group mobilization and conflict.

2.      The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed in 2005 put an end to the civil war in
Sudan and set out a process for conflict resolution between North and South Sudan. Development
partners supported Sudanâs peace building through two Multi-donor Trust Funds: (i) MDTF-National
and (ii) MDTF-South. The Basic Education Project (BEP) was designed and approved in 2009, more
than three years after the CPA. The project was part of the MDTF-N, focusing on the four states in
Northern Sudan.

3.      The post-CPA period was marked by significant economic growth and rapidly rising per capita
GDP (average 7.05 percent per annum). There was a general optimism that the economy would
continue to grow. However, the situation worsened after the Project began. The Project became
effective in late 2009, and by July 2011, South Sudan seceded from Sudan. This led to renewed
conflict in the border regions and continuing conflict in Darfur as well as a period of fiscal crisis with
the loss of oil revenue and eventually the shutting down of oil production. Inflation was running as
high as 40 percent. There was a change in leadership at the national, state and local levels following
the secession which led to some disruption in the government programs.

Education sector context

Access

4.      According to Government of National Unity (GoNU)âs Baseline Survey (2008), the average
Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) in basic education for the country was 71.7 percent and the Net
Enrollment Rate (NER) was 65.3 percent; for females the GER was 65.7 percent and NER 58.8
percent The positive impact of the CPA has been demonstrated through significant increases in basic
school enrollment in Sudan as a whole, and especially in communities previously affected by conflict.
Basic school enrollment in Sudan increased by almost a million between 2004/05 and 2008/09,
corresponding to an average annual growth of 5.7 percent. The peace dividend was evident in the
dramatic increases in access to education in states previously affected by conflict (the Darfur states,
states bordering Southern Sudan and the Eastern states). However, the physical infrastructure in a
large number of schools in the country remained extremely poor. Many of the classrooms were built
out of tree branches and hay. During the rainy season, many students were unable to continue their
education.


                                                    5
Quality

5.      According to the result of the first Service Delivery Survey (SDS) conducted in 2009, student
learning levels in the sampled schools in Sudan were low. The mathematics and reading tests were
taken from the 1995 and 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) grade
4 assessments, and the reading questions were taken from the 1991 and 2001 Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) grade 4 assessments. The vast majority of Grade 5 students (84
percent for mathematics and 72 percent for reading) answered less than half these questions correctly.

6.     The findings highlighted the lack of resources in many basic schools and family background
variables, such as wealth and parental education, were related to low level of student learning
outcomes. Specifically:

ï·         Classroom resources were generally scarce, with shortages of textbooks, desks, and functional
          chalkboards in many of the sample schools;
ï·         A large share of students did not have textbooks;
ï·         The chalkboard was the only most important teaching tools, and in many cases chalkboards
          were not in usable condition;
ï·         Many students did not have desks, but instead sat on chairs without desks or on the ground,
          particularly in rural schools;
ï·         Syllabus coverage was low in many schools, limiting learning opportunities ; and
ï·         Only 10 percent of basic education teacher were officially qualified and there was no
          systematic in-service training provision

Efficiency

7.      The SDS 2009 also showed that in Sudan for Grades 1-5, average dropout was about 8% and
repetition was about 2%. Location, gender and poverty remained very influential in determining a
childâs likelihood of attending school. Whether a child lived in an urban or rural area was the single
most powerful predictor of whether a child will access schooling. GER for urban children was 17
percentage points higher than for rural children. A poor rural girl was the most disadvantaged and was
about 25 percentage-points less likely to ever access basic school than a rich urban boy. In rural
schools, only 41 percent of enrolled students were girls.

Management structure

8.      Sudan had a decentralized system of education service delivery. Within the education sector,
the federal government, through the Federal Ministry of General Education (FMoGE) in Khartoum,
was in charge of planning, coordinating, and monitoring across the general education levels. FMoGE
directed policy development in three key areas: secondary school certification, the qualification
framework for teachers, and development of the basic and secondary education curricula. Policies
related to human resource management and certification for basic education fell under the Preview of
the state governments. The states and mahalyas (localities) were responsible for the delivery and
financing of preschool, basic, and secondary education.

Sector strategy



                                                   6
9.     The GoNU developed the Five year (2007-2011) Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) based
on the 2001 Education Act. The Plan expressed the countryâs commitment to the Education for All
(EFA) goals and outlined activities to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets by
2015. Goals included:

â¢       Closing the gender gap and reducing regional imbalances;
â¢       Ensuring universal primary education and improving quality;
â¢       Improving quality and relevance by revising the national curriculum;
â¢       Improving efficiency; and
â¢       Expanding the role of the private sector in education.

10.      Though the ESSP set clear targets within a specific time frame, the detailed strategies or
financial implications for achieving these targets were not fully analyzed. Realizing complexity of the
situation and the magnitude of the tasks ahead, the MoGE decided to strengthen partnership
arrangements with the international community represented by donors active in the education sector.
To this end, the MoGE expressed its commitment to joining the Education for All - Fast Track
Initiative (EFA/FTI) partnership.

Bank and Development partnersâ program

11.     The MDTFâs commitment to assist Sudan in the education sector was confirmed in the Bankâs
Interim Strategy Note for the Republic of Sudan (Report No. 43036-SD, March 20, 2008). The BEP
Project was approved in 2009, among the 15 projects funded by the MDTF-N.

BEP target areas

12.    The BEP supported four of the States in Sudan - Red Sea, South Kordofan, North Kordofan,
and Blue Nile (see Map page 46).

13.     The four states were among the poorest in Sudan. The poverty incidence in these states was
higher than most of the states in Northern Sudan and was only lower than the Darfur states. In terms
of access to basic education, Red Sea and Blue Nile were significant below the national average while
North Kordofan and South Kordofan were performing better than the national average. About half of
the classrooms in these four states were in poor condition without a chalkboard and furniture.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

14.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase access to improved basic education in
four selected states in northern Sudan.

The main indicators through which its principal outcomes will be measured are:

â¢        Enrolment in the selected schools (number of boys and girls).
â¢        Number of functioning days in the schools supported.
â¢        Percentage of teachers evaluated positively following in-service training in the four states

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDO remained unchanged during the project.

15.      The PDO key indicators, however, were revised as part of the first restructuring in June 2011
(after the Mid-term review in October 2010).

and girls).                                                    Sudan over the last 10 years, which was 5%.
                                                               Also, the majority of the schools would have only

16.     Schools were classified as Category A and Category B. Category A schools had an average
school year of around 210 days, while for Category B it was 140 days. In the Category B schools,
instruction took place only in the non-rainy season as the quality of infrastructure made it impossible
for children to attend schools while it was raining. The original project schools identified in 2009
(Group 1) consisted of 30 schools (13 category A and 17 category B). Due to the conflict in Blue Nile
and South Kordofan, six schools had to be cancelled. Furthermore, seven schools already built from
this group remained closed to date as a result of the conflict hence the final achievement was recorded
for 17 schools in Group 1 against the 2009 baseline. Group 2 (5 schools) was added in late 2012 as a
result of the second restructuring and the final achievement was recorded for these five schools against
the 2011 baseline.

Details of the adjustments are presented in section 1.7, 2.2 and Annex 2.

1.7 Other significant changes

The project underwent two restructurings (details presented in section 2.2)

18.    First restructuring in June 2011 to (i) extend the project closing date by 12 months from June
30, 2011 to June 30, 2012; (ii) amend the institutional arrangements related to procurement and civil
works supervision aspects of the project; (iii) revise some of the targets related to the Project
Development Objective (PDO) indicators; and (iv) reallocate the Grant proceeds amongst the
categories of expenditures; and

19.    Second restructuring in June 2012 to: (i) introduce changes to the institutional arrangements
that would streamline implementation now that some activities have been completed; (ii) allow
resources currently held up in conflict affected states to be used in other states, per Governmentâs
request; and (iii) extend the closing date of the BEP from June 30, 2012 to May 31, 2013.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.   The BEP preparation can be considered as an emergency project as the preparation time from
Concept review to Grant Funding Proposal approval was less than five months. The design team took

                                                  11
the lessons learnt from the Community Development Fund (CDF) project in the MDTF-N that
involved interventions in the education sector (primarily school construction). The design adopted a
strategy that in the project states where CDF was active, the delivery of school and TTIs construction
would be outsourced to CDF.

21.     BEP was also designed to go beyond providing education facilities. The reform of the school
curriculum and the pre-service teacher training program were intended to lay grounds for system-wide
reforms. These interventions were also expected to lay the foundations for the Bank and other partnersâ
longer-term engagement with Sudanâs education sector.

22.     In spite of the short preparation timeframe, the preparation was participatory and consultative.
Consultation with the four states was conducted. The consultation confirmed that direct support at the
state level was likely to produce faster results and stimulate a more targeted development of education.
State governmentsâ and State Ministries of General Education (SMoGEs)âs commitment had been
strong and their full participation at different levels ensured the project activities were incorporated
into the statesâ annual plans for 2009-2011.

23.      At appraisal, the design team identified the following risks associated with the project:

24.     Most of the risks identified here related to the lack of experience in the MoGE and SMoEs in
managing donor supported projects. The design team expected that for the project investment
activities (Component 1 and 2.3) CDF would bridge this capacity gap using its experience of
managing the CDF program in Sudan. Actual project implementation showed that while CDF had
experience with World Bank funded projects before, its commitment and capacity to implement the
construction activities for BEP was limited. There were significant delays in the planning,
procurement and execution of these contracts and the quality of on-site supervision was not
satisfactory. This led to the need to restructure the implementation arrangement of the construction-
related components.

25.    For the curriculum interventions, although the design team foresaw the political risk associated
with curriculum development and the potential tension between North and South Sudan, it was
expected that the MoU signed in 2009 between FMoE and MoE of South Sudan would enable the joint
review of the curriculum. The political process, however, went far beyond this premise and resulted in
the separation of South Sudan in 2011, making the unified North/South curriculum not possible.

2.2 Implementation

26.     The factors that affected the implementation of the project can be grouped into: (i) external
factors; and (ii) internal factors.

27.   The external factors consisted primarily of the political development leading to the split of
Sudan and South Sudan and the ethnic conflicts erupted in Blue Nile and South Kordofan states in
2011.

South Sudan/ Sudan split

28.     The CPA established the basis for power sharing pending the outcomes of elections;
constituted the Government of South Sudan (GoSS) with administrative authority over the 10 states of
the South; entrenched an oil revenue sharing agreement whereby the Government of National Unity
(GoNU) and GoSS divided evenly revenues derived from exploitation of oil wells in Southern Sudan.
It further provided for a referendum on the status of South Sudan. The outcome of referendum in
January 2011 led to creation of the new state of South Sudan in July 2011.

29.     The Southâs secession has had fundamental repercussions on Sudan as evidenced by significant
stresses in the macro-fiscal situation, the structure of the economy, and the political economy. The
most important and immediate was the loss of the oil revenue, aggravated by the several years of oil-
export driven growth, extravagant public investments, and expanded public employment. In political
economy terms, the secession has rendered the remaining territorial disputes with South Sudan (e.g.,
over Abyei, borders, etc.) and with other populations within Sudan (e.g. South Kordofan) particularly


                                                   13
difficult as the state views further compromise on territory as a threat to the integrity of the remaining
Sudan.

30.     The separation of South Sudan had impacted BEP in three ways. Fiscal resources available to
the sector became more constrained. Many statesâ and federal level education institutions experienced
personnel changes. These had indirectly impacted the implementation of BEP at the state level.
Finally and perhaps most notably, the development the unified curriculum was no longer possible.

Conflict in Blue Nile & South Kordofan states

31.      Even after the separation of South Sudan, not all conflict has been arrested and tensions
continue. In most regions of Sudan conflict is endemic at the local level. This was especially the case
as it related to competition over access to natural resources between pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and
settled farmers (including commercial farms). The most disruptive conflict remained the conflict in the
âThree Protocol Areasâ (Blue Nile and South Kordofan states and Abyei area) where previous peace
protocols had not yet been fully implemented. This conflict has been affecting Blue Nile and South
Kordofan states since late June 2011. Several schools in these two states had not been reachable by
the BEP team since the conflict began. In the end, due to this conflict the construction of five schools
and the TTI in South Kordofan needed to be cancelled. Seven of the project-built schools in Blue Nile
and South Kordofan remained closed to date.

32.      Factors that are internal to the project included: (i) the decision to delegate major construction
activities to CDF; and (ii) weak implementation capacity of implementing agencies (the education
ministries, at both federal and state levels as well as contractors. The choice to delegate the planning,
procurement and supervision of construction activities (schools and TTIs) to CDF was based on the
assessment that CDF had more experience with implementing World Bank-funded projects than the
Ministry of General Education in three of the four BEP states. However, CDF did not satisfactorily
deliver what was planned. The procurement plans were submitted late by the project and only
approved in June 2010, seven months after project effectiveness. Clearing of award recommendations
was often delayed by incomplete and/or incorrect Bid Evaluation Reports. The design and
procurement of the TTIs were also held back as CDF did not have the capacity to provide technical
specifications for the TTI design. Quality of the construction of the several schools was also affected
as CDF did not have sufficient staff dedicated to on-site supervision. This led to the need to
restructure the project in mid-2011 to revise this implementation arrangement (limiting CDF role to
existing schools and delegate states to be the implementing agencies for the remaining schools and
TTIs). The states, while having high ownership of the project activities, did also have capacity
constraint. By June 2012 another restructuring of implementation arrangement was done to
consolidate the implementation of the TTIsâ and Group 2 school construction to the central PIU. With
this restructuring and the stronger leadership and implementation capacity of the federal PIU, BEP
completed its activities by the new closing date of May 31, 2013. As to the project duration, BEP was
approved in May 2009 and was expected to close in June 2011, the same time as the MDTF-N. The
Project closing dates were therefore had to be extended twice following the extension of the mother
trust fund MDTF-N, which was initially extended to June 30, 2102 and then extended further to 2013.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

33.     The project M&E design included the following features: (i) Monitoring and evaluation will
focus on the components highest in investment, the access component and the teachersâ training sub-
component; (ii) Given that the number of schools to be supported under the project is small compared
to the number of schools in each locality and state, monitoring of output and outcomes will be
assessed at the schoolsâ level; and (iii) The project will use the existing capacities of M&E in the CDF
in the three states to be supported where the CDF will be involved in implementation.


                                                           15
34.     During implementation, the project followed the design principle of collecting data at each of
the project school. The baseline data collection was done by CDF but due to some questionable data
that needed subsequent verification, the project eventually relied on its own staff to carry out the M&E
function. Designated M&E officers were engaged at the federal and all four state coordination units.
With the support from the WB team, a detailed data collection protocol was developed, covering the
indicators contained in the result framework. The data was updated quarterly and shared with the WB
team. Data verification and spot check was conducted through field visits. After the project had closed,
the final monitoring report was prepared as part of the project exit and hand-over process.

35.      The M&E framework was utilized extensively for project monitoring purpose. Data related to
the result indicators (both at the PDO and component levels) were used to inform about the project
progress and performance. In particular, data on school enrolment informed the wider debate of
access to education and the challenge of retain students (boys and girls) in schools. Data on the
utilization of the project-provided facilities was also collected and reviewed.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

36.     Construction of schools and TTIs was classified as environment Category B which triggers OP
4.01. The project developed an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) that
describes measures to mitigate negative project impacts and the environmental monitoring
arrangements. These included: (i) Environmental considerations included as criteria for site selecting;
(ii) Environmental assessment would become an integral part of the infrastructure activities; and (iii)
Environmental guidelines to be followed and used. At the state level, the M&E officer was designated
as the focal point responsible for ensuring full implementation of the ESMF. The ESMF document
was translated into Arabic language and disclosed to stakeholders. The project completed the required
environmental forms for the ongoing schools.

37.     The project had no significant irreversible environmental and social impacts. Construction and
upgrading of school infrastructure had been at existing school sites, with no new sites acquired. The
availability of water in many schools was a challenge as there are no nearby sources of water. In
addition, several schools did not have fences to ensure the safety of students and protect the school
from livestock encroachment. It was agreed at Mid-Term Review that BEP would endeavor to address
the issue of water, fencing and trashcans using the available budget. Additionally, community
awareness about the importance of maintaining the school environment, along with informal action
plans led by the Project M&E officers had been developed.

Fiduciary

38.     BEP in general complied with the fiduciary requirements. The project appointed and
maintained procurement and financial management staff in the implementing units at the federal and
state levels. For procurement, the main challenge was the delay in submitting the procurement
plan/re-plan and bidding documents. For financial management, the project submitted the financial
reports on time although occasionally revisions were required. Audit reports were submitted timely
and the Bank provided comments and inputs to strengthen the project budgeting, accounting and
control processes.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
                                                  16
39.   At closing the project team had carried out a thorough project exit and hand-over, including the
hand-over of key outputs such as assets, data and documents to responsible agencies at the Federal
MoGE and State MoGEs.

40.     Implementation of BEP has served as the platform for deeper engagement of the WB and other
partners in the education sector in Sudan. In June 2011, the Bank together with the other primary
donors to the Sudanese education system commenced a series of meetings to support the work of the
MoGE to develop its strategic plan. The Status of the Education Sector in Sudan report (ESR, 2012)
produced by the MoGE, with technical support from World Bank and other partners, provided a
detailed diagnostic of the education sector and suggested underlying reasons for poor learning
performance, including teacher deployment; teacher utilization; distribution of textbooks; the learning
environment and the health status of learners. This ESR enabled Sudan to access financing to the
Global Partnership for Education (former FTI/EFA Catalytic Fund). The Basic Education Recovery
Project (BERP) was approved by GPE in March 2013, with the WB acting as the supervising entity.

41.     The BERP (US$76.5 million) aimed at improving the learning environment in targeted areas;
increasing the availability of textbooks; and strengthening education planning and management
mechanisms in the Sudan. BERP included (i) improving learning environment through classroom
construction and provision of school grants; (ii) increasing the availability of textbooks and learning
materials; and (iii) strengthening the monitoring and management mechanisms of the education system.

42.     BERP, therefore, is a follow-on project, taking BEP key interventions to larger scale as well as
addressing systemic sector challenges not covered by BEP. Specifically, BERP scales up the school
construction program to 10 states in Sudan with ten-fold increase in the number of classrooms to be
constructed. In addition to classroom construction, BERP will pilot a school grant component to
provide schools with additional resources to improve their learning conditions. BERP will go beyond
curriculum review to textbook development and distribution, a key constraint to improved learning
conditions in primary schools in Sudan. BERP will continue the English language textbooks
development that was initiated under BEP. Taking the experience of in-service teacher training in
BEP, BERP will help to develop system-wide teacher management database than can inform more
efficient deployment as well as professional development needs of teachers. Finally, BERP will take
the M&E culture developed in BEP to system level by operationalizing the sector Education
Management Information System (EMIS).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives

43.     BEPâs objective of increasing access to improved basic education in four selected states in
northern Sudan remains highly relevant with Sudanâs current context. Access to basic education had
increased in the last five years. However the conditions of learning in schools were very constrained
and limited. The Second Service Delivery Survey (SDS) conducted in 2010/2011 showed that: (i) Test
scores in mathematics among Grade 5 students were weak and lower in rural areas, for children from
poorer background and for boys; (ii) School catchment area was vast - a majority of rural students
lived far from schools; (iii) School infrastructure was generally poor or missing: 12 percent of rural
schools had no school building and students sat under trees. Another 13 percent of rural schools had a
roof but no walls. Many schools were inaccessible during the rainy season; (iv) Many schools lacked
                                                   17
drinking water and toilets, particularly in rural areas; (v) There were severe shortages in schools of
basic inputs such as desks, usable chalkboards and textbooks; (vi) The average actual school year was
much shorter than the official school year, indicating a substantial loss of instructional time; (vii) more
than 70 percent of teachers had no pre-service teacher training; and (viii) A significant share of the
non-salary operational costs was funded by parents or other members of the community. These
challenges demonstrated that the objectives and the interventions of BEP stayed highly relevant and
will continue to serve Sudanâs aspiration to improve its educational outcomes. Scaling up these
interventions will hopefully enable Sudan to move toward achieving the Education for All and the
Millennium Development Goals.

44.      The new WB Sudan Interim Strategy Note (covering the period 2014-2015) pointed to the
principle of partnership and focused the Bankâs engagement with the Government of Sudan and the
donors in two pillars: (i) Manage the economic transition; and (ii) Address socio-economic roots of
Conflict. The second pillar supported national and local programs for service delivery focusing on key
human development outcomes. BEPâs emphasis on improving access to quality education fit within
this pillar. The project was also consistent with the World Bank Africa Regional strategy focusing on
fragile states.

Relevance of design and implementation

45.     BEPâs relevance of design is assessed as Substantial. The design team had chosen the relevant
objective which remains appropriate even in the current context. The team had also designed
appropriate targeting mechanism to ensure that the project cater to the hard to reach locations and
focus on girls education and the disadvantaged. The selection of the project interventions was also
suitable. School construction, teachersâ pre-service and in-service training and improving curriculum
and learning materials are important to improving Sudan education sector outcomes. The chosen
interventions in BEP complimented other projects administered by the WB and other development
partners in the education sector. The design process also built community engagement to ensure that
the project outputs and outcomes can be sustained. Finally, making M&E an explicit function of the
project management structure was also valuable in ensuring that eventual project implementation
focus on results. The main short-coming in the design was the choice to outsource major construction-
related activities to CDF whose capacity and incentive to delivery for BEP was later shown limited.

46.    The project design was adjusted during the implementation to reflect the changes in the project
environment (Sudan/South Sudan separation and the conflict in Blue Nile and South Kordofan) and
the project management capacity and performance. This adaptation helped to improve the project
performance by the project end.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

47.     BEP was expected to increase access to improved basic education in four selected states in
northern Sudan. As the project was restructured in 2011 (no change in PDO but clarification and
revision of two of the PDO indicators), a split assessment of achievement of PDO before and after
restructuring was conducted.

48.    Overall the project achievement of PDO was assessed as Moderately Satisfactory (MS). This
was the combined assessment for two periods, before and after the restructuring. The achievement
before restructuring (42 percent disbursement) was Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU).           The
achievement after restructuring (58 percent disbursement) was Satisfactory (S).

                                                    18
49.     Before restructuring â The achievement of PDO was assessed as Moderately Unsatisfactory
(MU) because while there was a modest increase in the enrolment of students in project schools and a
significant improvement in knowledge of teachers, several project activities had not been completed.
Specifically:

ï·        For the objective of increasing access, at the time of the restructuring in 2011, there was a
         modest increase in enrolment (4 percent) in the project schools but there was yet an increase in
         the average number of functional days of the project schools. The main reason was that
         construction of the project schools had not been completed.

ï·        For to the objective of improving basic education, the project had provided training for 80
         percent of teachers in the four states in the areas of core curriculum, mathematics, English and
         Arabic. A sample of 2520 teachers took part in the pre and post training assessments. The
         result of the post training assessment, available after the restructuring, showed a significant
         improvement in the knowledge of teachers across all four domains. The construction and
         upgrading of the four TTIs had not been completed and the work on curriculum review and
         revision was limited.

51.     After restructuring â the achievement of PDO after the restructuring was assessed as
Satisfactory (S) due to (i) the impressive enrolment increase in the project active schools; (ii) a
significant increase in the average days active Category B schools were open; and (iii) improved
teachersâ knowledge; (iv) improved Pre-service B.Ed. program; (v) improved curriculum and

textbooks in English language; and (vi) improved capacity for teacher training of two TTIs.
Specifically:

52.     For the goal of increasing access to education in project schools, the active project schools
recorded impressive enrolment increase, in particular in the lower grades. The increase was particular
strong for girls who registered 16.8 percent increase. The increase for boys was also high, 9.6 percent,
but certainly not as remarkable as for girls. One reason for the lower enrolment for boys was the rush
of boys and even male teachers to the areas with newly found gold.

53.     The number of days that Category B project schools stayed open was also encouraging.
Category B schools are not open during rainy and extremely hot months (depending on where the
State is located) due to the quality of school infrastructure. Since construction of the Category B
schools was only completed in 2012 for most schools, data was only collected in last school year for
six remaining Category B schools which were located in Blue Nile (3 schools) and Red Sea (3
schools) (2012/2013). On average, the six remaining Category B schools were open for 149.6 school
days missing the PDO target of 160.3 days. Five of the seven schools were open between 159-160
days with the exception of Shindoday School in Red Sea which was only open 91 days of the school
year due to major challenges around teacher retention.

54.     With regards to the goal of improving basic education, 11,380 teachers in the four states
received this in-service training during the project life. Most of these teachers only finished secondary
schools and did not have any teacher training qualification before becoming teachers. They also did
not receive any in-service training prior to the project. The pre training test showed very low level of
knowledge across the four training domains. Teachers lacked knowledge of the core curriculum,
mathematics and English and the only subject that they seemed most knowledgeable was Arabic. The
post-training test results showed marked improvement in their knowledge for the core curriculum,
mathematics and Arabic. Improvement in their English is less significant. This is to be expected
given English is not the main medium of communication for these teachers. While improved teachersâ
knowledge cannot be equated automatically with improved quality of basic education, ensuring that
teachers have adequate knowledge for the subjects that they teach is an essential step towards
improving quality. Teachers in Sudan lacked basic knowledge and opportunities to receive
professional development. BEP, therefore, targeted the right audience by providing un-qualified
teachers with the basic in-service training program.

55.     Overall, BEP has made significant achievements towards the PDO. Across all project-
supported schools that are active, enrolment increased for both boys and girls and these students now
have access to better school infrastructure. Schools have been constructed with permanent structure
with adequate furniture, water supply and other learning materials. Teachers, albeit facing many
challenges in their job, received timely in-service training in the areas where they were not confident
and needed help. In particular, for teaching English (the subject that most teachers identified as most
difficult for them), BEP has helped to developed the new English curriculum and new English
textbooks and teachersâ guide for Grade 3. These new textbooks focused on enhancing the English
speaking and listening skills and include many activities with communicative and child-friendly
approaches. Future teachers can also benefit from the newly developed Bachelor of Education pre-
service training program, supported by BEP and the improved facilities at the two TTIs in North
Kordofan and Red Sea.

3.3 Efficiency

56.       The economic analysis at the appraisal stage was not specific to BEP but covered broad fiscal
projections for the education sector expansion. As BEP interventions were very small (30 schools
amongst more than two thousands schools in the four states and approximately fifteen thousand
schools in Sudan), this exercise was not repeated at the ICR stage. Rather, a project-specific unit cost
analysis was done in late 2012 for the school construction component (which involved more than 40
percent of project financing). Cost analysis allowed for cost-comparisons across projects with respect
to their implementation arrangements and technology. The methodology provides disaggregate
information of both the direct cost of construction, i.e. the cost of the contractorâs contract, and the
total project cost, resulting from the addition the direct cost and all the indirect costs, for instance, the
management and supervision costs. BEP costs were compared with projects administered by UNICEF,
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and CDF in various states of Northern Sudan.

57.      The average unit costs for BEP were USD189 per square meter; with South Kordofan
registered lowest unit cost of USD158 and Blue Nile registered highest unit cost of USD213. Unit
costs of projects managed by UNICEF were USD326. Unit costs of the CDF project were USD213.
The analysis therefore showed that with comparable quality of construction, BEP schools registered


                                                             21
lowest unit costs, comparable with projects managed by Non-governmental organzations (see Annex
3). This result is very encouraging given the schools locations are in the hard to reach areas.

58.      The costs for teacher in-service training (about 20 percent of project financing) stayed within
the budget. The number of teachers trained by the project resources was slightly higher than the target,
yet the total costs of training remained the same as planned. The costs for curriculum review and
revision was also comparable to the plan. The costs for TTI upgrading were only 65 percent as the
resources planned for two TTIs were reallocated to additional school construction.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

59.    The overall rating of the project outcome is Moderately Satisfactory. The project PDO remains
highly relevant in todayâs Sudan education sector context. The relevance of project design was
substantial. The project made significant achievements toward the PDO as evidenced by the improved
values of the key PDO indicators at the project end. Finally the project costs were reasonable.

60.   The main short-coming in the progress towards the achievement of outcomes was the fact that
some of the project outputs were only partially delivered.

61.     Some factors were beyond the project control, in particular the separation of South Sudan and
the ethnic conflicts in Blue Nile and South Kordofan. Internal factors such as capacity constraint of
CDF and the federal and state MoGEs in project management also held the project back from fully
satisfactory outcome achievement.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.    A number of social issues formed the basis for the project design. These were: a) gender equity
in access to basic education services; b) the challenge of providing quality education to nomadic
communities; c) the importance of supporting education in schools operating under the Sudan Peopleâs
Liberation Movement (SPLA) in South Kordofan; and d) ensuring community involvement in project
implementation.

Poverty

63.     BEP provided direct support to four of the states with high poverty incidence in northern Sudan,
contributing to improving enrollment and reducing inequality and disparity across the states. As the
project resources were limited, the selection of the localities within these four states to receive support
was also pro-poor and geared towards the educationally disadvantaged:

ï·      Localities with the lowest enrolment rates.
ï·      Localities with the lowest girlsâ enrolment rates.
ï·      Localities that have schools where learning is on-going and is lacking the proper school
       facility.
ï·      Localities where no other development partners were operating.
ï·      Localities where some school feeding programs were running.
ï·      In North Kordofan provisions were made to cater for localities with nomadic population.


                                                   22
Gender

64.     The project has a special focus on girlsâ education aiming at reducing the access gender gap in
the four states. A number of the schools selected were girls only schools, other schools were supported
with latrines for girls to ensure that factors inhibiting girlsâ enrolment are reduced, and a number of
schools were supported by female teachersâ housing that would ensure the sustainability of female
teachers in remote areas. The project M&E system paid particular emphasis on monitoring this aspect
and indeed the improvement of girlsâ enrolment in the project schools is higher than that of the boys.

Social development

65.     With the CDF involved at the project start, approach to community engagement similar to that
of the CDF project was used to ensure communities were consulted at every step of the project
implementation.      In fact across the project-supported schools, communities embraced the
responsibility for monitoring the quality and utilization of the infrastructure and especially the
financing of the schoolsâ operating costs. This showed great commitment to their children education
and to the sustainability of the schools in their communities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

66.     With BEP experience in school construction, some of the State MoGEs have now decided to
strengthen their engineering office with the view to adopt standard construction guidelines and
coordinate all school construction projects in their localities.

67.     In addition to strengthening teachersâ capacity through in-service training, BEP had supported
the development of the new curriculum in English language. The process for developing the
curriculum and the associated textbooks and teachers guides, with support from the British Council,
will likely serve as benchmark for further development of learning and teaching materials in higher
grades.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

68.     The officials from the Ministry of General Education confirmed that MDTF-N support has
been instrumental during a time where there had been a decrease in government revenue and an
increase in population. BEP marked the return of the Bank to the education sector in Sudan and paved
the way for a larger scale support to the sector through the follow-on Basic Education Recovery
Project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Interviews with school directors, teachers and parents in several project schools in North Kordofan
state showed:

(i)     an overwhelming sense of appreciation from all three groups (school directors, teachers and
        parents) for the support that BEP brought in terms of adequate school facilities
(ii)    a significant increase in the student enrolment, in particular in the lower grades of primary
        education
(iii)   that retention of students up to Grade 8 remained a challenge as that students lack textbooks
        and learning materials, making learning in higher grades difficult

                                                  23
(iv)   that teachers need more professional development to help them upgrade knowledge in key
       subjects as well as acquire effective pedagogical skills
(v)    that in remote schools teacher dormitories help to attract and retain teachers; and that schools
       rely on parents to support for their additional teachersâ salaries and operating expenses

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

70.     The project development outcomes are significant and observable, but the risk to sustain these
outcomes is significant. The maintenance of the physical assets such as school infrastructure and the
related facilities will not likely face substantial challenge. Unless conflict happens, parents are
committed to making the schools sustainable for their children. The schools will likely continue to
attract students, in particular for the beginning grades as they are safe and well-built. The challenges
to sustain the enrolment and increase the retention of students in the higher grades are to do with: (i)
capacity to attract and retain teachers; (ii) capacity to provide teachers with much needed professional
development to enable them to teach effectively; (iii) capacity to provide other learning conditions
(textbooks and learning materials) to students to help them acquire basic skills needed to attain in
higher grades; and (iv) external factors such as family conditions and wider country socio-economic
development.

71.     The risk to making the two TTIs in North Kordofan and Red Sea to become effective agents
for teacher training reform is also significant. The two TTIs, one upgraded and the other newly built,
will need to have a clear strategy to use the new facilities for their teacher training mission. Since the
two TTIs were only completed in February 2013, there was insufficient time to assess the capacity of
these two TTIs in this respect. A simple analysis of the business strategies of these two TTIs showed
that the El Obied TTI in North Kordofan has a clear three year strategic plan which takes advantage of
the newly upgrade facilities. By August 2013, more than 2000 teachers have received training in the
newly upgraded facility. The TTI in Port Sudan, Red Sea, while becoming a massive infrastructure,
has yet got a sustainable development strategy and may run a risk of having costly maintenance
expense.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

72.     The Bankâs performance in ensuring quality at entry was assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.
The team had selected relevant objective for the project. The targeting mechanism ensured that the
project catered to the hard to reach areas. Improving girlsâ education had been made an explicit
objective of the project. In general the selection of the project activities was also appropriate. School
construction, teachersâ pre-service and in-service training and improving curriculum and teaching and
learning materials were essential for Sudan education sector. The team had paid due attention to
designing a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework and to making M&E an explicit function of
the project management structure. This was valuable in ensuring that eventual project implementation
focused on results.

73.     The project design contained some short-comings such as: (i) overly high target for PDO
indicator on expected increase in student enrolment; (ii) vague definitions of the two PDO indicators
for number of days school are functional and positive evaluation of teacher in-service training; (iii)
over-reliance on CDF as a delivery institution for the school and TTI construction components; and
                                                 24
(iv) optimism for a unified North/South Sudan curriculum reform which later fell through with the
political separation of the two countries.

(b) Quality of Supervision

74.     The Bankâs performance in supervision of the project implementation is assessed as
Satisfactory.

75.     At the task team level, the supervision team took over from the design team without any
interruptions to the Bankâs providing technical assistance and fiduciary supervision. The supervision
team conducted intensive supervision missions in the first year of the project implementation. The
supervision missions always focused on: (i) monitoring the PDO indicatorsâ values and discuss the
likelihood of the project meeting its objectives; (ii) updating the outputs by components; (iii)
providing technical assistance and capacity building on project management and M&E; (iv) providing
support on the ground including intensified supervision of the construction components; (v) identify
key challenges for improving the project implementation; (vi) raising these issues to higher levels of
management (government and Bank); and (vii) identifying strategies to address the challenges,
including the two project restructurings.

76.     At the CMU level, regular supervision of the project performance was also recorded. CMU
had been active in: (i) encouraging task teams to be candid on assessing the project PDO achievement
and its challenges; and (ii) ensuring that task teams focus on key issues pertaining to the project
implementation.      At the portfolio level, the MDTF-N had engaged a Monitoring Agent
(PriceWaterhouseCoopers) to provide additional on-site supervision of the 15 projects in the MDTF-N.
The Monitoring Agent provided regular quarterly assessments of all the projects including BEP, using
the same six domains in the WBâs system for assessing Implementation Progress (overall
implementation progress; financial management; project management; counterpart funding;
procurement and monitoring and evaluation). By March 2013, the Monitoring Agent rated BEP
satisfactory on all the six domains and considered BEP as among the top three best-performing
projects in the MDTF-N portfolio.

77.     The SMU also provided active support to the task team during supervision. The recruitment of
the local education specialist strengthened the direct support to the client. The SMU also ensured a
smooth transition and back-up of Task Team Leaders during 2011 and 2012. Advice was given to the
task teams to (i) sustain the M&E focus; (ii) intensify project supervision; (iii) strengthen project
management; (iv) re-arrange the project implementation structure; and (v) adjust the project activities
that became stalled. The project assessment by the task team and SMU through-out the project life
was MS for both PDO and IP, suggesting that the teams remained cautious and candid.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

78.    The overall Bank performance is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory. This includes the
Moderately Satisfactory rating for the design stage. The design of project objectives and interventions
was relevant but the choice of the implementation arrangement and the risk assessment had some
short-comings. Bank performance during supervision was Satisfactory with consistent focus on the
monitoring of PDO achievement and pro-active restructuring to ensure that project activities were
completed and key outputs were delivered.

5.2 Borrower Performance

                                                  25
(a) Government Performance

79.    The performance of the Grantee at the government level is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory.
The Government showed its commitment to the project through active participation in the project
design, mobilizing the federal and state ministries of general education. Several Director Generals
(DG) across the states committed state finances towards the project despite the fiscal constraints they
were facing.

80.    During implementation, the government appointed the project personnel according to the
project structure. The Project Steering Committee did meet to review the project progress and
deliberate on the project implementation issues. Resolutions to these issues did come, but with delays.
For example, the decision to reallocate resources that stalled due to the conflict in Blue Nile and South
Kordofan states to new localities/states was challenging and required an extended period of time. The
new FMoGE minister provided support and leadership in resolving this difficult situation.

81.     The BEP was one of the first projects to be funded by the MDTF without counterpart funding.
During project preparation, the GoNU agreed to support the project coordination units with office
space, equipment and vehicles (and other items for the schools such as desks, chairs, textbooks etc.)
while the BEP would fund operating costs related to the project. This was a verbal agreement with no
written documentation of what exactly would be required of the GoNU/MoGE in terms of funding to
support the project. As a consequence, the MoGE did not have the required budget to support the
project at inception which, in turn, constrained effective implementation of the project. The issue was
later resolved under the leadership of the state and federal DGs as well as Undersecretary of the
MoGE. In October 2012 there was another issue of counterpart funding related to the payment of
taxes for the TTIs in Red Sea and North Kordofan States which was only resolved by the time of the
project closing.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

82.     The performance of the Implementing Agency is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory. The
project implementation structure was set up with the Central Coordination Unit (CCU) and four State
Coordination Units (SCUs) as per the project design. These units were staffed with managers,
procurement, financial and M&E personnel. Implementation of construction-related components was
challenging as CDF did not have full ownership of the BEP activities and did not deliver satisfactorily,
leading to the first restructuring that limited CDFâs role to 15 schools only.

83.    Amongst the CCU and SCUs, there was at times insufficient communication and collaboration.
In 2011, internal management issues within the Central Coordination Unit (CCU) occurred and needed
to be raised to the political leadership of the MoGE. By June 2012, a consolidation of the five
implementing agencies was done, with the centralized implementation unit being responsible for the
remaining construction (schools and TTIs) as well as the work on English curriculum development.

84.     Management of the project had greatly improved since the PIU was fully staffed and functional.
PIU teams had been proactive in implementation of all aspects of the project and coordination with the
State level officials has been good. The PIU team led by a dynamic project manager was key to the
successful completion of this project. The consolidated PIU team successfully disbursed and
implemented over $4 million in less than one year, which was an incredible given the country context.
By the project closing, the team had delivered all expected results and disbursed 99% of the grant
proceeds.

                                                   26
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

85.     The combined rating for the overall granteeâs performance is Moderately Satisfactory.
Government performance was Moderately Satisfactory because although the commitment to the
project objective was high, government could not timely provide the parallel financing for project
management and was slow in making decision with respect to project resource re-allocation. The
Implementing agency performance was Moderately Satisfactory because the implementation capacity
was weak during the first two and a half year of the project an only picked up during the last year with
the change in the PIU leadership.

6. Lessons Learned

86.    Community engagement is powerful, even in conflict situations â BEP experience showed that
communitiesâ engagement led to the ownership of the new school facilities. Communities are
committed to ensuring their school sustainability. Communities also understand the challenges facing
the schools and are well positioned to contribute to the identification of appropriate interventions.
With technical and managerial support, communities can be empowered to take on the responsibility
of some school level project activities.

87.     Targeting and resource allocation requires that bottom-up need assessment be balanced with
top-down planning and monitoring â BEP allocated approximately the same amount of resources to
the four states, even though these states have very different education system characteristics (different
size of student population, GER, number of schools and teachers etc.). A closer look at Red Sea and
North Kordofan, the two states that were not affected by the conflict, illustrated very different resource
allocation approaches within BEP. Red Sea, which had the GER of only 37 percent and had almost
four times less teachers than that of North Kordofan, chose to allocate the majority (almost 90%) of
BEP funding for the building of the new TTI in Port Sudan. In contrast, North Kordofan, with GER at
78%, chose to dedicate two third of BEP resources for school construction and used the remaining
fund to only upgrade the existing TTI in El Obied.

88.     Data is the cornerstone for project targeting, implementation and result monitoring â BEP
efforts in collecting and updating data at the school level helped to inform key stakeholders whether
the project was on targets and what were the key challenges facing the implementing entities. In
addition to reporting (paper-based and by telephone), site visits to verify data were also instrumental in
ensuring that project decision making was based on valid data. For example, project teams should be
cautioned against targeting school construction in very remote areas. Some of these areas will not
have access to other services such as water and adequate roads, which makes it difficult to attract
teachers and students alike.

89.     Curriculum reforms are difficult, requiring (i) political wills; (ii) capacity to articulate vision
for reform; and (iii) capacity to embrace best international practices and integrate them with the
countryâs social, economic, cultural and education realities. The separation of Sudan and South Sudan
superseded the efforts to develop a unified school curriculum as part of BEP. Even after the
separation, the revision of the curriculum and textbooks of one subject, English, was challenging and
required external technical support.

90.     Interventions to improve the teaching force are also complex, involving teacher preparation,
recruitment and remuneration, professional development, and deployment, especially in a
decentralized education system. Strategies to address the weaknesses of the teaching force can be
organized into short, medium and longer term measures. Adequate time will be required for measures
                                                 27
aiming at institutional change within the system. BEP focused on provision of short-term remedial
training to unqualified teachers. To sustain the motivation of teachers towards professional
development, more opportunities for joint learning can be provided through developing communities
of practice amongst teachers at the local level.

91.     Interventions to provide education infrastructure need to take into account the local market
situation and the capacity of contractors to deliver â As project school sites tend to locate in more
remote areas, it is not easy to attract competent contractors that can deliver. BEP works contracts were
medium-sized. A combination of low post-qualification financial and technical criteria and of poor
procurement capacity of local bid opening and evaluation committees could lead to contract being
awarded to poorly qualified contractors. The works can be organized in smaller bid packages awarded
through local competitive bidding, thus opening business opportunities to a larger number of smaller
contractors, some of them closer to the concerned communities, therefore increasing competition.

92.    Institutional assessment needs to be integral part of the design, taking into account both
capacity and incentive to deliver of the proposed implementing agencies.            Assigning the
implementation responsibility to the agency that has ownership of the project outputs increases the
chances of project activities being implemented satisfactorily.

93.    Ensuring high quality leadership is critical for the project success - Leadership quality was
perhaps the most important factor in BEPâs improved performance.

94.    Project institutional arrangements need to be clear, with (i) job descriptions and expected
performance level benchmarks for each positions/units, (ii) communication channels to be set up and
maintained; and (iii) capacity building program appropriate to the roles and responsibilities and
capabilities of each teams.

95.     Projects, especially projects in more fragile states, are subject to external and sometimes
unforeseen factors â In this environment outcome target setting can benefit from tools such as
sensitivity analysis to make sure that external factors are taken into consideration and that caution can
be exercised.

96.     Last but not least, project teams including both the government and the Bank need to stay
flexible and agile to make necessary adjustments when the project context and situation so command
while maintaining the focus on the project development objective(s).

Annex 2. Outputs by Components

Component 1: Enhancing Access to Basic Education

Targets at appraisal: In total, the component was to finance construction and rehabilitation in 30
schools for around 220 classrooms, 29 teachers housing units, 9 school fences, 60 offices, and 47
toilets.

Actual implementation: The outputs of construction are reported in two groups of schools: (i) schools
in four states in the original design; and (ii) new schools in NK and BN added after (the second)
restructuring/reallocation of funds from conflicted areas:

For Group 1, although 30 schools were identified at appraisal, by the project end only 25 of these
schools were constructed and rehabilitated because the remaining 5 schools were located in the
conflict areas in BN and SK and their construction was suspended due to the conflict. For Group 2,
after the second project restructuring in June 2012 whereby funds originally allocated for TTI
upgrading in BN and SK were reallocated, five new schools in NK and BN were identified for
construction/rehabilitation.

In addition to construction activities, the project also used remaining funds (around $870,000) to
supply classroom furniture (student and teacher desks and chairs), dormitory furniture, water pumps
and water tanks as well as learning materials for students (pens, pencils, notebooks and teaching
materials) to the project schools.

Component 2: Contributing to enhancing the quality of basic education. This component has
three sub-components

Sub-Component 2.1: Curriculum review.

Target at appraisal: The project design foresaw an evaluation of the basic education curriculum and
suggestion of changes necessary to enhance quality and relevance of the curriculum to post
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA 2005) era, i.e. to include the multi-religious, multi-ethnic and
multi-lingual reality of Sudan. Based on this evaluation a draft curriculum framework will have to be
developed and discussed in a national forum.

Actual implementation: The Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005 necessitated a joint curriculum
between North and South Sudan. This process, however, has been mired by political issues and
developments that culminated in the separation of South Sudan in July 2011. In retrospect the desire
to have a unified curriculum was out of sync with the countriesâ political dynamics.

The uncertainties during 2010/2011 held back the direction and consensus for curriculum reform. For
example, there was no real agreement for a fundamental issue such as language of instruction. The
policy in North Sudan was to use Arabic as the medium of instruction but in regions in the South
English was deemed to be the medium of instruction.

In this uncertain environment, the project did help to organize ten workshops at the federal level. The
workshops, while at the times of their organization seemed random, can be grouped into three themes:

Curriculum related

   ï·   School curriculum
   ï·   Mathematics education
   ï·   Teaching and vocation subjections
   ï·   Language in education (Arabic, English and French)
   ï·   School curriculum activities

Education system related:

   ï·   School supervision
   ï·   The pattern of school system
   ï·   Education of internally displaced and out of school children
   ï·   Literacy and adult education
   ï·   School environment
   ï·   Counseling and guidance

Teacher education related:

   ï·   Basic School Teacher Education & Training (B.ED) Program

Following these workshops at the national level, discussion at State level on curriculum issues was
held in all States, with the exception of South Sudan.
                                                  31
In addition, the project also helped to adapt Arabic language materials for speakers of âThittireâ in
South Kordofan basic schools. Specialists in teaching Arabic for non-Arabic speakers were
commissioned to carry out contextual analysis of Arabic readers for the first and second graders. Two
outputs came out of this process: (i) Book One for teaching and writing âThittireâ using Arabic
characters to be used as companion; and (ii) Book Two introduces broad but simple reading materials
in "Thittire" written in Arabic characters to facilitate transition from the native language to the use of
Arabic as the medium of instruction.

This sub-component also produced the new pre-service Bachelor of Education program. This B.Ed
program, developed by a committee of experts in consultation with Sudanese deans of faculties of
education and teacher training institutions and teacher education specialists, comprised of the
following: (i) rationale; (ii) aims and objectives; (iii) expected learning outcomes (expressed as
knowledge, skills, competencies, values and attitudes of student teachers; (iv) content (course topics,
themes, units and modules â both compulsory and elective); (v) content-appropriate teaching and
learning strategies; (vi) strategies for assessing students; (vi) references and guidelines for program
improvement

Development of English curriculum

Following the separation of South Sudan in July 2011, this sub-component was again refocused solely
on the development and writing of basic education English language textbooks. The Ministry of
General Education decided that English language will be introduced at Grade 3 from the academic
year of 2014/2015. Currently English language is taught from Grade 5 so the existing textbooks,
SPINE, only cover Grade 5-8.

The project supported the National Center for Curriculum and Educational Research (NCCER) to
work closely with the British Council to develop course books for Grades 3 and 4.

The result of all these efforts has been the completion of Grade 3 Manuscript: a Pupilâs Book, an
Activity Book and a Teacherâs Guide. A Sudanese artist has been selected by the NCCER to produce
the pictures/illustrations for the design of Grade 3 books. The syllabus of Grade 4 has also been
developed and the manuscripts will be developed in BERP. The publishing of Grade 3 as with all
other phases of its production can be treated as a pilot and can be used as a model of good practice for
the future production of Grade 4 and all subsequent books all the way up to Grade 8.

                                                     Overall assessment: PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

Sub-Component 2.2: In-service teacher training

Target at appraisal: In-service training was to be provided in Arabic, English, mathematics and core
programs to a selected group of teachers across the four states. The modules to be used for the training,
developed by ISETI with support from UNICEF, were common across states. The target population to
receive in-service training included teachers with only secondary education (without a diploma) and
university B.Ed teachers. The target number of teachers to be trained was 11,350 (1200 in Red Sea,
3760 in North Kordofan, 1920 in Blue Nile and 4500 in South Kordofan).

Actual implementation:


                                                   32
100 percent of the target numbers of teachers were trained on Mathematics, English, Arabic and the
Core Program. 69 percent of the teachers trained were female. The majority of teachers (40 percent)
were trained in the core program (which is for Grade 1-3 students), 20 percent in Arabic, 20 percent in
Mathematics and 20 percent in English.

The trainees were divided into cohorts of 40 participants subject-wise and trained simultaneously over
a period of one year and a half. The length of training varied between 15 to 21 days according to the
training modules of each subject. Trainers were from INSETI and TTIs. Although the training started
later than planned, by mid-2012 the project completed the target training programs. The training
content was based on modules which were developed in the mid-1990s when the curriculum was last
revised, and moderately updated in the early 2000s. Feedback by the teachers attended these training
include: (i) the duration of the training was short; (ii) the content is basic and introductory in nature;
(iii) wishes to received longer training that can lead to certification; and (iv) time of the training to be
during summer.

The results of the pre training test showed low levels of subject knowledge across all four domains and
that trainees are in desperate need of help in how to deal with the subject matter, teaching skills,
planning and evaluation. The post-training test registered significant improvement in the participantsâ
knowledge (28% increase in the Core program, 19% increase in mathematics, 9% increase in English
and 33% increase in Arabic). This improvement is encouraging, albeit from a very low base.

                                                                                   Overall assessment: ACHIEVED

Sub-Component 2.3: Physical upgrading to a number of TTIs in the four states

Targets at appraisal: This sub-component aimed to increase the capacity of training and enhance the
learning environment in four TTIs in the four states. The TTIs to be supported by the were Al-Dalang
TTI in South Kordofan (rehabilitations and additions), Ganoub Al-Roseirus TTI in Blue Nile (new),
Al-Obied TTI in North Kordofan (additions and rehabilitation), and Port Sudan TTI in Res Sea State
(new).

Actual implementation: The TTI in Ganoub Al-Reseirus in Blue Nile was not constructed because the
location presented a challenge given that the soil conditions are unsuitable for foundations. Moreover,
the location is not well connected by a road, which raises the question of whether teachers can feasibly
be trained there. In addition, given the existing TTI in Damazine is not being adequately utilized; there
is insufficient justification to build another TTI in the Blue Nile state, in a more remote location. The
TTI in Dalang in South Kordfan was also not constructed due to security reasons. The funding
planned for these two TTIs were reallocated to Component 1 for additional school construction.



                                                             33
The project, therefore, only funded the construction of two TTIs: (i) building of a new TTI in Port
Sudan (Red Sea) and (ii) upgrading of an existing TTI in El Obied (North Kordofan). Construction of
these two TTIs experienced significant delays due to (i) the inability of the CDF and an independent
consultant to provide good quality schematic designs for the TTIs; and (ii) poor performance of on-site
supervision. With intensified contract management and on-site supervision, by February 2013 the
construction of these two TTIs was completed and the new facilities were handed over to the States.

Component 3: Monitoring, Evaluation and Project Management

Project management: The component financed personnel/units responsible for the implementation at
the central (CCU) and statesâ levels (SCUs). Those personnel were not to come from the public service
and recruited on competitive basis. Operational costs also covered the management costs of the CDF
and the Engineering Office in Red Sea States, operational travel expenses and the costs of workshops
organized during the project. The project Operations Procedures Manual included procedures for staff
compensation as well as travel and workshops.

The project structure (PSC, CCU and 4 SCUs) was established and staffed according to the design.

                    Targeted schools and TTIs


The Project Steering Committee met once every quarter with the participation and leadership the state
DGs of MoGE, the DG for Planning at the Federal level, the Undersecretary of the MoGE, the BEP
team and other stakeholders.

With this organizational structure, project management in terms of planning, procurement and contract
supervision was moderately unsatisfactory. In the three states where procurement is delegated to
CDF, clearing of award recommendations was often delayed by incomplete and/or incorrect Bid
Evaluation Reports. The procurement plans were submitted late by the project and only approved in
June 2010, seven months after project effectiveness. The design and procurement of the TTIs were
also held back as CDF lacked the capacity to provide technical specifications for TTI design.

The financial management arrangements were acceptable. The Project installed the accounting
software. The CCU drafted FM policies and procedures manual. The issuance of financial reports was
generally timely. With respect to safeguards, the CCU coordinated a training workshop on the
environmental and social management framework for all the SCUs. The CCU submitted quarterly
reports in a regular and timely manner.

The main constraint in managing the project initially was the lack of parallel co-financing from the
MoGE to support the CCU and SCUs with office space, equipment and transportation. These issues
were largely resolved by the second half of 2011. There is room for increased communication,
collaboration and sharing of knowledge and resources across implementing agencies and SCUs.

In the first restructuring (June 2011), the project had limited the scope of CDF to implementing 15
schools only and engaged other entities (State Ministry of Urban Planning and State MoEâs
Engineering office) to implement the remaining schools and the TTIs.




                                                   35
In the second restructuring (June 2012), the project organizational structure was simplified by
centralizing all remaining project implementation activities to the Central PIU (as major state-led
activities has been completed).

Management of the project has greatly improved since the PIU was centralized in Khartoum. The
team has been proactive in implementation of all aspects of the project and coordination with the State
level officials has been good. By the project closing, the team had delivered all expected results and
disbursed 99% of the grant proceeds.

Monitoring and Evaluation: the M&E system was designed to focus on the components with highest in
investment, the access component and the teachersâ training sub-component. Given that the number of
schools to be supported under the project is small compared to the number of schools in each locality
and state, monitoring of output and outcomes will be assessed at the schoolsâ level. The project would
use the existing capacities of M&E in the CDF in the three states to be supported where the CDF
would be involved in implementation.

In accordance with the project M&E design, the project collected data on students, teachersâ and
school characteristics of all project schools. The baseline was done by CDF but with some delays and
some of the data was questionable. The project then instituted M&E specialist in each of the four
states to help with data collection, monitoring and school/community visits rather than relying on
CDF. The WB team provided thorough technical assistance to the project M&E team to develop and
maintain the monitoring framework.

The MTR confirmed that all schools have been visited at least one time by State Coordinators and
multiple times by State M&E Officers, which has been essential in monitoring outputs as well as
responding to the changing needs of stakeholders. The mission proposed incorporating information on
site visits within the BEP quarterly reports.

The expiration of staff contracts in Dec. 2011, without a plan for recruitment or retention of key staff,
left major holes in implementation and M & E, causing delays in project activities and reporting. It
was these delays that caused the downgrading of project implementation from MS to MU during the
April 2012 ISR submission. This situation was subsequently rectified with the World Bank sharing
the backup data and tables on file and the Monitoring Agent providing informal input as needed.

With the second restructuring in June 2012, the M&E function was also centralized to the PIU. The
M&E team continued to collect data from each of the schools and visit all the target schools under the
project as well as continue supervision of new construction. The PIU M&E team had also been
proactive in communicating with all the schools under the BEP project and raising issues/challenges to
State and Federal Ministry officials. The team had been working closely with communities to better
understand reasons why children were dropping out and ways to improve teacher retention, recording
available resources for schools and how the resources were utilized to enhance the learning
environment for students.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

In November 2012, a stocktaking exercise of school construction project was undertaken. The
exercise covered: old World Bank-, IDB-financed and UNESCO-supported projects in the Khartoum
area; UNICEF-financed projects in Kassala, Red Sea and Darfur States; MTDF-financed MoGEâs
project in Blue Nile, South and North Kordofan, and Red Sea States; MTDF-financed CDF project in
Blue Nile, Kassala and both Kordofan States; and projects by NGOs such as ZOA and CRS in Darfour
States. This exercise allows compiling and comparing resulting outputs in terms of cost-efficiency, in
particular vis-Ã -vis the Basic Education Project.

To assess the efficiency of BEP, various cost analysis allows for cost-comparisons across projects with
respect to their implementation arrangements and technology. The cost comparisons are focusing on
the blocks of classrooms, and only take into account the tax-free gross square meter. The methodology
provides disaggregate information of both the direct cost of construction, i.e. the cost of the
contractorâs contract, and the total project cost, resulting from the addition the direct cost and all the
indirect costs, for instance, the management and supervision costs, as far as they are known. The four
groups of projects are the following.
   ï·     UNICEF project with Italy Funds implemented by Kassala and Red Sea State administration;
   ï·     UNICEF-funded projects implemented by NGOs in Darfur States;
   ï·     NGO projects using SSB technology in Darfur Sates;
    ï·    BEP projects financed by MTDF and implemented through by different agencies, in Blue Nile,
         North and South Kordofan and Red Sea States,
   ï·     CDF-managed projects financed by MTDF in North and South Kordofan and Blue Nile States.

 The lowest global unit costs â around 170-190 US$/m2 -- are achieved through both NGOs and BEP, i.e. through totally
 different approaches: a) NGO managing projects by delegation from UNICEF and b) the BEPâs PIU supervising projects managed
 by various managing entities such as States, and CDF

 CDF global unit cost is the second higher â 300 US$/m2 -- because its management costs are low, therefore, global unit cost of
 NGO working for UNICEF/Italy, have surpassed CDFâs one

 The highest global unit costs â average 325 US$/m2 -- is achieved by States implementing projects with UNICEF/Italy funds,
 because high indirect costs are topping already medium-high construction costs.

The report concluded that BEP has delivered tangible results towards its development objectives, but at
different levels in each component, where, the improvement in access to basic education is most evident
compared to the second (curriculum reform) and third (upgrading of TTIs). The report recommended
that:

   ï·   The state government to fulfill its obligations of providing seating, books and exercise books to all
       school children and secure running costs
   ï·   The Ministry of education continue to reach out for all teachers in the states for training with
       emphasis on longer and more intensive training for teachers with secondary school education
   ï·   The ministry should adopt the model of building teacher dormitories to encourage qualified
       teachers to stay in rural schools
   ï·   The level of coordination and information dissemination needs to be improved within the ministry
       of education, with training institutions and the federal education authorities
                                                     46
   ï·   The federal ministry, state MoEs and TTIs establish mechanism to develop training policies and an
       expert be assigned (at least for one year) to set up the administrative structure of TTI and define its
       relationship with other state and federal institutions and supervise the selection and training of the
       permanent staff of the TTIs

The report did not assess in details the implementation performance of the government, implementing
agencies and of the Bank. The report was completed in May 2013 but by the end of August 2013 it has
yet been formally discussed with MoGE and Ministry of Finance.
