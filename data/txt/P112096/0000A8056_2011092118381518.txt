                         The project was restructured and extended by 12 months through 30 June 2012 in order to complete outstanding activities. In addition to the change of the end date of the project,
                         the Grant amendment included: (i) changes to the institutional arrangements related to procurement and civil works supervision aspects of the project; (iii) revision of some of the

                         Implementation performance of the Basic Education Project (BEP) by the end of July 2011 was moderately satisfactory. 14 of 30 schools were completed by the end of July 2011 with
                         12 schools close to completion. The remaining schools are to be re-bid due to non-performance of contractors Student enrollment increased by about 4% overall from baseline with

                         more than 50% of overall students enrolled being female. The quality of the schools construction has been variable, though there has been a marked improvement with regular
                         supervision of the sites by the World Bank civil engineers, one of whom is based in South Kordofan.

                         By the end of May 2011, 10953 teachers had received training in Arabic, English, and Mathematics of the Core Program (for Grade 1-3 students). This is about 96% of the target
                         number of teachers of which 69 percent were female teachers and 31 percent male teachers.

                         The teacher training institute (TTI) in the Red Sea was 39 percent complete by the end of June 2011, though the construction was about 55 days behind schedule. The Bank is still
                         waiting for a revised workplan for the completion of the TTI detailing how it intends to speed up works at this point. The construction is supposed to be completed by 15 October
                         2011. The bid opening for the teacher-training institutes (TTIs) for North Kordofan and South Kordofan was held on 21 July 2011 and it is anticipated that construction would begin in
                         August. The total construction period is 34 weeks for each TTI which means both sites should be completed by the end of April 2012. The planned TTI in Blue Nile state will not go
                         ahead given the poor soil conditions in the demarcated TTI area and insufficient funds for the construction of a completed TTI. Further, given the existing TTI in the state is not being
                         adequately utilized, there was insufficient justification to build another TTI, which is even more remote and would fall under the purview of a relatively poorly resourced locality. The
                         financing allocated towards the TTI in Blue Nile will now be diverted to the construction of an additional school in the state (currently under review by the Bank).

                         While the last aide-memoire indicated that the curriculum component would be scaled down due to a lack of clear vision in this area, there was a new proposal from the MoGE to
                         review the English curriculum for basic and secondary education over the next year. Led by the State Minister of Education, the review of the English curriculum is the first step in an
                         overall curriculum renewal process which the government is undertaking in collaboration with partners. The Bank is awaiting a workplan and proposal on this activity.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The conflict affecting the South Kordofan region since late June 2011, is of concern to the project. Three schools based in Taloudi locality within South Kordofan have not been
                         reachable by the BEP team since the conflict began. While the proposed TTI for South Kordofan is to be based in Dallang locality, which has largely been unaffected by the conflict,
                         it is not clear whether the feeder roads leading to the site are all accessible. Further analysis of the situation is required before proceeding with the proposed contract for the TTI in
                         North Kordofan.
