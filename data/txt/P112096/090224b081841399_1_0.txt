                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Basic Education Project is 7 months away from its revised closing date. At this stage, activities in the original design have been completed with minor exceptions (5 schools have
                         been canceled while others added and the curriculum component was restructured in 2011). In terms of achieving its development objectives, data shows that a 5% increase in

                         enrollment has already been achieved, albeit with a difference by gender: female student enrollment has increased substantially (12 percent increase from baseline), whereas male
                         student enrollment has barely changed (2 percent increase from baseline). Pre and Post training questionnaires showed a 21% overall increase in teachers’ knowledge of subject
                         materials but not across all subjects. Finally, the number of days schools are open has not been assessed but is expected to meet the target as well based on preliminary data
                         collection of completed schools.

                         Since the last ISR, the Project has completed restructuring, hired the necessary staff under a consolidated management structure, and extended the closing date to May 2013. The
                         PIU is now carrying out new activities funded from resources that had been stalled in Blue Nile and South Kordofan due to the conflict.

                         With less than 7 months remaining, implementation is back on track: training of 11380 teachers is complete; construction of original target schools and the Technical Training
                         Institutes is nearly complete (awaiting handover in case of TTIs); new target schools to benefit from reallocated resources have been selected (after extensive negotiations among the
                         states and the Federal Ministry). The team PIU is now prioritizing these new construction interventions, completing an in-class observation of sample teachers who undertook
                         trainings, and developing the new English curriculum textbooks (2 of 6 completed).

                         Disbursement of remaining funds may be now the biggest challenge with 82% of resources disbursed to date. The Bank team has been working with the project team in this area to
                         speed up implementation to the extent possible. An updated workplan and procurement plan were extensively negotiated during the latest mission in October and have been
                         subsequently approved. Bidding for construction has begun and contracts are expected to be awarded in December.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         After the decision of the MDTF donor committee and the Government to extend the TF to June 2013, the BEP was granted a one-year no-cost extension to May 2013 to allow for
                         activities to be completed, and resources to be reallocated from conflict affected states. The World Bank and PIU have finalized the selection of new target schools and additional
                         activities to be funded by the reallocated resources.
