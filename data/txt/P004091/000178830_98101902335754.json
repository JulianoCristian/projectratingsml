   of the Republic of Korea to reduce fertility over the next\n            five years, and simultaneously reduce infant and maternal\n            mortality, particularly in rural areas. The project has been\n            designed to reach out into communities with primary care\n            services, particularly maternal and child health and family\n            planning, identifying those most at risk and referring them\n            to facilities for more specialized care. The major\n            components are: (a) improving the delivery of health and\n            family planning services by strengthening and expanding the\n            delivery network; (b) increasing demand for services by\n            strengthening and expanding information, education and\n            communication activities in health and family planning; and\n            (c) improving the program's evaluation and\n            administration capacities. The principal beneficiaries will\n            be mothers and children, primarily in rural areas, who do\n            not now have access to services. It is estimated that about\n            10 million people would be provided primary health care\n            services under the project thus lowering fertility,\n            mortality and morbidity. The age structure of the population\n            and the lack of responsiveness of the women, particularly in\n            rural areas, to the programs proposed could jeopardize the\n            efforts to attain the goals of the project."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
