for Morocco will assist the\n            Government in improving inclusiveness, accountability and\n            transparency of decision making and implementation processes\n            at the local level in order to enhance use of social and\n            economic infrastructure and services by poor and vulnerable\n            groups. The Mid Term Review (MTR) for the project was held\n            in November 2008. At this time it was found that several\n            indicators proved redundant and the progress they were meant\n            to measure could be monitored with fewer indicators. In\n            addition, the project's indicators in the results\n            framework were not directly related to the project\n            development objective (PDO) nor to the project's\n            components, and some target values were unrealistic. A\n            request to restructure the project was finally received from\n            the Ministry of the Economy and Finance on 25 December,\n            2009. The long time that elapsed between the MTR and the\n            formal request for restructuring is due to the consultations\n            necessary among key stakeholders in Morocco as well as with\n            other donors involved with the project. Given the high\n            visibility of the project, it was also necessary to ensure\n            that it was generally understood that the restructuring does\n            not reflect problems with the project per se, but rather a\n            need for more meaningful indicators to monitor the project."}, "docdt": "2010-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
