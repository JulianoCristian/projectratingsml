satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate to significant; Bank\n            performance: was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: the valuable lessons drawn from the\n            implementation of first INDH are based on continuous\n            learning and dialogue between the Government, the Bank and\n            other partners, and are supplemented by contributions from a\n            broad spectrum of stakeholders through stakeholder\n            workshops. The overall conclusions are presented here, but\n            given the need for intensive learning and applicability to\n            second INDH, annex two and annex six contain more detailed\n            lessons learned in all areas of the project. INDH has shown\n            that new participatory approaches can be put in place\n            rapidly. In an environment with a history of top-down,\n            centralized decision making, implanting a culture of\n            participatory diagnostic and programming and real\n            empowerment of poor communities poses many policy and\n            institutional challenges. The first five year phase of the\n            INDH has succeeded, with strong government commitment,\n            adequate resource allocation and good technical support, in\n            building capacity in governance and support structures,\n            establishing participatory approaches, and showing what\n            improvements are needed. Further, INDH has also demonstrated\n            that large numbers of sub-projects can be implemented in a\n            very short period. Despite the risks, a well-designed and\n            supported program can begin from almost nothing and achieve\n            high levels of implementation in a very short time, provided\n            that adequate supporting measures are in place."}, "docdt": "2012-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
