                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The National Initiative for Human Development (INDH) which was launched in 2005 is the first large scale Community Driven Development program in the Middle East and North
                         Africa region and one of the largest worldwide reaching around five million people. INDH has received high visibility and support from country resources as well as from 17
                         Development Partners and provided a unique opportunity to support poverty programs designed through a CDD approach. Among INDH's accomplishments are the establishment of

                         the past five years, INDH financed more than 22,000 sub-projects, spread over the country, which are at various stages of implementation/completion. These sub-projects contributed

                         to the improvement of the access and the use of basic infrastructures and social services by the targeted population. Although the INDH has brought civil society, women and youth
                         to the table, their effective voice has yet to emerge. CDD efforts require longer hand holding and patient and large investments in social mobilization to achieve real engagement.
                         future attention should be given to: (i) strengthening the participatory approach, (ii) promoting sustainable income generating activities and (iii) ensuring sustainability of sub-projects
                         with the participation of line ministries.
