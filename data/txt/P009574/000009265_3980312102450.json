The project has four components. 1) Increasing and\n            upgrading facilities for basic education by constructing new\n            schools, substantially upgrading existing schools, and\n            supporting decentralized construction; 2) expanding and\n            improving teacher education; revising curriculum; and\n            supporting central, district, and school-based in-service\n            teacher-training programs; 3) improving learning processes\n            by curriculum development, examining learning processes,\n            revising existing examinations and introducing standardized\n            tests, and developing resource centers, school networks, and\n            the supplementary reading program; and 4) strengthening\n            educational management and administration by further\n            strengthening the professional skills of central staff and\n            developing the capacity to introduce a decentralized school\n            monitoring and supervisory system; strengthening district\n            educational administration; and strengthening school level\n            management through networks and headteacher training."}, "docdt": "1998-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
