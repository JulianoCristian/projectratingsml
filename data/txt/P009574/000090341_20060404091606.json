Lessons learned from the\n            project. The eleven schools built under Second Education\n            Project (SEP) are attractive structures which will serve as\n            relatively high quality schools for years to come as\n            Bhutan's rapid development continues. SEP-financed\n            schools lack a sufficient number of books to stock new\n            libraries. The outcome of implementation of the civil works\n            activities under SEP demonstrate the importance of carrying\n            out advance preparatory tasks, including site surveys, the\n            development of designs and drawings, the simplification of\n            bidding documents, and capacity building at the local level.\n            A key impediment to the effective use of new teaching\n            approaches for improved classroom management and to\n            stimulate children's learning can be largely attributed\n            to a lack of familiarity with them. Lessons learned from the\n            vast literature on the importance of good school leadership\n            for instituting pedagogic reforms and effective management\n            of schools are in evidence in Bhutan.
