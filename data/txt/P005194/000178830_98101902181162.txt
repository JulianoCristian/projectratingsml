REPORT AiD RECC@MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED SECOND LOAN
TO THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND OF
IRAN WITH THE GUARANTEE OF IRAN
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Agricultural Development Fund of Iran (ADFI), to be guaranteed,by Iran,
for the equivalent of US $14.0 million to help finance part of the foreign
exchange component of ADFI's lending program for an estimated period of two
years. The loan would have a term of twelve years, including four years of
grace, with interest at 7¼ percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank has made nineteen loans to Iran aggregating $601.2 million
(net of cancellations). Two further loans ($32 million equivalent for a Pipe-
line Project and $50 million equivalent for the Industrial and Mining Develop-
ment Bank of Iran) were approved in December 1971 and are awaiting signature.
By the end of December 1971, $352.3 million had been disbursed and $14.2
million had been repaid. There have been no IDA Credits. A summary statement
of Bank Loans and IFC investments as of December 31, 1971 is attached as Annex I.
3.        The position in regard to current Bank Group operations in Iran
is substantially the same as set out in mr Report to the Executive Directors
on a loan to Iran for a Pipeline Project (No. P-995 dated December 2, 1971).
4.        The Bank's activity in Iran has been increased substantially in the
last two years. The expanded lending program is intended to help Iran improve
the average term of foreign borrowing and the quality of its investment program,
thereby contributing to the more efficient use of investment funds. In order
to assist in the process of identifying priorities in the investment program,
Bank staff have worked intensively with the Iranian authorities on agriculture,
transportation and industry and, to a lesser extent, on family planning, urban
development, housing and water supply. Specific projects in an advanced stage
of disaLssion and likely to be ready for presentation in the next few months
are a second power project, the second stage of the Dez Irrigation Project
and a ports equipment project.
5.        The proposed loan will be the second to the ADFI. The first in an
amount of $6.5 million (No. 662-IRN) was approved in March 1970. The project
for which the Bank loan was made is progressing satisfactorily, and the invest-
ments financed are sound. The Bank loan has been fully committed and it is
expected that it will be fully disbursed by December 31, 1972, which is the
Closing Date in the Loan Agreement.



PART II - THE ECONCMY
6.        An economic report entitled "Guirrent Economic Position and Prospects of
Iran" (SA-23a dated May 18, 1971) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on August 13, 1971. A Country Data sheet is attached as Annex II.
7.        A statement on recent developments in the Iranian economy was con-
tained in my Report to the Executive Directors on the Pipeline Pi'ojebt in Iran
(No. P-995 dated December 2, 1971). As background to the proposed prbject, the
achievements, problems and prospects of Iran's agricultural development are out-
lined in the following paragraphs.
8.        A basic objective of the Gbvernmentts strategy for the agricultural
sector is to narrow, as quickly as possible, the gap that has existed during
the past decade between the rates of growth of agricultural production and
demand for agricultural and livestock products. The fotimer has grown by some
3 percent per annum, the latter by 'about 8.5 percent, in line with a 10 percent
rate of growth of national income. As a result, imports of farm products doubled
and of liyestock products increased sevenfold. If a gap of this size were to
continue, imports of agricultural products would reach a size that would jeopardize
the Government's overall development objectives.
9.        In order to accelerate growth in agriculture, the Government believes
it essential to accelerate the introduction of higher technology. One approach
is to support large scale farming on irrigated land. The move towards agri-
cultural corporations and. agri-business is seen as maximizing agricultural
yields per unit of water, -the most scarce factor.  Harnessing water resources
has been co'stly. During the last decade, eleven damrs were constructed at a
cost of over Rls 30 billion and with a maximum capacity to irrigate 860,000
hectares; the capital cost per hectare is, therefore, Rls 35,000 or $462,
excluding the irrigation and drainage canal network.   Until stall farmers have
gained experience in effective water management, the Ministry: of Agriculture
feels that the most-economic use of water would be assured through large-scale
agricultural units, at least in those irrigated lands downstream of the majbr
dams.
10.       1{owever, this is obviously not a comprehensive strategy for the develop-
ment of the agricultural sector because it does not cover the great majority
of fhrmers.  The second approach, therefore, is to accelerate the process of
reaching the smaller farmer-with the required guidance and inputs. Efforts
in this direction are viewed as an exteision of the comprehensive land reform
that, started in 1962. The implementation of the three stages of land reform
sucoeeded in changing radically the pattern of land ownership; in 1960/61, 6
percent of the land was farmed by small-holders, 22 percent by large-holders
and 72 percent owned by absentee landlords and farmed by sharecroppers (62



-3-
percent) and tenants (10 percent). Most of the two latter groups have now been
given title to the land. The reform, therefore, provides the basis for a dynamic
agriculture through the application of better technology and improved agricul-
tural practices. However, for the full benefit of the changed pattern of land
ownership to be obtained, institutions have to be strengthened greatly in. order
to be able to reach the new owners with effective extension, water management
and credit, adequate quantities of fertilizer and inproved seeds.  This, in
essence, is the task for the 1970's.
11.       In response to the Government's request, the Bank is assisting in
formulating the broad outlines of the required institutional improvement and,
in a preliminary way, the measures required for increasing institutional credit
to the small farmers. The Government has already taken a number of steps aimed
at consolidating the ministries and agencies serving the sector. The diffuse
departmental structure has now been appreciably improved. The formulation of
a clear and precise definition of policy goals in agriculture can now be more
realistically attempted within the context of the forthcoming Fifth Development
Plan.
PART III - THE PROJECT
12.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Second Agricultural Credit Project
Iran" (PA-93a dated January 13, 1972) is being distributed separately. A Loan
and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
13.       Institutional sources of credit for agriculture in Iran are limited
in number, and the amount of credit available falls far short of needs. Apart
from the ADFI, the sources of institutional credit are the Agricultural
Cooperative Bank (ACB), the Rural Cooperatives and a number of Government
Agencies. Both the ACB and the Rural Cooperatives, which provide about a third
each of total institutional agricultural credit, receive their funds mainly
from the Gavernment and lend primarily to the smaller farmers. ACB's loans
are mainly for short-term working capital (harvesting loans) but it also extends
loans for irrigation, orchards, cattle breeding, rural construction and other
longer-term projects, especially to groups of smaller farmers acting as a body.
Rural Cooperatives were started in 1949 and were given great impetus under the
1962 Land Reform Law, which required new small landowners to become members of
cooperatives. The Central Organization for Rural Cooperatives (CORC) was set
up in 1963 with a membership of over 1,000 rural cooperatives or cooperative
federations0 CORC lends to the cooperative federations and individual coopera-
tives at 4 percent and they, in turn, charge their members 6 percent. Their
loans are mainly short-term. Rural Cooperatives and the ACB have ceilings
respectively of $260 and $13,000 equivalent on loans to individual borrowers.
14.       ADFI specializes in serving the credit needs of the larger farm units.
Initially the lower limit for its loans was fixed at $66,000. In order to
expand the scope of its operations, ADFI reduced the minimum size of loans



early in 1971 to $33, 000 and more recently further to $13J,000 which corresponds
to the ceiling on ACB loans. The gap which existed previously between ACB's
ceiling and ADFI's lower limit has, therefore, been eliminated.  ADFI's function,
however, remains essentially that of the major supplier of credit to the larger
farmers.
15.       ADFI is a wholly-government-owned autonomous agency. Under a Law
promulgated in 1968, the purposes of the Fund are to encourage and assist
private investment in agriculture and animal husbandry, promote commercial
farming, increase food production, reclaim arid and waste lands, provide raw'
materials for agricultural industries and expand the export of agricultural
commodities.  Its activities are defined as investment in private companies
through equity participation and the granting of loans and the supervision
of the utilization of such loans.
16.       The scope of the operations, powers and organization of the Fund
have been set out in a Charter approved in 1968. The Charter empowers
the Fund to promote, underwrite or subscribe to capital and loan issues for
agricultural purposes; to guarantee agricultural companies; to provide
technical and managerial assistance in agriculture and to assist in the prepara-
tion of projects. It also empowers ADFI to intervene, if needed to protect
its interests, in the management of private institutions which have used its
credit facilities.
17.       ADFI's initial authorized share capital was Rls 1,000 million ($13.2
million) to be subscribed entirely by Government and has been fully paid in.
The authorized capital is being increased to Rls 2,000 million and the Govern-
ment has undertaken to pay in a further Rls 400 million no later than 18 months
after signature of the proposed Bank loan. In addition to its capital and
reserves, ADFI may issue agricultural development bonds up to Rls 5,000 million
($66 million) and borrow funds from the Plan Organization. It has not had to
use either of these facilities so far. It may also use the re-discount and
credit facilities of the Central Bank (Rls 22 million outstanding at June 20,
1971) and the credit facilities of other banks in Iran. ADFI has also been
authorized to obtain loans and credits up to the equivalent of $200 million
from foreign and international sources, with the guarantee of the Government.
18.       The General Assembly which consists of six Cabinet Ministers and the
Managing Director of the Plan Organization, meets once a year to approve the
annual report and give general policy directions. The High Council, which is
in effect the Board of Directors, under the chairmanship of the Governor of
the Central Bank, is required to meet at least once a month. Its functions are
to approve the annual budget as well as loan and other regulations and to take
decisions on bad debts, the selection of auditors and on all matters concerning
the Fund which the President may submit to it. The President and the Executive
Vice-President are non-voting participants. Proposals regarding loans, equity
participation and guarantees are approved by a Loan bmnmittee, which consists
of the President (who has veto powers) and four specified members of the High
Council.



-5-
19.       The President of ADFI is appointed for a term of three years by
Royal Decree on the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and the
approval of the Council of Ministers. A similar procedure is followed in
the appointment of the Executive Vice-President. There are separate depart-
ments in charge of project appraisal, loan supervision, economic research,
legal affairs, finance and administration, with a staff of 31 professional
and 25 general administrative officers.
20.       Projects which are submitted for ADFI lending are subjected to a
detailed appraisal by a team consisting of persons with the requisite profes-
sional training and experience. Its appraisal work has been generally good.
21.       In the three years since its establishment ADFI's loan operations
have expanded substantially, loans outstanding increasing from Rls 35 million
($462,000) in 1968/69 to Rls 216 million ($2.9 million) in 1969/70 and Rls
496 million ($6.5 million) in 1970/71.  As of the end of September 1971, 84
projects had been approved involving loans aggregating the equivalent of $22.0
million. ADFI loan disbursements at this date amounted to $8.0 million.
Lending operations under the first Bank financed Project have gone according
to schedule, but, as a young institution, ADFI has not yet reached a level
of operations sufficient to generate profits; on present projections, this
point is expected to be reached in 1974.
22.       The project would be part of ADFI's lending program for the next
two years; the proposed Bank loan would help finance long-term investments
on commercial farms and agro-industrial operations such as processing, prepara-
tion, storage and marketing of agricultural projects. It would assist ADFI
in making loans to a wider range of farmers than in the past, following the
reduction in ADFI's minimum loan amount and would bring about 14,000 ha of
land under cultivation.
23.       The major categories of investment expected to be financed under the
proposed project are set out in the following table:
Number of                   Average Investment    Total
Loans made in Year   Total Ha    per Sub Borrower   Investment
1         2      or Number            (in Rls million)
Mixed Farming        18         22       12,000          15.3              612
Orchards             16         16        1,600          10.0             320
Dairy                 8         12        2,000          10.8              216
Sheep                18         22       40,000           3.9              156
Poultry               6         10                       43.5             696
Agro-industry         4          8                       55.0             660
Total           70         90                                      2,660



-6-
24.       Loans for mixed farming would be used for the production of such,
crops as cereals, alfalfa, cotton, sugar beet, sunflower, soybeans and pulses.
The orchards would produce citrus, apples, pistachios and, to a'lesser extent,
pears and apricots. Sheep raising would be combined with annual crops and
orchard development.
25.       It is expected that about four agri-business operations would also be
financed under the proposed project. These would be large scale vertically'
integrated operations in which the production of annual crops would be closely
linked with agro-industrial activities such as processing and marketing.  Invest-
ments are expected to -be mainly for land levelling, on-farm irrigation facilities,
machinery and equipment for agricultural production and pro cessing.
26.       Specific investments to be financed under the project would be buildings
and roads (38 percent of total project cost), machinery and equipment (33 per-
cent), irrigation facilities (9 percent), livestock and planting materials
(9 percent), land preparation (7 percent) and planting costs (4 percent).  The
increased production resulting from the project would be mainly for the 'domestic
market, although some quantities of cotton and fruit may be exported.
27.       The'total project cost is estimated at Rls 2,660-'million ($35.1
million) of'which $15.6 million (44 percent) would be the foreign exchange com-
ponent. As under the first Project, 30 percent ($10.5 million equivalent) would
be financed by the sub-borrowers, a similar amount by ADFI from other resources
and the balance of'40 percent by ADFI from the proposed loan of $14 million equiva-
lent. The sub-borrowers would be required to bear the foreign exchange risk.
ADFI -would lend for periods of six to twelve years and charge interest at a
rate'not less than 8 percent on the principal amount withdrawn and outstanding
inclusive of a service -charge of i percent, and a commitment fee of 1 percent
on undisbursed loan balances.' Loans for agri-businesses and working capital
would carry interest rates of 9 percent and 10 percent respectively. The esti-
mated financial rates of return on investments under the project range from 15
percent for mixed farming to 32 percent for poultry enterprises.
28.       Considerable benefits would accrue to the economy through the increased
production from the project;. the incremental value of annual production resulting
from the investments is expected at full development to be of the order of
Rls I,030 million ($14 million). Net annual foreign exchange earnings and/or
savings are estimated -to reach about $10 million after allowing for -the cost
of the required imported inputs. The economic rate of return over an average
life of 15 years is estimated at 19 percent. In addition, there would be other
non-quantifiable benefits such as the demonstration effect on non-project farmers
and enterprises. The project's full impact on employment cannot be assessed
accurately, but it is :estimated that it would provide direct employment in bene-
ficiary farms and agro-industries for about 2,500 persons on a full-time basis.



-7-
29.       A wide variety of items would be financed under the project over an
extended period of time which would make bulking of procurement and international
competitive bidding impracticable. Sub-borrowers would purchase the goods
required through normal commercial channels. Farm machinery and equipment,
pumps, motors and piping can be imported without restrictions, subject to a
tariff of 5 percent (20 percent for pumps and motors). Such equipment is readily
available through normal commercial channels and many international suppliers
are represented in Iran, providing a sufficient degree of competition. This
is not currently the case with tractors of over 40 hp, which would consequently
not be eligible for inclusion in project costs to be financed by ADFI sub-loans.
ADFI would stipulate in its agreements with sub-borrowers that the goods and
services to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan should be purchased at
a reasonable price, with account being taken of factors such as the time of
delivery and the availability of service and spare parts.
30.       The project covers ADFI's lending program for two years.  ADFI's dis-
bursements would be spread over about three years and disbursements from the
proposed Bank loan would be made over about three and a half years against
documented statements from ADFI that sub-loans had been disbursed for approved
purposes.  ADFI is required to submit to the Bank for review and prior approval
any sub-loan of Rls 20 million and above. This provision was applied in the
first Bank Loan to sub-loans exceeding Rls 1i million.  Because of the quality
of ADFI's investment appraisals and its greater experience in lending operations,
a somewhat higher figure is now justified. ADFI would also be required to sub-
mit for Bank review and prior approval any sub-loan for agro-industry or a
category of lending not listed in paragraph 23 above. ADFI has at present a
backlog of appraised and approved loan applications. To maintain continuity
of commitments and disbursements by ADFI, disbursements made after October 1,
1971 up to an aggregate of $1 million would be eligible for financing under
the proposed loan.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Agricultural Develop-
ment Fund of Iran, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Iran and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.  The draft agree-
ments conform to the normal pattern for loans for agricultural credit projects.
32.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
