Project for Armenia are as follows: overall outcome of the\n            project was rated highly satisfactory, and the performance\n            of the Bank and Borrower also rated highly satisfactory.\n            Some of the lessons learned from the project are: 1) while\n            it is commonplace to emphasize the importance of recipient\n            commitment and ownership, the lesson from this project is\n            that neither of these is likely to be satisfactory if the\n            recipient does not understand the project in more than a\n            superficial way. The Government of Armenia's commitment\n            to the reform process and this project were the result of a\n            deep understanding of the reforms, including the inevitable\n            short-run costs; 2) adequate institutional support was a\n            necessary condition for the success of the project; 3) most\n            of the delays which took place in the project, including\n            privatization, were largely due to difficulties in designing\n            and implementing a consistent set of laws and procedures.\n            Given the involvement of Parliament in such a process,\n            either less ambitious time tables or more active\n            participation of members of Parliament from the beginning is\n            required; and 4) another lesson is the need to recognize the\n            interdependency of social and economic policies. Although\n            this has been rectified in the structural adjustment credit,\n            insufficient attention was placed on social issues in the\n            Rehabilitation Credit, despite the widespread poverty, large\n            declines in life expectancy, and deterioration of the\n            education system. There is wide agreement that the future of\n            Armenia depends on its human resources, given its lack of\n            natural resources. Accordingly, the success of any economic\n            reform program will depend greatly on social reform and rehabilitation."}, "docdt": "1997-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
