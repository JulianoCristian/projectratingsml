of the\n            agricultural extension services.  It is part of a long-term\n            strategy aiming at sustainable agricultural development\n            through modernization of agricultural practices,\n            envrionmental measures and population policies.\n            Specifically, it will help : a) reorganize and strengthen\n            the extension services of 5 of the country's 23 CIRVAs\n            (Agricultural extension districts) : Ambatondrazaka,\n            Antananarivo, Miarinarivo, Moramanga, and Amparafaravolo; b)\n            provide systematic in-service training for project staff at\n            all levels; c) focus adaptive research on validation and\n            diffusion of economically and environmentally sound\n            technology; d) strengthen the monitoring and evaluation\n            capability at both the central and regional levels; e)\n            strengthen financial management; f) improve organizational\n            and managerial capacity of the DVA; and g) make funds\n            available for studies, an in-depth project review, and the\n            preparation of a follow-up project that will draw on the\n            results of the project review.  The study program is\n            intended to look at ways to reduce the cost of extension to\n            the Government through : 1) involving the private sector and\n            NGOs more forcefully; 2) reducing costs at the DVA (e.g.\n            reducing excess personnel); and 3) reviewing the possibility\n            of cost recovery mechanisms."}, "docdt": "1990-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
