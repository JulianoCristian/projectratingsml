Excellency:
       Re: Agricultural Extension Pilot Project
                 (Credit No. 2150-MAG)
    Amendments to the Development Credit Agreement
               We refer to the above-mentioned Development Credit
Agreement dated July 18, 1990; the letter No. 0936-
MINFIN/SG/DGT/DDPOF/RO dated March 18, 1992 from your services (copy
enclosed herewith), requesting an increase of the percentage of
expenditures to be financed, out of the proceeds of the Credit, for
field allowances during 1991 from 50% to 100%; and to the
discussions relating thereto held between your representatives and
our recent supervision mission.
               Further to these discussions, we wish to inform you
that the Association is not in a position to agree to said request
for 1991, since it considers that the high increase of the level of
field allowances since September 1991 is partly the cause of your
present difficulties and that field allowances should be reduced to
a reasonable level.  A level of FMG 10,000 per day for upper level
field staff and of FMG 6,000 per day for medium level staff, as
recently agreed with the Government under the Education Sector
Project, would be deemed reasonable.  In order to cover field
allowances arrears related to 1991, the Government should increase
its contribution to the 1992 budget from FMG 549 million to FMG
1,071 million, as suggested by the recent supervision mission in its
Aide memoire.
               Nevertheless, the Association agrees to your request
to increase the financing percentage for field allowances to 100%
for 1992 and 1993, subject to a reduction of the level of field
allowances and an increase of the Goverrunent contribution to the
1992 budget, as indicated above.
               Consequently, the Association hereby agrees to the
following, concerning the table set forth in paragraph I of Schedule
1 to the Development Credit Agreement:
(a)  two new categories (c) and (d) are added to Category (5) Field
     allowances of said table, to read "(c) 1992" and "(d) 1993 and
     subsequent years," with a respective percentage of 100% of
     expenditures to be financed;
(b)  Category (1) is now to read "Civil works" and an amount of SDR
     140,000 from that Category is reallocated to Category (2)
     Vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, spare parts and equipment
     other than under Category (3);
(c)  the amount of SDR 50,000 under Category (3) (a), being no
     longer needed for civil works for the CIRVA of Amparafaravola,
     an amount of SDR 100,000 from Category (3)(b) Vehicles,
     motorcycles, bicycles, spare parts and equipment for the CIRVA
     of Amparafaravola, and an amount of SDR 100,000 from Category
     (4) Consultants' services, studies and training, are
     reallocated to the new sub-Category (5) (c) for field
     allowances during 1992; and
(d)  an amount of SDR I 10,000 from Category (4) and an amount of
     SDR 90,000 from Category (7) Unallocated are reallocated to
     the new sub-Category (5) (d) for field allowances during 1993
     and subsequent years.
               The revised table resulting from the above changes is
set forth in the Attachment to this letter.  We wish to point out
Page  2
that the financing of field allowances on the basis of 100% during
1992 and 1993 until the completion of the Project does not entail
any commitment for the Association to cover such recurrent
expenditures beyond the Closing Date of the Credit.  Such financing,
according to Bank policies, is to be on a declining basis in order
to allow the continuous operation of services once external aid is
exhausted.
               Please confirm your agreement to the above by signing
and dating the form of confirmation on the enclosed copy of this
letter and returning it to us.
               It is understood that these amendments to the
Development Credit Agreement shall come into force upon: (i)
confirmation of your agreement as indicated above; (ii) receipt of
your agreement on the reduction at an appropriate level of field
allowances; and (iii) confirmation of an increase of the Government
contribution to the 1992 budget to FMG 1,071 million, with payment
of the arrears of field allowances related to 1991.
                      Very Yours,
