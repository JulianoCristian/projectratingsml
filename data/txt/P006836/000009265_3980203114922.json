Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Sector Project in Colombia were as follows: overall\n            outcome of the project was rated moderately satisfactory;\n            and the performance of the Bank and the Borrower were rated\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) reform of utility collateral must be undertaken by\n            bringing to an end the pledging of Government transfers as a\n            collateral for revenue earning projects, but instead\n            pledging utility revenues from user charges. This should be\n            embedded in the collateral legislation and apply to all\n            sector pledging, not just for loans rediscounted by Regional\n            Development Finance Corporation (FINDETER); 2) resources of\n            the national co-financing grant system, which originate from\n            Congress appropriations, have introduced distortions to\n            project objectives as a result of being allocated on the\n            basis of political criteria, without being subject to the\n            same conditions as those attached to the Bank loan proceeds.\n            This in turn has introduced a disincentive for\n            business-oriented performance on the part of the sector\n            companies and resulted in distorting one of the loan's\n            most important objective, namely that of promoting the\n            creation and strengthening of self-sufficient municipal\n            service companies; and 3) FINDETER's management,\n            staffing and project appraisal and supervision capability\n            have deteriorated sharply with growing political\n            considerations entering into decision making because of its\n            new role in handling large co-financing grants. This\n            hampered its credibility and its leadership in the sector reform."}, "docdt": "1997-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
