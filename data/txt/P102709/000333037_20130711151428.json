Support for Institution Building Project for\n            Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory,\n            risk to development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Strengthening Institutions\n            Development Policy Grant Project for Afghanistan were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Development\n            Policy Operations (DPO) can achieve important public\n            administration and financial management reforms in high-risk\n            environments with strong government ownership and flexible\n            implementation. Emergency consultant support in the short\n            and medium-term can usefully supplement the skill base in\n            Governments where progress in institution and capacity\n            building is bound to be a slow and time-consuming process.\n            These skilled personnel can help adopt structures,\n            processes, systems, laws, and regulations to enable reforms\n            in, inter alia, pay and grading, administrative reform\n            oversight, human resources monitoring, tax administration,\n            financial management, procurement, and audit. However,\n            ensuring the transition to a more normal administrative\n            structure is necessary for sustainability. It is crucial to\n            empower senior officials from Government to determine and\n            direct administrative reform, public financial management\n            and other institutional processes that make sense locally\n            and that can promote broad based consensus inclusive of key\n            political groups, while being sufficiently robust to deal\n            with rapid social and economic change."}, "docdt": "2013-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
