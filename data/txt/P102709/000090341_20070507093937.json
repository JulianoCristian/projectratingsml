The success of these\n            reforms is essential for building an accountable and\n            effective state and is critical for successful poverty\n            reduction. The operation also supports the implementation of\n            reforms that lead to a more efficient allocation of fiscal\n            resources in the areas of human development and private\n            sector development.
