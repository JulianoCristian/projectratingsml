had a satisfactory outcome and a substantial\n            risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and the borrower\n            performances were satisfactory. The main lessons learned\n            from these projects are: 1) For the PSIB II and III, the\n            Bank team made good use of both facets of the development\n            policy instrument. 2) The PSIB\u0092s experience emphasized the\n            opportunity to maximize synergies with other Bank\n            instruments and other donor programs. 3) It is vital to\n            carefully assess the political economy in each reform area\n            as well as ground development policy lending in high quality\n            AAA work. 4) The PSIB series succeeded in strengthening\n            institution building and important parts of the legal\n            regulatory framework, but capacity development will be a\n            long term undertaking. 5) The outcomes for the PSIB series\n            confirmed that a results-based approach can work in a\n            conflict-ridden and low-capacity environment."}, "docdt": "2009-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
