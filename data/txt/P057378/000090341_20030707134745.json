      Adjustment Credit for Madagascar were as follows: the\n            outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that growth remains an essential\n            and indeed central ingredient in any realistic\n            poverty-reducing program. However, it does not necessarily\n            lead to widespread poverty reduction and progressive\n            distribution. Madagascar, during the time period observed,\n            is a good example of this phenomenon. To achieve pro-poor\n            growth requires not only a concern with accelerating\n            economic growth, but also the existence of an efficient\n            mechanism of service delivery for those that are bypassed by\n            this growth. Policy based lending, coupled with floating\n            tranches, gives flexibility to the borrower but it runs the\n            risk of engaging the borrower in too many parallel reforms.\n            Flexibility is necessary when the package of structural\n            measures requires a very high level of political commitment.\n            When the package of measures is overloaded, though,\n            prioritization becomes difficult as well as effective\n            monitoring of reform progress. The Bank should not make the\n            transfer of assets a privatization conditionality for\n            tranche disbursement under structural adjustment loans.\n            Linking the privatization to the transfer of assets bears\n            the risk of exerting an undue pressure and putting the\n            Government in a weaker bargaining position. Supplemental\n            credits to adjustment operations that provide needed\n            balance-of-payments support can be important tools to\n            maintain the reform program on track. However, if they are\n            linked to specific Government expenditure measures (as was\n            the case with the cyclone emergency credit for Madagascar),\n            they might not be the best financing instrument as Bank\n            influence on reaching the stated objectives are minimal due\n            to the nature of adjustment support. Only in cases where\n            programmatic lending through budget support operations has a\n            proven good record should such supplemental credits be considered."}, "docdt": "2003-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
