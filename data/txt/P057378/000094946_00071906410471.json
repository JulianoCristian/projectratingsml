credit to the Second\n            Structural Adjustment Credit Project will provide Madagascar\n            with fast-disbursing foreign exchange to partially\n            compensate for lower export earnings, and higher import\n            needs in 2000/2001, due to the three cyclones that partly\n            devastated the country recently. These have created\n            unanticipated financing needs that would endanger the\n            government's reform effort, otherwise proceeding on\n            track. Counterpart funds generated will assist the\n            government in its planned reconstruction effort. Benefits\n            will maintain macroeconomic stability, while meeting\n            pressing reconstruction requirements. However, risks relate\n            to the financing need being larger than anticipated,\n            capacity constraints in the public sector, and the\n            non-transparent use of funds. Appropriate supervision, and\n            monitoring will address these risks. Although not targeted\n            at the poor, the credit would assist the poor by helping the\n            government contain inflation, providing foreign exchange for\n            key imports - mainly rice - and contributing resources for\n            the restoration of basic services in the affected areas. The\n            supplemental credit will be disbursed in one tranche."}, "docdt": "2000-07-05T00:00:00Z"}
