to the\n            strategic outcomes of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)\n            by focusing support on two Economic Development and Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) flagship programs: growth for\n            jobs and exports, and governance. It adopts policies and\n            reforms that support more efficient governance and\n            contribute to broad based growth by easing the key\n            constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low\n            skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in\n            Rwanda. The operation complements the sector budget support,\n            Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC), to support\n            continued reforms in health and the implementation of the\n            Vision Umurenge Program (VUP). Supported policies draw on\n            the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) for\n            monitoring the EDPRS, to reduce the transaction costs of\n            Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds. This\n            program continues to support the Government of Rwanda as it\n            implements measures to foster broad based growth in the\n            context of enhanced decentralization reforms. Donor support\n            to the Rwanda budget, based on policy reforms and outcome\n            indicators of the CPAF, are the reflection of a mature\n            partnership between international partners and Rwanda.\n            Rwanda's performance is impressive when looking at the\n            number of EDPRS indicator targets which have been met\n            already, as well as the number of policy actions which have\n            been implemented since 2008. In 2010 Rwanda continued its\n            strong reform performance, despite the impact of the recent\n            global economic slowdown."}, "docdt": "2011-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
