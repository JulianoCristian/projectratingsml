Program Development            The proposed operation contributes to the strategic outcomes of the
Objective(s) and               Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) by focusing support on two Economic
Contribution to the Country    Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) flagship programs:
Assistance Strategy (CAS)      growth for jobs and exports, and governance. It adopts policies and reforms
                               that support more efficient governance and contribute to broad based
                               growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity,
                               low skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in Rwanda. The
                               operation complements the sector budget support, Community Living
                               Standards Credit (CLSC), to support continued reforms in health and the
                               implementation of the Vision Umurenge Program (VUP). PRSF-7
                               supported policies draw on the Common Performance Assessment
                               Framework (CPAF) for monitoring the EDPRS, to reduce the transaction
                               costs of Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds.
Risks and Risk Mitigation      Key risks to the program are: (i) adverse impacts on aid flows due to
                               changes in the international perceptions about the state of political
                               governance and human rights in Rwanda; (ii) Government's capacity to
                               implement the EDPRS; and (ii) the exposure to external shocks. The
                               Bank's support for strengthened governance will continue within the
                               parameters laid down in its 2007 Governance and Anticorruption Strategy
                               including with regards to supporting the finalization of the Joint
                               Governance Assessment (JGA), and strengthening capacity of civil society
                               and private sector actors. Risks associated with capacity weaknesses in the
                               country's fiduciary framework, will be addressed through the Public
                               Financial Management (PFM) Action Plan, supported by the PRSF series.
                               Rwanda's exposure to external shocks, like a drawn out recovery following
                               the global slowdown, could increase the external account deficit due to a
                               reduction in export earnings.

              PROPOSED SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT FINANCING
                           TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA

                                                I. INTRODUCTION

 1.      The proposed Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Financing (PRSF-7) continues to
support the Government of Rwanda (Government) as it implements measures to foster broad
based growth in the context of enhanced decentralization reforms. The PRSF-7 is the fourth and
last operation in the second series of PRSFs. 1 It forms an integral part of the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), approved by the Board of Executive Directors on September 26, 2008, in
support of the Government's second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The EDPRS covers the period 2008-2012
and describes the Government's development objectives following a decade of achievements in
rehabilitation and reconstruction. It presents a strategy focused on accelerating growth and human
development, with an emphasis on decentralization, and a greater role for the private sector. The
EDPRS priorities are articulated through three flagship programs aimed at promoting sustainable
growth and poverty reduction and improving governance.

2.       Donor support to the Rwanda budget, based on policy reforms and outcome indicators
of the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF), are the reflection of a mature
partnership between international partners and Rwanda. Direct budget support amounted to 36
percent of total expenditures in 2009/2010. The CPAF (Annex 3) was developed during PRSG-5
implementation, under the leadership of the Government and in close collaboration with donors and
other development partners. The policy measures and indicators have been prioritized based on
consultations and discussions held through the Sector Reviews and Sector Working Groups. All
donors who provide general budget or sector budget support in Rwanda use the CPAF with its
indicators as a base on which to make disbursement decisions. The PRSF-7 is aligned to the country's
CPAF. Prior actions for PRSF-7 were agreed with the Government and are all, but one, part of the
CPAF (para. 68). They reflect the broad-based consultation undertaken in its preparation. It also
reflects the principles elaborated in the Partnership Framework that accompanies the CPAF.

 3.     Rwanda's performance is impressive when looking at the number of EDPRS indicator
targets which have been met already, as well as the number of policy actions which have been
implemented since 2008. The interests and needs of local communities are represented through the
results of the Ubudehe process (community-based planning and monitoring reports), imihigo,
performance contracts between District Mayors and the President, citizen report cards and score cards,
and direct participation of civil society organizations in the Sector Working Groups. Many sectors are
now in a position to systematically monitor progress towards achieving the EDPRS targets. However,
in some sectors, the choice and definition of certain indicators have made it difficult to measure and
report on progress. The experience with monitoring a sub-set of the EDPRS indicators in the CPAF
based on which donors decide on disbursement of their budget support has highlighted the need to
have well-defined indicators that can be measured in a timely fashion. Government plans to revise the
Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework of the EDPRS at its mid-term review in early 2011.

 4.      In 2010 Rwanda continued its strong reform performance, despite the impact of the
recent global economic slowdown. This fourth PRSF in the second series, together with a
Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC), supports the Government in its reform efforts. The
PRSF-7 builds on the past operations' support to the Government in the core areas of: (i) sustainably
raising agricultural production; (ii) increasing access to infrastructure services; (iii) strengthening the
framework for post-basic education, to build a skilled workforce and promote science and technology;

1
    All other operations, but PRSF-7, of the series were on grant terms, i.e. Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG) 4-6.

                                                               2
(iv) deepening the financial sector; and (v) strengthening the management of public resources at the
central and local levels. In 2010, the most important reforms have included the Cabinet approval of
the amended draft Procurement Law, the piloting and subsequent roll-out of the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS), the Cabinet approval of a comprehensive framework to
support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and the introduction of performance-based
assessment for all civil servants under the adopted General Statutes for the Public Sector. The PRSF
program has supported these reforms. Out of a total of 12 outcome indicators tracked under the PRSF-
7, 2 Rwanda has made important gains in all areas: nine have been met or exceeded, while one has
seen substantial improvements but did not reach the agreed target range (Footnote 24).

 5.     The second PRSF series has been effective in advancing Government-owned reforms,
providing substantial financing and fostering better donor coordination. The PRSF series has
provided crucial support to an ambitious and reform-minded Government to operationalize its
medium-term development strategy by translating its objectives into priority actions. Rwanda
depends on highly concessional financing, not just to cover an ambitious investment program, but also
to cover parts of the recurrent budget expenditures. Budget support grants from development partners
provide an important and preferred contribution to Rwanda's overall financing needs. The Authorities
are looking to the World Bank and other development partners as an important source of financing in
meeting these needs. Finally, the second PRSF series has improved harmonization and reinforced
support for reforms among the country's budget support donors: the World Bank, the African
Development Bank (AfDB), and bilateral donors -all partners in the Budget Support Harmonization
Group (BSHG) and part of the bi-annual Joint Budget Support Review (JBSR).

6.        To start re-aligning the timing of the World Bank PRSFs with the new fiscal year in
Rwanda, and the related CPAF cycle, this second series of PRSFs includes a seventh operation.
Initially, the second series was to cover PRSG-4 to PRSG-6, from the years 2008 to 2009/10.
However, this operation (PRSF-7) is the first operation that starts the transition to a new fiscal year
while ensuring better alignment between the PRSF series and the CPAF process. 3 Specifically, the
PRSF-7 preparation stage was informed by the backward review in October 2010 to assess the prior
actions, covering one year of EDPRS implementation.

7.       The successor PRSF series is expected to be completely re-aligned, such that
disbursement will target the first quarter of Government's fiscal year and be based on
achievements recognized in the CPAF review for the year prior to the disbursement year.
During a transitional period, the first operation of the new series is planned to be presented to the
Board in late 2011, and disbursed in quarter two of the Rwandan fiscal year. Thus, the first series of
the new operation will cover only a very short reform implementation period. Its prior actions will
need to be based on achievements in the fiscal year 2009/10, and potentially come from outside of the
CPAF. Subsequent operations are planned to be disbursed in quarter one of the Government's fiscal
year, in order to ensure better resource predictability for the Authorities and appropriate execution
time for its budget cycle. Since the focus of the Government's program is broadly continuous, there
are no major policy shifts expected for the new PRSF series. However, a higher level of selectivity in
regard to sectors for which prior actions will be proposed is planned, based on the recent donor
Division of Labor announced by the Government. Supported reforms for a future PRSF series will
focus on sectors for which the World Bank was designated as a lead donor, namely, the agriculture,
energy, and transport sectors and cross-cutting areas (e.g. skills development). Macroeconomic and
fiscal management, economic development, Public Financial Management (PFM) and procurement,
are also very likely areas to be continued to be supported by a successor series.

  Of the original 14 original triggers two were dropped, because no baseline or target / actual data became available by the
end of this series. For two of the tracked outcome indicators under PRSF-7 there was no data available for 2009/10.

  The Rwandan fiscal year changed in July 2009 from calendar year to July 1 ­ June 30 to harmonize with the East African
Community budget calendar.

8.       Key risks which may affect the implementation of the Government's reform strategy are
a reduction in aid flows, low capacity, and the continued exposure to external economic shocks.
There is a potential adverse impact on aid flows due to changes in the international perceptions about
the state of political governance and human rights in Rwanda. For several bilateral donors, issues of
democratic governance, political and media freedom and equal access to justice are key determinants
of the decision to continue provide funding, in particular general budget support. 4 Weak capacity
slowed down the implementation of Rwanda's first Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Government
identified it as a crucial priority in the EDPRS. There remain large skills deficits which limit the
effectiveness of public institutions and, more importantly, hamper the development of the private
sector. In addition, the country remains strongly exposed to external trade shocks, with exports being
subject to price and volume demand fluctuations for a few products and a the country being dependant
on large imports for basic goods. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to its EDPRS targets, a
subset of which were supported by the PRSF-5 to 7 series, and already successfully fulfilled a number
of indicator targets, as well as policy actions in its first two years.

                                        II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

9.      Rwanda's long-term development goal is outlined in the Vision 2020 (2000) and its
EDPRS 2008-12. It seeks to transform Rwanda from a low-income agrarian economy to a medium-
income export-oriented economy, operating as a knowledge-based service hub by 2020. It envisages
real growth of eight percent annually, to be achieved through: (i) deepening reforms, especially those
designed to improve the business environment; (ii) investing in major infrastructure (power, transport,
and Information and Communication Technology, (ICT), (iii) increasing agricultural productivity; and
(iv) investing in skills development needed for economic modernization. The Government is also
keen to ensure that growth is broadly shared in order to mitigate any risks to the erosion of Rwanda's
hard-won political and social stability.
10.      The lack of economic infrastructure remains one of the major binding constraints to
increasing and diversifying exports of goods and services and further enhancing
competitiveness. To alleviate the infrastructure constraints, the Government has identified six
complementary investment projects (Box 1). These investments should lead to employment
generation, poverty reduction and an increase in exports of goods and services both in traditional
export sectors (coffee, tea, mining and tourism) and new export sectors (horticulture, ITC, and
business services). In the medium-term, as noted in Rwanda's Vision 2020, the Government's goals
are to reduce the trade deficit and transform the country into a knowledge-based service economy.
11.      The Government is undertaking reforms to ensure that public spending, in particular
related to its six strategic investments, is effective and sustains growth. A framework for
implementing a Public Investment Program was elaborated and approved in February 2009. To date,
a Public Investment Policy has been adopted and guidelines for identifying investment selection
criteria and project prioritization that maximize the returns on investment, and safeguards public debt
sustainability are being developed. The aim is to ensure good coordination of investment across and
within sectors, establish an analytical and information base for prioritizing investments, and support
the strengthening of capacity in this area. However, these efforts need to be strengthened and should
be extended to the strategic investments already on-going. The Bank is supporting a capacity building
program in economic and financial analysis to strengthen Rwanda's Public Investment Program, and
in particular to ensure that large investments are going through a rigorous vetting process before being
implemented. The Government also intends to develop Public Private Partnerships through which it
would stimulate investment without crowding out the private sector.

1.   Energy rollout: increasing household grid connections from 6 percent at end-2008 to 16 percent by 2013, reaching all
     public health centers and administrative offices, and connecting half of all schools (a EDPRS objectives).
2.   Core ICT infrastructure: creating infrastructure for high-speed broadband by: (i) building high-capacity fiber-optic lines by
     May 2011, (ii) providing broadband wireless technology to up to 100,000 users by mid-2010, and (iii) connecting Rwanda
     to undersea fiber-optic cables by 2013, reducing broadband purchase costs.
3.   Regional Railway: rehabilitating/building a railway linking Rwanda to Burundi and Tanzania.
4.   Bugesera Airport: constructing a new airport conforming to International Civil Aviation Organization standards, with
     sufficient capacity to meet future demand from high-value agro exports and business tourism, and make Rwanda into a
     Central African hub/gateway.
5.   RwandAir expansion: creating strong air links to Rwanda to support service sectors and high-value exports and
     capturing a share of the increasing regional and international air traffic.
6.   Kigali Convention Complex: building a five-star hotel and convention center for catalyzing the development of its
     business tourism sub-segment.

12.      Another key constraint to Rwanda's development is the persistent lack of capacity.
Rwanda emerged from the genocide with drastically reduced capacity. There remains a large skills
deficit in the private sector and in most Government agencies. Capacity building is progressing only
slowly, being by nature a long-term endeavor. Many public and private institutions have a large
proportion of relatively inexperienced people which leaves core systems and processes nascent and
underdeveloped. There has been significant reform in the public sector, for example in Public
Financial Management and decentralization. However, the drastic downsizing of the civil service that
has occurred over the past few years has created capacity challenges for central ministries, struggling
with understaffing and high turnover. The speed of implementation of reforms and service delivery is
affected by these issues in virtually all sectors. The Government is currently developing a new
National Human Capital and Skills Development Strategy to address these challenges.

13.      Poverty affects large part of the population in Rwanda. According to the most recent
national household survey, the Integrated Household Living Conditions Survey (EICV 2), carried out
in 2006, 56.8 percent of the population in Rwanda lived below the national poverty line. Extreme
poverty incidence ­reflecting people living below the food poverty line--was 37.8 percent of the
population (Table 1). 5 Over 90 percent of poor people live in rural areas. Between 2001 and 2006
national poverty incidence decreased by 5.8 percent from 60.3 percent to 56.8 percent. However,
given the high population growth of 3.5 percent per year, the absolute number of people living in
poverty increased from 4.8 to 5.4 million. Poverty largely increased in rural areas, with an additional
500,000 people living in poverty and 170,000 more confronted with extreme poverty. In addition the
absolute number of poor strongly increased in non-Kigali urban areas where the number of people
living in poverty increased by 24 percent between 2001 and 2006. Another source of subjective
poverty measure in Rwanda is the Ubudehe survey, where households were asked to position
themselves into one of seven socioeconomic categories, identified by communities. Most people (52.5
percent) indicated that they felt they were among the poorest, or among the destitute (18.0 percent),
caused by lack of land, poor soils, unpredictable weather and lack of livestock.

14.       Lack of recent poverty data prevents an assessment whether the high growth of 2005-
2008 translated into significant poverty reduction in Rwanda. In November 2010 a new improved
national household survey, the EICV 3, was launched, which is based on a monthly rolling survey to
adequately address seasonality. It will deliver updated poverty numbers by 2012. In the meantime,
data of the recent 2009 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Survey confirms that the
main underlying causes of food poverty and vulnerability in Rwanda are: (i) limited access to land,
(ii) lack of livestock, and (iii) household income shocks (e.g. due to illness).

growth fell to 4.1 percent in 2009 from 11.2
percent in 2008, it is expected to rebound to
6.5 percent in 2010. This recovery is mainly
driven by strong growth in services,
particularly in the telecommunications, and
construction, even though credit to the private
sector has grown less than expected. The
agriculture sector continues to be a key source
for growth, with production and prices for

percent and 14.8 percent in 2008, respectively
(Figure 1: ). The main reasons for this decline                     2009                      2010
were the tight credit conditions in the Source: NISR
domestic banking sector, because Rwandan
Authorities tried to manage inflation and domestic demand. Real sector developments in the first half
of 2010 outline a picture of ongoing recovery. In agriculture, intensification efforts and favorable
weather conditions led to the increased harvest, mainly in cereals and roots and tubers, which are
largely produced for domestic consumption and were not affected by the price drop for export goods.
Revival in construction activities, transport and storage, and banks and insurance services contributed

                                                        6
to the increasing growth trend for the industrial and services sectors (estimated at 4.6 percent and 12.8
percent in the first half of 2010).
17.      Inflation has returned to single digit numbers as global food and fuel prices eased off.
Inflation retreated in 2009 from the peak levels observed at end-2008 with the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) standing at 22.3 percent and headline and underlying inflation at 15.4 percent and 17.8
respectively (Figure 2). In 2010, the CPI remained under 5 percent, declining to 0.2 by end-
December. Headline inflation and underlying inflation fell to 2.3 percent and 1.5 percent respectively
by end-December 2010. The decrease in import prices and the good performance in food production
were the major cause of this evolution. Price pressures are expected to continue to decrease in 2010.
Monetary policy aims at seven percent inflation by end-2010, taking into account expected rises in oil
prices, and stabilizing at five percent over the medium term.

External Balance

18.      Trade data for the first nine months of 2010 showed slight improvements, mainly due to
a rebound in prices and strong volumes of
                                                      Figure 3: Rwanda External Developments
one of Rwanda's main export goods, tea.                           in percent of GDP
Export values increased by 30 percent
compared to the first half of 2009. Accounting
for around 24 percent of the exports value, tea
exports rose by 20.0 percent. Imports rose by
2.6 percent in value while the volume rose by
18.3 percent mainly on account of lower non-
oil import prices and volumes of capital
goods. Remittances continued to increase in
2010 and are projected to reach a record high
of US$98.8 million dollars.              Gross
international reserves are projected to remain
at comfortable levels, but slightly lower than
end-2009. (Table 2).
19.      Recent global shocks adversely
                                                   Source: BNR & IMF
impacted Rwanda's external balances. The
trade deficit and current account deficit
widened in 2009. The trade deficit reached 16.0 percent of GDP in 2009, up from 13.1 percent in
2008. While imports continued to rise, external demand for Rwanda's main export products fell.
Export values declined by 28.0 percent in 2009, also reflecting lower export volumes. Import values
grew by 16.3 percent in 2009, mainly driven by an increase in imported consumer and energy goods. 6
The current account deficit widened, despite an increase in remittances and public transfers. It
deteriorated to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2009, following a downward trend since 2007 (Figure 3).
Remittances recorded an increase of 39.2 percent compared to 2008, while public transfers increased
by 17.6 percent, reflecting an increase of 22.0 percent in budgetary support transfers. In total, current
transfers increased by 16.5 percent, but this increase was not enough to outbalance the trade deficit.
Nevertheless, strong foreign capital inflows led to a surplus of 2.8 percent of GDP in the overall
balance of payments in 2009.

Fiscal Performance

20.     In 2010/11 Rwanda's Government started unwinding its fiscal stimulus. 2009/10 was
characterized by a fiscal stimulus of about 2 percent of GDP, leading to an overall deficit (excl.

  Continued high levels of private remittances, and reduced barriers within the East African Community (EAC) and
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), contributed to the continuous increase in consumer goods
imports.

grants) of 13.2 percent of GDP. The overall deficit before grants is expected to increase to 13.8
percent of GDP in 2010/11. The overall fiscal deficit including grants is expected to widen due to an
estimated marked decline in grants (2.9 percent of GDP) as grants revert to levels seen prior to the
onset of the financial crisis. Net domestic financing is expected to increase, as Government spending
remains at high levels in 2010/11.

Net lending as a share of GDP increased in Source: IMF

remain flat, with new net-lending planned to be mainly absorbed by RwandAir, due to a delay for an
agreement on further KCC lending.



                                 Box 2: Government Priority Areas of Spending
1.   The development of physical infrastructure: Priorities will be those investments that improve the business environment
     and reduce the cost of doing business in Rwanda, such as energy generation and distribution, road construction and
     rehabilitation, and ICT development.
2.   Productive sector: Spending will focus on agriculture supply, agri-business, land reform and promotion of value addition
     for exports. Special emphasis will be put on accelerated implementation of the pro-poor Vision 2020 Umurenge Program
     (VUP), introducing integrated development projects in all provinces and promoting non-traditional export crops.
3.   Human development and social protection: The focus is on interventions to improve the quality of life of the population
     with special emphasis on providing 9-year basic education, skills development through vocational training colleges and
     strategic support to higher education. Efforts will be also directed towards improving the health of the people by
     intensifying the fight against infectious diseases, preventing and treating non-communicable diseases, reducing maternal,
     infant and child mortality and provide family planning services. Social protection interventions will be mainly geared
     towards increasing the productive capacities of the vulnerable members of society by providing employment income
     generating projects, while giving direct support to the physically handicapped and aged people.
4.   Good governance and protection of state sovereignty: The priority will be to strengthen community policing and to
     promote the community program of human rights and judiciary support, with particular attention to supporting institutions
     that promote integrity and the fight against corruption, especially the Ombudsman and the Office of the Auditor General.
     Fiscal decentralization will be enhanced through increased fiscal transfers to local Government and fiscal reforms
     undertaken to mitigate any fiduciary risks in local governments' financial management. Support will also be given to Peace
     Keeping Forces (in Sudan and the East African Community standby force) to ensure security of the state.

22.     Rwanda scores lowest in revenue mobilization compared to its neighboring countries in
East Africa, reporting 12.5 percent of GDP in 2009/10. Preliminary data for the first half of 2010
indicate that domestic revenue collection exceeded the Government's target. However, shortfalls in
trade taxes and losses in corporate taxes led to a revised revenue projection of 0.2 percent of GDP
lower than originally programmed for 2010/11. While the base year revenue numbers (2009/10) were
revised upwards, the projected growth until the final target in 2012/13 was slightly lowered for each
year. The Government's overall revenue target of 14.3 percent of GDP remains ambitious -a 2 percent
of GDP increase between 2009/10 and 2012/23- despite good progress in tax administration reforms.
Following the downward revision of the revenue target, the Government committed to submit a
revised budget by the end of 2010, with expenditure cuts in the amount of 0.2 percent of GDP.
23.      Rwanda's budget is heavily reliant on grant financing and aid predictability remains a
challenge. In 2009/10 about 53 percent of the entire Government budget was grant financed. A large
part of these grants is provided as budget support. Budgetary grants increased in 2009/10 to 9.2
percent of GDP due to additional crisis support by donors, but are expected to decrease to near pre-
crisis levels, 6.9 percent, in 2013/14 (Table 2). The Government is working closely with budget
support development partners to increase aid predictability. At the bi-annual Development Partners
Meeting in November 2010 it requested donors to provide: (i) annual commitments in time for the
national budget formulation process and (ii) monthly disbursement plans. The Government also
appealed to donors to use country systems, given the improvements in PFM, as reflected in the most

recent 2010 Public Expenditure Framework Assessment (PEFA). A considerable amount of bilateral
aid is still delivered outside of the Government system, i.e. off-budget. In 2009/10 about 45 percent of
aid delivered by development partners was not going through the Government budget.
24.     Fiscal sustainability is a long term objective of the Authorities, with current expenditure
not expected to be covered with domestic revenues until 2014/15. In the medium-term fiscal
consolidation is anchored on unwinding the higher spending levels of the fiscal stimulus of recent
years. Continued efforts to increase domestic revenue collection are crucial, given the prospect of
declining grants and limited scope for domestic financing. Overall, fiscal policy still needs to be
aligned with a sustainable Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and grounded in a medium
term framework that gradually reduces the overall fiscal deficit (including grants) to its long term
sustainable level. This medium-term framework should contain a clear statement of fiscal policy
objectives and a credible set of integrated medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal targets and
projection.

year. The MTEF was successfully integrated into the
2009/10 budget process and included capacity building for staff of all budget units. The Government
has also embarked on the process to institutionalize Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) with the aim
of strengthening public expenditure management and monitoring of spending. In 2010 PERs were
completed for the Water and Sanitation, Agriculture, and Education and Social Protection sectors.
Compared to the 2009 mini budget execution rate of 92 percent, budget execution performance has
improved to 97 percent in 2009/10. 8 A 2010 PEFA update was completed and shows remarkable
improvements compared to the 2007 PEFA ( Box 3). The strong commitment of the Government to
prudent financial management increased donor confidence, reflected in the continued high share of
budgetary grants.

Monetary Policies and Financial Sector Performance

26.     Progress has been made by the Banque Nationale du Rwanda (BNR) to enhance the
effectiveness of monetary policy, with reserve money being the anchor of monetary policy.
Liquidity management improved, BNR now targets average reserve money rather than end-period
reserve money as a way to smooth the path of the liquidity. 9 Gross official reserves (in months of
imports) increased in 2009 to 5.1 from 4.8. They are expected to stabilize in 2010 at around 4.8
months. An exchange rate corridor framework was introduced as a transition measure toward

7
  The strategy is based on the results of the 2007 PEFA and includes an operational manual for the MTEF, a strategic plan
for public procurement, internal audit manuals, a strategy for the implementation of the IFMIS and improved reporting on
transfers to districts.
8
  A major reason for this development is the longer execution period for the 2009/2010 budget (double of the 2009 mini
budget execution period). The overall execution rate hides significant differences in performance among entities. The
differences between budgeted and actual spend at the entity level are more pronounced when looking at the development
budget, whereas the recurrent budgets show smaller deviations.
9
  This is done through a mix of monetary policy instruments, including foreign exchange sales (subject to the conditions of
the foreign exchange market), and daily repos and reverse repos.

greater exchange rate flexibility. However, BNR is still challenged by capacity constraints, to
implement and monitor the new exchange rate framework, but also in carrying out its supervision
responsibilities. In particular, high turnover of trained bank examiners continues to weaken the
supervisory capacity and remains a potential source of vulnerability in the financial sector. A joint
IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update is planned for February 2011
which will review the financial sector and lay out proposal for future policy reforms.
27.     Credit to the private sector picked up and financial sector soundness indicators have
been improving in 2010. In the first half of 2010 credit to the private sector picked up slower than
expected, reflecting in part pre-election uncertainties, but is expected to rebound in the second half of
the year. As of June 2010, all eight commercial banks were in compliance with the minimum capital
requirements of Rwf5 billion (approximately US$8.5 million dollars). The capital adequacy ratio on a
consolidated basis decreased to 17.6 percent in June 2010 against 19.0 percent in December 2009.
The overall banking sector liquidity position has also improved. Money supply increased by 5.6
percent between December 2009 and June 2010. The volume of newly authorized loans increased by
45.5 percent during the first half of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. However, the
outstanding credit to private sector has shown only moderate growth compared to the increase in new
loans. This reflects efforts by banks to recover non-performing loans distributed before 2009.

             MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

28.      Growth will continue to benefit from an increase in agriculture productivity and the
recovery in services. Increased investment in fertilizers, improved seeds, extensions in services and
the dispatch of farm machinery to farmers will sustain the positive trend in the agriculture sector
while services will benefit from the recovery in lending activities recovery. Growth will also be
supported by the Government's investment strategy, which is expected to lead to an increase in
Government's capital spending. The Rwanda's medium term framework expects that the country will
sustain real growth of six to seven percent per year for 2010-13 (Annex 5). This real growth would be
needed to reach the envisioned increase in per capita income and to reduce poverty in line with the
targets of the Rwanda's EDPRS.
29.      A gradual fiscal consolidation is expected. Fiscal policy will balance the objectives to
pursue growth and poverty reduction of the EDPRS, while preserving debt sustainability. The fiscal
deficit (including grants) is expected to decrease from 3.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to less than 1
percent of GDP by 2012/13. For that to be realized revenues need to continue increasing at ambitious
levels -consistent with the EDRSP- by two percent of GDP between 2010/11 and 2012/13. This will
be backed by significant reforms in revenue administration. Simultaneously, dependence on donor aid
is expected to decrease, with official grants predicted to decline slightly from 12.5 percent of GDP in
2009/10 to 10.1 percent of GDP by 2012/13. Additional spending based on medium-term fiscal
performance will follow expenditure prioritization. The updated medium-term projections show a
rapid increase in borrowing from US$96.4 million in 2010 to US$259.0 million in 2011, connected
with a steep increase in the scheduled debt service ratio from 3.6 to 6.2 percent of export goods and
services. This is mainly related to borrowing for the KCC, which was supposed to happen in 2010,
but was pushed back to 2011, pending final agreement of Government negotiations, but also the
remainder of the Boeing loan to RwandAir (Para 21).
30.     Over the medium term, budgetary grants will continue to be the main source of
financing for the Government's implementation of the EDPRS. The projected increase in
investments will continue to rely on grant financing, which is reflected in the medium-term financing
plan in Table 3. Precise comparisons are difficult to make since projections are based on the newly
adopted fiscal year (July to June) as opposed to the previously used calendar year. Although current
commitment levels have not yet been affected by the global slowdown, projections beyond 2010/11
are based on firm commitments and assume lower levels of disbursements.

31.      The current account is expected to remain in deficit over the medium-term. Strong
import growth stemming from higher capital imports associated with the expanding Public Investment
Program is in the medium-term expected to outpace moderate expansion in exports. Export volumes,
led by receipts from traditional exports and tourism, and are forecasted to increase at a slow rate. This
is expected to widen the external current account deficit considerably from about 5 percent of GDP
(including grants) in 2008, to about 9 percent by 2011. Long-term improvements are expected, based
on the implementation of the Government's Export Promotion Strategy, which is expected to be
finalized in 2011.

Adequacy of the Macro-Economic Policy Framework

33.      Overall, the medium term macro-economic framework is sound and adequate to
support the Government's program. In June 2010, the IMF Executive Board approved a three-year
Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Rwanda upon request by the Authorities. Rwanda's track record
of prudent macroeconomic policies justified the transition to PSI-based IMF support. Rwanda
successfully completed the first review of the PSI in December 2010. The medium-term outlook,
including inflation, economic growth and financing remains favorable. The Government is
continuing to pursue policies that support private sector led growth. Public investments to improve
agriculture productivity and to reduce the dependence on thermal power as well as the implementation
of a strategic plan for capacity building should help establish the foundation for long-term sustainable
growth. However, fiscal risks remain due to the high level of donor financing to the budget and the
continued high level of public investments. Revenue efforts need to be intensified. In order to keep
external debt dynamics sustainable, new non-concessional external borrowing for investments will
need to be carefully assessed in regard to economic viability and financing options that incorporate
participation from the private sector should be considered.

     III. RWANDA'S REFORM PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

Rwanda's Development Strategy

34.      The EDPRS is the country's medium-term development plan for 2008-2012. The EDPRS
was completed and adopted by the Government in September 2007, and submitted to the IMF and
World Bank as Rwanda's PRSP. The EDPRS is the Government's second-generation PRSP setting
out the country's objectives and major policies, and redefining the country's priorities for five years.
Rwanda's first PRSP covered the period 2002-2005 and was elaborated in a post-conflict
environment, where the primary emphasis was on managing a transitional period of rehabilitation and
reconstruction. The EDPRS makes the case for consolidating and extending the decentralization of
public spending when accompanied by robust accountability mechanisms. The EDPRS recognizes
the key role of the private sector in accelerating growth in order to reduce poverty. The strategy
provides a medium-term framework for achieving the country's long term development goals and
aspirations as embodied in the Rwanda Vision 2020 objectives. Rwanda's long term development
vision is to become a lower middle income economy (US$900 per capita) operating as a knowledge-
based service hub by 2020.

35.      The Government produced the EDPRS over a period of 18 months following an
extensive process of consultation with stakeholders from across Government and domestic and
international partners, including donors, civil society and the private sector. Participation at grass-
root levels was ensured through various consultations with citizens. Rwanda's socio-economic
performance together with the lessons from the first PRSP lead to four underlying objectives for the
EDPRS: (i) increase economic growth. (ii) slow down population growth, (iii) tackle extreme poverty,
and (iv) ensure greater efficiency in poverty reduction. The EDPRS assigns the highest priority to
accelerating growth to create employment and generate exports. The strategy is framed around three
strategic flagship programs: (1) Growth for Jobs and Exports, (2) Vision 2020 Umurenge (VUP) (an
integrated rural development program to eradicate extreme poverty and release the productive
capacities of the poor) 11, and (3) Governance. The implementation of the EDPRS will require total
resources of RwF5,151 billion over the five-year period 2008-12. The financing requirement amounts
to RwF352 billion, equivalent to US$700 million (or an average of US$ 140 million per year).




11
   The VUP strengthens implementation of public works employment, comprises cash transfer to the poor and landless, and
focuses on the delivery of high impact health and nutrition interventions at the community level.

Reviews (JSRs) and is subsequently validated
by the JBSR. Donors providing budget support coordinate with Government to jointly monitor
progress in EDPRS implementation through use of the CPAF. In 2008, the Government conducted the
first JSR and JBSR based on the established CPAF. The proposed PRSF-7 operation is coordinated
with the CPAF and all PRSF-7 prior actions, but one, are part of the CPAF (Annex 3). In line with
the intention to give a more prominent role to SWGs and to increase the focus of the overall JBSR,
consultations and discussions are held at sector level prior to each JBSR. SWGs, each chaired by a
lead Government institution and co-chaired by a lead donor, monitor and report on their respective
sector results and policy matrices. Sectors produce sector performance reports (around EDPRS, CPAF
and budget indicators), which are subsequently discussed in JSRs. Based on these discussions,
summaries of sector performance over the fiscal year are signed by the co-chairs.

               IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                                              LINK TO CAS

37.    The proposed operation is in alignment with the Rwanda CAS, discussed by the Board
in August 2008, and supports the Government's vision to become a middle income economy by
2020. The CAS is framed around two strategic themes: (i) promoting economic transformation and
growth; and (ii) reducing social vulnerability. It is closely aligned with the EDPRS and follows the
Government's preferences for engagement with the Bank in coordination with other donors.

38.     The focus of the PRSF series is on the first CAS strategic theme: promoting economic
growth. Within this theme, the PRSF covers three areas: (i) promoting sustainable growth and private
sector development, supported by science, technology and innovation; (ii) increasing capacity to
implement the Government's decentralization program and budget reforms; and (iii) continuing to
support improvements in service delivery with a focus on economic and infrastructure services and on
increasing the availability of skilled labor.

39.     In support of the second CAS strategic theme, reducing social vulnerability, a parallel
programmatic Development Policy Operation series supports the Government's
implementation of social protection and community health strategies. The CLSC complements
the PRSF focus on growth and poverty reduction, particularly in rural areas. It supports social
protection and health policy reforms, designed to reduce extreme poverty and to expand access to
high impact health, nutrition and population interventions at the community level.

6). The Authorities were a key driver behind the
establishment of the Donor Performance Assessment
Framework (DPAF) and the CPAF for budget support donors.

41.      A DPAF reviews the performance of bilateral and multilateral donors against a set of
establish indicators on the quality and volume of development assistance to Rwanda. Total
Oversees Development Assistance (ODA) for the last DPAF review for FY10 was US$941 million
dollars from 15 donors with 36 percent provided in budget support. The DPAF exercise is based on
donor reporting of aid data and self-reporting on DPAF indicators at project/program level in a
Development Assistance Database. Key DPAF findings on an aggregate level include a continued
increase in the total volume of ODA that is recorded in Rwanda's national annual budget. This
increase has been driven by a considerable shift in aid modalities toward general and sector budget
support. At the same time, more ODA is disbursed using Government financial reporting as well as
procurement systems. Further improvements are needed in terms of ODA disbursed using
Government's execution procedures as well as auditing procedures. The DPAF also features budget
support specific indicators, which record positively that donors keep Government fully informed
about the anticipated volumes of budget support. However, progress is lacking with respect to the
predictability and timing of budget support. In an attempt to improve this indicator Government
recently requested agencies to provide monthly disbursement schedules.

42.      In July 2010, Government finalized a DoL exercise with the goal to limit each partners'
activities to three sectors. Some of the criteria for mapping sectors with donors were the financing
gap for EDPRS programs and specific donor characteristics, e.g. donors' preferred aid modalities,
their track record in terms of achieving sector outcomes, but also in being aid effective, their mandate,
and their global experience in the respective area. The DoL confirmed the Bank's engagement in
three sectors: agriculture, energy, and transport (including ICT) and some cross-cutting areas (e.g.
skills development and capacity building). As a provider of general budget support the Bank is in
principle free to take part in any sector dialogue.

43.      The World Bank and the IMF continue to work closely together to ensure coordination
and consistency in macroeconomic and structural policy programs. While the Fund advises on the
size of the spending envelope on the occasion of budget discussions, the World Bank focuses
attention to the composition of spending and its alignment with the EDPRS. The proposed PRSF
operation supports a subset of the Government's reform program which is complementing the IMF's
PSI and the budget support operations provided by other donors.

                         RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

44.      Since 1970, The International Development Association (IDA) has committed to Rwanda
a total of US$1.8 billion, of which 35 percent has been in grants and 65 percent in credits. Forty-
four investment projects and eight development policy operations have been implemented to date.
During FY09-10, IDA delivered three new investment operations and two PRSFs for a total net
commitment amount of US$195.8 million. IDA's current active portfolio comprises eleven
investment projects with a net commitment of US$236.5 million, of which US$112 million (43
percent) had been disbursed as of October 4, 2010.


                                                                                                                                         16
45.     The PRSF supports other parts of the Rwanda portfolio, including various investment
projects in different sectors. The PRSF focus complements an investment portfolio with a strong
emphasis on improved agriculture production and infrastructure (transport, energy and ICT), and
providing continued support to the management of public resources at central and local levels.

46.     Agriculture: The Second Rural Sector Support Project-2 focuses on expanding irrigated
areas in cultivated marshlands and increasing the use of sustainable land management practices on
associated hillsides to accelerate the pace of agriculture intensification. The more recent Land
Management, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) Project supports a comprehensive
Government program for commercialized and professional agriculture with a focus on increasing the
productivity and commercialization of hillside agriculture in target areas. The Integrated
Management of Critical Ecosystems Project promotes the sustainable use and management of
Rwanda's critical ecosystems. A planned regional project will focus on the sustainable environmental
management of the Lake Victoria basin. The regional project (under the Nile Basin Initiative), the
Kagera River Basin Project, includes a feasibility study in integrated water resources management and
small multipurpose storage in the Kagera Basin.

47.     Infrastructure (Energy/Transport/ICT): The Electricity Access Scale-up Project focuses
on improving access to reliable and cost-effective electricity services for households and priority
public institutions by financing the rehabilitation and expansion of Rwanda's national transmission
and distribution networks. The Transport Sector Development Project contributes to improving the
quality of key international and domestic transport infrastructure as part of a wider strategy to
improve regional connectivity. The project links with various regional projects, including the East
Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project, which supports specific measures to improve the
links with markets within the EAC. The project is providing political risk insurance to improve
private capital flows within the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA). The
Regional Communications Infrastructure Project supports investments and technical assistance to
lower prices for international communications and extend the geographic reach of broadband
networks. The eRwanda Project supports the use and implementation of various ICT services.

48.      Private Sector Development: The Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project
supports investment climate reforms by assisting commercial law reform, developing the capacity of
the Rwanda investment promotion agency, promoting the public-private dialogue as well as
supporting implementation of key elements of the country's financial sector development plan
(payment systems, microfinance, accounting and auditing standards). The planned East African
Community Financial Sector Regionalization Project supports the development of the financial
sector through the establishment of a single market in financial services among EAC partner states.
The IDA program links closely with various IFC activities in the country, including the Investment
Climate Reform Project, which seeks to improve the regulatory environment, build institutions, and
attract private sector participation in key sectors; the IFC's Credit Reporting Program, which works
closely with the central bank to develop the legal framework for sharing information and selecting a
private credit bureau operator; and the Entrepreneurship Development Program, which promotes
SME competitiveness through building capacity and linkages with larger firms as well as
entrepreneurship among the youth and women. In addition, there are several MIGA activities, which
consist of three projects in the areas of financial services and banking, with a major guarantee planned
for the energy sector.

49.      Management of Public Resources: The Public Sector Capacity Building Project focuses
on supporting crucial reforms that will strengthen PFM, including budgeting, accounting, auditing,
procurement, financial reporting and external oversight. This is complemented by technical assistance
which is being provided for Public Expenditure Management. In addition, technical support is
being given to help the Government implement its Civil Service Reform Program with particular
attention on strengthening of core systems.

Rwanda labor force by expanding access to quality vocational training and general education.

                                      LESSONS LEARNED

51.      The Rwanda PRSF series comprises four annual, single-tranche operations within a
programmatic framework that reflects good practices and lessons learned in budget support
and development effectiveness. The reform program supported by these PRSF operations has been
underpinned by analytic and diagnostic work (para. 58), policy engagement by Bank staff and policy
collaboration with development partners --involving both budget support and non-budget support
partners (para. 40). The program complements, and is reinforced by, Bank sectoral investments and a
diverse trust fund portfolio (para. 45).

52.     The main findings from the second PRSF series are that it proved to be effective in
advancing Government-owned reforms, providing substantial financing and fostering better
donor coordination. The PRSF series has provided important support to the Government to
operationalize its ambitious medium-term development strategy (i.e., the EDPRS) by translating its
objectives into priority actions. The PRSF series also provided substantial financing to Rwanda's
budget. Since Rwanda depends on highly concessional financing, not just to cover an ambitious
investment program, but also to cover parts of the recurrent budget expenditures, budget support
grants provide a preferred contribution to Rwanda's overall financing needs. The Authorities are
looking to the World Bank and other development partners as a source of continued financing in
meeting these needs. Finally, the second PRSF series has improved harmonization and reinforced
support for reforms among the country's budget support donors: the World Bank, AfDB, and bilateral
donors --all partners in the BSHG and part of the bi-annual JBSR.

53.      As the PRSF series has progressed, so the reform agenda evolved, but remained overall
broad. This is attributable to the breadth of the Bank's policy dialogue with Government, but also
reflects the recognition by policy-makers of the utility of budget support, including the PRSF series,
in helping to move the reform process forward. While the series set-out to support the second
generation EDPRS, the process of designing the reform program has evolved in ways that were not
foreseen at the outset. A major change over the course of the series was the finalization of the CPAF
in December 2008 and the subsequent alignment of all donor budget support, including the PRSF
series with it. The PRSG-5 operation was the first operation that aligned the series with the CPAF.

54.      The broad scope of the Government of Rwanda reform agenda, and reflected in the
CPAF, revealed tensions in the design and strategic use of the PRSF series. While the CPAF
(Annex 3) contains a number of outcome indicators, which other donors use as their condition for
budget support disbursement, the policy actions formulated in the CPAF are by design more process-
oriented. For Government the goal of these policy actions is to be able to monitor if key milestones
are being achieved, thus, helping the Government to track progress over the year towards fulfillment
of key outcome indicators. The process nature of many prior actions contravenes World Bank good
practice, but should also be seen in the context of strong country ownership of the reform process.

55.      Through the successful implementation of the PRSF series 4 to 7, investment projects
and analytical work on Rwanda, a number of lessons have been learned. First, the CAS Progress
report summarizes lessons from previous strategy implementation, underlining the importance of
capacity building and the need to continue to explore synergies within the World Bank Group.
Second, given the capacity constraints of a small, but reform-oriented Government the principles of
selectivity, ownership and predictability -applicable across countries--are emphasized in Rwanda.
Finally, there needs to be better coordination with the monitoring and evaluation system for the
EDPRS, and in the case of the PRSF series, the CPAF process. Key lessons emerging from
implementation of the PRSF 4-7 series are summarized as follows:



                                                 18
  · Capacity support: A complex budget support framework requires capacity support for program
    design, elaboration of reforms, identification and measurement of outcome indicators. Strong
    capacity support has led to substantial progress in reforms for example, in the health, education
    and agriculture sectors. The same approach has been adopted for the infrastructure sector.

  · Participation in sector dialogue: Greater participation of sectors in policy discussions, within
    the SWGs during the biannual JSRs and anchored around the CPAF, greatly facilitated reform
    progress. This has helped to: (i) ensure the PRSF reflects substantive policy agreements reached
    at the sector level; (ii) strengthen the capacity of sector ministries to present their needs and
    priorities during national level policy discussions and budget negotiations; and (iii) facilitate
    coordination of the Bank's inputs into the CPAF policy discussions in a timely manner. A greater
    representation of the sector staff in-country is crucial to contribute to this progress.

  · Adjust best practices on conditionality to the country context. Box 7 presents the adjustment
    of good practice principles on conditionality to the Rwanda context. These principles are also
    reflected in the CPAF, which contains specific actions and outcomes for PRSF-7 (Annex 3).


              Box 7: How the PRSF Reflects Good Practices Principles on Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership. The Government of Rwanda has a strong track record in committing to and implementing
reforms. The PRSF supports the Government's program, the EDPRS, which was developed in a participatory manner involving
extensive consultation of a wide range of stakeholders (including civil society, farmers' organizations, and NGOs). The process
was led by a National Steering Committee, comprised of Ministers and Governors, providing high level guidance. Furthermore,
Government coordination with development partners and its preferred modality for donor funding is defined in the Aid Policy that
articulates the Government's vision for improved aid management and policies

Principle 2: Agreement upfront with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework. Under the Government's leadership and working closely with development partners, a common performance
assessment framework was completed and adopted in 2008. The CPAF is based on the policy matrix of the EDPRS and
represents a time bound and monitorable action plan (Annex 3). PRSG-4 was a transition operation toward development of the
CPAF. Under PRSF-6 and 7 alignment with the CPAF review process has been improved. The CPAF matrix serves to monitor
progress under the reform program supported by the PRSF series. In addition, the Government and the budget support donors
have agreed to use the PEFA as a common assessment framework for progress in PFM.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances. The
PRSF series is fully aligned with the EDPRS priority areas. It benefits from the extensive consultations that were led by
Government in identifying priority areas for the EDPRS. These consultations were conducted within the Government's
participatory planning framework or Ubudehe process. PRSF preparation also benefits from the extensive consultations through
the SWGs of the EDPRS implementation process. Each key sector of the EDPRS (and therefore of the PRSF) coordinates its
sector policies through a SWG. SWG membership includes both Government and non-government representation (i.e. donors,
civil society, local organizations and NGOs).The PRSF can be seen as the overall umbrella for Bank support and policy dialogue,
which is complemented by specific projects providing focused investment assistance. Rwanda has established a track record in
budget support and project implementation, therefore budget support is seen as a good instrument to address a broader range of
issues while strengthening the Government's systems.

Principle 4: Choose actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The PRSF focuses on a few
selected triggers and prior actions, representing critical steps for implementing the Government's program. They are based on
the EDPRS policy matrix and evolved from extensive discussion with the Government and other relevant stakeholders.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial support. A
full review of the program takes place in line with the reviews agreed in the Partnership Framework between the Government and
the budget support donors. JBSRs take place twice a year, aligned with the budget cycle. A secretariat in MINECOFIN has taken
over the lead role in coordination and preparation of the reviews. In addition, SWGs conduct sector reviews, aligned with the
budget cycle, and which form the basis for the JBSR.




                                                             19
56.       There is a need to adjust the preparation cycle of the PRSF series in Rwanda in order
to facilitate the process for formulation of policy actions and the timely use of the CPAF. As
pointed out during the preparation of PRSG-6, the process for elaborating and prioritizing policy
actions repeatedly posed substantial challenges to the
Bank in preparing its program. Unlike other budget             Box 8: MoU on Budget Support

that a robust and up-to-date policy framework is

Bank to time disbursements for the beginning of the Government's fiscal year, considerably
improving alignment with Government's budget cycle and improving predictability of resources.

                                 ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

58.      The PRSF-7 builds on analytical work carried out over the last few years, as well as
ongoing analytical work on public expenditure management to support Pillar 1 (Jobs for
Growth and Exports), and Pillar 3 (Governance) of the EDPRS. A Multi-year Technical
Assistance PER was finalized in June 2010 and plays a major role in implementation of PRSF
activities by prioritizing the measures needed to improve the quality of spending in the PRSF series.
It also provided technical assistance to the Government for the institutionalization of the PER process.
Regular DSA updates, in close collaboration with the IMF and in consultation with the Government
aim to ensure debt is managed consistently with macroeconomic stability. Analytical work completed
includes the FY07 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the FY07 Agriculture Policy Note, and
the FY07 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment. The program also builds on
analytical work carried out by the Government including the FY06 Poverty Report and the Financial
Sector Development Plan (FSDP).

59.       The areas of focus under this second series of PRSFs are defined by the results of key
analytical assessments that examined the sources and constraints to growth as well as measures
needed to improve the overall business and investment environment. In particular, the CEM, the
Diagnostic Trade Integrated Study and the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) identified the
constraints to growth, exports and investment, emphasizing the need to build and maintain the stock
of infrastructure and skills. The CEM highlights the problem posed by the high level of maintenance
costs with low cost recovery that affects upkeep of the infrastructure network and its efficiency. This
also has an impact on investments. In the road sector, maintenance is constrained by the lack of road
maintenance funds. In the electricity sector, poor maintenance has contributed to high transmission
losses and frequent outages. The CEM also highlighted the importance of agriculture in sustaining
growth over the medium term and the Agriculture Policy Note identified poor input use, water
management and soil conservation along with insufficient capacity support to farmers as the most
critical constraints to address, in order to raise productivity.



                                                     20
60.     The ICA and the Foreign Investment Advisory Service study of informal enterprises
both highlighted the need to improve financial intermediation and build capacity of micro-
enterprises to access micro-finance. The study identifies the low level of capacity in business
development skills and lack of information on the kinds of credit instruments that are available and
how to access these. The FSDP identified the need to develop the microfinance sector as critical to
monetizing and deepening the financial sector. The report highlighted the importance of developing
the payment system, if Rwanda is to reduce the predominance of cash transactions, particularly given
the country's vision of developing the tourism sector and a service-based economy.

61.      For the infrastructure sectors (i.e. energy, water, transport), strategic frameworks and
policies have been elaborated and the institutional frameworks established. For example, the
report on water legislation and institutions led to the drafting and approval of the Water Law by
Parliament, the implementation of which is being supported under this PRSF series. The report on
water data management stresses the need for further capacity building in developing and monitoring
activities in the water sector through the use of a management information system and water
information system to improve data collection, analysis and reporting. Rwanda is also in the process
of developing a Water Resources Master Plan. The aim is to improve coordination and ensure that
there is proper planning and allocation among sectors to ensure the sustainability of water resources in
the country. Furthermore, a critical constraint now is sustainability and maintenance of the
infrastructure and ensuring there is a sound institutional and regulatory framework in place to attain
this. To that end, completed studies-- the tariff study in electricity and water; PERs in transport ­
helped to prioritize specific areas of reform to be supported under the PRSF.

62.      In the area of skills development, a comprehensive and well-costed strategy for post-
basic education (PBE) is being developed and development partners are engaged through the
economic sector working group, as the coordinating body. Costing estimates for PBE are being
undertaken within a context of updating the overall costing of the education sector strategic plan to
reflect revised targets for the sector. The revised targets reflect the strong achievements to date and
incorporate the needs of the private sector. It recognizes that the strategy for strengthening PBE and
skills development is broader than a focus on Technical and Vocational Education and Training
(TVET). The Bank's analytical work through the Country Status Report Update and the ESW on
PBE and training serves as input for the government's PBE strategy as well as for the revision of the
Education Sector Strategic Plan. In addition, following on the ESW work on PBE, a project on skills
development is planned as well as further analytical work in the area of skills development and PBE,
and their linkages to labor demand.

63.      Ongoing and existing analytical work on fiduciary arrangements set out action plans for
improvements in PFM and public procurement, providing important insights for the preparation of
this operation. These works include the completed 2010 PEFA assessment update, which highlights
the importance of continuing to support capacity in pubic financial accounting and reporting
particularly at decentralized levels, MTEF development, and procurement. Annex 4 presents a
summary of the PEFA indicators and compares the 2007 and 2010 results. The PFM Action Plan
outlines a costed plan for reforms to strengthen PFM capacity. These are key areas of support under
the PRSF series.

64.      Non-lending activities will continue to play a major role in the implementation of PRSF
activities, and will focus on capacity building. A Technical Assistance program in support of
improving public expenditure management has been finalized. A multi-year Agriculture Policy
Technical Assistance program is ongoing to complement operations in the sector.

65.    Aside from ongoing and completed analytical works, several studies are planned to
support the successor PRSF agenda including: (i) an Employment and Growth ESW focused on
employment creation, growth and skills development, to improve understanding of the employment
and poverty effects of growth, has been launched; (ii) a ESW within the framework of the multi-year
Education Policy Analysis to underpin the skills development agenda is underway; (iii) a Non-

                                                  21
Lending Technical Assistance in Private Sector Development is under implementation and supports

 V. THE PROPOSED SEVENTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT FINANCING

                                  OPERATION DESCRIPTION

66.      Development objective: The PRSF-7 of SDR67.8 million (US$104.4 million equivalent)
supports the implementation of the Government's medium-term development strategy, the EDPRS,
within the context of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The proposed Financing is closely
aligned with the CPAF, which was prepared under Government leadership in consultation with
development partners. Overall, PRSF-7 continues to follow the areas of reforms identified under
PRSG-4 in the agriculture, infrastructure and social sectors. The program development objective is to
adopt policies and reforms that support more efficient governance and contribute to broad based
growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low skills base, and the
high cost of infrastructure services in Rwanda. Specifically, it aims at: (i) sustainably raising
agricultural production; (ii) increasing access to infrastructure services; (iii) strengthening the
framework for post-basic education, to build a skilled workforce and promote science and technology;
(iv) deepening the financial sector; and (v) strengthening the management of public resources at the
central and local levels.

67.      Reform Program: The Government requested IDA to support the national development
strategy, the EDPRS, with its commitment to macroeconomic stability and sustained growth and
poverty reduction as outlined in the attached Letter of Development Policy (LDP, Annex 1). Specific
actions being supported and monitored under PRSF-7 are summarized below, covering two of the
Government's flagship programs. The first flagship program, Growth for Exports and Jobs, covers
actions to: enhance the skills of the population; improve cost-effective and operational efficiency in
the energy sector; develop a framework for integrated and sustainable management of water
resources; increase rural road access by improving the condition of the classified district road
network; raise agricultural productivity; and broaden and deepen the financial sector. The second
flagship program, Economic Governance and Implementation Capacity, aims to strengthen the: PFM
system; capacity and transparency of procurement systems; implementation of budget and fiscal
decentralization reforms; and civil service reforms to build skills and incentives for retention.

68.     Prior actions: The operation is designed so that all prior actions for the PRSF-7 have been
taken prior to Board presentation. The prior actions are described in Table 5 and present the specific
actions within the Government reform program that forms the basis for PRSF-7 disbursement. They
are imbedded in the medium-term Government reform program as reflected in this section. Annex 2
presents the policy actions supported by the PRSF-5 to 7 operations, which are aligned with the
CPAF. Only one prior action is not from the CPAF, prior action 11, because the original prior action
was exchanged with a reform towards the achievement of it.

changing environment. 12

70.       Both Government and key stakeholders have agreed that the approach to skills
development requires a comprehensive treatment of PBE. Through the education SWG,
stakeholders have agreed that the approach needs to ensure all key aspects and levels of the education
sector are aligned to support the strengthening of PBE. In addition, there is an emphasis on ensuring
that it is demand driven and responds to the needs of the private sector. Recognizing the shortages of
technically trained workers and the relatively underdeveloped state of the TVET system compared to
that for general upper secondary and higher education, particular attention is being devoted to
improving access to, quality and relevance of TVET. To this end, a TVET Policy, Integrated TVET
Concept Paper, and draft TVET Implementation Plan have been developed, and are in the process of
being implemented by the newly established Workforce Development Authority. 13 In addition, there
are indications that the Government is considering the expansion of its current policy of 9YBE to
targeting universal access to twelve years of education. This would imply the need to considerably
increase access to upper general secondary education, which is currently considered to be a potential
bottleneck for the further expansion of the PBET system.

71.     Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) are considered to be particularly important
elements that need to be promoted and strengthened to support the achievement of Rwanda's
economic development objectives. Reforms related to STI have been adopted to strengthen PBE and
promote skills development and innovation. These have focused on establishing the institutions to
support the STI Policy, and ensure its linkage to the education system, such as the Cabinet decision of
September 2009, to establish the National Council for Science Technology and Innovation that will be
involved in the implementation of the cross-sectoral STI Policy. Cabinet also approved the

   These skills can be considered to include communication skills, the ability to work in a team, critical thinking and problem
solving skills, independent thinking, the ability to learn, adaptability, and entrepreneurial skills.

General.

72.      The prior action for the PRSF-7 was the revision of the ESSP to include greater focus on
and cost of PBE and its linkages to the labor market as well as STI. The new ESSP 2010-2015 was
finalized after a consultative development process that took into account lessons learned from the
previous ESSP. The ESSP is underpinned by an updated financing framework based on a newly
developed costing model. This model can be used to provide cost estimates of key education
programs for the implementation period of the ESSP. The ESSP has undergone a formal appraisal ­
approved by all key development partners in the sector including the World Bank­ which summarizes
the ESSP as being consistent in addressing key policy and strategic challenges. The ESSP provides a
good balance between basic and post-basic levels of the system and between equity and labour market
considerations. It recognises the trade-offs involved in driving towards its twin priorities of Nine Year
Basic Education and PBE. The promotion of STI is considered an important cross-sector priority.

73.       The Government's next reform steps are likely to focus on priority actions in the skills
development sector that address adequately changes in (projected) skills gaps. First, to continue
improving the skills base of the workforce in an effective and efficient manner, it will be essential to
make improved information on current and future skills needs available to all relevant stakeholders. 14
Second, the information on current and future labor needs and skills gaps would be used as a basis for
MINEDUC to determine priority areas and to adequately balance attention to improving access and/or
quality of post-basic education, or general education and/or TVET. In this regard it is likely that upper
secondary education is expected to require increased attention in the coming years, both in terms of
access and quality. Third, as a cross-sector issue, skills development issues would need to be
addressed in a coordinated manner across various ministries and agencies, with a role for the
MINEDUC as the key implementer of policies and interventions in the area of education and training.
Finally, MINEDUC should provide the framework and incentives to education and training providers
to respond adequately and flexibly to either national or local skills needs.This includes the
improvement of the legal framework, funding and accountability mechanisms, and support to
facilitate interactions and cooperation between individual education and training institutions and the
private sector.

(ii)     Improve Economic Infrastructure

Increase Electricity Access and Supply

74.       The primary EDPRS target for the electricity sector is tripling access by 2012 to about
16 percent of households and at least 50 percent of identified public institutions in health, education,
and local administration. More than 200,000 new grid connections will be required, and efforts are
also included for reaching rural consumers and service providers currently off the national grid.
Despite the high density of population (estimated at about 9 million and more than 320
individuals/km2), only 8 percent of Rwandan households (150,000 customers) have access to
electricity from the grid. During 2004-2006, Rwanda suffered from an acute shortage of electricity
supply and severe load shedding. Government responded by renting additional diesel generation
capacity at high cost, increasing tariffs by more than 100 percent, to about US$0.21/kWh. By contrast,
average retail tariffs in the rest of the region are around US$0.10-0.16/kWh. Furthermore, the poor
quality of supply severely limits the competitiveness of Rwandan businesses. The development of
energy resources ­additional hydroelectricity, methane gas dissolved in Lake Kivu, peat, geothermal­
has been constrained by lack of financing and an inadequate institutional framework.



14
   On the national governmental level, this would involve gathering and disseminating labor market information data and
projecting future labor needs based on national and sectoral economic growth prognosis and comprehensive consultations
with private sector representatives.

Government's policy to increase private sector
investments primarily in generation and off-grid
electricity distribution. A number of new generation projects are under various stages of development,
many utilizing lower cost indigenous energy sources (Box 10). These projects account for a more than
70 percent increase in national generation capacity installed, and are adequate to supply the
incremental demand from the National Electricity Access Program and other load growth through the
short term. However, tariffs still need to be adjusted to reflect cost, following the adoption of cheaper
energy sources and the planned reduction of technical losses (from the current level of 20 to 15
percent by 2012) as well as the promotion of energy efficiency.

76.      A comprehensive strategy for the sector has been adopted within the framework of a
SWAp, supported by the Bank as well as other key donors such as Netherlands, Belgium, AfDB,
JICA and the EC. Also, the Government has designated, with donor endorsement, the Bank's role as
both the lead donor in the energy sector and the donor representative of the energy sector cluster and
SWG; the latter was formalized in the Energy SWAp MoU of July 2008. The Bank has supported the
Government's efforts to orchestrate formation of the SWG and to facilitate its early functioning. This
support has also included preparation of the Government's spatial, least-cost electricity investment
program and financing proposal, and the National Electricity Access Program Investment Prospectus.
As the largest donor in the sector, the IDA project portfolio constitutes a cornerstone of the sector
investment plan in areas where private sector financing is not available (i.e. transmission and
distribution).

77.      Prior actions for PRSF-7 in this sector were: (i) completion of electricity tariff study
(including revised tariff structure) and its validation by Rwanda Utility Regulations Agency
(RURA) and MININFRA; and (ii) removal of taxes (Import Duty and Value Added Tax) on LPG to
promote its use and reduce dependence on charcoal. The LPG VAT and import duty were removed
in 2010. While the environmental and social impact of the LPG tax removal is estimated to be small
(see para 114 and 122), a short socio-economic impact analysis of the effects of the LPG tax removal,
based on available date is presented in Annex 7. The tariff and cost of service study informs the level
of cost reflective tariff that is a function of operational cost, investment needs and depreciation. It
recommends a new structure and tariff for various customer groups balancing the cost of service and
socio-economic considerations to protect the poor and support economic growth. The first report on
the tariff review was completed in October 2010 and presented and discussed in a validation
workshop hosted by RURA. A socio-economic impact analysis of the planned tariff framework in
regard to access will be incorporated into the IDA Rwanda Electricity Access Scale-up Project.

78.     Next important Government reform activities will facilitate further increases in
electricity production and access and foster the use of regional electricity resources. Assuming
continuing growth of the Rwanda economy, further increases in power production will be necessary
over the short-term and should include the exploration of local energy sources, such as methane gas,

                                                       27
thermal, solar, and the substitution of biomass with modern forms of energy. In the medium to longer
term, the increased regional integration of the regional power market under the auspices of the East-
Africa Power Pool will have significant benefits to the power sector in the form of lower cost service
in addition to increased reliability efficiency. Regional projects include a transmission line connecting
Rwanda to Uganda and the regional hydropower projects of Rus umo (50-80MW) and Rusizi III
(145MW), including the associated transmission network interconnecting Rwanda to Tanzania,
Burundi and DRC. Potentially supported activities for the next series include: (i) reducing the cost of
electricity; (ii) sustaining increased access and generation; and (iii) developing a regulatory and
institutional framework that will support increased private sector participation and regional power
trade.

Improved Access to Safe Drinking Water and Improved Sanitation Status

79.     By recognizing the major role of water resources management in socio-economic
development of the country, the Government decided to separate water resources management
from water supply and sanitation. The Ministry of Environment and Land (MINELA) focuses now
on water resources management while water supply and sanitation services are covered by
MININFRA. Under the leadership of MININFRA, a MoU for a SWAp on Water Supply and
Sanitation is being discussed by the SWG and is in the process of being finalized and signed. The goal
of the SWAp is to support future coordination and sector financing. A financing mechanism for water
supply and sanitation in rural area has been completed and adopted by the SWG. MINELA is
currently establishing a MoU for a SWAp for natural resources, including water resources. Donor
support for reforms in the water sector through these SWAps include the support of investments to
construct and rehabilitate water supply and sanitation facilities.

80.      The main regulatory framework for water resources management has been established.
The Water Law was gazetted, and MINELA has initiated drafting of the decrees to implement the
Water Law. This Law defines the regulatory framework for the use, conservation, protection and
management of water resources. If well implemented, this law is expected to allow improved planning
in the water sector. In March 2010 Cabinet adopted a National Policy and Strategy for Water Supply
and Sanitation. A natural resources board will be established to ensure effective coordination in
management of Rwanda's natural resources. This Board is expected to cover the following aspects:
land, forestry, mining and water resources management. Upon recommendation of the SWG, a Policy
of Water Resource Management was produced.

81.      A prior action under PRSF-7 was: design of a tariff framework for urban water services
that promotes efficiency, reliability, equity and sustainability of water resources. The Tariff Study
Review for Water in Urban Services was designed and validated by a workshop in December 2010.
Under the overall direction of MININFRA, a consultant reviewed the current urban water tariff and
made recommendations (with options) on tariff structure and level for Government consideration as
well as regulatory mechanisms for oversight of the tariff system, including periodic reviews. This
prior action will help to strengthen coordination, planning, implementation and monitoring leading to
improved service delivery and eventually improved sanitation.

82.      Important future reforms in this sector include measures to further improve water
supply and water resource management. With regard to water supply, it is important that a revised
tariff framework for urban water supply services is being implemented. With regard to water
resources management, MINELA drafted a Water Policy that is being reviewed and has initiated the
process to produce the Water Resources Master Plan. To implement adequately the Water Law it is
critical to finalize the decrees and the Water Resources Master Plan. The decrees will clarify the
institutional aspects (including decentralization) and processing of key aspects such as the allocation
of water. The Water Resources Master Plan shall include aspects related to the quantification of the
water resources in the country and analysis on the demand and availability of the resource. It should
also provide linkages with other sectoral master plans (e.g. Irrigation Master Plan, etc).


                                                   28
 (iii)   Raise Agriculture Productivity

83.      The PRSF supports the Government's main areas of focus in agriculture, to strengthen
soil and water conservation and irrigation, and reforms to develop a private sector led fertilizer
distribution system. Notable achievements in this sector include the completion of the Agriculture
Sector Investment Plan 2009-2011 and the signing of a MoU for the Agriculture SWAp in December
2008. The SWAp formalizes the commitments of development partners in the sector around the four
Programs 15 of the country's Strategic Plan for the Transformation of Agriculture (PSTA II). Other
achievements include the development of the Fertilizer Strategy and successful production under the
Crop Intensification Program ­a program to promote improved use of fertilizer and other inputs. The
Irrigation Master Plan was completed in September 2010 and the design and financing of the flagship
sustainable hillside intensification program, the LWH Program, was also finalized. Rwanda became
the first country to complete the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program
(CAADP) 16 process and one of the first three countries to receive support from the Global
Agricultural Food Security Program (GAFSP) for its hillside intensification program. Donor and
Government activities are coordinated through the effective operation of the SWG, which is seeing an
increasing interest among some development partners to engage in sectoral budget support.

84.     Several donors support overall implementation of the Government's strategic program
in agriculture and rural development. The International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD), Belgium, the World Food Program, AfDB, and USAID provide direct project support to the
implementation of the Government's program and strategy. Belgium is engaged in a national program
to support extension activities; IFAD supports community based watershed management, marshland
development and export crop production and marketing. AfDB is engaged in integrated lakes
management, rural infrastructure development and support to the livestock sector. The Netherlands
and the Food and Agriculture Organization are involved in extension and food security activities, and
JICA supports investments in water management in parallel to the Bank co-financed (with USAID
and Canadian International Development Agency) LWH support. The EC provides sector (as well as
general) budget support earmarked for decentralization and also has projects to support increased
exports and stabilize export earnings. Finally, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is
engaged in soil and land management. The sector is also supported across its four strategic PSTA
programs by a host of NGOs and smaller development partner organizations.

85.       The PRSF-7 supported Government to put in place a private sector-led fertilizer system
with a prior action on the development, costing and initiation of an action plan for capacity
building of private sector agro-dealers in agricultural input procurement and distribution,
particularly at decentralized levels. In addition to the support for generating sustainable fertilizer
demand through improved and targeted extension, improving private sector engagement and
distribution of improved inputs, depends critically on enabling private sector wholesaler and retailers
in Rwanda to participate in the business of fertilizers. Diagnostics on the fertilizer sub-sector in
Rwanda repeatedly pointed to weak private sector capacity for procurement, distribution and
marketing of fertilizers. Past PRSF has supported the Government's efforts through establishing a
fertilizer auction to enable private sector (as opposed to Government) distribution of fertilizers to
farmers and the implementation of a voucher scheme to deliver non-distortionary `smart' subsidies to
targeted food farmers. The Government's eventual exit from the fertilizer sub-sector--a stated goal in
their Input and Fertilizer Strategy--depends on capable and versatile private sector agents to step in.
For this reason, the PRSF prior action of a costed action plan for capacity building of private sector
agro-dealers in agricultural input procurement and distribution reflects a tangible commitment to the
private sector-oriented policy. The action plan was completed and is currently under implementation
with training sessions underway across the country and, with support from the International Fertilizer

Development Center and other development partners, outcomes of the training with private agro-
dealers will be monitored by MINAGRI.

86.      Government's reforms in this sector are likely to continue with the focus on furthering
private sector involvement in agriculture. The commitment to promote private sector involvement
and an exit strategy in fertilizer subsidization, evidenced by CPAF policy actions and past PRSF prior
actions, reflects the Government's overall stated policy for the sector. Government withdrawal from
mechanization, seeds and post harvest activities must be accompanied with support and capacity
building for private sector agents, if the needs of this critical growth sector are to be met. Support for
these activities, and further reforms that complete the exit of Government from the fertilizer and seeds
sector will be important, as will a review of the Mechanization and Rural Finance Strategies to clear
the way for private sector investment. The most numerous private sector agents are farmers so that
support for implementation of farmer choice-led programs and policies will contribute to a firm basis
for development in the sector.

(iv)      Broaden and Deepen the Financial Sector

87.      The objective of financial sector development is to facilitate the mobilization of savings
by establishing direct links to productive public and private investments. To achieve the
ambitious annual EDPRS growth target of 8 percent a savings level of 12 percent of GDP and
domestic investments of 24 percent of GDP is required. While the financial sector has recorded in the
pre-crisis period of 2003-07 an impressive 20 percent growth per year, the GDP share of the financial
sector remained small at 5.2 percent. In 2007 only 12 percent of the population had a bank account.
In order to be able to better promote financial sector development, the IMF and World Bank
conducted upon request by the Government a FSAP in 2005. Today, the financial sector in Rwanda
comprises eight commercial banks, one primary
microfinance bank, one discount house, one                          Box 11: Access to Finance

88.     Challenges in the financial sector include a
high level of financial exclusion, inadequate
capacity and governance issues. Access to finance remains very limited, only about 50 percent of
Rwandan adults have access to any form of financial services (Box 11). Despite the fact that
Government along with the World Bank and several other development partners provide support to
strengthen the financial sector, capacity limitations still need to be overcome. Improving corporate
governance in the financial sector remains another main focus of ongoing activities.

89.   One prior action for the PRSF-7 was the adoption by Cabinet of a comprehensive
framework of support to SMEs (including consolidation of financing mechanisms). This supports

   This market is essential to issue and trade long-term securities currently comprising of Treasury bonds and corporate
bonds. Contrary to T-bills (short-term of less than one year) issued and traded on the money market, T-bonds (long-term of
more than one year) are essential to raise capital for public and private investments. The plan is to proceed with the issuance
and trading of equities. At the end of 2010, the trading and regulatory functions will be separated. Government bonds of
between 2-3 years worth RwF19.75 billion and one 10 year corporate bond worth RwF1 billion were issued and are traded.

the Government's continuing effort to improve access to finance, particularly rural finance. In June
2010 the Cabinet approved Rwanda's SME Development Policy which has the objective of fostering
job creation and an increase in the tax and export base through the promotion of competitive new and
existing SMEs in value added sectors. In order to implement this policy, currently main
implementing agencies BRD, Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and Private Sector Federation with
MINICOM supervision are preparing a clear and practical action plan that will help implement this
policy framework.

90.      The PRSF-7 supported with another prior action the gazetting of the Regulation
Governing Payment Service Providers in the financial services sector. This supports increased
banking and monetization of the economy through the further development of the payment system. A
prior action under PRSG-6 supported the adoption by Parliament of a Law Governing Payment
Systems in the financial services sector, and development by the central bank of proposed regulations
governing payment service providers in the financial services sector. The Payments Systems Law was
approved and the accompanying regulations governing Payment Service Providers were published in
2010. BNR is setting up the Rwanda Integrated Payment Processing System, the national payment
system, and is expected to be functional for the Real Time Gross Settlement and Central Securities
Depository components. On business continuity arrangements, a decision has been made to set up a
disaster recovery site at a location that has already been identified. Public awareness is a key success
factor for payment systems modernization and BNR is planning to carry out activities in this regard.

91.      The next generation of financial sector reforms is likely to focus on the pension sector
and the microfinance sector. A FSAP update is planned for February 2011. The FSAP will review
the financial sector and lay out proposal for future policy reforms. This will be reflected in an updated
FSDP, which is likely to focus on the pension and microfinance sectors. For example, currently the
pension sector only provides benefits to citizens working in the formal sector. The Caisse Sociale du
Rwanda covers about 300,000 salaried workers, representing 7.5 percent of the active population.
The pension sector should be a major source of long term funds to support the development of the
private sector. In order to develop into this direction, it needs to be reformed by strengthening its
regulation, supervision and governance.

(i)      Strengthen the Public Financial Management System

92.     A PFM reform strategy and action plan was approved in 2008, and institutional
arrangements were established to monitor progress in its implementation (Para 25), including the
incorporation of seven PFM indicators into the CPAF. A PFM Reform Steering Committee chaired by
the Permanent Secretary and Secretary to the Treasury, MINECOFIN, was re-constituted to oversee
and coordinate PFM reforms. A PFM Reform Coordination Secretariat has been established. In
addition, Government signed with PFM donors a MoU for a Basket Fund to support PFM reforms,
which is now fully operational.

93.       The ongoing challenge remains to build capacity in public accountancy and managing
the transition from the current budgeting and accounting systems to an IFMIS. An important
aspect of the PFM Reform Strategy is to professionalize Government's PFM staff, through
enrollments into the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants professional qualification. The
first intake in 2006 had a low pass-rate, but Government has incorporated lessons learnt into a revised
design for this activity. Progress on this activity has been slow, given the rather complex and technical
nature. A second phase was launched in June 2010 and the pass-rate was better than the global
average. Complementary measures are being considered through the Rwanda Expertise Scheme,
including career path and retention measures. The main donors supporting reforms and capacity in the
PFM Action plan are: World Bank, EC, KfW, AfDB, the Department for International Development
(DfID), Netherlands, and Sweden.

                                                   31
94.      The PRSF series has focused support on Government actions to improve transparency
through the strengthening of the budget monitoring and reporting system. Automation of the
entire spectrum of the PFM cycle (planning, budgeting, procurement, accounting and reporting and
oversight) will enhance the transparency and efficiency of PFM processes across Government. This
complex process requires addressing a host of tasks, from transaction processing and the
consideration of information needs from various stakeholders, to the complete integration of
related/collaborating information systems. Efforts to address this challenge are currently focused on
developing a blue print for the IFMIS implementation, enhancing the core functionality of SmartGov
and designing interfaces with other systems such as IPPS, BNR and Rwanda Revenue Authority
(RRA) systems. The PRSF series also supported the development of the IFMIS and capacity
development for implementing procurement reforms at the central level of Government. SmartGov
includes a procurement module, already developed but not yet deployed. It is expected that the
procurement module will be tested and deployed in late 2011.

95.       The prior action for the PRSF-7 was the completion of the piloting of the IFMIS in
central government and its integration with the IPPS. In July 2010, following a short piloting phase
between April and June 2010, the (four) core modules of the IFMIS were rolled out to 94 out of 236
budget agencies. Current efforts are focused on providing sufficient end user support, developing key
functionalities that enhance the performance and controls embedded in the business processes of the
core modules, and developing operational and management reports for end users. The IFMIS will be
rolled out to the rest of the budget agencies in two additional phases, after which SAGE PASTELTM
will be phased out to be replaced by SmartGov as Rwanda's IFMIS. The second part of the prior
action, the creation of an interface to integrate IFMIS and the IPPS, was also accomplished. This
interface is ready to be rolled-out on a pilot basis, following the completion of the end user training in
January 2011. Its operationalization in June 2011 will allow Government to automate the capturing of
all government expenditures. Salaries and wages will no longer be inputted manually, and controls
over payroll will be strengthened. In future years, Government intends to roll out SmartGov to
districts and phase out SAGE PASTELTM.

96.     The next key actions that need to be taken in PFM include: (i) rolling out the remaining
modules of the IFMIS for its full implementation, including linking it to other systems such as the
RRA and the central bank as well as the debt management system and (ii) implementing career path
and retention measures in PFM through the Rwanda Expertise Scheme.

(ii) Strengthen Capacity and Transparency of Procurement Systems

97.      Rwanda has progressed in establishing a modern procurement system with an
appropriate institutional and legal system. A Procurement Law was adopted in April 2007, and in
February 2008 the institutional framework for oversight of procurement was established through the
Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA). A new organization chart of RPPA was approved and
set in place by a draft Code of Conduct was prepared by RPPA, specific to procurement staff. This
reorganization was done following a change in mission and responsibility. The new chart will help to
staff RPPA in accordance with the new mandate. A user guide manual was approved by the RPPA
board and published one the RPPA website. In an effort to develop capacity and support for
procurement practices RPPA conducted an intensive training program in Government's institutions.

98.     The prior action for the PRSF-7 was the Cabinet approval of the bill to amend the
Procurement Law to increase efficiency and transparency of public procurement. The proposed
changes in the law are meant to address some of the gaps identified during the Country Systems
Assessment and Government's own lessons from experience in the law implementation. The new bill
was approved by Cabinet on December 15, 2010. These amendments, when in effect, should reinforce
progress made to improve procurement practices and transparency. Amendment of the law was also
necessary to ensure its provisions are in line with: (i) the revised mandate of RPPA, resulting from the
full devolution of the procurement transaction function to the procuring entities; and (ii) the
COMESA framework for procurement. The amendment also clarify the scope of the law, the

                                                   32
definitions of certain procurement methods, participation of state owned enterprises in bidding,
language(s) used in bidding and application of administrative and criminal sanctions. It will
strengthen appeal procedures, increase publicity of contract awards, will broaden definitions on fraud
and corruption, and, in general, will ensure the consistent use of terminology. The preparation of the
bill to amend the Procurement Law followed a consultative process, including World Bank input.

99.      The next phase of procurement reforms will put emphasis on implementation of the
amended Procurement Law, capacity building and M&E, to continuously monitor and improve
the system. First, the procurement regulations, manuals and bidding documents will need to be
updated to make them consistent with the revised law. Reforms in this area will also focus on
strengthening internal controls and the set up of an oversight function and to ensure enforcement of its
recommendations. RPPA in cooperation with other oversight agencies (in particular internal audit)
will establish mechanisms to monitor the publication of key information related to procurement by
procuring entities to ensure the needed transparency and strengthen private sector and public
confidence in the workings of procurement and their ability to be active participants in the oversight
of public procurement. Second, the Government aims to mainstream procurement training in the
higher education agenda and will create a more diversified capacity building program. To this end, it
will put in place a twining arrangement with an international reputable institution will be set in place
and the Government will continue to work towards the professionalization of the procurement
function. Finally, a priority is to build mechanism for information collection, validation and
performance monitoring, including studying options for a Management Information System for
procurement. 18 Another reform focus of the Government is to ensure an improved enabling
environment for private sector participation in public procurement transaction.

 (iii) Strengthen and Deepen Implementation of Decentralization Reforms

100.    The Government remains strongly committed to the continuous refinement of
decentralization reforms which were initiated in May 2000 to promote good governance, social
harmony, and improve service delivery. The evaluation of the first phase of the reform (2000-2005)
informed the second phase (2006­2010). The Government also launched an evaluation of the second
phase at the beginning 2010 and a draft report is being discussed amongst development partners. The
inception report, among others, highlighted need for enhancing specific capacity building to districts
and sectors and addressing demand side factors to continue positive developments in service delivery
and decentralized governance and management. The Government has taken steps to build local
capacity. In 2009, a new local administrative structure was developed where staff numbers will be
increased, especially at the sector and cell levels, to reinforce local capacities.

101.     A fiscal decentralization policy was adopted in 2005 (revised in 2006), and has since been
under implementation. Implementation of this policy has seen a number of achievements, including
enhanced budget execution reporting from districts, which has now become a norm, and capacity
building on public financial management to boost legitimate budget execution and related reporting.
Given the limited tax base at the local level, intergovernmental transfers will remain the main source
of funding of local government programs for the foreseeable future. One of the challenges which
remains is that most of the transfers are earmarked funding, which limits district ownership and
flexibility to respond to the in-year budget needs variations. This challenge will be addressed in the
third phase of the decentralization reform by increasing bloc transfers and creating innovations that
will allow flexibility for districts and sectors to review budget execution and take some decisions on
reallocations. A draft fiscal decentralization strategy to facilitate implementation of the policy and
strengthen linkages with other elements of public financial management was developed.

102.  The prior action for the PRSF-7 was the adoption by Cabinet and operationalization of a
comprehensive 5-year capacity building strategy for local Government, in an effort to support the

18
   This is a priority since with the decentralization the collection of information will be more challenging and
implementation and performance monitoring are key to further improving the systems.

                                                      33
strengthening of local capacity. Adequate analytical and sector work to develop the comprehensive 5-
year strategy has been completed. 19 The National Decentralization Implementation Secretariat
included this action as a priority in its current action plan and led the process of developing the
strategy. It was finalized in December 2010, and after transmittal to Cabinet by the Ministry of Local
Government, it was approved by Cabinet on January 19, 2011. Implementation of the strategy
commenced and the strategy itself refers specifically to activities that already started in 2010 in regard
to capacity building of local Government.

103.     Future priority reforms in this area are likely to focus on the third phase of
decentralization. 20 These include support to activities that will facilitate: (i) fully empowering
districts and reduce existing structural overlaps, (ii) effectively coordinating local government
capacity building and devising means to make it more impactful, (iii) matching bloc fiscal transfers to
district and sector needs, (iv) creating innovations to promote flexibility for districts and sectors to
manage earmarked funding, and (v) enhancing coordinated decentralization by sector ministries
through the identification of their sector specific needs and addressing them to harness required buy-
in to the policy.

(iv) Adopt Civil Service Reforms to Build Skills and Incentives for Retention

104.     The downsizing of the civil service that has occurred over the past few years has
exacerbated capacity challenges for public institutions, which are only gradually recovering from
the drastic capacity reduction that was an outcome of the genocide. The internal conflict left
Government institutions severely undermined or destroyed and struggling with large skills deficits,
understaffing and high turnover. Capacity building is progressing only slowly and the speed of
implementation of reforms and service delivery is affected by capacity issues in virtually all sectors.
There has been significant reform in the public sector, for example in decentralization and the
restructuring of the civil service. While the sense of urgency and strong commitment to improved
service delivery has led to many successes in the past fifteen years, there remains a challenge to
develop a coherent civil service reform agenda and a shared medium term vision in this area. These
challenges include: (i) underdeveloped core systems related to management information, monitoring
and performance management systems--which are currently being developed by MIFOTRA; (ii)
significant understaffing of central ministries in key policy areas, (iii) high rates of staff turnover and
retention difficulties; and (iv) a relatively flat career path which limits promotion opportunities and
staff motivation.

105.     The Government recognizes that to recruit skilled and dedicated people into public
service, and retain their services over time, it is critical to develop a comprehensive and
affordable Pay and Retention Policy. Following a restructuring exercise, new `cadre organiques'
with agreed numbers of staff and required job profiles for the central and local government
institutions were approved by the Cabinet in June 2009. The Government had prepared in April 2010
TORs and a contract for a consultant to design and develop a new national Pay and Retention Policy,
recognizing the challenges to improve the harmonization of pay across the public service and address
the widespread retention problems. The inception report was approved by the key stakeholders at a
meeting chaired by the Minister of Public Service and Labor on April 26, 2010. The inception report
set out a work plan and timetable for completion of the policy by August 2010. However, the
consultant contract had to be cancelled by the Government and the Ministry of Public Service and
Labor has since re-advertized the work through a competitive international tender and it is expected
that the policy will be completed by March 2011.




19
   Five-year district capacity building needs assessments and plans were completed in 2008/9, an assessment of local
government capacity challenges was done in 2010 and the evaluation of the second phase of decentralization policy
implementation reviewed local government capacity among key areas.

106.     The prior action for the PRSF-7 was the Cabinet approval of the General Statutes for
the Public Service. This prior action is crucial, given the importance of taking forward specific
activities envisaged within the Strategic Framework for Public Service Reform over the time period of
2010-2015. It is a key milestone towards the finalization of the more comprehensive Pay and
Retention Policy (Para 104), which remains the goal of the Authorities. In the interest of increasing
retention, the Statutes provide the terms of public servant pay depending on performance on the job
are (which are spelled out in the procedures of the Prime Minister's Order of September 8, 2010). The
draft law approved by the Cabinet includes performance-related pay and proposes to introduce a
bonus system for public servants linked to their annual performance reports.

107.     The next phase of Government's reforms in regard to civil service reform are: (i) the
finalization of the Pay and Retention Policy; (ii) the roll out of IPPS to central government ministries,
JSR agencies and districts following the prioritization sequence; and (iii) operationalize the Strategic
Framework for Public Service Reform.

                      VI. TRANSITION TO A SUCESSOR PROGRAM

108.    The proposed PRSF-7 is the last in a series of four and is designed to make a transition
to a successor program. The focus of the Government's program is broadly continuing in the areas
covered by the PRSF-5 to 7. However, a higher level of selectivity in regard to sectors for which prior
actions will be proposed is planned. Reform areas supported with prior action will focus in the future
PRSF series on sectors for which the World Bank was designated as a lead donor according to the
Governments new DoL (Para 42), namely the agriculture, energy, and transport (including ICT)
sectors as well as some cross-cutting areas (e.g. skills development). Since the World Bank, together
with the IMF, is the main Government counterpart on issues of macroeconomic and fiscal
management, economic development, and PFM and procurement, these are also likely areas to be
continued to be supported by a successor series. This will also enable the World Bank team to
increasingly make use of synergies within the team by focusing policy support on sectors with Bank
Investment Lending projects or Technical Assistance.

109.    The new series will support, and be guided by, the EDPRS and the 2011 mid-term
review of the EDPRS, and the CPAF. The implementation of the EDPRS for the years 2008 to 2012
is ongoing. A mid-term progress report is forthcoming in early 2011, which is unlikely to indicate
major policy shifts. The PRSF is based on the CPAF, which contains a sub-set of EDPRS indicators,
thus no major program area changes are expected based on Government's policy changes. The
successor program would support mainly the first CAS strategic theme: promoting economic growth,
with a focus on promoting sustainable growth and private sector development, increasing capacity and
improving economic and infrastructure service delivery, and increasing the availability of skilled
labor. Correspondingly, the PRSF series will transition to a new program which is expected to
continue supporting most sectors which were covered in the PRSF 5 to 7.

110.    The new series will continue the process of re-aligning the timing of the World Bank
PRSF with the new fiscal year in Rwanda, and the related CPAF cycle. The disbursement goal
for the successor PRSF series will be gradually re-aligned with the World Bank's commitments, as
made in the Budget Support MoU (Box 8), to disburse in the first quarter of Government's fiscal year.
Disbursement will be based on policy actions assessed by the CPAF review in the year prior to the
disbursement year. The first operation of the new series is planned to be presented to the World Bank
Board in late 2011 to enable disbursement in quarter two of the Rwandan fiscal year (as compared to
the current PRSF-7, which will disburse in quarter three). Thus the first series of the new operation
will cover only a very short period for potential reform implementation. This is likely to require
inclusion in the list of prior actions for the next PRSF policy reforms that are outside of the current
CPAF--for this one operation only. In an effort to revert to original practice, the prior actions of the
PRSF will focus on reform progress assessed at the fall backward-looking CPAF review of October
2010 for the fiscal year that finished in July 2010. Subsequent operations are planned to be disbursed

                                                   35
in quarter one of the Government's fiscal year, in order to ensure better predictability of resources for
the Authorities and appropriate execution time for its budget cycle.

111.    Indicative areas for triggers for the first operation of the new PRSF series have been
jointly discussed with the Government in order to provide predictability to the Government and to
ensure continuity in the dialogue on reforms. The LDP describes the Government's objectives in these
reform areas. Potential triggers will be jointly reviewed with the Government when the successor
program is identified and prepared in order to incorporate findings from on-going analytical work, and
also the evaluation of the series of PRSF-4 to7, while ensuring ownership, prioritizing reform areas,
and remaining flexible to changes in country circumstances.

                          VII.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                 POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

112.    The poverty and social implications of the reforms supported by the Financing were
reviewed (Annex 6). Most of these reforms are not expected to generate concerns regarding social or
livelihood impacts. The focus of the PRSF series was not only on central state level, but also
decentralized levels, which could support the creation of equal benefits for the population in more
remote areas of Rwanda. Overall the operation is likely to contribute to positive poverty and social
impacts as described below.

113.  In the case of the PRSF-7, most of the policies and reforms supported under this
program are unlikely to have major distributional impacts. These reforms include:

  · Revision of the ESSP to include greater focus on and cost of PBE and its linkages to the labor
    market as well as STI

  · Adoption by Cabinet and operationalization of a comprehensive 5-year capacity building strategy
    for local Government

  · Cabinet approval of a bill to amend the Procurement Law to increase efficiency and transparency
    of public procurement

  · Completion of the piloting of the IFMIS in central government and its integration with the IPPS

  · Adoption by Cabinet of a comprehensive framework of support to SMEs (including consolidation
    of financing mechanisms)

  · Development, costing and initiation of an action plan for capacity building of private sector agro-
    dealers in agricultural input procurement and distribution, particularly at decentralized levels

  · Gazetting of the Regulation Governing Payment Service Providers

  · Cabinet approval of the General Statutes for the Public Service

Each of the above reforms will have an overall positive impact on the economy, generating greater
efficiency in general Government operations as well as in key sectors. A theme running throughout
PRSF 4-7 has been improving technical and vocational training by improving quality, and increasing
opportunities for those within the PBE system. In addition to educational reforms, other reforms noted
above will focus, inter alia, on improved functioning of governmental processes at both the central
and local levels (procurement, financial management etc.), support for SME's and greater private
sector involvement in providing agricultural inputs to farmers. Finally, it is expected that the


                                                   36
General Statutes for the Public Service adopted for the Government civil service will have an
impact on improved quality in the delivery of social services.

114.    Several reforms under PRSF-7 will likely have distributional impacts: These reforms
continue programs that have been started earlier and are designed to have pro-poor impacts. They
include the following:

     · Completion of a tariff study (including revised tariff structure) and its validation by RURA and
       MININFRA

     · Removal of taxes (Import Duty and Value Added Tax) on LPG to promote its use and reduce
       dependence on charcoal

     · Design of a tariff framework for urban water services that promotes efficiency, reliability, equity
       and sustainability of water resources

115.      The team provided an assessment of the distributional impacts of the above reforms in
Annex 6, and these are expected to have many pro-poor benefits. The electricity tariff study will
help inform a revision of the current electricity tariff structure with the goal of balancing the cost of
service and socio-economic considerations to protect the poor and support economic growth. A socio-
economic impact analysis of the planned tariff framework in regard to access will be incorporated into
the IDA Rwanda Electricity Access Scale-up and SWAp Development Project. The removal of taxes
on LPG will enable household to substitute cleaner, more efficient fuel for charcoal, not only resulting
in health and environmental benefits, but enabling greater efficiency and ultimately lower energy
costs. A new tariff framework for urban water services will promote improved efficiency, greater
reliability, and ultimately a more equitable and sustainable use of water. The new tariff structure is
critical to ensure the financial viability of new water utility, Rwanda Water and Sanitation
Corporation.

116.    In general, the assessment of the poverty and social impact of the measures proposed by
the EDPRS, and supported by the PRSF is carried out in the context of Rwanda's EDPRS
monitoring system. It involves an analysis of the household living conditions and demographic
health surveys and, among other things, poverty trends and dynamics every five years. The surveys,
which cover the entire country, provide a rich source of information on household socio-economic
characteristics, including consumption expenditures, employment, and access to social services, etc.
The surveys will be complemented by annual integrated poverty assessments to enable mid-course
adjustments towards reaching identified goals and targets set over a five year period.

                                        ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

117.     Following Bank Policy requirements, specific policies supported by the PRSF-7 are not
likely to cause significant effects on Rwanda's environment, forests and other natural resources
if adequately managed. 21 On the contrary, any likely adverse effects are expected to be minor and
manageable through the existing Bank framework in place for the PRSF-7 areas of support. In the
current PRSF series, such environmental effects may arise through measures to support water
resources management and supply (including irrigation, watershed management and terracing),
infrastructure development (including hydropower and rural road development and maintenance), and
agricultural development, particularly with fertilizer distribution. While an extensive Environmental

21
   Under Operational Policy 8.60, on Development Policy Lending, the Bank is required to determine whether specific
country policies supported under the operation are likely to cause significant effects on the country's environment, and, in
the event of such likely effects, assess country systems for reducing any such adverse effects and enhancing such positive
effects. In the event of significant gaps in the analysis, or shortcomings in the country systems, the Bank is required to
identify how such gaps or shortcomings would be addressed before or during program implementation, as appropriate.


                                                            37
Assessment and Social Analysis undertaken during PRSG-1 remains relevant in this regard, there is a
need to strengthen monitoring and additional analysis for subsequent PRSF. The current series
(PRSF-4 to 7) has relied on two areas to address potential environmental concerns: (i) continued
strengthening of the overall framework for environmental management in Rwanda; and (ii)
environmental management assessments undertaken in the context of other Bank projects.

118.     There continue to be improvements in the framework for environmental management in
Rwanda, resulting in noticeable improvements enhancements of the institutional framework
during the last five years. However, the lack of adequate staffing with relevant skills both at the
central and district level is a noticeable hindrance to effective policy implementation and
coordination. The capacity constraint seems particularly severe at the district level where most of the
responsibilities for sectoral policy implementation are located, and where staff turnover is high. The
PRSF series, through policy discussions and the budget support review, is supporting the
Government's efforts to strengthen capacity in the key agencies charged with environmental
management. This is complementing a program of small grants for environmental capacity building
provided by United Nations Environment Program that is being used to build in a framework for
environmental assessments in key ministries. Moreover, the Global Environment Facility projects are
also supporting institutional capacity development on environmental management in Rwanda,
particularly on ecosystem and watershed management in both central and district levels.

119.     Policy discussions under the PRSF series have focused on reforms to strengthen the
institutions for environmental management. However, environment and land use management
issues are broad and involve many institutions including those relating to agriculture, lands, water,
infrastructure, investment agencies, and other areas of environment in addition to the Rwanda
Environmental Management Authority (REMA). While the country pursues sustainable development
through agriculture and infrastructure development, there is also the need for increased attention on
the public goods aspects, particularly on conservation issues and to strengthen the coordination across
intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral activities to address environmental concerns. The Government is
currently making efforts to mainstream environmental considerations in key production sectors,
through a SWAp, as these sectors have an important bearing on optimal utilization and sustainable
management of natural resources. There is a need for additional efforts to institutionally mainstream
environmental management capacity beyond project-by-project approaches.

120.     The impact of climate risks ­both historical climate variability and climate change­ to
livelihoods and the production sectors, particularly on agriculture production and water
management, has also been recognized and considered as part of the mainstreaming efforts. There is
a need for stronger coordination across various sectors and agencies on developing and implementing
a comprehensive approach to climate risk management, incorporating adaptation to historical climate
variability and projected climate change and effectively using new climate-related financing.

121.    The capacity issue is impacted by the restructuring that has moved the Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) function from REMA to the Environment Compliance Unit in the
RDB. This reform was undertaken to align EIA processes and procedures with the newly instituted
RDB, which oversees overall coordination of business reforms and regulations. For example, receipt
of an EIA clearance is now one of the requirements for setting up a business. However, environmental
standards enforcement and audit functions remain within REMA. The RDB has created the one-stop
center for business registration which also integrates the EIA clearance process and helps to minimize
clearance procedures for businesses. Given this new and unusual set up, whereby the RDB is charged
with issuing EIA permits, the Bank has requested an institutional assessment to assess the existence or
degree of conflict of interest. Moreover, as EIA is still new in Rwanda, there is a shortage of staff
competent in EIAs and its enforcement and monitoring, and further capacity development is required.

122.     Several aspects of the PRSF-7 reform are likely to generate positive environmental
benefits. The removal of taxes on LPG will permit a gradual substitution of LPG for charcoal,
resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gasses. However, its effects are very small, since most

                                                  38
households use firewood and neither charcoal or LPG. Since LPG is expensive compared to other
sources, only better-off households are able to use it (Annex 7). With adequate management, new
water tariffs are expected to result in a more efficient water service and conservation. Finally, through
developing the capacity of private sector agro-dealers in input procurement and distribution at
decentralized levels, the reforms should lead to better use of fertilizer which will be distributed more
efficiently than under the previous governmental system, augmenting the current low level of
fertilizer use. Although this is likely to result eventually in an increased uptake of fertilizer, currently,
the quantity of fertilizer that is likely to get distributed through improved private sector involvement
would be limited. With proper management (in terms of types of fertilizers distributed, encouraging
complementary manure use and field erosion management, appropriate integrated nutrient
management and integrated pest management programs, soil testing to improve targeted and
appropriate use, capacity building and awareness raising of farmers and agro-dealers, and monitoring
programs), significant adverse environmental impacts could be avoided, and it should have substantial
positive impacts on poverty and smallholder and resource productivity. 22 REMA's State of the
Environment and Outlook Report 2009 23 for Rwanda also indicates the need to control the use of
agrochemicals near marshes and on slopes.

123.   The proposed operation is expected to have no significant adverse effects on the
environment, while country systems are functioning and appropriate arrangements have been made
through Bank work to address any such minor effects that might arise. The operation therefore
complies fully with the requirements of OP 8.60.

                      IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

Implementation and Results

124.    The second PRSF series comprised four annual, single-tranche operations within a
programmatic framework and as the series has progressed, so the reform agenda evolved. With
the PRSG-5 operation the series was being aligned with the CPAF, which was finalized in December
2008. Since then, the PRSF series supported under its themes A, B, C and D the EDPRS Flagship
Area 1: Growth for Jobs and Export. Theme A supported policy actions for enhancing skills of the
population, theme B to inprove economic infrastructure, theme C to raise agricultural productivity and
theme D to deepen and broaden the financial sector. Under the PRSF series theme E, enhanced
Government capacity, accountability and transparency, policy actions supported the EDPRS Flagship
Area 3: Governance.

125.     The evolution in the reform program supported by the PRSF 5-7 has been captured in
the associated Policy Matrix and Results Framework (Annex 2). Of the original 14 original
triggers 2 were dropped, because no baseline or target / actual data became available. For two of the
tracked outcome indicators under PRSF-7 there was no data available for 2009/10. Among the
remaining 10 indicators, 9 were fulfilled; one missed its target for 2009/10 (shaded grey in Table 6).
The following paragraphs provide an overview of progress accomplished in each of the themes
defined for the program.

Results Achieved in Supported EDPRS Flagship Area 1: Growth for Jobs and Export

126.    Results achieved in the supported EDPRS and CPAF area: Invest in Human Capital to
Enhance Skills for Growth. The PRSF-4, 5 and 7 supported reforms designed to lay the foundation
for a comprehensive program to enhance the skills of the labor force. Among the results achieved are
the establishment of the National Council for Higher Education and the development of a TVET
system that reflects the needs of the labor market. The PRSG-5 supported the publication of the TVET
Policy in 2008. Based on the policy, the development and costing of the TVET strategic plan is being
developed. The basis for the development of the integrated TVET strategic plan is: (i) the concept
paper for an integrated TVET program (issued in late 2008); (ii) the strategic plan for technical
colleges; and (iii) the PBE costed strategy, which is to include post-basic TVET. A strategic
framework has been elaborated for PBE with an emphasis on improving quality in secondary and
higher levels of education, including TVET. The PRSF-7 supported the critical step of costing of this
strategy or action plan for PBE through the revision of the ESSP. The ESSP also has a stronger focus
on labor market as well as STI. Although transition from basic education to upper secondary
education increased since 2008 above target (Annex 2) outcomes capturing actual improvements in
PBE and skills will only materialize under a longer timeframe and will be better captured under the
framework of the next series.



24
  According to the Terms of Reference for the JSR outcome indicators fulfilled at 90 percent of target are regarded
as fulfilled. The Bank, as a partner in the CPAF, follows this assessment and regards them as fulfilled.

                                                                40
127.     Results achieved in the supported EDPRS and CPAF area: Improve Economic
Infrastructure. The Government has either met or exceeded its own targets over the past years in the
energy sector (Annex 2). In the case of electricity, the number of on/off grid electricity connections
increased from 91,332 in 2006 to 110,000 connections in 2008 and in 2009/10 an additional 49,516
customers have been connected, in both years exceeding the targets. The number of MW of electricity
achieved was 84MW in 2009/10 against a projected target of 80MW. The PRSG-4 and 5 supported
Government actions to establish a transparent regulatory framework to engage the private sector, to
reduce service cost and to introduce a sustainable framework for coordination and financing of
investments in energy. The Law on Electricity and Gas, governing concessions on electricity
generation from the Lake Kivu project, which aims to improve overall availability/supply of energy,
and supports implementation of a transparent regulatory framework for engaging the private sector,
has been approved by Parliament. In addition, a MoU for the Energy sector SWAp was signed and a
financing and coordination mechanism adopted to support the National Electricity Rollout Program.
As prior action for PRSG-6 the Project Management Directorate for implementation of the National
Electricity Rollout program was established and made operational in the Rwanda Electricity
Corporation, consolidating within the corporation all existing project-specific Project Coordination
Units. The PRSF-7 supported the electricity tariff and cost service study, which recommends a new
structure and tariff for various customer groups balancing the cost of service and socio-economic
considerations to protect the poor and support economic growth.

128.      In the road sector, the PRSG-4 and PRSG-5 supported the establishment of a
framework for regular maintenance and rehabilitation of the road network through the
adoption of the Road Maintenance Strategy. The strategy includes a framework for maintenance
and decentralization of district/rural roads. Financing to ensure sustainability in maintenance is a
critical factor for the upkeep of the road network. As a result, Government intended to increase the
fuel levy collected through the Road Fund. As a prior action the PRSG-6 supported the Government
in progressively increasing the Fuel Levy up to 10 cents. In 2009, over the period June to August, the
levy was increased to its current level of 11 cents per liter. The related indicator is the percent of
Classified District Road Network in Good Condition, which slightly missed its target of 28 percent,
increasing to 23 percent in 2009/10.

129.      Results achieved in the supported EDPRS and CPAF area: Improved Access to Safe
Drinking Water and Improved Sanitation Status. The PRSG-4 and 5 have supported reforms to
improve planning and financing of maintenance in the water sector. Under PRSG-4, water supply and
water resources management were mainstreamed in the budget starting with the 2008 budget. In line
with the more coordinated approach for integrated water resources management, there has been a
consolidation of responsibility for all aspects of water and sanitation management under one ministry.
Under PRSG-5, the area of support has been toward development of the water information system and
the management information system. A Water Supply and Sanitation Policy, supported by PRSG-6,
presents the sector's approach on how to achieve the Vision 2020, MDGs and EDPRS objectives, and
breaks them down into concrete principles, objectives and actions. The related indicator of proportion
of households with access to clean drinking water increased steadily each year, exceeding the target in
2009/10 (Annex 2). A critical step was the elaboration and adoption of a tariff structure to ensure
effective operation, efficient service delivery and financial viability of the newly restructured water
utility, supported by PRSF-7. It should help reduce the need for annual budgetary support from the
Treasury. The tariff setting mechanism also takes into consideration affordability and social
constraints (poverty focus) or equity as major policy priorities.

130.     Results achieved in the supported EDPRS and CPAF area: Raise Agriculture
Productivity. The PRSF supported the Government's main areas of focus in agriculture, to strengthen
soil and water conservation and irrigation, and reforms to develop a private sector led fertilizer
distribution system. Under the LWH Program, feasibility studies and detailed designs, including
assessment of pilots and mapping, have been completed for eight sites (exceeding the target of four)
out of 34 sites for watershed management. The related indicator, proportion of arable land sustainably
managed against soil erosion increased from 45 percent in 2008 to 81 percent in 2009/10 (Annex 2).

                                                  41
The PRSF-6 and 7 supported Government's actions to strengthen the private fertilizer distribution
system. Along with efforts to improve private sector engagement in the distribution of improved
inputs, there was also a critical need to support farmers in their effective use of these inputs. To
complement the actions to improve the extension system, there was a need to elaborate a strategic
action plan for capacity support to farmers. Therefore, the PRSF-7 supported the development,
costing and initiation of an action plan for capacity building of private sector agro-dealers in input
procurement and distribution, particularly at decentralized levels. The related indicator, mineral
fertilizer use (in mega tons) performed well in recent years, and was in 2009/10 achieved with 90.6
percent of its target fulfilled (27,900 compared to the targeted 30,800) (Footnote 24).

131.     Results achieved in the supported EDPRS and CPAF area: Deepen and Broaden the
Financial Sector. The PRSF supported Government's efforts to improve access to financial services,
with a focus on micro-finance and rural finance. Under PRSG-4, a Policy on Microfinance and a
related law, were developed in line with international good practice. The PRSG-5 supported the
signing of an MoU was between BNR and MINAGRI to fund investments in the rural sector, through
the second Rural Investment Facility. PRSF-7 supported the adoption of a comprehensive framework
of support to SMEs. The Bank is also supporting the modernization of the payment systems, a critical
action to support increased banking and monetization of the economy. The PRSG-6 and PRSF-7
supported the adoption by Parliament of a Law Governing Payment Systems in the Financial Services
Sector, and development by the central bank of Regulations Governing Payment Service Providers in
the Financial Services Sector. The related indicator, credit to the private sector (as % of GDP) was
achieved at 95.6 percent in 2009/10 at 11.8 percent (target was 12.2 percent), which was partly in
effect of the global economic crisis (Footnote 24).

Results Achieved in Supported EDPRS Flagship Area 3: Governance

132.    Results achieved in the supported EDPRS and CPAF area: Strengthen the Public
Financial Management System. The PRSF series has focused support in the PFM area on
Government's actions to improve transparency through the strengthening of the budget monitoring
and reporting system. Under PRSG-5, the Public Books module of SmartGov was finalized.
Development of the IPPS (Payroll module) was seen as an extremely important step in strengthening
the Government's ability to manage resources within the public sector. The prior action for PRSG-6
supported the adoption of the Payroll Module (subsystem) of the IPPS installed in central Government
ministries. It allowed producing a truly consolidated financial statement with fully capturing wages
and salaries in the system. Ensuring that wages and salaries are captured will improve transparency
and eliminate potential errors that could arise through manual entry or manipulation of data. PRSF-7
supported the piloting of the IFMIS in central government and integrates it with the IPPS One of the
related CPAF indicator (but not a PRSF indicator), PEFA PI-25 on the timeliness and quality of
financial statements (Annex 4) did not improved, but decreased, in the recent 2010 PEFA (as
compared to the 2007 PEFA.

133.     The PRSF supported the Government in its effort to develop its capacity and systems of
procurement. For example, the prior action for PRSG-6 was that at least eighty percent of all
procurement agencies submit a procurement plan that is consistent with their allocated budget
proposal, to MINECOFIN, and RPPA publishes at least 60 percent of such plans on its website. In
order to reinforce progress made to improve procurement practices and transparency, PRSF-7
supported the Cabinet approval of the amendments the Procurement Law with the goal to increase
efficiency and transparency of public procurement. Overall, Rwanda was successful in establishing an
institutional and legal framework for oversight of procurement that is in line with internationally
accepted standards. The related CPAF indicator, the proportion of the value of procurement tendered
competitively or justified reached 100 percent in 2009/10, well above the 87 percent target.

134.    Results achieved in the supported EDPRS and CPAF area: Strengthen the
implementation of budget and fiscal decentralization reforms. PRSG-4 supported the adoption of
budget software at district levels and the production of the first budget execution report by districts

                                                  42
(for the period January to June 2007). Government has also adopted various community based
monitoring and accountability arrangements to promote increased accountability. For example, the
Joint Action Forum (which brings together stakeholders involved in service delivery at the district
level, including NGOs and civil society) to improve coordination of district interventions, produces a
District Performance Review which is published on the Government's website. The production of
citizen report cards is another means of engaging the local citizens in improving service delivery.
PRSG-6 supported the assessment of service delivery at local level with citizen report cards and
community score cards. The results of the nationally representative citizen report / community score
cards ranked administration highest and infrastructure and agriculture services the lowest in terms of
satisfaction. Government also has take steps to build local capacity. In 2009, a new local
administrative structure was developed with staff numbers planned to increase especially at the sector
and cell levels to reinforce local capacities. There has also been a variety of capacity building training
events for Community Development Committees and Tax Advisory Councils. PRSF-7 supported the
adoption and operationalization of a comprehensive 5-year capacity building strategy for local
Government. The related indicator, the proportion of districts achieving a minimum of 80 percent of
their service delivery and development targets, progressed positively and exceeded its target of 65
(achieving 67 percent) in 2009/10.

135.     Results achieved in the supported EDPRS and CPAF area: Adopt Civil Service Reforms
to Build Skills and Incentives for Retention. The PRSF series supported skills development and staff
retention in the civil service, and strengthened coordination of functions and structures,
complementing the technical assistance being provided under the Bank's Public Sector Capacity
Building Project. The prior action for PRSG-6 was Cabinet approval of the Organic Framework
reflecting agreement between the Ministry of Public Service and Labor and all central government
ministries on staffing levels and ministerial structures for optimal performance within fiscal limits.
The Government also recognizes stronger systems of performance management, career progression
and pay harmonization need to be developed in order to recruit and retain skilled and dedicated people
in the public service. It is seen as critical to develop a comprehensive and affordable Pay and
Retention Policy. Therefore, PRSF-7 supported the Cabinet approval of the General Statutes for the
Public Service, a milestone towards the finalization of the more comprehensive Pay and Retention
Policy (Para 104). The draft law approved by the Cabinet includes performance-related pay rules and
proposes to introduce a bonus system for public servants linked to their annual performance reports,
in the interest of increasing retention.

Monitoring and Evaluation

136.     Monitoring and evaluation arrangements rely on Government arrangements with the
aim of strengthening Government capacity and institutions. The Government has developed in
close collaboration with partners, including the Bank, a results and performance framework integrated
into the planning and budgeting processes for monitoring the EDPRS. The integrated results
framework/monitoring system consists of three components: (i) a National Results and Policy Matrix,
(ii) the CPAF, and the DPAF. It has also designed appropriate institutional settings to monitor its
implementation, in which responsibility for the overall monitoring of the EDPRS rests with
MINECOFIN's Strategic Planning Unit. In addition, the Budget Monitoring and Reporting Unit
reports on spending of the budget and related outputs. This unit also ensures that the sector spending
plans are incorporated into the macro-MTEF, and budget. The Bank closely worked with these two
units to monitor spending and outputs achieved under the PRSF series.

137.    To improve monitoring systems, the Bank has supported the Government's efforts to
build quality and institutional capacity. Alongside the PRSF, the Bank is implementing grants from
the Trust Fund on Statistical Capacity Building, the Belgian Poverty Reduction Partnership Trust
Fund aimed at enhancing statistical capacity, and the support to the National Institute of Statistics
through the Statistics for Results Facility. Finally, the Bank's ongoing investment projects each have
an M&E component that supports both the project and the relevant sectoral ministry.


                                                   43
138.    The monitoring and evaluation of the PRSF series draws from the CPAF which was
finalized in December 2008. The Bank monitors selected key outcome indicators and the overall
CPAF in close collaboration with Government and other budget support donors. Table 6 summarizes
the expected outcomes and related indicators and targets and provides the actual achievements for
2009/10, the fiscal year closing immediately before the PRSF-7. Monitoring of these indicators relies
on the Government system, and the actuals for 2009/10 displayed in the table below, stem from the
SWG reports of the October 2010 JSRs. Definition of each indicator along with measurement and
data source has been outlined by the National Institute of Statistics. Of the 12 key outcome indicators
of the PRSF series for 2009/10, seven were fulfilled. Two had no data measurement available and one
was slightly underachieved. The indicator (1) on credit to the private sector was impacted by the
global economic downturn.

                                     FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

139.    The PFM system is reasonably adequate to support the PRSF. In addition, a key focus of
this operation is related to continued support to strengthening the Government's public financial and
expenditure management and procurement systems. Areas of support under the PRSF have been
summarized in the previous section. Assessments of the fiduciary aspects are largely based on results
from the 2007 and 2010 PEFA (Annex 4). They indicate that PFM and procurement systems have
been improving steadily in line with Government's commitment to reform (as outlined in its Financial
Accountability Review and Action Plan) and the dialogue between the Government and donors.

140.     The Government is implementing a PFM Action Plan to ensure comprehensiveness and
consistency of reforms. This plan has been endorsed by key donors engaged in supporting the
Government's reform agenda. Fiduciary assessments are also based on results from recently
completed PERs in the education, health, agriculture, and water sectors, the 2004 HIPC Assessment
and Country Procurement Assessment Report, as well as the 2005 Country Financial Accountability
Assessment. In addition, the most recent safeguards assessment of the BNR was completed by the
IMF in the context of the PRGF arrangement approved on June 12, 2006. The updated assessment
was completed on January 26, 2007 and proposed recommendations to address continuing
vulnerabilities in the external audit and financial reporting areas. The implementation of these
measures is being monitored under the Fund program, but there was no separate follow-up since 2007.
Finally, the Bank is undertaking a policy driven technical assistance PER to provide capacity building
support to Government in expenditure analysis and monitoring.

141.     A key focus of the PRSF-7 is providing continuing support for the implementation of the
Government's PFM Reform Strategy (2008-2012), which was approved by Cabinet in December
2008. The PFM Reform Strategy has a comprehensive Government approach that deals with the
overarching strategic issues in a structured and sequenced manner. It is being implemented under four
pillars and twelve distinct complementary components. A PFM Basket Fund and a separate fund for
the Office of the Auditor General were created in 2010.

                              DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

142.     A single-tranche development policy financing consisting of a grant of SDR45.5 million
(US$70 million equivalent) and a credit of SDR22.3 million (US$34.4 equivalent) would be made
available upon effectiveness. The proposed financing will follow the Bank's disbursement
procedures for development policy operations. Financing proceeds will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases
or be subject to procurement requirements. Once the Bank's Board approves the Financing and it
becomes effective, provided IDA is satisfied with the program being carried out by the Recipient and
with the appropriateness of the Recipient's macroeconomic policy framework and at the request of the
Recipient, IDA will disburse the proceeds of the Financing into an account designated by the
Recipient that forms a part of the country's foreign exchange reserves at the BNR. The Recipient shall
ensure that upon the deposit of the Financing proceeds into said account, an equivalent amount is

                                                  44
credited in the Recipient's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to IDA. The Recipient
will report to IDA on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local
currency to the budget management system with an indication of the exchange rate applied. IDA
reserves the right to request an audit of said account. If the proceeds of the Financing are used for
ineligible purposes (i.e. to finance goods or services on the standard negative list), as defined in the
Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Recipient to promptly upon notice from IDA, refund an
amount equal to the amount of said payment to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request
shall be cancelled. The administration of this Financing will be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning.

143.     Within two business days, BNR will credit the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the
Financing proceeds to the consolidated account maintained on behalf of Government which
finances budgeted expenditures. The Director of Treasury will be notified accordingly. The BNR
will not impose any charges or commissions on Government for these transactions. The conversion
from US dollar to Rwanda Franc will be based on the prevailing exchange rate on the date that the
funds are credited to the consolidated account. Government, through the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning, will: (i) provide written confirmation within 30 days to the Bank that an amount
equivalent to the Financing proceeds from the Bank has been credited to the consolidated account,
with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (ii) provide evidence that the Rwanda Franc
equivalent of the Financing proceeds was recorded as financing for Government budget; and (iii)
ensure that the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the Financing proceeds are subject to controls to ensure
its use for eligible budgeted public expenditures only.

                                 RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

144.   There are four main risks potentially associated with the program are as follows: (i)
macroeconomic and fiscal risk; (ii) regional and country risk; (ii) program risk; and (iv) fiduciary risk.

145.     Macroeconomic and Fiscal Risk: This risk is rated moderate to low given the Government's
record in macroeconomic management. Overall Government's record on macroeconomic
management has been rated as satisfactory as evidenced also through the satisfactory completion of
the first reviews under the IMF PSI in December 2010. Risk in this regard could arise through
persistent volatility in world commodity prices for Rwanda's key export goods, tea and coffee,
compromising export earnings. Rwanda was not directly affected by the toxic assets that led to the
global financial crisis, but the impact of the crisis was transmitted to the economy through lower
exports, FDI and tourism receipts. The Government responded with the development of an Export
Strategy, which is being finalized, aiming at diversifying exports and better using its comparative
advantage in specific sectors. Related, is the risk of a reduction in grants as an effect of the fiscal
crisis following the global slowdown. In order to mitigate fiscal risk, Government is reducing
expenditures and revising the current 2010/11 budget at mid-term review. Government will continue
to protect priority spending from any potential reductions in overall spending and will redouble efforts
to expand the tax base and improve the efficiency of the tax system. Also, there remains the need for
Government to take on some non-concessional loans, on a selective basis, to enable the necessary
investments to generate growth. However, the uncertain path of global recovery will continue to pose
a risk to macroeconomic and fiscal stability. The World Bank and the IMF will continue to support
the Government in managing macroeconomic reform. In the context of the low-income country DSA
framework, the Bank and IMF will continue to monitor the evolution in Rwanda's debt indicators
which are currently substantially below set thresholds.

146.     Regional and Country Risk: Rwanda's internal security and political situation has
stabilized. In August 2010, the country peacefully re-elected the incumbent president for his second
and, and by the Constitution, last seven-year term. In order to mitigate the risk of repeating internal
ethnic unrest due to unequal access and distribution of resource, the Authorities focus large parts of
public expenditures on poverty reduction priorities, and address remaining disparities with explicit
interventions to assist the poorest groups identified through one of the three EDPRS flagships, the

                                                   45
VUP. Additionally, the participatory planning and poverty assessment in use ­i.e. the Ubudehe
program­ assesses how the poor are identified and offers recommendations for reducing poverty.
However, Rwanda remains vulnerable to a reduction in aid flows due to changes in international
perceptions about the state of political governance and human rights in Rwanda. Commentaries in the
international media around the August elections alleged suppression of various political opposition
groups and individuals. In 2010 and Amnesty International report alleged that Rwanda's genocide
laws are deliberately vague to allow criminalization of dissent 25 and a UN report alleged acts of
brutality by the Rwandan Patriotic Army in the DRC during 1993-2003. For several bilateral donors,
issues of democratic governance, political and media freedom and equal access to justice are key
determinants of the decision to continue provide funding, in particular general budget support which
amounted to about 36 percent of total expenditures in 2009/2010. The Government denies the UN
report allegations, pointing to the numbers of its forces deployed as UN peace-keeping forces across
Africa as an indicator of a disciplined force. Rwanda continues to work on the redrafting of its
genocide ideology laws. It remains committed to finalizing the update of the Rwanda JGA. While
these issues continue to be raised by bilateral donors, there have so far been no signs for reductions in
donor assistance, which could potentially jeopardize achievement of development outcomes including
the ones supported by the CAS. The Bank's support for strengthened governance will continue within
the parameters laid down in its 2007 Governance and Anticorruption Strategy and strengthening
capacity of civil society and private sector actors. Capacity remains one of the key country risks that
affect all sectors, public and private. Beside the Government's commitment to invest in skills
development needed for economic modernization, including stronger focus on PBE, it is currently
developing a new National Human Capital and Skills Development strategy to address major gaps.

147.    Program Risk: Predictability of donor funding, the ability to mobilize donor funding and
debt sustainability continue to be the main risks to the Government's reform program. The recent
global slowdown could pose a risk to the past increasing trend to budget support for the country.
Improvements in donor fund predictability will help the Government to plan and implement its budget
in a more sustainable manner. In the recent past, the Bank has worked to help the Government access
the Catalytic Fund for Africa and through the PRSG-6 operation, the Crisis Response Window funds
for mitigating the effects of the global financial crisis. Over the long-term, the Government will need
to continue to focus on mobilizing domestic revenue, which is critical if the Government is to remain
within prudent debt sustainability limits.

148.     Fiduciary Risk: The rapid decentralization undertaken by the Government has heightened
potential procurement and PFM risks (related to low capacity) since only limited accompanying
fiduciary measures were included in the reform. However, the Government has committed to
accelerating its efforts to address these risks. The Government is drafting a reference guide for
procurement, along with a technical assistance "hotline" for procurement officers. The Government is
also accelerating the implementation of the Rwanda Expertise Scheme that is training accountants and
internal auditors in the Rwanda public accounting system, and sponsoring the best among them for
professional accountancy qualification. Following an unsuccessful attempt of training public
accountants and internal auditors in 2006, which resulted in extremely low pass rates, Government
scaled down the number of trainees and retained only a pilot of 20 students who have now gone half-
way through the training program, with reasonable pass rates. More trainees were identified in 2010
with the aim of ensuring a critical mass of qualified accountants in the public sector by 2012. In June
2010, more than ninety trainees were sponsored and the pass-rate was better than the global average.
Furthermore, the PRSF series is supporting the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive 5-
year capacity building strategy for local government, which includes measures to strengthen public
financial management at the local level.

The Program

  1. The Government of Rwanda remains committed to achieving sustained
     economic growth and poverty reduction and consolidating macroeconomic
     stability. The strategies to achieve these goals are set out in the EDPRS for
     2008­2012 as well as in the Vision 2020 development plan. Rwanda is at mid-
     term implementing its medium term planning tool, the EDPRS, designed in
     line with its Vision 2020 and its international commitments, including the
     Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The EDPRS sets out the national
     strategy and action plan for poverty reduction, and forms the basis for the
     allocation of public resources to development activities. The GoR jointly with
     all its Development Partners implements, monitors and reviews the EDPRS's
     three flagship programs, namely (i) Sustainable Growth for Jobs and Exports,
     which includes agriculture, infrastructure, and private sector development; (ii)
     Vision 2020 Umurenge (a decentralized integrated rural development program
     designed to address extreme poverty); and (iii) Governance. A picture of
     progress of the Strategy is portrayed through the EDPRS's formal monitoring
     and assessment tool, the Joint Budget Support Reviews (JBSR).


  2. The latest JBSR was held early October 2010 and concluded that Rwanda is
     making good progress in terms of EDPRS implementation and against
     indicators of the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF). The
     CPAF is the basis for assessment of the Government's performance in the
     implementation of the EDPRS by the Development Partners providing budget
     support.


  3. Rwanda presents a unique case in development and in its progress towards
     achieving the MDGs. Rwanda has been recovering from the tragic and
     devastating genocide and civil war of 1994 and is on course to implement
     many of the MDGs. MDGs baseline indicators in Rwanda were dramatically
     reversed as a consequence of the 1994 genocide and fell far below 1990 levels.
     Therefore, Rwanda's baseline for working towards the MDGs was much
     lower, than in many other countries. In recent years, Rwanda has made good
     progress in efforts to achieve several if not all MDGs by 2015.


  4. Rwanda has achieved high growth and macroeconomic stability over the last
     decade despite the global financial and economic crisis, Rwanda's economic
     growth remains relatively strong, the growth has averaged about 8 percent per
     year. However, much effort is still needed to translate the growth into
     reducing extreme poverty and to meet the Vision 2020 targets.

                                        48
Economic Development and Macroeconomic Management

  5. Rwanda's economic performance has remained strong over recent years,
     despite the effects of the global financial and economic crisis and a domestic
     liquidity issue. The average real GDP growth was 8.8 percent during 2005-
     2009, exceeding the EDPRS target of 7 percent. In 2008, the economy
     registered its highest growth rate in last five years of 11.2 percent. After a
     somewhat slower growth in 2009 due to the impact of the global economic
     downturn, a slight recovery has taken place in 2010. Real GDP growth is
     projected at 6.5 percent in 2010. Growth will be driven by agriculture
     especially food crops which will continue to benefit from large investments in
     fertilizer, improved seeds and extension services under our Crops
     Intensification Program.


  6.    Export rebound in 2010 mainly on account of strong performance in the
       coffee and tea sectors, as their combined exports are expected to increase by
       about 40 percent compared to 2009. Non-traditional exports are also
       performing well and the results of the Informal Cross-Border Trade Survey
       (included for the first time in the export statistics), indicate a net surplus for
       informal net exports. Addressing the liquidity constraints that occurred in the
       latter part of 2008, the Central Bank (NBR) has maintained an accommodative
       monetary policy stance to boost liquidity and support the turnaround in
       growth. Specifically, NBR injected liquidity of approximately 1.5 percent of
       GDP, in order to sustain credit expansion and boost economic growth. The
       policy rate, which also serves as the key repo rate, has been cut cumulatively
       by 200 basis points since November 2009. However, commercial banks have
       maintained a cautious credit stance while enhancing their risk management
       practices and loan recovery processes. As a result, growth in credit to private
       sector has been slower than expected, as it is forecasted to increase by about
       10 percent by end 2010, well below the 20 percent growth initially projected.


  7. The Government of Rwanda remains committed to achieving sustained
     economic growth and poverty reduction and consolidating macroeconomic
     stability. The strategies to achieve these goals are set out in the Economic
     Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) for 2008­2012 as well
     as in the Vision 2020 development plan.


  8. In recognition of its track record of high growth and generally prudent macro-
     economic management, including achievement of low fiscal and current
     account deficits and maintenance of a comfortable level of international
     reserves, Rwanda was approved for a Policy Support Instrument (PSI) by the
     IMF in June 2010. The Government and the International Monetary Fund
     (IMF) are cooperating on a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) to

                                          49
       support prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that underlie
       strategies in the EDPRS and Vision 2020. The Executive Board of the
       International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed in mid December 2010 the first
       review under the three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Rwanda and
       commended satisfactory implementation of the program in 2009/10 against the
       backdrop of a global economic downturn.


  9.    The 2010 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
       assessment indicates significant increases in PFM scores in many other areas,
       reflecting in part progress from a low base since the 2007 PEFA assessment.


  10. The Government has taken strong steps to improve debt management practices
      by reviewing existing Medium Term Debt Strategy and Debt Policy with
      limits for loans, to assess costs and benefits of scaled-up non-concessional
      financing and analyze fiscal risks associated with PPPs.

Overview of Recent Developments

  11. The last JBSR reported that there was in general good progress in the five
      sectors under the economic cluster: (1) Private Sector Development (PSD), (2)
      Agriculture, (3) Energy, (4) Transport, and (5) Environment.


  12. The PSD sector progress discussion focused around the issue of measuring
      progress in promoting PSD, in particular improving the investment climate.
      Two separate indicator-related improvements were proposed, first, the need
      for stronger focus on investment climate perception indicators and second, the
      need to improve timely availability of data to measure current indicators.
      Another key issue is the level playing field for private sector activity. On the
      first point there was a discussion on perceptions of a lack of a level playing
      field and therefore the potential crowding out of foreign investments by public
      companies. In this respect, participants welcomed Government initiatives to
      adopt a new Competition and Consumer Protection Policy, which is currently
      in Parliament and encouraged more open discussion about these perceptions
      using the opportunity of the forthcoming Private Sector Federation report on
      investment in Rwanda as an early opportunity to do so. In regard to the lack
      of (timely) data for some PSD sector indicators; there was agreement to not
      change indicators or targets for the current fiscal year, but to have a discussion
      on this in the forward-looking review in May 2011. There was agreement on
      the need for improved coordination among Government agencies and among
      Development Partners, which could be addressed by a new PSD Strategy,
      which clearly defines roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders.

13. For the agriculture the stakeholders welcomed the strong yields achieved,
    following concerted reform efforts of the Government in this sector. Actions to
    follow-up on this success are lined up and have been agreed upon. Forward-
    looking there is agreement on improvement of the post-harvest supply-chain.
    Due to the remarkable increase in the agriculture productivity, a strong focus
    should be put on the improvement of post harvest and strategic storage in
    order to minimize losses and to continue to tackle malnutrition. The analysis
    of potential consequences of a Strategic Grain Reserve was identified as a key
    action. There was strong support from all stakeholders to support next steps to
    further the Agriculture SWAp. They also confirmed the World Bank as the
    Lead DP for this sector.


14. For the energy sector stakeholders welcomed progress on the electricity tariff
    study, which has been finalized. They also acknowledged the Government's
    efforts to address the biomass issue with the successful implementation of the
    LPG tax-reduction and the continued effort to promote alternatives to
    charcoal.


15. On transport, it was noted that following the successful interventions in the
    agriculture sector to improve yields there is a need to provide appropriate
    feeder roads which will connect farmers with markets. Currently the focus of
    policy actions and indicators in this sector is primarily on national / district
    paved road, rather than rural roads and the efforts are required to improve the
    rural roads conditions.


16. Rwanda was inspired by the 2010 results to even do better especially on
    indicators that were more challenging. The Doing Business spirit that is inbuilt
    within institutions enabled to establish a onestop centre for construction
    permits in order to promptly address the main challenge to our construction
    industry. But there is still more to do; over the next 12 months, the GoR will
    continue to support reform agenda so that business and trade contribute more
    to Rwanda's economic growth and social transformation.


17. The 9 th Government of Rwanda and Development Partners Meeting (DPM)
    held early November 2010 agreed to progressive actions and measures with
    the view to meet the principles agreed in Paris and Accra on aid effectiveness.
    The GoR welcomed the approval by the Bank to use the country's
    procurement systems and its cooperation in implementing the commitments
    jointly endorsed at the DPM including; improving in-year and medium-term
    predictability, increased use of country systems (such as channeling
    projects/programme funds through Treasury Single Account), and phasing out

      of PIUs while strengthening the Single Project Implementation Units in
      various Ministries.


Conclusion

  18. In conclusion, the Government of Rwanda expresses its gratitude to the Bank
      for its continued support to the development of Rwanda and reiterates its
      strong commitment to reduce poverty and foster sustainable development. The
      Government would greatly appreciate the approval of the Financing to assist in
      the implementation of the Program.

                                   Annex 4: Rwanda's 2007 and 2010 PEFA

This annex presents an executive summary of the PEFA 2010 prepared in the second half of 2010. It
contained a Central Government (CG) assessment and a Sub-National (SN) assessment. The CG
Assessment is a repeat assessment as a PEFA for CG has been undertaken in 2007. The fact that,
when undertaking a repeat assessment, the previous PEFA may have under-scored or over-scored
some of the ratings for indicators or individual dimensions, entails that a simple comparison of the
overall scores between two assessments at different times, not detailed by dimension, and with no
analysis of change, as in Table 1, can suggest deterioration, improvement or stagnation of indicators
and thus PFM performance or lack thereof for the various core dimensions, which is in fact not the
case. There could be real progress despite the appearance of stagnation, if an indicator was over-
scored by the previous assessment (as what the PEFA team found to be the case for PI-11), real
progress despite the appearance of deterioration if indicators or dimensions were highly over-scored
(as the PEFA team found to be the case for PI-21 and PI-25), or progress but less so than indicated by
a simple comparison of the overall scores, if the indicator was over-scored by the previous assessment
(as the PEFA team found to be the case for PI-18).

Summary of Assessment Indicator Scores

Ratings that have remained unchanged since the 2007 PEFA, and are difficult to justify are:
_ PI-7 (ii), PI-23, and D-3 at D;
_ PI-15 and PI-24 at D+;
_ PI-12 and PI-27 at C+.
It is disappointing feature of the Government Reform Program inaugurated in 2008 that it has failed to
make improvements in these areas. This is especially difficult to explain for:
_ PI-7 (ii), since more information on donor assistance than what is included in fiscal reports is
available within MINECOFIN, so that the policy measures to improve this dimension would be at
virtually no cost, and simply an issue of coordination and sharing of information within a single
Ministry; and
_ PI-15, effectiveness in collection of tax payments, unchanged at D+ since the 2007 PEFA, despite
Domestic Revenue Generation being a component of the Government reform Strategy under Pillar 1,
Economic Management and Budget;
_ PI-24, as in-year budget reporting did take place in 2007 and 2008; and in-year reporting just
ceased, with no explanation provided to the Team, in mid-2008.

Regarding the others, it can be noted that:
_ D-3, proportion of aid that is managed by use of national procedures, shows that donors are not
sufficiently relying on country systems for the channeling of donor assistance, and have not increased
their reliance since 2006, despite the constant and coordinated presence of donor support in Rwanda,
an overall improvement in PFM processes, and the general objective under the Paris Deceleration and
the Accra Agenda to increasingly rely on national systems;
_ The failure of improvements in the availability of information on resources received by service
delivery units (PI-23) is also quite surprising especially give the fiscal decentralization process
underway, and the stated objectives of the National Decentralization Policy.
_ Regarding legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law (PI-27), the indicator rating cannot improve
as long as the current situation, of no limit in place for the size of supplementary budgets, reflected
under dimension (iv), continues.
_ The failure of the MTEF (see PI-12) to deliver its true objective of linking policy targets with actual
budget allocations and thus ensure at the same time a strategic allocation of resources and fiscal
sustainability, is also especially costly in Rwanda, given the vast amount of capacity invested in the
multi-year planning process, which is very extensive and involves a large variety of activities
throughout the budget preparation cycle, across all sectors.
_ Regarding the implementation of IFMIS/SmartGov, which is part of the official PFM Government
Reform Program, under Pillar 2, component 3, it has fallen behind schedule. Its delay is at the root of
the fact that the quality of financial statements (PI-25 (i)) has not improved as much as its potential, as
it is hampered by the continued coexistence of two different systems, SagePastel and SmartGov.
Overall, not enough effect has trickled to PFM systems in the area of accounting, recording and
reporting despite it being one of the main reform pillars.

Overall, the PEFA assessment for CG found a marked improvement in external audit (PI-26) and
legislative scrutiny of audit reports (PI-28), which have improved from D to B+ and B respectively.
Government Reform Pillar 4, Budget Execution Oversight, at least regarding external audit, has thus
already resulted in measurable positive effects both in the directly targeted areas, and, probably as a
consequence, in the related areas of controls in procurement, salary and non-salary expenditure (PI-
19, PI-18 and PI-20).

Similarly, the SN Assessment found a satisfactory nature and scope of the external scrutiny of SN
governments (see SN PI-26, rated at A for nature and scope and B overall). The OAG in fact audits all

                                                    71
SN governments on a yearly basis and issues the results of the audit as part of the Annual Report
presented to Parliament, under Volume III. Also in parallel with CG, and also probably as a result of
an acceptable level of external oversight, including on the implementation of audit recommendations,
the SN Assessment found that controls on both salary and non-salary expenditure are at an
acceptable/satisfactory level, with PI-18 and PI-20 both rated at B+. At the SN level, the core
dimension transparency and comprehensiveness was assessed only on the basis of two indicators (PI-8
and PI-10), one of which was found not applicable (PI-8). On the basis of PI-10 only, which assesses
public access to key fiscal information, transparency at the SN level is satisfactory (A). The core
dimension accounting and reporting, assessed at the SN level on the basis of the availability of funds
for commitment expenditures (PI-22) and in-year budget reporting (PI-24), shows acceptable to good
results (B+), and a more positive status of processes than for CG.

By indicator, the SN Assessment found that the areas that are at a good or acceptable level of
performance are:
_ PI-2 Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget (B,B,A,B)
_ HLG-1 Predictability of transfers from higher levels of Government (B+, B+, B+, A)
_ PI-10 Public access to key fiscal information (A)
_ PI-16 Predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of expenditures (B+)
_ PI-18 Effectiveness of payroll controls (B+)
_ PI-20 Effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary expenditure (B+)
_ PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of accounts reconciliation (B+)
_ PI-24 Quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports (B+)
_ PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external audit (B+)

Whereas the following areas were found to be weak:
_ PI-1 Aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget (D,B,D,D)
_ PI-11 Orderliness and participation in the annual budget process (D+)

                                  Annex 7: Impact Assessment of LPG Tax Removal

                Fuel use in Rwanda and the potential effects of the de-taxation on LPG
According to the latest DHS 2008, firewood remains the predominant source of fuel used for cooking
(for 90.9 percent of the households), followed by charcoal which accounts for about 8 percent of the
households. Firewood is used nearly equally among all the lower wealth quintiles. Only the richest
quintile uses charcoal partly for cooking.

Based on the data in Table 1 and 2, LPG use is minuscule and mainly confined to the richest
households. De-taxation of LPGs may reduce over time dependence on charcoal which of course has
benefits for the environment. However, based on the current fuel usage pattern, it will benefit most
likely the better-off households and not the poor households.

       IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Rwanda

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/3
January 11, 2011

On December 20, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Rwanda. 26

Background

Rwanda's economy is showing clear signs of recovery from the external and domestic shocks of the
past two years, while inflation has remained low.

After slowing to 4.1 percent in 2009 from 11.2 percent in 2008, real GDP growth for 2010 is expected
to reach 6.5 percent, driven by a rebound in exports and stronger-than-expected growth in services
(mainly in telecommunications) and constructionsectors that were adversely affected by the global
recession and tight liquidity. High-frequency macroeconomic indicators for the first three quarters of
2010 confirm the pickup in economic activity.

Higher export performance, reflecting a rebound in international prices and stronger-than-expected
volumes of coffee, tea, and non-traditional exports, has contributed to a narrowing of the external
current account deficit (excluding grants) to 17.3 percent of GDP in 2010 from 18.6 percent in 2009,
while international reserves remain at comfortable levels.

For the first time in many years, annual inflation has remained below 5 percent in 2010, reflecting in
large part the benign external environment, especially stable food and fuel prices.

Monetary policy has been accommodative, but private sector credit has been slow to respond, despite
three cuts in the central bank's policy rate (the key repo rate) since November 2009 by 300 basis
points.

Fiscal performance in Fiscal Year 2009/10 was better than projected, reflecting better than projected
domestic revenue collection while total expenditure including net lending remained on target.

In general, Rwanda's economy has a higher growth potential of about 8½ percent over the medium
term, provided that (i) investment is scaled up significantly; (ii) productivity growth increases and
remains elevated; and (iii) there are no adverse shocks. Achieving and maintaining this high growth
rate, however, is challenging as it will require additional investments of at least US$350 million (or 7
percent of GDP) a year. Risks to the outlook are on the downside, reflecting mainly slower pickup in
external demand and domestic credit. Donor flows are expected to remain strong, but decline
gradually over the medium term. Over the longer term, risks to potential growth include lower levels
of investment financing and smaller productivity gains. There are also upside risks to inflation from
higher global food and fuel prices.

Rwanda's macroeconomic policies are supported by the IMF's Policy Support Instrument (PSI),
which was approved in June 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/247). The proposed three-year PSI
program aims to consolidate macroeconomic stability while reducing Rwanda's aid dependency by:

26
   Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

                                                       81
(i) maintaining a sustainable fiscal position through improved revenue mobilization; (ii) strengthening
monetary and exchange rate policies to ensure low and stable inflation; (iii) reducing financial sector
vulnerability by strengthening banking supervision, and deepening the financial sector by enhancing
access to credit; and (iv) diversifying the export base and improving the business environment.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the Rwandan authorities for satisfactory implementation of the
economic program supported under the PSI. Countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies helped to
mitigate the impact of the global economic downturn and contributed to a rebound in economic
activity. Directors noted that the recovery remains fragile.

Continued prudent policies, improved infrastructure, increased agricultural productivity, and
deepened financial markets will be needed to sustain growth and reduce poverty.

Directors welcomed the authorities' intention to gradually unwind fiscal stimulus and to embark on a
medium-term path toward fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the authorities to consider
complementing revenue mobilization efforts with tax policy reforms and supported further
strengthening of the medium-term fiscal framework underlying the planned fiscal consolidation. Such
improvements include better costing of government spending plans in the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework, improved alignment of external grants with a medium-term domestic debt strategy, and
quarterly dissemination of fiscal data.

Directors commended the authorities for their progress in reforming public financial management, and
emphasized the importance of further enhancing public expenditure accountability and efficiency.
They noted that strengthening of public investment planning and evaluation and of debt management
capacity would be critical for scaled-up infrastructure spending, in particular when using
nonconcessional financing.

Directors underscored the importance of regular review of the monetary policy stance to enable timely
response to any underlying inflationary pressures. They recognized the challenges involved in
strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism, and encouraged more active use of the policy
rate and development of an active debt market with longer-dated instruments. Directors emphasized
the importance of continued analytical support for the Monetary Policy Committee deliberation
process and supported continuation of reforms toward greater exchange rate flexibility.

Directors noted staff's assessment that Rwanda's real effective exchange rate was broadly in line with
economic fundamentals. They underscored the importance of continued improvements in the business
environment and stepped up efforts on structural reforms to broaden the export base.
Directors welcomed efforts to improve access to finance, but cautioned that accelerating the
expansion of micro finance institutions and savings and credit cooperatives should be balanced by
having in place the necessary supervisory capacity. They emphasized the importance of developing
and implementing a plan to build and retain banking supervision staff. Directors stressed the
importance of enhancing competition in the banking sector.

Directors encouraged the authorities to improve quality of statistics, particularly in the areas of the
national accounts and the balance of payment.
