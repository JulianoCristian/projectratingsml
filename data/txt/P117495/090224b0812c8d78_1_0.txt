Program Development Objectives
Program Development Objective (from Program Document)
The Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Financing (PRSF-7) continues to support the Government of Rwanda as it implements measures to foster broad based growth
in the context of enhanced decentralization reforms. The program development objective is to adopt policies and reforms that support more efficient governance and
contribute to broad based growth by easing the key constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in
Rwanda. The PRSF-7 supports the implementation of the Government's medium-term development strategy, the EDPRS, within the context of a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework. The Financing is closely aligned with the CPAF, which was prepared under Government leadership in consultation with development
partners. The PRSF-7 is the fourth and last operation in the second series of PRSFs. The PRSF-7 builds on the past operations' support to the Government in the core
areas of: (i) sustainably raising agricultural production; (ii) increasing access to infrastructure services; (iii) strengthening the framework for post-basic education, to
build a skilled workforce and promote science and technology; (iv) deepening the financial sector; and (v) strengthening the management of public resources at the
central and local levels.
Overall, PRSF-7 continues to follow the areas of reforms identified under PRSG-4 in the agriculture, infrastructure and social sectors.

.U,
0    Implementation progress for the Rwanda PRSF-7, the last in a series, was satisfactory. For this operation, the to be assessed year of the corresponding outcome indicators of the
0   CPAF was the Government FY 2009/10, ending in June 2010. This is based on the agreement of the MoU for Budget Support in Rwanda, of which the Bank is a signatory. The
agreement states that a budget support disbursed in a given Government fiscal year should be based on the results of the CPAF and Joint Budget Support Review the year
-- preceding the disbursement of this budget support. The PRSF-7 was approved on February 24, 2011 and disbursed on April 7, 2011. By the time of the Joint Budget Sector Review
of October 2010 all but one prior actions for the PRSF-7 were fulfilled. The one unfulfilled policy action was in the area of civil service reforms and was subsequently exchanged with

another prior action for the PRSF-7, as it was felt the non-fulfillment of that prior action was not within the control of the Authorities. By October 2010, out of the 12 outcome
indicators, 9 were fulfilled, one had substantial progress achieved but aas not met and two had no data for 2009/10 available.

Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
Satisfactory implementation performance was the reason for the decision to move ahead with the preparation of a new series and follow-up operation, the PRSF-8. After the approval
of the PRSF-7, the last in the second series, it was decided to immediately move to an ICR, in order to be able to draw on lessons learned from the second series for the new series.
It was also agreed with Government to prepare the new operation under a compressed preparation schedule, moving it up by one quarter, in order to address Government's request
to align the Bank's budget support with the new Rwandan Fiscal Year.
