       The Executive Directors approved the Enhanced Fiscal and Financial Management for
Greater Opportunities Development Policy Loan (R2014-0098) to the Republic of Guatemala in
the amount of US$340 million on the conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum.

       Directors supported the proposed operation and noted its alignment with the World Bank
Group’s goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity as well as the Country
Partnership Strategy. They welcomed the Government’s commitment to strengthen tax policy
and tax administration, enhance the results orientation of the budget, and improve the
coordination of social policies. Directors noted the Government’s efforts to improve the
progressivity of the tax system and were pleased the Bank was assisting the Government to
enhance tax and customs administration. They highlighted the need for medium-term sustained
reform efforts to create fiscal space. They also welcomed measures to improve the quality of
spending, including enhanced budgetary targeting and monitoring and evaluation systems.
Directors supported efforts to foster social inclusion, improve child health, and reduce
malnutrition. They also underscored the importance of tackling gender inequality.

        Directors acknowledged the risks inherent in the program, particularly those that stem
from Guatemala’s vulnerability to economic shocks and natural disasters, but agreed that the
policy actions underpinned by this DPL were steps in the right direction. Directors welcomed the
creation of the Economic and Social Council and the poverty and shared prosperity
benchmarking presented in the operation and the country analysis on key development
challenges.

        Directors took note of the Government’s progress in the negotiations with communities
affected by the Chixoy hydroelectric dam. They welcomed progress in negotiations on
reparations and underscored the importance of Government leadership to resolve the legacy of
earlier MDB engagement.
