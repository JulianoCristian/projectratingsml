and aligned with the three pillars of the operation. Moreover, the reform focus was broadened to
include reforms related to budget management and results orientation of public spending. As a
consequence, the pillars and the indicators were adjusted to enhance the linkages between the
supported actions and the expected outcomes.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) assesses the achievements of the
expected results of the programmatic series of Enhanced Fiscal and Financial Management
for Greater Opportunities Development Policy Loans to the Republic of Guatemala. The
Development Policy Loan (DPL) series intended to support the Government of Guatemala to: (i)
strengthen tax administration and tax policy; (ii) strengthen budget management and increase the
results orientation of public spending; and (iii) improve the management and coordination of social
policies. The first operation (DPL1) of US$200 million was approved by the World Bank’s Board
of Directors on September 27, 2012 and disbursed upon loan effectiveness on November 21, 2013.2
The second operation (DPL2) of US$340 million was approved on June 17, 2014 and disbursed
upon loan effectiveness on February 26, 2015. The second and last operation in the series closed
on March 31, 2015.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The series was part of the Bank’s strategic engagement with the new Guatemalan
administration following the Presidential elections of September 2011. The new administration
of Otto Pérez Molina of the Partido Patriota focused on reforms to improve Guatemala’s
deteriorating security situation, and to strengthen public finances to allow for increased spending
in social programs to reduce the country’s high levels of poverty and inequality. The Government’s
reform priorities supported three strategic “Pacts”3: (i) the Fiscal Reform Pact, (ii) the Zero Hunger
Pact; and (iii) the Peace, Public Safety and Justice Pact. In this context, the DPL series was
designed to assist the new government with two of these strategic pacts: the Fiscal Reform Pact,
and the Zero Hunger Pact.

At the inception of the DPL series, Guatemala’s macroeconomic performance was strong.
Table 1 provides selected economic indicators for the period 2008-2014. Guatemala’s GDP growth
accelerated to over 4 percent in 2011, from 2.9 percent the year before, despite a series of natural
hazards which hit the country during 2010-11. Growth was driven by strong private consumption,
supported by a 6.1 percent increase in remittances. While the fiscal deficit was still above the pre-
crisis levels, it had been reduced in 2011 to 2.8 percent of GDP, driven by an increase in revenues.
Nonetheless, fiscal revenues were still low, in particular tax revenues (10.9 percent of GDP) which
remained well below the average of other developing countries in Latin America (14.8 percent of

  At the time DPL1 was approved, the Congress in Guatemala had to approve each external loan individually, and the
time between loan approval and effectiveness is explained by the procedural steps taken in Congress to discuss and
approve external loans. At the time DPL2 was approved, the authorities had streamlined these procedures, and the
external loans that were included in the annual budget were approved together with the Budget Law.
3
  The “Pacts” and their specific objectives included: (i) the Fiscal Reform Pact, which targeted tax reform in order to
raise the country’s tax revenue, which stood at 11 percent of GDP in 2011 and limited the ability of the public sector
to undertake needed investments in the social and productive sectors; (ii) the Zero Hunger Pact, which focused on
reducing malnutrition rates in children under five (estimated at 13 percent compared to a regional average of 2.8
percent); and (iii) the Peace, Public Safety and Justice Pact, which aimed to decrease crime and violence, considered
to be among the most destabilizing factors for political, social, and economic life.


                                                          1
GDP). This imposed a restriction on spending, in particular social spending, in order to maintain
a small fiscal deficit.

Furthermore, the Government was quickly advancing structural reforms embedded in the
Fiscal and Zero Hunger Pacts, even though Congress was highly polarized and fragmented.4
During the first month in office (January 2012), the Government created the Ministry of Social
Development to improve the coordination in the design and implementation of social policies. In
February 2012, Congress approved a package of tax reforms that marked a historic achievement
as it represented the first comprehensive reform of the tax system in twenty years. In March 2012,
to better target social policies, the Government launched the flagship “Zero Hunger” program,
aimed at reducing infant mortality and chronic malnutrition.

By the time the second operation was appraised in April 2014, Guatemala continued to have
a favorable macroeconomic situation, but fiscal resources for social expenditures remained
constrained. Economic growth increased to 4.2 percent in 2014, up from 3.7 percent in 2013. The
recovery in 2014 was supported again by private consumption and backed by strong remittances
inflows which increased by 8.6 percent. The external position had also improved, with a reduction
of the current account deficit from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.1 percent in 2014, financed
mainly by foreign direct investment (FDI). Regarding the fiscal balance, however, the expected
improvements in fiscal revenues did not materialize. In 2013, the share of total tax revenues to
GDP amounted to 11 percent of GDP, below the pre-crisis level of 12.1 percent of GDP in 2007.

During this period, the Government continued making progress on the reform program. The
Government recognized that without a substantial and sustained increase in tax revenues, resources
would remain insufficient to improve social service delivery and address Guatemala’s
infrastructure deficit. As a result, the Government accelerated the pace of reforms in tax
administration and tax policy, public financial management, and social policy. Policy measures
included the approval of implementing regulations for the tax reform package, the adoption of a
National Customs Law, and enhancements to the accountability of public spending, including the
institutionalization of results-based budgeting and of the Treasury Single Account.

The DPL series supported the Government’s reform program and was fully consistent with
the World Bank’s objectives of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The design
of the series benefited from lessons learned from previous World Bank operations in Guatemala.
In the past, low levels of trust among the population regarding the ability of the Government to
manage public resources transparently and effectively had been a critical obstacle to the adoption
of tax reforms. Taking this into account, the DPL series took a two-pronged approach: on the one
hand, it aimed at mobilizing revenues in an efficient and equitable way, and on the other hand it
aimed at improving the results-orientation of the budget, as well as the management and
coordination of social policies so that social programs would reach the most vulnerable segments
of society.

 What was crucial in this process was the fact that the incoming government basically garnered the necessary support
and consensus for the tax reform before taking the office, and the reform was approved within the first months of the
new administration.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The original Program Development Objective specified in DPL1 was to support the Guatemalan
Government in creating fiscal space and expanding opportunities for the most vulnerable segments
of society.

The DPL series supported the government’s reform program under three original core pillars:
   (i)   Strengthening Tax Administration and Tax Policy;
   (ii)  Enhancing the Quality of Public Expenditure; and
   (iii) Improving the Coordination and Management of Social Policy.




                                                             3
The Key Outcome Indicators, as presented in DPL1, were the following:

Strengthening Tax Administration and Tax Policy

   1   Increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio by one percentage point (baseline: 2011=11 percent;
       target: 2013=12 percent);
   2   Increase in the tax base by 8 percent from 2011 to 2013
   3   Increase in the number of audits of exports and imports, including ex-post verifications, by
       one-third (baseline: 2011=346; target: 2012=519);
   4   Tax information sharing agreements have been signed, in line with the Global Forum’s
       standards of transparency and exchange of tax information (baseline 2011=0; target:
       2013=12).

Improving the Quality and Transparency of Public Expenditure

   5   Percentage of children less than 1 year old in 83 prioritized municipalities who receive
       the appropriate growth promotion package of services for their age which includes eight
       weight check-ups, one height check-up, one treatment of micronutrients and vitamin A
       (baseline not available; target: 2013=10 percent).
   6   Percentage of women in 83 prioritized municipalities who are attended to during labor in
       facilities of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance by qualified providers
       (baseline: not available; target: 2013=15 percent).

Enhancing the Coordination and Management of Social Policy

   7   Major social programs are included in the Unique Beneficiary Registry (baseline:
       2011=0; target: 2013=3 (Bono Seguro, Jóvenes Protagonistas and Bolsa Segura).
   8   Number of Zero Hunger offices established in priority municipalities with the highest
       incidence of chronic malnutrition (baseline: 2011=0; target: 2013=100);
   9   The Economic and Social Council (CES) holds regular meetings to discuss public
       policies.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

For DPL2, the wording of the PDO was modified to make it more specific and better aligned with
the three pillars of the operation. Moreover, the reform focus was broadened to include new
reforms aimed at improving the results-orientation of public spending. As a consequence, the
pillars and the results indicators were adjusted to enhance the linkages between the supported
actions and the expected outcomes.

The PDO of the DPL series was as follows:

Support the Government of Guatemala to (i) strengthen tax administration and tax policy; (ii)
strengthen budget management and increase the results orientation of public spending; and (iii)
improve the management and coordination of social policies.




                                                4
The final Key Outcomes Indicators expected to be achieved by the end of the DPL series were the
following:

Strengthening Tax Administration and Tax Policy

   1. Increase in the income tax-to-GDP ratio (baseline: 2011=2.7 percent; target: 2014=3.2
      percent)
   2. Increase in the tax base (number of effective tax payers making direct payments to SAT)
      by at least 10 percent from 2011 to 2014 (baseline: 2011=1,441,246; target:
      2014=1,585,370)
   3. Increase in the amount of administrative sanctions in the area of customs in line with the
      National Customs Law (baseline:2013=0; target:2014=4 million quetzals)
   4. Increase in the number of countries with which Guatemala has a signed framework to
      exchange tax related information (baseline: 2011=0; target: 2014=60); and the number of
      countries with which Guatemala is exchanging tax related information, upon request,
      through information sharing agreements or through the OECD Multilateral Convention, in
      line with the Global Forum’s standards of transparency and exchange of tax information
      (baseline: 2011=0; target: 2014=5).

Enhancing Budget Management and Increasing the Results Orientation of Public Spending

   5. Increase in the percentage of children less than 1 year old in 83 prioritized municipalities
      who receive the appropriate growth promotion package of services for their age which
      includes weight and height check-ups (baseline: 2011=37.5 percent; target: 2014=50
      percent)
   6. Increase in the percentage of the total budget under the results-based budgeting framework
      (baseline: 2011=0 percent; target: 2014=9 percent)

Improving the Coordination and Management of Social Policies

   7. Increase in the percentage of beneficiaries across all social programs that are included in
      the Unique Beneficiary Registry (baseline: 2011=0; target: 2014=80 percent)
   8. Increase in the percentage of the population in the country represented by an active
      Municipal Council of Food and Nutrition Security (COMUSAN) that is in charge of
      coordinating the implementation of the Zero Hunger Pact at the local level (baseline:
      2011=25 percent; target: 2014=90 percent)
   9. The Economic and Social Council (CES) holds regular meetings to discuss public policies,
      and has issued consensus resolutions on policy issues in Guatemala that have been
      supported by its members.

Table 2 summarizes the reasons behind the adjustments to the results indicators. These adjustments
aimed at enhancing the monitoring and evaluation framework of the DPL series, reflect on the
broadening of the reform agenda, and address changes in the pace of the reforms.

  The remaining four indicators (indicators #2, #5, #7, and #9 in DPL2) did not change. The language of these

information on the baseline and target values (e.g., indicator #5 in DPL2).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

The original policy areas supported by the DPL were:

      1. Tax Administration and Tax Policy

Tax administration and tax policy reforms were intended to increase the efficiency of
revenue mobilization, improve the progressivity of the tax system and enhance transparency
and exchange of information related to international tax agreements. These reforms were
needed to help strengthen the tax system to support Guatemala’s development priorities in terms
of social spending and growth enhancing investment. Notably, at the time of DPL1 preparation,
Guatemala had one of the lowest government revenues in the world relative to the size of the
economy, mainly due to low tax collection. In this area, the DPL series supported measures to
widen the tax base and simplify existing taxes, strengthen tax and customs administration, and
increase the transparency and exchange of information related to international taxation.

      2. Budget Management and Results Orientation of Public Spending

Budget management and public spending reforms intended to improve fiscal progressivity
by enhancing the accountability and results orientation of public spending. This was of
particular importance given Guatemala’s tight fiscal envelope and limited trust in the state. In
particular, the implementation of results-based budgeting (RBB) was initiated through a pilot RBB
in the health sector, and was later scaled up to other central government entities. In addition, the
supported reforms aimed at enhancing public financial transparency through the
institutionalization of a Treasury Single Account to process budget transactions and the
implementation of Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) to consolidate budgetary and
financial information.

      3. Coordination and Management of Social Policies

The improvement of the coordination and management of social policies aimed to protect
the most vulnerable segments of society and support consensus building for public policies.
Weak human development indicators in Guatemala, related to high child mortality and
malnutrition rates, combined with very low levels of social spending underscored the importance
of reforms in the area of social policies. The DPL series contributed to these objectives by
supporting the creation of the Ministry of Social Development, the adoption of the Zero Hunger
program, the creation of a social information system underpinned by a Single Beneficiary Registry
for social programs, and the creation of the Economic and Social Council (CES) to promote policy
dialogue and consensus on fundamental issues of public policy.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

The policy areas remained unchanged throughout the program.

Not applicable.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Program Performance6

The programmatic series consisted of two single-tranche Development Policy Loans
disbursed upon effectiveness, in the total amount of US$540 million. Table 3 provides key
milestone dates for the DPL series. All required prior actions were completed prior to the
operation’s approval (see Table 4).

                                                                            Disbursed

                DPL1              09/27/2012           11/21/2013           US$200m           12/31/2013
                DPL2              06/17/2014           02/26/2015           US$340m           03/31/2015

As the series evolved, for DPL2 the scope of some of the prior actions was broadened,
reflecting an overall stronger program relative to what was envisioned under the DPL1
triggers. Out of the six indicative triggers identified under DPL1, three were converted into prior
actions for DPL2 (the language of the prior actions was adjusted to better capture their legal form),
three were strengthened (i.e., the scope of the action was broadened),7 and a new prior action was
added. The new prior action supported a substantive reform package including measures to
enhance the Organic Budget Law, the Organic Law for the Tax Administration Superintendence,
and the Organic Law for the Comptroller General of Accounts.




6
  This ICR does not discuss the Implementation Supervision Report (ISR) ratings given that the ISRs were only filed
for DPL1 and due to the change in OPCS’s new guidance approved in September 2014, there was no requirement to
file an ISR for DPL2. The ICR notes that the last ISR for DPL1 had a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory due to
delays in the Congressional approval of the loan, and due to risks at the time related to the passage of the tax reform.
During identification of DPL2, as reflected in the DPL2 program document, the tax reform package had been kept in
place after a review by the Constitutional Court, implying an overall satisfactory assessment of DPL1.
7
  For instance, regarding the management of social programs, an indicative trigger under DPL1 specified the launching
of a program to roll-out offices to monitor progress of the Zero Hunger program. Under DPL2 the scope of this reform
was broadened as the Government had established 120 offices in priority municipalities responsible for the inter-
ministerial coordination related to the Zero Hunger program. In the same pillar, new measures were added under DPL2,
including expanding the legal framework for Results-Based Budgeting to the entire Central Government.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

The overall implementation of the DPL series was adequate, with the Government
committed to the reform program, though there were factors that negatively affected
program implementation. The factors that negatively affected program implementation had been
identified as risks under DPL1 and DPL2, and included political and legal risks, and risks related
to limited institutional capacity. 8 In particular, issues related to claims of unconstitutionality
against the tax reform package approved under DPL1 affected the pace of tax reforms by
generating delays in the adoption of secondary tax legislation. As further elaborated below, these
claims were resolved prior to the approval of DPL2. Moreover, institutional capacity issues also
affected the pace of reforms in tax administration and regarding the coordination of social policies.
Nonetheless, there were also factors that positively affected the implementation of the program. In
particular, the program benefitted from solid analytical underpinnings, technical assistance, and
consultations and collaboration with other development partners, all of which contributed to
advance the reform agenda.

         (a) Political and Legal Risks

Following the approval of DPL1, a number of unconstitutionality claims were presented
against the tax reform package supported under the program. Specific articles of the tax
legislation were challenged: out of a total of 258 articles that comprised the tax reform package,
68 articles were challenged by the Constitutional Court. Since in the past similar constitutional
challenges had led to the reversals of tax reforms in Guatemala, the risks for the DPL operation
increased substantially. While these claims were being reviewed by the Constitutional Court, there
were difficulties in reaching agreements between the Executive and Legislative branches regarding
the related secondary tax legislations. In this context it was difficult for the Government to garner
political support to adopt the related implementing regulations for the new tax laws. However, by
early-2014 uncertainties about the unconstitutionality of the tax reforms were resolved, the
measures supported by the operation were not reversed, and the Government adopted the related
implementing regulations.

         (b) Institutional Capacity Risks

Institutional weaknesses affected the pace of implementation of some of the measures supported
by the DPL series. In particular, the effectiveness of the tax reforms depended on the ability of the
tax administration to apply and enforce the new provisions. Yet, as part of the Government’s
strategy to improve tax administration, in 2013 there were massive layoffs and management
changes in the Tax Administration Superintendence (SAT). While these measures aimed at
improving the effectiveness of SAT over the medium-term, in the short-term they affected the
performance of the agency leading to weaker tax enforcement, as reported by SAT. Furthermore,
institutional risks aggravated during 2014-2015 due to weak customs enforcement, and most
notably by the uncovering in early-2015 of corruption allegations against high-ranked SAT


8
  The DPL program documents also recognized macroeconomic and natural disaster risks stemming for an unstable
global economy following the global financial crisis and the country’s high vulnerability to natural hazards, but these
risks did not materialize.


                                                         11
officials that further weakened the limited trust in SAT. Institutional capacity issues related to
inter-agency coordination also affected the pace of implementation of the RBB, and the
implementation of the Zero Hunger program, especially at the sub-national level.

       (a) Soundness of the Background Analysis and Provision of Technical Assistance

The DPL series was underpinned by sound analytical work conducted by the World Bank and
development partners and was well linked to complementary World Bank investment lending and
technical assistance projects. For example, the implementation of RBB was supported by the fiscal
diagnostics embedded in the Public Expenditure Review and the pilot RBB program benefited
from Bank technical assistance through a Bank investment project in the health sector.

       (b) Consultation and Collaboration with Other Development Partners

The design of the DPL series benefited from an extensive process of consultations during the
preparation of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), in which the Bank
engaged with the private sector, civil society, and development partners to discuss the proposed
reform program. The Bank also collaborated closely with the IMF, that in its Article IV (2013)
stressed the importance of pursuing structural reforms to promote long-term inclusive growth,
including increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio to support priority public spending. Finally, the DPLs
were also prepared in coordination with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). The
IADB prepared a Policy-Based Loan in parallel to the World Bank DPL, supporting
complementary reforms in the social sector. The teams coordinated the design of the policy matrix
to avoid duplicating efforts and ease the reporting and monitoring burden of the authorities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The program’s development objectives were clear and the focus of the different pillars was
well described, which helped in the selection of appropriate indicators. The supporting M&E
arrangements were adequate. Specific comments on the design, implementation, and utilization of
M&E arrangements are laid out below.

   (a) Design

The program documents presented the pillars, actions, and results indicators clearly and these were
well aligned to the PDO. Some indicators were revised during the preparation of DPL2 as
described in Section 1.3, and these revisions enhanced the M&E framework of the series. Overall,
the indicators were well-selected, measureable, and clearly attributable to the prior actions. The
result indicators had identified baseline and targets in line with the expected program outcomes.
They were largely based on publically-available data, although some of them (e.g. quantitative
indicators related to the implementation of the Zero Hunger program) required an additional data
collection effort on the part of the Government. Both the policy matrix and the corresponding
results indicators were prepared jointly with the government counterparts, supporting the process
of institutionalizing the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements in the public sector.




                                                12
   (b) Implementation

The DPL was monitored through a continuous dialogue with government counterparts to assess
progress and address potential bottlenecks. Monitoring was conducted on an on-going basis and
supported by complementary investment projects, technical assistance, and analytical activities.
On the Government side, the implementation of the M&E framework was led by the Ministry of
Public Finance (MINFIN), through the Directorate of Public Credit. Other agencies involved in
the implementation of the program included the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES), SAT,
the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance (MOHSA), and the Economic and Social Council
(CES). They were all involved in the data collection effort supporting the monitoring of the DPL
program. During the collection of data, the documentation received for preparation of this ICR
was timely and complete. The quality of data was satisfactory, with the exception of indicator #5
which was based on the outdated population data projections from the 2002 Population and
Housing Census (there has been no census carried out in Guatemala since 2002), and which did
not fully capture the movement of people from one municipality to another.

   (c) Utilization

The DPL series promoted the use of the M&E arrangements. Regular monitoring and data collection
undertaken as part of the DPL series facilitated discussions with the Government on the
implementation of reforms and progress on the indicators. In particular, with the implementation of
RBB, the series contributed to promoting evidence based policy making and helped to shift
budgetary discussion from a focus on inputs (‘what to spend on’) to a focus on outcomes (‘what to
achieve’).

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

The World Bank continues to support the Government of Guatemala in the areas of the DPL series
through policy dialogue and technical assistance, in coordination with development partners. The
Bank is finalizing the preparation of a Systematic Country Diagnostic and preparing a new Country
Partnership Framework (CPF). The Government has requested the Bank to continue supporting
the areas under the DPL series as part of the new CPF.


3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

(a) Relevance of Objectives: Satisfactory

The overall objectives of the program were and remain highly relevant. The program’s
development objectives to assist the Government of Guatemala to strengthen tax administration
and tax policy; improve the results-orientation of public spending, and improve the management
and coordination of social policies continue to be as relevant today as they were when the DPL


                                               13
series was designed. The key components of the DPLs program were fully consistent with the
Government’s agenda to promote growth and social development and with the pillars of the CPS,
presented to the Board jointly with the DPL1 in September 2012. The relevance of the objectives
is further highlighted by the fact that challenges in revenue mobilization remain, as Guatemala
continues to have one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratios in the world. And given the limited
fiscal space and high poverty rates in the country, it remains critical to spend resources in the most
efficient and transparent way, and protect the most vulnerable groups of society.

(b) Relevance of Design: Satisfactory

The design of the operation builds on lessons learned from previous DPLs in Guatemala.
Policy measures supported by the program and results indicators were in line with the outlined
objectives and chosen following a rationale: the need to be cautious given the low capacity while
at the same time consolidate positive results of the country’s reform program and long standing
Bank engagement. The program supported areas where the Bank was well-positioned to contribute
with analytical and advisory services. The design focused on a well-defined and feasible set of
reforms that were accompanied by complementary technical assistance—e.g., the implementation
of an Integrated Assessment Model for Tax Administration (IAMTAX), the application of
behavioral insights to improve tax compliance, and the provision of technical assistance to support
the pilot RBB in the health sector. This led to a framework of clear prior actions and results
indicators. The programmatic design of the operation emphasizes the Government’s and the
Bank’s commitment to the program objectives. The programmatic design allowed putting more
emphasis on legislation in DPL1 and on implementing regulations in DPL2. This approach was
helpful in avoiding implementation slippages.

(c) Relevance of Implementation: Satisfactory

Implementation arrangements were and continue to be relevant. MINFIN was the executing
agency due to its central role in managing the fiscal framework, implementing the result-based
budgeting and coordinating social policy within the Government. The Public Credit Director was
appropriately responsible for monitoring the implementation of the program. After a mid-term
review, progress in achieving results indicators was assessed. In August 2015 an update on the
progress in achieving the results indicators was submitted by the authorities, and further updates
were provided by the authorities during the preparation of this ICR.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Overall Rating: Satisfactory

The overall Program Development Objective of enhancing fiscal and financial management
for greater opportunities was overall successfully achieved as evidenced by key results
indicators. Substantial progress has been achieved in improving tax administration and tax policy,
in increasing the results-orientation of public spending, and in improving the management and
coordination of social programs.




                                                 14
The PDO of the DPL series was evaluated using nine results indicators. Out of nine indicators,
eight were achieved (Indicators #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8 & #9), while only one indicator (#1),
was partially achieved. The results indicators and their current status are discussed in detail below.

Objective 1: Strengthening Tax Administration and Tax Policy

In Strengthening Tax Administration and Tax Policy, the DPL series proved satisfactory in
achieving its outcomes and objectives. The reforms were broadly implemented as envisaged, and
the quantitative targets were achieved (with the exception of indicator #1 which was partially
achieved).

Outcome Indicator 1: Increase in the income tax-to-GDP ratio from a baseline of 2.7 percent
in 2011 to 3.2 percent by the end of 2014.9 − Partially Achieved

Against the backdrop of having one of the lowest revenue to GDP ratios globally, the agenda
of increasing tax revenues was at the cornerstone of the Government’s reform program. The
series supported a comprehensive package of tax reforms, which were intended to increase tax
collection and broaden the tax base. The most significant reforms included the adoption of the
Antievasión II Law, which introduced a number of measures strengthening tax administration; and
the Actualización Tributaria Law, which made important changes to tax policy, including changes
to the tax rates, tax bases, and other aspects of the existing system.

Legislative initiatives delivered important improvements in the Guatemalan tax system. First,
in contrast to other tax reform efforts in the past, and despite multiple claims of unconstitutionality,
the tax reform was kept in place.10 Secondly, with the new tax package, the country managed to
achieve a more equitable tax system. In particular, the widening of the tax base subject to income
tax, a reduction of tax exemptions, and a simplification of the tax rates, for salaried workers,
promoted greater progressivity in the tax system. This was because the reforms supported a shift
in the balance from indirect taxes like the value-added tax (VAT), which are in general regressive
taxes, towards direct income taxes. And third, there was an improvement in the income-tax-to-
GDP ratio, which increased from a baseline of 2.7 percent in 2011 to 3.1 percent in 2014, falling
0.1 percentage points below the intended target value. This shortfall in the income-tax-to-GDP is
partly explained by the growth of GDP. At the time when this indicator was defined, real GDP
was projected to grow by 3.5 percent during 2013-2014. Yet, the actual growth rate was
significantly higher: real GDP grew on average by 4 percent during 2013-2014.



9
  This indicator concerning tax collection was modified, from total tax collection (as a percent of GDP) to income tax
collection (as a percentage of GDP). As outlined in section 1.3, Guatemala is a country that historically has relied
heavily on indirect taxes such as VAT rather than more direct taxes such as income tax. The selection of the income
tax indicator represented the need to measure progress both in terms of revenue mobilization and in terms of the
progressivity of the tax system.
10
   It is worth noting that prior to the 2012 tax reform, only piecemeal fiscal reforms and temporary taxes had been
passed, causing very little impact. Notably, previous fiscal reforms in Guatemala were challenged in the Constitutional
Court and subsequently reversed. Temporary taxes were passed, but they either expired quickly or were rolled back
at the end of the presidential mandate. This cycle of temporary taxes has been exacerbated by sector-specific laws
amplifying exceptions and weakening progressivity.


                                                         15
Despite the progress achieved, there is a large scope for further improvements in tax
collection in Guatemala. It is important to note, that despite the increase in income tax collection
(which was the focus of the reform), overall tax revenues as a share of GDP remained low at 10.8
percent in 2014, well below the levels observed in most countries in the Latin American and the
Caribbean. Without the 2012 reforms supported by the DPL series, however, this result would
have been even lower, due to the visible deterioration in the VAT collection on imported goods.11
Multiple challenges, especially in tax and customs administration related to weak governance,
continue to undermine the effective tax collection effort.

Outcome Indicator 2: Increase in the tax base (number of effective tax payers making direct
payments to SAT) by at least 10 percent from 2011 to 2014 (baseline: 2011=1,441,246; target:
2014=1,585,370) − Achieved

Improvements to the organizational structure and implementation capacity of SAT were
essential to support the achievement of the DPL objectives. A number of legal initiatives were
aimed at strengthening tax administration and bringing it closer to international best practices. The
most important reforms included the Anti-Evasion Law II (Legislative Decree 4-2012), which
strengthened the role of SAT and defined taxpayer obligations, and the Organic Law of SAT
(Legislative Decree 13-2013), which contributed to improvements in its organizational structure.
These reforms helped to increase the tax base as measured by the number of effective tax payers
making direct payments to SAT, which increased by around 15 percent from 1,441,246 in 2011 to
1,658,765 in 2014. This number further increased to 1,700,586 in 2015, representing a growth of
18 percent compared to 2011.

Outcome Indicator 3. Increase in the amount of administrative sanctions in the area of customs
in line with the National Customs Law (baseline: 2013=0; target: 2014=4 million quetzals). –
Achieved

The program supported the National Customs Law (Legislative Decree No. 14- 2013), which
aligned the Guatemalan Customs Code to the Central American standard. The most important
amendments included: the introduction of a definition on customs infringements and related
sanctions; a clear role of SAT in the suspension and cancellation of customs licenses; and the
establishment of the procedures against fraud and contraband. As a result of these measures, the
amount of administrative sanctions amounted to 7.3 million quetzals in 2014, from a baseline of
zero in 2013, and this figure increased further to 9.6 million quetzals in 2015. Moreover, SAT
carried out a posteriori trade verifications in roads, imports warehouses and customs deposits,
which increased significantly from 553 in 2011 to 3,040 in 2014.




11
  There are a number of factors behind the slowdown in VAT on imported goods. First, in 2013, customs controls
were affected by institutional problems, which included massive layoffs and changes in management. As a result,
weaker customs capacity likely allowed for greater tax evasion. Second, in 2013 there was a significant slowdown in
the growth of the value of imports that are subject to taxes, which meant that VAT collection on imports remained
broadly unchanged in nominal terms relative to the previous year implying decline in relative terms (as a share of
GDP). Third, the corruption scheme called ‘La Linea’ that was uncovered in early-2015 operated primarily in customs,
and thus can be attributed to the slowdown in VAT on imported goods during this time period.


                                                        16
Outcome Indicator 4. Increase in the number of countries with which Guatemala has a signed
framework to exchange tax related information (baseline: 2011=0; target: 2014=60); and the
number of countries with which Guatemala is exchanging tax related information, upon request,
through information sharing agreements or through the OECD Multilateral Convention, in line
with the Global Forum’s standards of transparency and exchange of tax information (baseline:
2011=0; target: 2014=5). – Achieved

Increasing transparency and exchange of information related to international taxation was
a priority for Guatemala. At the time when the DPL series was designed, Guatemala was
undergoing the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes
peer review process, which highlighted a number of shortcomings related to the tax information
exchange process. Areas in which Guatemala did not comply with the international standards
included: insufficient obligations regarding the availability of ownership and identity information;
restrictions on the ability of the tax administration to obtain relevant information from taxpayers
and third parties; and restrictions in Guatemala’s domestic law which prevent the effective
exchange of tax information among Central American tax and customs administrations. These
shortcomings placed Guatemala on the OECD’s ‘grey list’ of countries that had not yet
implemented internationally recognized tax standards.

Against this backdrop, the DPL series supported measures to improve transparency and
exchange of information for tax purposes. Reform initiatives included Executive Agreement
No. 26-2014, which mandated the signing of the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance
in Tax Matters (December, 2012), and the creation in 2014 of an International Taxation Unit inside
the Ministry of Public Finance aimed to support the exchange of information related to
international taxation. As of December 2015, the number of countries with which Guatemala has
a signed framework to exchange tax related information, reached 94 jurisdictions (includes State
Parties to the Convention as well as jurisdictions). Additionally, as of August 2015 Guatemala has
signed one bilateral Double Tax Convention (DTC) with Mexico; Eight Bilateral Tax Information
Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) with Australia, Denmark, Faroe Island, Finland, Greenland,
Iceland, Norway, and Sweden; 12 and a Mutual Assistance Convention with four other Central
American countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua). Following the signing of
the Multilateral Convention, Guatemala was taken off the OECDs ‘grey list’ in recognition for its
progress in enhancing transparency related to international taxation.

Objective 2. Enhancing Budget Management and Increasing the Results Orientation of
Public Spending

Progress towards Enhancing Budget Management and Increasing the Results Orientation of
Public Spending has been assessed as satisfactory. The DPL series helped to establish practices
promoting greater accountability in public spending, which is of utmost importance given
Guatemalan’s tight fiscal envelope. All quantitative indicators were met, and regulatory and
legislative foundations are facilitating further gains in effectiveness and efficiency of public


12
  However, these agreements are still awaiting submission to the Congress of Guatemala for ratification as the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently in the process of preparing an official opinion and statement to be submitted
alongside the agreements to the President who has to seek Congress Approval as part of the ratification process.

spending. Nonetheless, there are some concerns that the scarcity of resources can pose a risk for
the sustainability of the reform program. The risk mitigation measures are discussed in the next
section.

Outcome Indicator 5. Increase in the percentage of children under 1 year old in 83 prioritized
municipalities who receive the appropriate growth promotion package of services for their age
which include weight and height check-ups (baseline: 2011=37.5 percent; target: 2014=50
percent). – Achieved

The DPL series supported the implementation of the Government’s flagship Zero Hunger
program through the results-based budgeting (RBB) approach. The Zero Hunger program
aimed at reducing chronic malnutrition with a special focus on children under 1 year old. Chronic
malnutrition (stunting) is one of the key development challenges for Guatemala, which creates
significant costs for the affected individuals and the economy as a whole.13 The RBB approach,
supported by the DPL series, increased the results orientation of the budgetary process. As a result,
resource allocation is now based not only on historical trends, but on progress achieved regarding
child and maternal health, and nutrition results. The introduction of a pilot RBB in the health
sector, focusing on priority municipalities selected based on their nutrition indicators, was
expected to help improve resource allocation to sectoral priorities and address the most urgent
spending needs.

The implementation of the RBB approach contributed to advancing the goals of the Zero
Hunger program. The result indicator of the DPL program focused on increasing the percentage
of children under 1 year old in 83 prioritized municipalities who receive the appropriate growth
promotion package of services for their age which include weight and height check-ups. According
to the data collected by the Government,14 conservative estimates suggest that the share of children
covered by the growth promotion package increased from 37.5 percent in 2011 to over 87 percent
in end-2014. Only 8 municipalities out of the 83 prioritized under the program did not achieve the
target of 50 percent of children receiving the growth monitoring package. In addition, the
percentage of children under 1 year old who receive Vitamin A increased from 12.9 percent in
2011 to 77 percent in 2015 and those who receive micronutrient supplements increased from 6.4
percent to 73 percent during the same period, in the 83 prioritized municipalities. An evaluation
conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute on the Zero Hunger prioritized areas
indicates that chronic malnutrition for children 3 to 59 months old decreased from 60.1 percent in
2012 to 58.4 percent in 2013 while underweight for the same age group decreased from 17.4
percent in 2012 to 16.4 percent in 2013.


13
   At the individual level, the direct costs of malnutrition to individuals are high—malnutrition leads to a greater risk
of mortality, higher morbidity and lower cognitive development—and can perpetuate poverty across generations. The
cost for the economy are reflected in undermined investments and the lower labor productivity.
14
   The monitoring system of the Zero Hunger program is based on population data projections from the 2002
Population and Housing Census (there has been no census carried out in Guatemala since 2002). As a result, the share
of children covered by the program has some degree of uncertainty. In addition, the monitoring system for the indicator
has been subject to a few errors such as failing to fully capture movement of people from one municipality to the other
and double counting. These factors have led to the situation where the share of children covered by the program
exceeded 100 percent in some of the municipalities. The ICR team conservatively assumed these to be equal to 100
percent.


                                                          18
Outcome Indicator 6: Increase in the percentage of the total budget under the results-based
budgeting framework (baseline: 2011=0 percent; target: 2014=9 percent). − Achieved

During the course of DPL series, the Government made important strides to strengthen the
results-orientation of the budget. The objective of the RBB approach is to improve the links
between the planning budgeting processes by defining results indicators and linking them to
spending targets. Because the RBB implementation is a complex and long term process, the
Government is gradually implementing RBB. DPL1 supported a pilot RBB in the MOHSA, and
DPL2 supported the expansion in the coverage of RBB to other ministries. Decree No. 13-2013
mandated the adoption of a legal framework for results-based budgeting in the Ministry of
Economy and the Ministry of Sports and Culture; and the establishment of operating and
coordination mechanisms for RBB at MINFIN and MOHSA.

The implementation of the RBB approach in Guatemala helped to develop a performance
culture in the public administration. Given the political economy context in Guatemala,
improving the quality of spending―including RBB and measures to improve the targeting of
spending―is needed to forge consensus to raise revenues in the medium-term. By putting
emphasis on results, the RBB allowed to shift the focus from inputs to results and promote the role
of monitoring and evaluation systems. At the end of 2014, the percentage of the total budget under
the results-based budgeting framework increased from an initial 0 percent in 2011 to 9.5 percent.
It is important to mention that in 2014 and 2015 four Institutions of the Central Administration
formulated their budgets under the methodology of RBB, namely MINFIN, MOHSA, the Ministry
of Sports and Culture, and the Ministry of Economy.

Objective 3. Improving the Coordination and Management of Social Policies

In Improving the Coordination and Management of Social Policies, the DPL series proved
satisfactory in achieving its objectives geared towards reduction of the chronic fragmentation of
the decision making, design, implementation and M&E of social policy in Guatemala. The creation
of MIDES, the development of the national social information system, and the establishment of
the Economic and Social Council represent the main policy milestones under this pillar. The
progress in supporting the improved policy coordination in social area was satisfactory.

Outcome Indicator 7. Increase in the percentage of beneficiaries across all social programs that
are included in the Unique Beneficiary Registry (baseline: 2011=0; target: 2014=80 percent). –
Achieved

Multiple legislative and organizational improvements within MIDES have helped to
strengthen the management and coordination of social programs. With limited budgetary
resources, the emphasis of the Guatemalan government was to increase the efficiency of social
programs. In early 2012 (Decree 1-2012) the Government created the MIDES and in 2013
developed a social information system (SISO) within MIDES aimed at creating information on
social programs related to beneficiaries, geographic coverage and type of program. The SISO was
backed by a Single Beneficiary Registry (RUU) which included information on beneficiaries for
over 75 social programs.



                                                19
The improvements to the organizational structure to manage social programs have been
instrumental in achieving program’s results. The percentage of beneficiaries across all social
programs that are included in the RUU increased to 90 percent in 2014, from the baseline value of
0 percent in 2011. The RUU played a significant role in exploiting synergies across Government
agencies that deliver social programs. The RUU is accessible to, and uses information from
MINFIN, MOHSA, MIDES, as well as from the Planning Secretariat and the National Statistics
Institute, allowing for a better assessment of the effectiveness of social policies across the country.

Outcome Indicator 8. Increase in the percentage of the population in the country represented
by an active COMUSAN that is in charge of coordinating the implementation of the Zero
Hunger Pact at the local level (baseline: 2011=25 percent; target: 2014=90 percent). Achieved

The creation of Municipal Councils of Food and Nutritional Security or COMUSANES
aimed to improve the implementation of the Zero Hunger program. The COMUSANES were
created to promote the fulfillment of the objectives of nutritional security. By 2011, 120
COMUSANES had been established in prioritized municipalities with the highest chronic
malnutrition. As of 2015 there were 326 active COMUSANES, one in each Municipality, in charge
of coordinating the implementation of the Zero Hunger Pact. Hence, the percentage of the
population in the country represented by an active COMUSAN reached 100 percent in 2015 from
a baseline of 25 percent in 2011. It is worth noting that the implementation of the Zero Hunger
Pact was also supported by the pilot RBB pilot in the health sector. The introduction of RBB in
priority municipalities, selected based on nutrition indicators, has helped to improve resource
allocation to sectoral priorities given that historical budgeting tended to disproportionately affect
poorer regions and failed to take into account population increases.

Outcome Indicator 9. The Economic and Social Council (CES) holds regular meetings to
discuss public policies, and has issued consensus resolutions on policy issues in Guatemala that
have been supported by its members. – Achieved

To support the creation of consensus on public policies the DPL series supported the creation
of the Economic and Social Council (CES), which became operational in 2013. The CES was
created following a six-year dialogue between civil society and the private sector and provides a
platform to foster broad political consensus among key stakeholders. The CES is made up of eight
main representatives (and four alternates) each from the business community, cooperatives and
trade unions. A key objective of the CES is to review and propose public policies and legislative
initiatives, and raise awareness of economic and social issues. While the CES is meant as a non-
binding advisory body that reflects the productive forces of the country, by virtue of its
composition it reflects also a broad spectrum of Guatemalan society. The CES is chaired by an
elected president (with one vice-president from each of the three groups), and managed by an
executive secretary. The CES meets once per month and has a permanent commission that meets
on a weekly basis. Resolutions can only be passed if at least six representatives from each group
vote in favor, thereby preventing one group from dominating the decisions. In 2013, the CES
became part of the Latin-American Network of Social and Economic Councils. The Councils
decisions, views and opinions are published at their website, providing access to information for




                                                  20
all interested stakeholders and triggering policy debates15. Over the medium term, the CES plans
to enhance its analytical capacity to assess the economic and social impacts of public policies.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The rating of the achievement of development outcomes of DPL series is moderately satisfactory.
The overall assessment is on balance positive, both because the reform program was significant
and relevant, eight of nine indicators were achieved and one was partially achieved, and none of
the supported measures have been reversed. The main reason why it is rated moderately
satisfactory is due to the fact that the corruption scandal in tax administration that was uncovered
in 2015 represents a risk to the sustainability of the program development objectives of the DPL
series, given that the areas of tax policy and tax administration are considered to be the cornerstone
of the DPL series.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The three pillars of the DPL series are expected to have had a positive impact on poverty
reduction and social development. The first one refers to the reforms related to tax policy and
tax administration aimed at making the tax system more progressive. The impact of these reforms
is expected to affect mainly the upper decile of the income distribution and is not having a direct
impact on the poor and vulnerable. Furthermore, the measures improving the transparency of
international taxation are not expected to have impacted poverty or the distribution of income. On
the contrary, positive indirect effects might have occurred, through an improved business
environment and more employment opportunities. The second pillar of the DPL series comprises
the development of tools to improve budget management, such as the extended application of RBB
to better target social policies and social programs. The third pillar aimed at improving the
management and coordination of social policy is also expected to promote shared prosperity in
Guatemala.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Bank’s assistance to Guatemala under the DPL series supported numerous reforms
aimed at institutional strengthening across the pillars of the operation. Complementary
analytical and advisory activities under the umbrella of DPL series have had a direct impact on
institutional change. The most significant underpinnings included: the Integrated Financial
Management System (SIAF) project, technical assistance for coordinating social sector
interventions, and the implementation of the benchmarking tool IAMTAX. Furthermore, a number
of analytical products helped inform the reform agenda and supported a fruitful policy dialogue as
presented in Table 5, which provides a summary of these activities and their links to the DPL
program. The main beneficiaries of these activities were the Ministry of Public Finance, the
Ministry of Health and Social Assistance, the newly-created Ministry of Social Development, and
the Tax Administration Superintendence. As a result, the Government has (i) strengthened its
capacity to benchmark, on a regular basis, its internal tax administration systems and processes
against best international practices; (ii) improved the monitoring of income tax compliance
through the application of impact evaluation methods; (iii) introduced new budget codes to
enhance the linkages between public spending and social development outcomes as part of the
institutionalization of results-based budgeting; (iv) developed an integrated information system to
enhance the monitoring and evaluation of social assistance programs; and (v) strengthened
mechanisms to build consensus on major public policies among key business leaders and civil
society.

There were no beneficiary survey and/or stakeholder workshop.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Overall Rating: Substantial

The risk of either policy reversals or not maintaining the outcomes in the areas supported by the
DPL series is substantial.

Risks related to weak governance and limited institutional capacity for program
implementation continue to be substantial. The governance issues uncovered as a result of the
corruption scandal related to a number of high profile officials, including among the management
of SAT, have further deteriorated the limited trust in the State, as well as constrained progress on
the tax reforms and transparency agenda. The governance issues highlight the urgent need to
advance reforms in the area of tax administration and restore the integrity of SAT. The new
Government that took office in January 2016 is prioritizing governance reforms, in particular
related to strengthening tax administration. In support of these reform efforts, the World Bank, in
cooperation with the US Treasury Department and other donors has been working on a plan to
restructure SAT. The Bank team is also providing technical assistance to improve tax
administration. In other areas of the DPL program, institutional capacity risks do not compromise
the sustainability of the results, nevertheless the implementing agencies and the line ministries
continue to receive World Bank’s technical assistance and analytical and advisory products further
build and strengthen their implementation capacity.

The risk of maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment against a backdrop of shocks
in the global economy is moderate. This risk derives in part from a potential deterioration in the
external environment, in particular weaker demand in the United States and China, the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s tapering, and developments related to oil and food prices. If the macroeconomic
risks were to materialize, the limited fiscal space may prevent a countercyclical response.
Macroeconomic risks are mitigated to some extent by the implementation of prudent


                                                 23
macroeconomic policies by the Government, including planned reforms to further enhance public
financial management and improve tax administration to regain buffers to respond to external
shocks.

In the absence of increased fiscal space, there is a risk of sustaining progress in the social
sectors, particularly with regards to the reduction of chronic malnutrition. Reducing
malnutrition in Guatemala is a long standing development challenge that requires sustained
commitments from consecutive governments, and which will require a combination of reforms in
service delivery and food security, accompanied by large investments in infrastructure. Recent
information at the national level, shows that chronic malnutrition rate has decreased from 49.5
percent in 2008/09 to 46.5 percent in 2015, indicating limited progress (ENSMI 2014/15). Yet, the
Government’s decision in 2015 to cancel the Extension of Coverage Program (PEC), which
provided basic health and nutrition services through NGOs contracted by MOHSA in areas with
no MOHSA facilities, has affected at least a third of the Guatemalan population. Although the
MOHSA is expanding the use of mobile health teams to address service gaps in the areas
previously covered by the PEC, its ability to cover all the areas has been affected by resource
constraints, posing a risk to the progress made from 2012 to 2014. Recognizing this risk and the
need for more intensified efforts to significantly reduce chronic malnutrition, the new
Administration has recently launched its 2016-2020 Strategy to Reduce Chronic Malnutrition,
building on lessons learned from the implementation of the Zero Hunger program. Key
components of the strategy include: improved access to basic nutrition and health services, and
safe water and sanitation. The World Bank is providing technical assistance to support these efforts.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance during the preparation of the operation was satisfactory. The design of
the operation was appropriate, timely and responded to the country’s priorities. It built on lessons
learned from previous DPLs in Guatemala and the Bank’s experience with DPLs in middle income
countries. The priorities of the program were defined in line with the country’s priorities. The
experience of previous DPLs in Guatemala, which suffered from both internal political economy
factors and external shocks, highlighted the need to be cautious on the number of policy areas.
Thus, the operation focused on critical fiscal and social sector reforms that supported key
objectives of the Fiscal Pact and the Zero Hunger Pact. In this regard, the programmatic design
was appropriate and signaled medium-term commitment to development objectives. Furthermore,
the DPL series was underpinned by strong analytical work, technical assistance, and a frank policy
dialogue. The work was well-coordinated within the Bank’s multi-sectoral team. The operation’s
results framework established a clear mapping from PDO to prior actions to results indicators.
During the preparation of DPL2, the prior actions supported a broader reform scope relative to the
triggers originally envisioned in DPL1. Moreover, by shifting emphasis from legislative to


                                                24
administrative and implementing measures during the second operation, the operational design
insured implementation of legal reforms and helped avoid potential policy slippages.

Bank performance during appraisal was satisfactory. The Bank team monitored potential risks
very closely, bringing them to attention of the authorities and bank management, as it occurred
when the claims of unconstitutionality related to the tax reform surfaced. In addition, the Bank
team, as well as IMF and other development partners, helped the authorities identify adequate
mitigation measures in case that the risks foreseen were to materialize. The DPL series was
delivered in a timely manner and the Bank managed to flexibly adjust the program to changes in
economic and social priorities.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Ratings: Satisfactory

Bank performance in the supervision of the operation was satisfactory. In addition to regular
virtual meetings held between Bank team and the Government, the Bank conducted mid-term
reviews and supervision missions of both operations (Dec 2012, Jul 2013, Jun 2014, Feb 2015,
and Nov 2015). The planning and timing of the missions was adequate. The first one took place a
few months after the approval of DPL1 and the last one in early-2015 prior to the operation’s
closing date. The preparation of DPL2 entailed continuous dialogue with the Government and
follow-up on triggers, complementing the supervision of DPL1. The Bank’s team engaged with
the authorities not only on the implementation of the reform program as specified in the program
document, but also discussed further reforms needed for consolidating progress on fiscal and
financial management and on the management of social policies. This dialogue was supported by
ongoing technical assistance activities, which proved to be instrumental in enhancing the
authorities’ focus efforts on implementing the reform agenda. Given the excellent working
relationship between the Bank’s team and the Guatemalan counterpart’s team, the supervisory
work was undertaken efficiently and in an environment of mutual trust.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

Overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory on the basis of its overall efforts in ensuring
relevance of objectives and design; quality at entry, and on progress in supporting the Government
in the implementation of the reform agenda. DPL1 preparation began just after a new government
had taken office. The fragmented nature of Guatemala’s party system and the fact that the
Government did not have a majority in Congress (the ruling party had 62 out of 158 seats) posed
challenges to garner political support for the reform agenda. However, the fact that the series was
firmly anchored to Government’s strategic reforms helped to ensure the success of the series. The
Bank maintained high quality standards at all times in the design and implementation of DPL1 and
DPL2, providing additional support through its analytical work and technical assistance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance/Implementing Agency Performance/Overall Borrower
Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

For the purpose of this review, Government performance and implementing agency performance
are considered the same. Therefore, the above rating should be viewed as an overall rating for the
Borrower.

The Government showed strong commitment to reform and took full ownership of the
program. The Ministry of Public Finance played a consistent and effective role in monitoring
reform progress and results indicators. The Ministry of Public Finance coordinated with other
Government ministries and agencies involved in the implementation of the DPL series, including
MIDES, SAT, MOHSA, and the CES. Together with MINFIN, these institutions collected the
necessary data to assess implementation progress and reported to the Bank. During the collection
of data, the documentation received for preparation of this ICR was timely. MINFIN used the DPL
series to strengthen inter-ministerial coordination, as evidenced by the fact that the actions
supported by the DPL series were implemented as intended and almost all results indicators were
met. As noted above, the Government implemented an ambitious program of reforms, beyond the
actions supported by the operation. The authorities also engaged in consultations with key
stakeholders to ensure broad support for the program. In particular, both the Fiscal Pact and the
Zero Hunger Pact underwent extensive dialogue with civil society as part of Guatemala’s
increasing focus on social sectors following the 1996 Peace Accords. In this vein, the creation of
the CES, supported by this DPL series, helped to institutionalize a process of regular consultations
among the Government, business leaders, and civil society. The Government worked closely with
the Bank team over the life-cycle of the DPL series, and the public entities involved were attentive
to the agreed actions for each loan.

Nonetheless, governance issues raised concerns about policy performance. The government’s
performance is assessed as moderately satisfactory given the governance challenges discussed
above, which affected tax collection and posed risks to the sustainability of the tax administration
reform program.


6. Lessons Learned
Guatemala remains a difficult implementation environment for reforms and requires simple
project design. Historically, the portfolio of loans has suffered due to delays in Congressional
approval, changes in Government priorities following political transitions, high rates of turnover
of technical personnel, and a low capacity for implementation. The Bank worked closely with the
Government to ensure a simple design and implementation arrangements of the reforms supported
by the DPL series, focusing on critical policy areas, and providing technical assistance to build
capacity. The narrow focus of the DPL was a positive design feature. By joining forces with other




                                                26
development partners in a systematic manner, particularly on tax policy given that previous reform
efforts had been reverted, the Government was able to ensure adequate program implementation.

Extensive consultations in a politically polarized environment were essential to the successful
program implementation. As noted above, the supported tax reforms were politically sensitive
and subject to claims of unconstitutionality, but contrary to the historical precedent, the overall
reform was kept in place. One aspect that ensured that the tax reform was sustained was the
extensive consultations on the content of the reform. Hence, even though the tax legislation
package of 2012 was challenged in the Constitutional Court, and a small number of articles were
modified, the technical structure of the tax reform was kept in place.

Strong analytical underpinnings and technical assistance can ensure an adequate program
implementation. The DPL series was grounded in prior strong analytical groundwork, which, in
turn, provided the necessary rationale for selection of policy and program reform areas.
