                    IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
       ENHANCED FISCAL AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT FOR GREATER
              OPPORTUNITIES DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                   TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA

                   I.   INTRODUCTION AND COUNTRY CONTEXT

1.     This program document proposes a Second Development Policy Loan (DPL) in the
amount of US$340 million to the Republic of Guatemala. The proposed operation is the
second in a series of two single-tranche operations, the first of which was approved in September
2012. This DPL series is informed by the lessons learned in previous World Bank operations and
supports the Government to (i) strengthen tax administration and tax policy; (ii) strengthen
budget management and increase the results orientation of public spending; and (iii) improve the
management and coordination of social policies.

2.      Guatemala is the largest economy in Central America. Guatemala’s GDP is about
US$53 billion (2013) and its per-capita gross national income (GNI) is US$4,880 (2012). It has a
multiethnic population of about 15 million. The country is known for the implementation of
prudent macroeconomic policies. Between 2001 and 2013, annual GDP growth was comparable
to the LAC average at 3.3 percent (the LAC average was 3.4 percent for that period), however
less volatile than the regional average. Democratic institutions are now well established
following a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996. Despite progress, however, persistent economic
and social challenges have affected the population’s trust in the Government’s capacity to
eradicate poverty and boost shared prosperity.

3.      Sustaining progress in poverty reduction is an ongoing challenge. Guatemala reduced
its poverty headcount rate between 2000 and 2006 from 56.2 percent to 51 percent, according to
the Government’s methodology to measure poverty. Extreme poverty decreased modestly from
15.7 percent to 15.2 percent over the same period. However, in the wake of the global financial
crisis, poverty rates increased. The latest household survey indicates that the poverty rate
increased from 51 percent in 2006 to 53.7 percent in 2011, although extreme poverty did
decrease during this period from 15.2 percent to 13.3 percent. Geographically, poverty is
disproportionately concentrated in rural areas and amongst the indigenous population. Despite
marginal increases in poverty, inequality improved slightly between 2006 and 2011, explained
by modest reduction in extreme poverty and improvements in the middle class income.

4.     Shared prosperity developments and social indicators remain weak compared to
other middle-income countries. In LAC, the mean real per capita income of the bottom 40
percent of the population during the last decade (2003-2012) increased by around 5 percent. In
Guatemala, however, the mean real per capita income of the bottom 40 percent did not improve
during the last decade (2000-2011). Lack of progress in shared prosperity in Guatemala is
associated to the modest, and often unequal, coverage of basic goods and services, which is due
to the low public revenue collection and limited effectiveness and efficacy of public
expenditures. The limited ability of the State to provide sufficient and quality basic public goods
and services hinders economic opportunities, particularly for the most vulnerable. This is
evidenced by Guatemala’s low Human Opportunity Index (which measures the degree of equity
in the access to basic goods and services), which is among the lowest in LAC. In addition,

                                                1
 
Guatemala’s level of chronic malnutrition remains among the worst in the world, with about half
of all the children suffering from malnutrition. Nonetheless, the country has achieved some
progress during the last decade on social indicators. Rates of primary school enrollment (general
population and for girls) increased by 12 and 15 percentage points, respectively, during 2000-
2010. During the same period, rates of childhood mortality declined from 49 to 32 per thousand.
The Government plans to undertake a new household survey in 2014 to overcome data
limitations that currently restrict the ability to evaluate recent progress in poverty reduction and
shared prosperity.

5.     Since taking office in January 2012, the Government has sought to address these
development challenges by improving the progressivity of revenues and expenditures,
including the approval of a comprehensive tax reform and measures to improve the quality
of spending and a more coordinated formulation of social policies. As described in this
program document, the tax reform approved in 2012 represents the first comprehensive tax
reform in over 20 years, and is expected to expand the Government’s revenue base by
simplifying taxes, as well as enhancing tax administration, controls, and transparency. To date,
tax revenues as a share of GDP have risen by about 0.5 percentage points relative to the average
of the previous three years. Improvements in revenue collection have been modest, but
meaningful. Furthermore, the reform has improved progressivity and in its absence, tax revenues
would have declined. In addition, the tax reform withstood legal challenges, unlike previous
reform efforts which had been rolled-back. Moreover in November 2013, to support the tax
reform, the Government approved a comprehensive reform package aimed at improving public
financial and debt management, internal and external audit systems, and tax administration. The
Government of Guatemala is also promoting progressivity by improving the quality of spending.
The Government is introducing results-based budgeting (RBB), first through a pilot program in
the health sector and now expanding RBB to all ministries. To better target social policies, the
Government is implementing a flagship “Zero Hunger” Program, strengthening monitoring and
evaluation systems for social programs, and promoting multi-sectoral policy consensus through
the recently-created Economic and Social Council (Consejo Económico y Social, CES).1 These
reforms are expected to benefit poor and vulnerable groups.

6.     Despite the peaceful 2012 transition, politics remain polarized and continue to pose
a challenge to further advancing the reform agenda. The absence of a simple majority in
Congress (the ruling party has 56 out of 158 seats) and the fragmented nature of Guatemala’s
party system pose challenges for garnering political support for the continuation of the
administration’s reform agenda. A complex political economy environment in the past has
impacted the timely approval of legislation as well as new Government borrowing. For instance,
Congress did not approve the 2014 Budget and as a result, the 2013 Budget was automatically
renewed.2 Given the political economy context in Guatemala, improving the quality of
spending―including RBB and measures to improve the targeting of spending―is needed to
forge consensus to raise revenues in the medium-term.

 The CES is made up of representatives from the business sector, cooperatives, and trade unions.

  The budget is published promptly after its approval in the official gazette, and can be downloaded from the
Ministry of Finance’s webpage (http://www.minfin.gob.gt/presupaprobado/presupaprobados.html). The 2013 budget
has been amended for 2014 for a total of US$8,699 million.

                                                               2
 
7.      Notwithstanding the challenging policy environment, important inroads have been
made, signaling the consolidation of reforms necessary for meeting critical development
challenges. Revenue collection has been weakened by poor performance in customs, causing
fiscal space to grow less than projected. To better understand this phenomenon, the Government
of Guatemala has requested World Bank support for complementary analytical and advisory
activities for tax and customs administration. Moreover, in the context of a limited fiscal
envelope, the Government has continued to emphasize social spending by amending the budget
for 2014 to include an additional US$195 million for education and health, thus helping to
maintain focus on the priority of reducing chronic childhood malnutrition.

8.      This programmatic DPL series of Enhanced Fiscal and Financial Management for
Greater Opportunities has supported this reform program, and the proposed Second DPL
is fully consistent with the World Bank Group’s objectives of reducing poverty and
spreading shared prosperity. The proposed operation complements efforts of other
development partners, and builds on lessons learned and progress achieved under previous
World Bank operations. It helps consolidate a set of cross-sectorial policies intended to support a
more efficient delivery of quality public services. At the same time, this operation aims to
establish a foundation for progress in the medium- to long-term. In particular, new initiatives
include enhancements to the organizational structure of the Tax Administration Superintendence
(Superintendencia de la Administración Tributaria, SAT), the creation of a Department of
International Taxation within the Ministry of Finance (Ministerio de Finanzas Públicas,
MINFIN), and mandating the use of the Single Treasury Account and the Integrated Financial
Management System (SIAF) for all budgetary transactions, thereby increasing the transparency
and monitoring of public spending. In addition, to enhance its policy dialogue, the World Bank
Group is engaged in a series of analytical and advisory activities in support of envisaged reforms
in this DPL in the areas of economic governance, poverty and equity monitoring, and
competitiveness.

                  II.   MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

9.      Economic growth in Guatemala has historically been stable but modest. Between
2001 and 2007 GDP growth averaged 4.1 percent. Although the country was negatively affected
by the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, it avoided falling into a recession. Since then its
growth rate has increased and growth volatility was below the regional average, despite the
occurrence of natural disasters in 2010. The country grew by 2.9 percent in 2010 and accelerated
to 4.2 percent in 2011, driven by rising remittances and consumption. In 2012 growth
decelerated to 3.0 percent due to a sluggish recovery of the United States and a deteriorating
security situation in Guatemala. Overall, much of Guatemala’s relative economic stability can be
attributed to prudent macroeconomic policies that have kept inflation and public debt
manageable, and thanks to a relatively more diverse export base which has helped cushion the
impact of terms of trade shocks.

10.    Economic activity improved in 2013 and the underemployment rate fell. GDP growth
increased to 3.5 percent in 2013. All sectors with the exception of mining (which has a low share
of the productive structure) showed positive results. Agriculture, manufacturing, and services

                                                3
 
were the key drivers of growth, contributing to three-quarters of GDP growth. Growth in 2013
was also fuelled by a steady rise in remittances and a pick-up in investors’ confidence. The
combination of these factors translated into slightly better employment opportunities, with the
underemployment rate falling to 69.2 percent in 2013 from 74.5 percent in 2012.

11.     Inflation inched up in 2013 due to food commodity supply shocks but remained
within the Central Bank target of 3-5 percent. Inflation increased from 3.4 percent in 2012 to
4.4 percent in 2013 mainly driven by increases in food prices. Monetary authorities retained a
prudent policy stance, raising interest rates by 25 basis points in April 2013 in response to food
supply shocks, before cutting rates by 25 basis points in November 2013 and again by 25 basis
points in March 2014 as food price pressures receded.

12.     The current account balance deteriorated in 2013 due to supply-side shocks but it
remains within the average for LAC. Guatemala’s current account deficit widened from 2.6
percent of GDP in 2012 to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2013. The widening is explained by a larger
trade deficit which increased from 11.4 percent of GDP in 2012 to 12.1 percent of GDP in 2013,
and reflects a widening of the private saving-investment gap. Notably, the trade balance

                                                                 4
 
deteriorated as a result of a fall in coffee exports, which was due to both a reduction in coffee
prices, down 50 percent from their peak in 2011, and the coffee rust—a parasitic fungus
affecting coffee plants—that affected Central America.

13.    Remittances grew strongly in 2013 in line with improved economic activity in the
United States. Guatemalan remittances did not decline as much during the global crisis in 2007-
2009 compared to other Central American countries because most Guatemalan workers in the
United States are employed in agriculture and services, rather than construction. The hispanic
unemployment rate in the United States decreased from 12.5 percent in 2010 to 9.2 percent in
2013. As a result, remittances to Guatemala rose from 9.2 percent of GDP in 2011 to 9.8 percent
of GDP in 2013.

14.    Building on its recent reform momentum (the country was one of the top 10
reformers worldwide in the 2014 Doing Business ranking), Guatemala could benefit from
an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI). Compared to the rest of Central America, FDI
in Guatemala is low (around 2 percent of GDP), and an increase in FDI could encourage further
investment to stimulate economic growth. Continuing the implementation of the reform agenda
to reduce the costs of doing business, including further strengthening legal institutions to support
corporate governance and insolvency regimes, would help promote investment.

15.    Guatemala has been successful in maintaining fiscal stability despite exogenous
shocks, and public debt as a share of GDP remains low at around 25 percent (Table 2). In
2013, the overall fiscal deficit decreased slightly to 2.1 percent of GDP, down from 2.4 percent
of GDP in 2012, continuing a four-year downward path. Yet, this fiscal consolidation was mostly
due to cuts on the expenditure side since there has not been a substantial increase in revenues.
Indeed, tax revenues continue to be the lowest in Central America. Tax revenues dropped
dramatically during the crisis to 10.3 percent of GDP in 2009, and as of 2013 (11 percent of
GDP), they have not yet recovered to pre-crisis levels (12.1 percent of GDP in 2007).

16.    In order to increase tax collection, in 2012 the Guatemalan Government launched a
comprehensive tax reform, which represented a major milestone, since previous reforms
had been reversed. The tax reform, which comprised two tax laws, the “Ley de Actualización
Tributaria” and the “Ley Antievasión II”, took full effect in 2013. It aimed to modernize income
tax collection by increasing its tax base and eliminating tax exemptions through control of
deductions and elimination of payroll tax credit. Furthermore, it eliminated several Value Added
Tax (VAT) exemptions and strengthened tax administration efforts.

17.      While the goal of the tax reform to increase tax revenues by 1 percentage point was
not achieved, the main component of revenues covered by the reform (income tax)
increased by more than 20 percent in 2013. The reform, which focused on the income tax, was
initially expected to raise tax revenues by around 1 percentage point of GDP, from 10.9 percent
of GDP in 2012 to 11.8 percent in 2013, as foreseen in the 2013 Budget. However, tax revenues
only increased by 0.1 percent of GDP in 2013 to 11 percent of GDP. It is worth noting that in
2013, when the income tax reform took full effect, income tax revenues grew by more than 20
percent (compared to 5 percent in 2012). As a share of GDP, income taxes grew from 2.7 percent
of GDP in 2012 to 3 percent in 2013.

18.      However, the strong growth in income tax collection was offset by a significant
slowdown in VAT collection on imported goods. The growth rate of the VAT collection on
imported goods (the largest tax item, representing 3.2 percent of GDP) slowed down
significantly in 2013 relative to previous years. The VAT on imported goods grew by 0.2 percent
in 2013, compared to 5.2 percent in 2012. There are a number of factors behind its slowdown.
First, in 2013, customs controls were affected by institutional problems inside the SAT, which
included massive layoffs and changes in management. As a result, weaker customs capacity
likely allowed for greater tax evasion. Furthermore, these institutional problems were
compounded by a significant slowdown in 2013 of the growth in the value of imports that are
subject to taxes, which meant that VAT collection on imports remained broadly unchanged in
nominal terms relative to the previous year. In the medium-term, the value of the VAT on
imported goods is projected to recover, but not significantly enough to result in an increase as a
share of GDP In the longer term, the ratio may increase in line with continuous efforts to build
capacity in tax and customs administration (a key objective of this DPL series, as further
elaborated below).

19.      Public investment fell in 2013 as a result of lower-than-anticipated revenues.
Current expenditures increased in 2013 from 10.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 10.9 percent in
2013, mainly due to a rise in wages. Also, there were increases in transfers and expenditure in
goods and services, which also contributed to the rise in current expenditures. On the other hand,
capital expenditures were reduced from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2012 to 3 percent in 2013.

                                                                 6
 
20.     The Government continued to fund its deficit by combining bond issuances and
loans from multilateral agencies. The Guatemalan Government has been meeting its financing
needs predominately with multilateral loans and bond issuances. For the past three years the
composition of debt has relied more on bond issuances and less on multilateral loans. For
instance, in 2010 bond issuances represented about 50 percent of total borrowing, while
multilateral loans represent about 40 percent. As of end-2013 these ratios changed to 60 percent
(bonds) and 37 percent (multilateral loans). Guatemala has been able to access international
markets at lower rates than other Central American peers.

21.     The financial system is relatively sound, contributing to macroeconomic stability. As
noted in a joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Performance Assessment (FSAP) conducted
in March 2014, Guatemalan banks are well capitalized as a result of macroeconomic stability,
improvements in regulations and enhancements in risk-based supervisory practices. However,
efforts are still needed to strengthen precautionary buffers, improve the oversight of financial
conglomerates and address risks arising from the operations of offshore banks, formalize and
consolidate financial cooperatives and improve the terms and features of loans to medium and
small sized companies and low income-households.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

22.     The Guatemalan economy is projected to continue growing at a moderate level
during 2014-2016, sustained by private consumption and a slight increase in investment.
Private consumption is expected to remain the main driver of economic growth, supported by
steady growth in remittances. Both rising public and private investment are expected to boost
domestic demand. Similar levels of imports to those experienced in 2012 and 2013 are projected
to continue in following years. As the United States economy recovers, and exports and private
investment rises, the country is expected to continue to grow around 3.5 percent, mainly due to
persistent structural constraints such as the country’s weak fiscal intake, low investment, and
high levels of labor informality. Inflation is expected to remain under the Central Bank’s target
of 3-5 percent.

23.     Guatemala fiscal deficit is projected to stabilize at around 2 percent of GDP during
2014-2016. A slight increase in tax revenues is foreseen from 11 percent of GDP in 2013 to 11.2
percent of GDP in 2016, as well as a slight increase in current expenditures due to an increase in
interest payments.

24.     Central Government debt as a share of GDP is projected to remain low (Table 3).
Guatemala’s debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to increase from 24.9 percent in 2013 to 27.7 percent
of GDP by 2016. External debt is projected to remain at around 13 percent of GDP while
domestic debt is expected to increase from 11.8 percent of GDP in 2013 to 14.5 percent in 2016,
due to a rise in bond issuances in the domestic market. About 60 percent of Central Government
debt is denominated in foreign currency and this poses certain risks in the case of sharp
depreciation of the quetzal. A slight increase in interest payments is projected, as advanced
economies are foreseen to recover gradually and thus accessing international markets may not
yield the favorable rates seen in previous years.

25.     Under conservative assumptions, Guatemala’s public debt will remain sustainable
in the medium term. The most recent IMF debt sustainability analysis (DSA) undertaken in
August 2013 as part of the Article IV Consultation notes that while public debt has been rising
since 2008, it remains at low levels. Over the next 30 years, assuming that revenue intake
remains broadly unchanged, the DSA projects that Guatemala’s debt-to-GDP ratio would rise at
a gradual pace but remain below 40 percent of GDP. Under a number of alternative scenarios,
debt sustainability is the most sensitive to a large depreciation in the quetzal or to a shock
stemming from contingent liabilities. Given the relatively low level of public debt and the
prudent fiscal stance, the DSA projects that the macroeconomic framework will remain adequate
even under a scenario in which fiscal revenues remain at current levels. It is worth mentioning,
however, that the Government’s ability to implement counter-cyclical fiscal policies is limited
due to the low revenue intake and the fact that interest payments as a percent of total revenues
are projected to increase from around 13 percent in 2013 to around 14.5 percent in 2016.

26.    Guatemala’s current account deficit is projected to remain below the world average
at around 3.3 percent of GDP during 2014-2016. The trade deficit will remain stable at around
12 percent of GDP. FDI is also projected to remain stable at around 2 percent of GDP.

27.     Guatemala’s macroeconomic framework is deemed adequate for development
policy lending, notwithstanding the mentioned risks from external factors. The 2014-2016
macroeconomic framework is expected to support economic growth in line with potential GDP.
Inflation is expected to be contained and fiscal policy is expected to remain prudent. The current
account deficit is projected to be largely financed through FDI, and the remaining financing
needs are expected to be easily met during the forecast period.

                        III.      THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

28.     The Government’s program is built around five strategic pillars: (1) democratic
security and justice; (2) competitive economic development; (3) productive and social
infrastructure for development; (4) social inclusion; and (5) sustainable rural development. Since
taking office, the Government has announced three strategic pacts to support the implementation
of the five pillars: (i) a Fiscal Pact, including tax reforms as well as measures to improve the

                                                            8
 
transparency and quality of public expenditure; (ii) a Zero Hunger Pact3 to reduce chronic
malnutrition, emphasizing the first 1,000 days of life; and (iii) a Security, Justice, and Peace Pact
to tackle the high rates of crime and violence. These pacts aim to strengthen the relevant
institutions and improve inter-ministerial coordination at the central and local levels.

29.    The Fiscal Pact comprises a set of measures to improve revenue collections, raise
transparency, and improve the quality of public spending. An intensive consensus building
process preceded these measures, which enabled the Government to adopt the tax reforms in
2012, followed by the approval of a reform package in November 2013, which included a
Budget Reform, a reform of the Organic Law for the Tax Administration Superintendence,
reforms to the Comptroller General of Accounts, and a new Law on Illicit Enrichment. The
reforms are anticipated to strengthen governance in Guatemala’s and support economic growth.

30.     The Zero Hunger Pact is aimed at helping achieve sustainable food and nutrition
security in the long term. The Pact aims to (i) achieve a 10 percentage point reduction in
chronic malnutrition in children under five years of age; (ii) reduce the mortality rate related to
acute malnutrition in children under five years of age; and (iii) combat hunger and promote food
and nutrition security amongst the most vulnerable members of the population (rural areas and
marginalized urban areas of the country). The Pact is embedded within the National Strategic
Plan for Food Security and Nutrition and is designed to ensure participation across all sectors in
the fight against cyclical, structural, and behavioral causes perpetuating chronic malnutrition.

31.     To improve strategic planning of investment, the Government is preparing the first
National Development Plan for Guatemala. Led by the Planning Secretariat (SEGEPLAN),
this effort culminates a planning process carried out over the last five years, beginning with
municipal, departmental, and regional development plans, and which now includes a national
level planning exercise. The Plan de Desarrollo K’atun was initiated in 2013 and once
completed it will layout the strategic development areas for the country until 2032. The strategic
areas of the plan are expected to be formulated in 2014, and this strategy will inform the 2015
and 2016 budgets.

                                                  IV.          THE PROPOSED OPERATION

LINK TO GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND OPERATION DESCRIPTION

32.     The proposed DPL supports the Government’s program on revenue mobilization,
transparency, efficiency of spending, and coordination of social policies. Specifically, it aims
to (i) strengthen tax administration and tax policy; (ii) strengthen budget management and
increase the results orientation of public spending; and (iii) improve the management and
coordination of social policies.

  Zero Hunger is a multi-sectoral program that aims to coordinate various interrelated policy interventions (e.g.
training, counseling women and caregivers, health and nutrition services, including growth monitoring, food
fortification, microcredit, water and sanitation and promotion of healthy households or “hogares saludables”) all of
which contribute to reducing malnutrition. The program emphasizes the first 1,000 days of life (targeting women
and young children less than 2 years of age). The SESAN coordinates the Zero Hunger Program, with the support of
several ministries, including the Ministries of Social Development; Health; Education, Agriculture; Communication;
Infrastructure and Housing, as well as the private sector and civil society organizations.

                                                                        9
 
33.     The program supported by DPL2 is stronger than that originally envisioned in
DPL1. The six triggers were converted into prior actions and four of them were deepened,
reflecting a steady reform progress. Furthermore, a new prior action has been added which
supports a substantive reform package including measures to enhance the Organic Budget Law,
the Organic Law for the Tax Administration Superintendence, and the Organic Law for the
Comptroller General of Accounts. Regarding quality of spending and coordination of social
policies, the authorities are aware that improving the results orientation of the budget is a long-
term reform process that will require political support from consecutive governments, and
important measures were taken to maintain the reform momentum, including (i) expanding the
legal framework for Results-Based Budgeting to the entire central government; and (ii)
improving monitoring and evaluation systems for social programs.

34.     DPL outcome indicators have been updated to enhance the monitoring and
evaluation framework, and to reflect changes in the program (e.g., additional reforms) as
well as varying reform speed. In particular, the indicator concerning tax collection has been
modified, from total tax collection (as a percent of GDP) to income tax collection. As Guatemala
is a country that historically has relied heavily on indirect taxes such as VAT rather than more
direct taxes such as income tax, the selection of the income tax indicator represents the need to
measure progress both in terms of revenue mobilization and in terms of the progressivity of the
tax system, which will be important for increasing shared prosperity. In terms of social
indicators, these have been updated to reflect lessons learned from the first year of
implementation of RBB. Notably, the DPL2 policy matrix includes baseline values for these
indicators, which were not available when DPL1 was prepared.

35.    The design of the proposed operation builds on lessons learned from previous DPLs
in Guatemala and the World Bank’s experience with other middle-income countries (see
Box 1). The experience of the previous DPL series, which suffered from both internal political
economy factors and external shocks, highlights the need to be conservative while at the same
time consolidate positive outcomes from Government’s reform efforts and long-term
engagement with the country, specifically on fiscal and social sector issues. Additional relevant
lessons include (i) the importance of ownership of the reform program demonstrated by the non-
reversal of the fiscal reform despite claims of unconstitutionality; and (ii) strong analytical
underpinnings and links to complementary World Bank investment lending and Analytical and
Advisory Activities, including the Integrated Financial Management System (Sistema Integrado
de Administración Financiera – SIAF) project, technical assistance for coordinating social sector
interventions, and the recent implementation of benchmark analysis IAMTAX (Integrated
Assessment Model for Tax Administration). The program was initiated and developed by the
administration, with technical input from the World Bank. Furthermore, key Analytical and
Advisory Activities helped inform the reform efforts of Government and supported a fruitful
policy dialogue.

                      Box 1: Context of Development Policy Loans in Guatemala

Since the global financial crisis the World Bank has been actively engaged with the Guatemalan
authorities with the goal of enhancing the country’s economic fundamentals. Fiscal performance and its
social spending have targeted relevant areas aligned with this DPL’s policy objectives.

In 2009, a DPL programmatic series aimed at enhancing Guatemalan fiscal and institutional capacity was
initiated. The series covered the 2008-2011 period and consisted of three separate operations. The series
sought to support the Government’s development plan by enhancing capacity for increased public
spending in priority sectors and improving public expenditure transparency and management. Within the
context of enhancing economic fundamentals, the series monitored the fiscal deficit, ensuring that it did
not rise above 3 percent of GDP on average for the 2008-2011 period. This objective was achieved,
partially because the Government was conservative and cutback on investment by making adjustments in
line with tax revenues. Regarding tax collection, the DPL series’ sought to ensure that it did not fall below
11 percent of GDP in the 2008-2011 period. As Guatemala was hit hard by the global financial crisis,
there was a small deviation in the outcome indicator of tax revenues and the target was not met. On the
social side, the DPL series also aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of conditional cash transfer
(CCT) programs through the enhancement of monitoring and evaluation of program design and its
outcomes. This was achieved by verifying CCT beneficiaries (half of whom lived in extreme poverty)
with a new framework for monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, the transparency of targeting of social
programs was improved and public financial management was strengthened by the introduction of RBB.

While the country was able to maintain macroeconomic stability during 2008-2011, the impact of
previous DPLs was limited in terms of expanding fiscal space, given the difficult economic environment
the country faced. External conditions were not favorable and the Government implemented a mild anti-
cyclical fiscal policy to face the crisis. In order to protect social spending, public investment was reduced
and the composition of public spending was shifted towards consumption. The initial DPL series that
covered the 2008-2011 period supported a tax reform that was not passed due to internal complications
within the country, and the original tax revenue targets had to be reduced.

The present DPL series (initiated in 2012 and culminating with the present 2014 DPL) is motivated by the
tax reform passed in 2012 and closely monitors its performance and outcomes. It also continues to
support progress achieved in terms of enhancing transparency and governance by strengthening public
financial management, including RBB, and improving the management and coordination of social
policies, including enhancements in monitoring and evaluation systems.

PRIOR ACTIONS, RESULTS AND ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

Operation Pillar 1: Strengthening Tax Administration and Tax Policy

36.     This pillar supports the package of tax reforms approved in 2012, the progress
made to improve transparency on international taxation and the reinforcement of
accountability of public financial management and tax administration. The tax reforms are
expected to improve tax collections and lead to greater international cooperation on taxation. A
recently approved law is expected to improve transparency of public financial management and
the tax collecting agency.

                                                               Legislative Decree No. 14, 2013, including: (a) a definition on

The Government has: (i) signed an                              Prior Action 3: To increase transparency and exchange of
additional five Tax Information Sharing                        information on international taxation, the Borrower has: (a) signed

                                                               26-2014.

37.    Guatemala has the lowest government revenues in the world relative to the size of
the economy, mainly due to low tax collection. The total revenue of the central government is
around 12 percent of GDP, of which around 11 percent of GDP is tax revenues.4 Guatemala’s
tax-to-GDP ratio compares poorly to the Central American average of 13.5 percent and to the
LAC average of 17 percent. While other countries with low tax-to-GDP ratios have significant
non-tax revenue resources, Guatemala does not. As a result, general government revenues have
been below 13 percent. Low revenues limit the capacity of the State to provide adequate basic
public goods and services.

38.     The tax reform supported by DPL1 represented the first comprehensive tax policy
reform approved in many years. As part of its Fiscal Pact, the Government pushed through an
important package of tax reform, including the Antievasión II Law, which introduced a number
of measures strengthening tax administration; and (ii) the Actualización Tributaria Law, which
made important changes to the tax rates, tax bases and other aspects of the existing system. Both
laws are fundamentally based on the proposals developed by a non-partisan group of economists
in 2008 (Grupo Promotor del Diálogo Fiscal), representing broad-based consensus. While the
direct revenue impact of the reforms has been modest so far, the reforms are an important step in

    World Bank staff estimates that the structural tax-to-GDP ratio for Guatemala is around 10.4 percent.

                                                                        12
 
promoting progressive tax policy and strengthening the tax administration, which will reinforce
the system in the long run.

39.    It is worth noting that prior to the 2012 tax reform, only piecemeal fiscal reforms
and temporary taxes had been passed, causing very little impact. Notably, previous fiscal
reforms in Guatemala were challenged in the Constitutional Court and subsequently reversed.
Temporary taxes were passed, but they either expired quickly or were rolled back at the end of
the presidential mandate. This cycle of temporary taxes has been exacerbated by sector-specific
laws amplifying exceptions and weakening progressivity.

40.     Similar to previous reforms, the tax reform supported by DPL1 was subject to
claims of unconstitutionality, but contrary to the historical precedent, the overall reform
was kept in place. As most articles of the tax reform became effective in January 2013, some
groups representing specific interests put forward claims demanding the suspension of specific
articles of the reform. In summary, one of every three articles was challenged by claims of
unconstitutionality (68 articles out of 258 articles that comprise both tax reform laws), of which
only 9 were amended by the Constitutional Court.None of the amended articles affected the
technical structure of the tax reform. One aspect of the reform that was amended (by the
Executive) was the reform to the tax on the circulation of motor vehicles, which represents about
0.2 percent of GDP.5 As noted in the poverty and social impact assessment (PSIA) below,
overcoming these legal challenges and the full implementation of these policies sets a foundation
for long-term improvements in shared prosperity.

41.     At the time that DPL1 was prepared, the proposed measures were expected to yield
an increase in tax revenues equivalent to about 1 percentage point of GDP. However, as
noted in the program document of DPL1, tax revenues are affected by many factors beyond
policy. Hence the attribution of changes in this result indicator to the policies being supported in
this operation was necessarily imperfect.

42.    An analysis of the estimated revenue impact of the tax reform identified that the
bulk of the increase would come from direct taxes (over two-thirds of the estimated
increase can be attributed to the effect of the income tax reform). This estimate represents
a substantial shift as Guatemala’s tax system relies heavily on indirect taxes6, especially the
value added tax (VAT), which suggests a regressive tax structure. This DPL series supports a
more equitable tax system through the widening of the tax base subject to income tax, a
reduction of tax exemptions and a simplification of the tax rates for salaried workers.

43.     In 2013, the impact of the tax reform represented a small, but positive change in
increasing the progressivity of the tax system in the long run. The tax collection of 2013
shows an increase in the weight of direct taxes of 10 percent in comparison to 2012 and an
increase of over 20 percent compared to a decade ago. While the magnitude of the impact of the
tax reform may be modest, the shift toward greater progressivity in taxation demonstrates the
consolidation of reforms and strengthening of the tax system. Also, in 2012 Guatemala made

  Although the inclusion in the Actualización Tributaria Law envisaged a doubling of the tax on the circulation of
motor vehicles (ISCV), the June 2013 Congress Decree 1-2013 granted a 50 percent discount on this tax.

  Income tax revenues remain hampered by low tax bases, evasion and economic informality.

                                                               13
 
paying taxes easier for companies by introducing a new electronic filing and payment system
called “Declaraguate” (https://declaraguate.sat.gob.gt).

44.   With support from DPL2, the Government adopted necessary regulations for
implementing the tax reform. The Government issued regulations for the income tax reform;
the VAT reform; and the tax reform on the first registration of motor vehicles.

45.     The adopted regulations of the new Income Tax (Agreement No. 213-2013) support
a more progressive tax system. Taxes will be charged based on the source of income levied by
companies or individuals, that is, depending on whether they are the result of labor, profit
activities or capital and profits. The regulations came into effect in May 2013 and specify several
issues that are not clearly indicated in the law. For instance, they clarify the simplification of the
regime applicable to salaried employees in order to increase the complying tax base and lower
the possibility of obtaining a return of VAT based on invoices. For the first time, the reform
incorporates the charge of dividends as capital income, among other things.7

46.      The adopted regulations for the VAT (Agreement No. 5-2013) introduce additional
requirements in order to reduce tax evasion and improve tax collection. The regulations
facilitate the application of the special invoice for exports. VAT and income tax are directly
withheld from the producer, avoiding reporting failure and tax evasion by intermediaries. The
regulations also include the requirements that small taxpayers must meet regarding their invoices
and states that the SAT will publish a list of withholding VAT agents in order to clarify whether
taxpayers have an obligation to retain VAT or not.

47.     The adoption of the regulation for the new tax on Motor Vehicles First Registration
IPRIMA (Agreement No 133-2012), replaced import tariffs and is expected to make
revenues more stable over the medium-term. This law abolishes the discretion of the customs
staff by clearly defining the basis on which the tax is to be calculated. A table for determining
the tax for vehicles will be issued by the SAT based on market values. Before, the value taxed
was based on the billing price the importer presented, which wassignificantly lower than the real
market value of the cars.

48.     Furthermore, in November 2013 the Organic Law of the SAT was amended
(Legislative Decree 13-2013) to enhance its organizational structure. This law replaces a 15-
year old law and includes procedures for the renewal of its Board of Directors. Since the creation
of the SAT in 1998, there have not been mechanisms for the renewal or rotation of its Board of
Directors, which diminishes the dynamism of the decision-making process, particularly with
regards to tax administration. The new law contains an important change to the selection of the
Board of Directors in line with international practices.

49.    In November 2013, to improve customs administration, Guatemala adopted a
National Customs Law (Legislative Decree 14-2013), which aligned its Customs Code to the
Central American standard. With the approval of the Antievasión II Law, the Government had
aligned its legislation on customs sanctions to the Uniform Central American Customs Code
                                                            
7
 It also includes items relating to international income, raises the rate of the simplified tax regime to 7 percent and
decreases the rate for the general regime to 25 percent.

                                                               14
 
(CAUCA). The respective regulation (RECAUCA) was also issued by the Government, but prior
to the approval of the National Customs Law it these could not be implemented because it
needed to be validated in the local legal framework. The National Customs Law validates the
implementation of the RECAUCA, fully aligning Guatemala’s Customs Code to the CAUCA,
and also strengthening and simplifying the sanctions system. The National Customs Law
includes the definition of customs infringements and related sanctions, the regulation of
suspension and cancellation of customs licenses and procedures against fraud and contraband.

50.     Guatemala also enhanced transparency related to international taxation by signing
an additional tax information exchange agreement with Australia, and joining the OECD
Multilateral Convention of Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. On May 15,
2012, the Minister of Finance signed tax information exchange agreements with Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. Under these agreements,
the signatory parties committed to providing information that could be relevant for the control of
taxpayer obligations in the other party’s jurisdiction. In September 26, 2013, an additional
bilateral agreement of exchange of information was signed with Australia. Furthermore,
Guatemala has advanced the implementation of information exchange agreements with Costa
Rica. Finally, since December 2012, Guatemala is part of the OECD Multilateral Convention on
Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, based on which, as of end-2013, the country is
able to exchange information with more than 60 signatory countries upon request. Despite being
able to exchange information with these countries, ratification of the Convention by Congress is
necessary to use the information for legal taxation matters. This prior action aims to enhance
transparency related to international taxation. When the DPL was designed, Guatemala was on
the OECD ‘grey list’ of countries that had not yet implemented internationally recognized tax
standards. Following the signing of the Multilateral Convention, Guatemala was taken off the
OECD ‘grey list’.

51.     Additionally, in 2014 the Government created the Department of International
Taxation inside the Ministry of Public Finance to facilitate information exchange related to
international taxation. This department is responsible for generating the statistical information
at a global level for conducting comparative studies with countries of interest to Guatemala. It
also analyzes the exchange of information agreements and international conventions.

Operation Pillar 2: Enhancing Budget Management and Increasing the Results Orientation of
Public Spending

52.     A second component of the Government’s fiscal pact is the improvement in the
quality of public expenditures. Beyond tax reforms, this DPL also supports greater fiscal
progressivity by enhancing accountability in how public resources are spent, which will be
crucial in ensuring that scarce resources achieve better results.

      Indicative Trigger(s) for DPL2                                  Prior action(s) for DPL2
The Government has expanded the                Prior Action 4: To improve budget management and implement a
application     of    the      results-based   results-based methodology of public expenditures, the Borrower has:
management approach, in particular             (a) adopted a legal framework for results-based budgeting, as
strengthening     the   monitoring       and   evidenced by Legislative Decree No. 13-2013; (b) complied with the
evaluation framework.                          requirements to expand the application of results-based budgeting to
                                               the Borrower’s Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Sports and
                                               Culture; and (c) established operating and coordination mechanisms
                                               for results-based budgeting in the Borrower’s Ministry of Public
                                               Finance and the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance.
                                               Prior Action 5: To strengthen budget management and the
                                               transparency of public expenditures, the Borrower has: (a) mandated
                                               the use of the Single Treasury Account to process budget
                                               transactions; (b) mandated that all entities that execute projects with
                                               public funds adequately report their activities to the Borrower’s
                                               Ministry of Public Finance; (c) introduced regulations to strengthen
                                               the monitoring and evaluation of loans and grants to, and trust funds
                                               managed by, public entities; and (d) mandated that all public entities
                                               use the SIAF to consolidate budgetary and financial information, as
                                               evidenced by Legislative Decree No. 13-2013.

53.     The Government is aware that the implementation of systemic reforms such as RBB
is a long term process that will require support and commitment from subsequent
governments. The first phase of the DPL supported the Ministry of Health and Social
Assistance’s (MOHSA) RBB pilot with regard to selected sub-programs. The second phase of
the RBB mechanism will be improved and expanded to include other ministries in 2014,
supported by the second phase of the DPL. In subsequent years, the Government plans to include
more ministries and programs. Consolidation and scaling-up of a results-focused approach in
public financial management with the objective of increasing the effectiveness of public
spending, represent a continuation of long-term Government priorities that date back to the 2009-
2011 DPL series and that will enable the Government to address development challenges more
effectively, particularly given the limited fiscal space.

54.      A key policy supported by this DPL is the adoption of a new Organic Budget Law in
November 2013, which replaced a 17 year-old law and that includes a series of
improvements in budget management and transparency. First, the new Organic Budget Law
mandates the use of a Single Treasury Account (Cuenta Única del Tesoro, CUT), a unified
structure of government bank accounts that was previously not regulated and is a key step
towards strengthening the management and control of Government’s cash resources to ensure
that (i) all tax and non-tax revenues are collected and payments are made correctly, in a timely
manner; and (ii) government cash balances are optimally managed to reduce borrowing costs.
Second, it introduced new regulations to enhance fiscal policy management, including the
management of public debt. For instance, the new Organic Budget Law expands the definition of
the public sector to include all government agencies, state-owned enterprises, local governments,
non-governmental organizations that receive or manage public funds, as well as trust funds
constituted with public funds. In addition, the Law specifies principles and processes for loan
guarantees, establishes procedures to issue Treasury Bonds, and requirements for disbursements
for all public entities. The Law also enhances the comprehensiveness of the information included
in budget documentation. Third, the Law mandates that all public entities (including central

                                                          16
 
government, local governments, and state-owned enterprises and entities) use the Integrated
Financial Information System (SIAF) to consolidate budgetary and financial information, which
is expected to significantly enhance the capacity of the government to track revenues and
expenditures.

55.     DPL1 supported the implementation of a pilot of RBB for the health sector that is
focused on maternal and child health and nutrition results based on the “First 1000 days of
Life Initiative” under the Zero Hunger Pact, a larger multi-sectoral program8. Prior to this
pilot, public financial resources in Guatemala have been distributed mainly based on historical
budgeting, with a slight increase for inflation. In the health sector, in particular, regional
allocations were based on certain indicators: human resources, number of beds, and number of
health establishments9. Poorer regions with already unequal representation were assigned the
lowest amount of funds regardless of population increase or epidemiological profile. As a result,
the allocation criteria used for health expenditures ended up reinforcing historical trends as well
as inequalities across regions. It is expected that the introduction of the pilot RBB in health and
nutrition in priority municipalities, which were selected based on their nutritional status under
the Zero Hunger Pact, will improve the resource allocation among sub-national governments.

56.     The MOHSA’s RBB pilot is considered a key step toward aligning resource
allocations with sectoral priorities. Under the Zero Hunger Pact the Government developed a
plan that aims to reduce chronic malnutrition and prevent and mitigate seasonal hunger. In
particular, the plan seeks to reduce chronic malnutrition in children less than 5 years of age by
2.5 percentage points annually between 2012 and 2015. It also includes strategies to improve the
health status of women of reproductive age and children less than two years of age, based on the
evidence that improving the first 1000 days of life enables young children to attain their growth
potential.

57.     In order to operationalize the pilot RBB, the Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) and
MOHSA signed a Results-based Management Agreement in 2012 with targets for nutrition
and maternal health, providing for a significant increase in the budget allocated to these
two priorities. In the RBB pilot, MOHSA prioritized three sub-programs under its preventive
health program (Program 12): immunization, prevention and control of malnutrition, and
reproductive health. Budgetary allocations to these three sub-programs increased by 188 percent
from 2011 to 2012. In 2013, the MINFIN changed the budget categories and it was not possible
to directly compare changes in assigned budgets to each health sub-program per the 2011 and
2012 sub-program categories. Nonetheless, the total 2013 budget allocated (Q663,866,018) for
sub-programs directly related to nutritional and maternal health targets increased by 41.6 percent
from 2012 (Q468,563,755). Since the 2014 budget was not approved by end November 2013,
the 2013 budget remains effective to date.

58.      The RBB’s first phase laid the groundwork for operationalizing and monitoring the
process. In order to better adjust services to respond to the needs of the target population, the
initial phase of the RBB implementation produced (1) a resource gap analysis (financial, human
resources, water and sanitation, medicines, and equipment) in 83 of the 166 prioritized
municipalities10 in 12 Health Areas, in coordination with Secretariat of Food and Nutritional
Security (SESAN), as well as (2) a situational analysis (production, human resources, inventory
of supplies, equipment and infrastructure) of 17 Nutritional Recuperation Centers in 8 Health
Areas. In addition, work teams within MOHSA and in the departments and municipalities were
oriented and trained on the RBB process, and their work structured to enable them to deliver on
the RBB commitments. Furthermore, the MOHSA updated the primary care registration system
of the Health Management Information System (SIGSA), the ministry’s principal information
system, and the vaccination cards for children to be able to measure and report on indicators
included in the RBB agreement. The MOHSA also supported the development and
implementation of an alert and response system for the timely detection of acute malnutrition and
reduction of maternal-neonatal mortality through the use of mobile technology in 500
communities in 97 priority municipalities, in coordination with the private sector, external
partners, and SESAN, and updated the Extension of Coverage Program (PEC) information
system.11

59.    To improve the coordination of the Management for Results Process, the MOHSA
also established an Internal Technical Working Group (GTTI in Spanish) via ministerial
decree in May 2013. The GTTI is responsible for promoting good institutional practices that
contribute to harmonizing and operationalizing MOHSA activities.

60.     Aside from procedural and institutional improvements, the RBB approach also
demonstrated positive results in key maternal and child health and nutrition indicators.
While it is recognized that reducing chronic malnutrition usually takes time, other national level
results for several child and maternal health and nutrition indicators were positive. In particular,

   The number of prioritized municipalities refers to those that have the highest prevalence of chronic malnutrition in
the country―166 municipalities were rated as having a "high" incidence, of which 83 have a "very high" incidence.
The complete list of prioritized municipalities can be found at www.sesan.gob.gt.
11
   Of the 166 municipalities prioritized by the Zero Hunger Plan, the 83 classified with a “very high” incidence of
chronic malnutrition have an estimated rural population of 64 percent and the remaining 83 prioritized
municipalities with a “high” incidence of chronic malnutrition have an estimated rural population of 63 percent. At
the national level, the rural population is estimated at 52 percent, which reflects greater vulnerability in rural areas.
The municipalities prioritized by the Zero Hunger Plan are located in 18 of 22 departments of Guatemala. For
instance, of these 18 departments, 10 have a rural population of 60 percent or more, with the highest rural
populations in Alta Verapaz (77 percent), Chiquimula and San Marcos (73 percent each). In addition, 8 departments
have at least 50 percent of indigenous population, with the highest concentration in Totonicapán (97 percent), Sololá
(96.5 percent) and Alta Verapaz (89.7 percent).

                                                                 18
 
the MOHSA achieved 92.3 percent of its target for growth monitoring of children less than 5
years old, 92.4 percent of its target for micronutrient supplementation of children less than 5
years old, and 91.7 percent of its target for institutional deliveries. The MOHSA, in coordination
with SESAN and Government Ministries, also coordinated efforts to provide nutritional
interventions and treatment in 850 communities in 22 departments that identified 1,194 children
with acute malnutrition. The four main indicators12 used to monitor the RBB process in the 83
municipalities prioritized for the first phase of the RBB implementation under the Zero Hunger
Pact increased from 2011 (baseline) to 2013.

61.    As a result of the initial RBB implementation experience and with the view of
expanding results-oriented budgeting in other ministries, the Ministry of Finance will
strengthen the legal basis and institutional coordination and support mechanism for RBB.
The MINFIN, recognizing the importance of establishing regulations to implement results based
management in all ministries, will revise the Budget Law accordingly. In addition, it will support
the implementation of the RBB mechanism by assigning MINFIN staff to work closely with the
MOHSA. It will also initiate implementation of the RBB mechanism in two additional ministries
(Culture and Economy) that have expressed their willingness to participate in 2014.

62.     The MOHSA has prepared a strategy for 2014-19, and an operational plan for 2014
and 2015 that is based on, and supports, the RBB approach. This strategy has 7 pillars: (i)
strengthening the three levels of care and the integration of the service delivery network; (ii)
reforming the health sector regulatory framework; (iii) training, development of human
resources, and research; (iv) governance; (v) implementation of the regionalization of technical
and financial management; (vi) strengthening access to safe water and sanitation; and (vii)
quality assurance. Aside from strengthening service delivery in priority municipalities it aims to
train 100 percent of all primary health care staff in the correct use of the information system,
including registration of primary care data by 2014. By 2015, it seeks to have 100 percent of all
Health District Municipalities and hospitals implement results-based management based on cost
centers. This is a welcome, yet ambitious (in terms of timing) undertaking since the need to
improve the availability, quality, and timeliness of cost and production of data were also
highlighted in the PER (2013) and the ongoing Health Non-Lending Technical Assistance
                                                            
12
   For practical purposes and to be aligned with the indicators included in the MINFIN and MOHSA results
agreement, the DPL series will use these indicators to track progress.

                                                               19
 
Functional Review. In terms of establishing a single health information system (SUI, in Spanish)
the MOHSA’s targets are the following: (i) 50 percent of the Health Areas and their districts
operate SUI for registering consumption of medicines and other inputs by end of 2014, and (ii)
reaching 100 percent of the Health areas and their districts by end of 2015. The MOHSA has
presented and discussed its Plan with the National Health Council and plans to present it to the
President of Guatemala. Going forward, it would be essential for the MOHSA and MINFIN to
discuss said Plan and ensure that it is feasible and could be adequately supported by a budget.

Operation Pillar 3: Improving the Coordination and Management of Social Policies

     Indicative Trigger(s) for DPL2                                                    Prior action(s) for DPL2
MIDES has established the National                             Prior Action 6: To improve the management of social policies, the
System of Social Information, including                        Borrower has established a social information system (SISO) in the
the Unique Beneficiary Registry.                               Borrower’s Ministry of Social Development, including: (a)
                                                               information on social programs and policies related to beneficiaries,
                                                               geographic coverage and type of program; and (b) a single

63.     Social spending has expanded in recent years, but remains low as a share of GDP.
Social spending has gradually increased from 32.2 percent of total public expenditures in 2007 to
38.3 in 2013. However, as a share of GDP, Guatemala’s social spending ranks lowest in Central
America. This level of public spending represented 5.4 percent of GDP in 2013, compared to 4.3
percent in 2007. This gradual increase reflects both the commitments made under the Peace
Accords in 1996, and a strong social sector focus by the last administrations. Furthermore, in
recent years Guatemala has taken important steps towards expanding coverage of social
programs addressing the poor and the vulnerable.13 For instance, the largest social program is the
CCT program Mi Bono Seguro (formerly known as Mi Familia Progresa), which supports over
770,000 households living below the poverty line. As further described below, the proposed DPL
supports the enhancement of monitoring of social programs with the creation of the Social
Information System.

64.    This DPL series supports the adoption of the Zero Hunger Pact, which aims at
tackling chronic malnutrition. Child malnutrition rates in Guatemala are among the highest in
the world. Chronic malnutrition among children under five years of age reached 49.8 percent in
2008/09, but rates are as high as 89 percent among the indigenous population. This high rate of

  Guatemala has a range of programs that vary in their objectives, target population, and type and level of benefits.
These include the conditional cash transfer Mi Bono Seguro (annual spending of about US$100 million), which
covers over 770,000 of rural households living below the poverty line. The second largest social program is Mi
Bolsa Segura, a US$13 million program that provides a bundle of essential food items to over 205,000 mothers in
poor urban areas across 17 municipalities. Jovenes Protagonistas (formerly Escuelas Abiertas) is a program that
provides social and training activities for adolescents and youth in marginal and high violence urban areas – thus
addressing the key development challenge of improving citizen security. Although smaller in size (US$3 million) it
reaches almost 37,000 youth in Guatemala. Other programs like Comedor Seguro (US$4 million) and Beca Segura
(US$3 million) finance eateries and education tuition for the poor and vulnerable.

                                                                         20
 
malnutrition has a direct impact on child mortality, as well as a negative impact on intellectual
and physical development. It is critical for Guatemala to make the best use of available resources
in order to accelerate advances in human development outcomes.

65.     The Ministry of Social Development (MIDES) was created in 2011 to run key social
programs and enhance the coordination of social policies. MIDES was established with
support from DPL1 to ensure greater coherence in public social policy. Indeed, prior to the
creation of the MIDES, a large number of institutions were independently responsible for the
strategy and operations of the different social programs. In that context coordination among
agencies was difficult and costly. MIDES is currently responsible for social programs
representing annual expenditures of more than US$124 million. These programs are aimed at
breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty, building human capital, mitigating food
insecurity, and addressing the need of the vulnerable youth. Overall, MIDES’ social programs
cover more than 40 percent of the Guatemalan population (poverty rate is around 50 percent).

66.     While evidence suggests that targeted social programs in Guatemala have helped
alleviate poverty, the impact of existing social programs can be enhanced by improving
monitoring and targeting systems, and by exploiting synergies among them. As noted
earlier, fiscal constraints often result in budgetary uncertainty which consequently affects the
performance of social programs. For example, Bono Seguro payments in rural areas have been
irregular, which in turn has weakened compliance with required co-responsibilities (i.e., Bono
Seguro provides cash payments to poor families that meet certain behavioral requirements, or co-
responsibilities, generally related to children’s health care and education). The Government has
started an individual registration for programs like Bolsa Segura and will implement a
socioeconomic assessment of participating households to ensure they are targeted based on
observable needs. Other programs, like Jovenes Protagonistas, are being revised to strengthen
capacity building for the youth at risk. These developments suggest that the quality of spending
in social programs could be significantly improved, starting with ensuring a regular flow of
resources, better targeting, and improvement of internal processes.

67.     To enhance the monitoring and evaluation of social programs and to ensure
synergies across existing programs, the Government has created a national Social
Information System, which includes a Single Beneficiary Registry. The Single Beneficiary
Registry (RUU) was created with support from DPL1 and currently consolidates information of
beneficiaries from 75 programs across Government agencies, including Bono Seguro and Bolsa
Segura. The RUU is part of an effort to develop a comprehensive national Social Information
System, a platform where public policies and programs can be monitored and examined across
different Ministries and levels of intervention (school, municipalities, and households).14 The
RUU is expected to play a significant role in exploiting synergies across Government agencies
that deliver social programs. The RUU is accessible to, and uses information from, the Ministries
of Finance, Public Health and Social Assistance, Education, and Social Development, as well as
from the Planning Secretariat and the Statistics Institute. This is expected to help decision
makers to better assess the effectiveness of social policies across the country.

                                                            
14
  The RUU includes information organized by individual beneficiaries, geographic coverage and type of program.
In the medium-term, MIDES plans to expand the registry system to assess coverage between rural and urban areas.

                                                               21
 
68.      Furthermore, MIDES has established an agreement with the Ministry of
Agriculture (MAGA) to enhance the coordination of social policies using the Single
Beneficiary Registry. Through this agreement, MAGA is delivering agricultural extension
services to Bono Seguro beneficiaries (women heads of households in rural areas and indigenous
communities). In particular, MIDES is using the RUU to define the target population, and
MAGA delivers training through its network of 3,000 extension workers. Similarly, the Ministry
of Labor has established an agreement with the National Training Institute to deliver productive
training to households in municipalities prioritized in the Zero Hunger Plan. Notably, the RUU is
being used to monitor program efficiency (for instance, by reducing duplications of
beneficiaries). In turn, the centralizing of the financial management of programs is likely to give
rise to cost savings and to improve budget transparency.

69.     Over the medium-term, the Government plans to further strengthen the
coordination of social policies. For instance, the authorities are advancing measures to promote
cross-sectoral synergies of agriculture, labor, and education programs, with the objective of
enhancing the productivity of participants. The Government has established Specialized Cabinets
(Gabinetes Específicos), which focus on improving inter-ministerial coordination for specific
social programs in areas like rural development, youth employment, and gender equality. For
example, the MIDES-MAGA Agreement was discussed in the Rural Development Cabinet and
tackles the need to strengthen rural productivity of Bono Seguro beneficiaries, reduce food
insecurity and malnutrition, and open opportunities for graduating better-off households towards
productive programs. While this represents a strong institutional basis for coordination, the other
requirements on predictable financing, better targeting, improved content and closer monitoring
and evaluation are necessary conditions to ensure impact on the poor.

70.      DPL2 continues to support efforts to reduce chronic malnutrition by advancing the
implementation of the Zero Hunger Pact. The Zero Hunger Pact has four levels of
intervention: national, departmental, municipal and community. To support the implementation
of the Pact, the Government has established 161 Municipal Councils of Food and Nutritional
Security or COMUSANES (Consejos Municipales de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional)15 in
prioritized municipalities with the highest incidence of chronic malnutrition, of which 120 were
established during 2012 and 2013. The COMUSANES are integrated with representatives of the
municipalities, government institutions, NGOs and civil society. These councils support the
institutionalization of the National Policy for Nutritional Security and enhance coordination
between MIDES and SESAN in priority areas (in cooperation with MAGA). Overall, the
COMUSANES are responsible for monitoring the implementation of nutritional security at the
local level. It is expected that the establishment of these councils in priority municipalities will
help avoid duplication of efforts and maximize synergies for social policies. Of the 166
municipalities prioritized with high or very high prevalence of chronic malnutrition, around 97
percent have active COMUSANES. As noted earlier, the estimated rural population in these 166
municipalities is around 64 percent, compared to a rural population of 52 percent at the national
level. At the national level, out of a total of 366 municipalities, 95 percent have established
COMUSANES.
                                                            
15
  The COMUSANES were created by Decree 32-2005, which states that at the municipal and community levels, the
Urban and Rural Nutritional Security Councils will form committees to promote the fulfillment of the strategic
objectives of nutritional security, with their own programs, projects and activities in coordination with SESAN.

                                                               22
 
71.     In addition to progress noted in Pillar 2 on the Zero Hunger Pact results indicators
(reduction of maternal and child mortality, and chronic malnutrition), there have been
notable achievements related to inter-ministerial coordination on social policies. These
include: (i) the completion of a resource-gap analysis (financial, human resources, water and
sanitation, medicines and equipment) in 83 of the 166 prioritized municipalities in 12 health
areas, in coordination with SESAN; (ii) the development and implementation of an alert-and-
response system for the timely detection of acute malnutrition and reduction of maternal-
neonatal mortality through the use of mobile technology in 500 communities in 97 priority
municipalities, in 10 health areas in coordination with the private sector (Tigo Foundation),
external partners (UNICEF and UNDP), and SESAN; (iii) the identification and treatment of
1,194 acute malnourished children in 850 priority communities in 22 departments in
coordination with SESAN and other Government ministries; and (iv) the establishment of a
working group/communication mechanism between MOHSA and MINFIN to improve results
based management implementation.

72.    This DPL series also supported the creation of the Economic and Social Council
(CES) which became operational in 2013 and has been promoting policy dialogue and
consensus on fundamental issues of public policy. CES was created following a six-year
dialogue between civil society and private sector. It was established by Congress as an
independent organization, and seeks to provide a platform to propose and support public policies
and legislative initiatives, and provide advice to the Government on economic and social matters.
Represented by the business community, cooperatives, and trade unions, this initiative has been
welcomed as an opportunity to forge consensus on national policy priorities. CES has also been
providing training to its members on public policy issues, as an effort to strengthen the capacity
and participation of CES members. CES is chaired by an elected president (with one vice-
president from each of the three represented groups), and managed by an executive secretary.
Resolutions can only be passed if at least six representatives from each group vote in favor,
thereby preventing one group from dominating its decisions. In 2013 CES became part of the
Ibero-American Network of Social and Economic Councils. Over the medium term, CES plans
to enhance its analytical capacity to propose public policies.

    Prior Action 6: To improve the management of social policies, the  Public Expenditure Review (WB 2013)
    Borrower has established a social information system (SISO) in the  Human Development Policy Notes for

LINK TO CAS AND OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

73.     The proposed DPL bears strong links to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS),
presented to the Board jointly with the First Programmatic DPL in this series in 2012. In
accordance with the Government’s wishes, the CPS (Report No. 69229-GT) includes two pillars
that are highly aligned with the Government’s own priorities and two transversal themes. Within
the framework of the CPS, the proposed DPL will continue to be a key instrument influencing
CPS outcomes in the first pillar (strengthening public policies for social development). This
includes enhancing budget management16 and improving results in the social sectors.

74.     The DPL program supports CPS pillars. The program supports the Government’s
agenda to promote growth, social development, and transparency, in line with the Peace
Accords, all of which represent key themes of the CPS. The fiscal agenda is expected to enhance
the capacity of tax and customs administration in the long-term. In terms of social development,
the DPL highlights institutional measures to strengthen RBB practices and social policy
coordination through improved targeting and monitoring and evaluation systems to ensure the
greatest possible impact of public expenditures in terms of poverty reduction and shared
prosperity. It is worth mentioning that the First DPL was given a moderately unsatisfactory
rating in the Implementation Supervision Report that was prepared in June 2013. This rating was
given due to the fact that the Guatemalan Congress had not yet approved the DPL1 at that time,
and there had been delays in the collection of data for results indicators for pillar 2 and pillar 3.
Since mid-2013, however, the authorities have made important progress in collecting data for the
results indicators, and progress has advanced across all areas of the operation. As a result, the
Government is now on track to achieve the results indicators specified in the policy matrix.

75.     World Bank Analytical and Advisory Activities are supporting the DPL program,
both on the fiscal and social sectors. Since its approval in 2012, the fiscal reform has struggled
to achieve the anticipated results. In order to better understand the dynamics of reform
implementation and strengthen tax and customs administrations, the Bank is pursuing additional
interventions in an effort to improve the fiscal outcomes envisaged in this operation. At the
request of the Government, in 2014 the Bank implemented the IAMTAX assessment tool, which
provides a comprehensive and systematic assessment of overall tax administration performance
comprising over 45 indicators, allowing international benchmarking and transfer of best
practices, and facilitating monitoring and implementation of specific actions to strengthen tax
performance. Furthermore, in support of pillar 2, the World Bank has been implementing a
Health System NLTA, to undertake a functional review and terms of reference for the Health
System Strengthening Master Plan that focuses on improving infrastructure, human resource
strengthening, and monitoring and evaluation systems. This Master Plan is expected to help
sustain ongoing achievements beyond the current administration.

CONSULTATIONS AND COLLABORATION WITH DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

76.   The design of the DPL series benefited from an extensive process of consultations
during the preparation of the CPS, and key policy objectives supported by DPL2 are
broadly supported by Guatemalans. During the CPS consultation process in 2012, the Bank
                                                            
16
     Data on budget disbursements is public and can be consulted online (http://www.minfin.gob.gt).

                                                               25
 
engaged closely with different private sector, civil society, and development partners to discuss
innovative ways to incorporate key themes of the CPS into future interventions, such as gender,
transparency and citizen security. Among those that participated in the consultation process were
stakeholders from the Grupo de Diálogo (G-13) which includes bilateral as well as multilateral
donors, representatives of various private sector associations, universities, think tanks, women’s
groups, indigenous organizations, and youth associations. In particular, both the Fiscal Pact and
the Zero Hunger Pact have undergone extensive dialogue with civil society over the past decade
as part of Guatemala’s increasing focus on social sectors following the 1996 Peace Accords. The
creation of the CES, supported by this DPL series, is also the result of extensive consultation and
reflects a broad spectrum of Guatemalan society.

77.     The Bank collaborates closely with the IMF. An Article IV Consultation was
completed in August 2013. The IMF stressed the importance of pursuing structural reforms to
promote long-term inclusive growth, including increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio to support
priority public spending. The IMF Board welcomed revenue-enhancing efforts which are being
supported as part of this DPL series, and advocated for maintaining an adequate fiscal stance,
which will require protecting the inroads made under the tax reform.

78.     The proposed operation was also prepared in coordination with the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB). The IADB is preparing a Policy-Based loan of US$ 300 million in
parallel to the World Bank. The Loan is scheduled to be approved in the first semester of 2015,
supporting reforms in the social sector and other areas to be defined. The teams coordinated the
design of the policy matrix to avoid duplicating efforts and ease the reporting and monitoring
burden of the authorities.

                    V.    OTHER DESIGN AND APPRAISAL ISSUES

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

79.     Government actions supported in this DPL are expected to have positive poverty
and social impacts (see Annex 4). The analysis carried out on the potential impacts of the
reforms supported under DPL1, and the analysis presented in Annex 4 suggest a positive or
neutral impact for the reforms supported under this operation.

80.      Reforms related to tax policy and tax administration are expected to make the tax
system more progressive. The impact of tax reforms is expected to affect mainly the upper
decile of the income distribution and is unlikely to have a direct impact on the poor and
vulnerable. Simulations using the latest household survey for Guatemala suggest that the direct
impact of the changes in the tax code will likely be felt only among the top income decile. The
tax reform also aims to increase the share of direct taxes, which has the potential of making the
tax system more progressive. Furthermore, strengthening tax policy and tax administration, and
enhancing the results orientation of the budget - central objectives of this DPL series - will help
the Government deliver a more ambitious social contract and expand economic opportunities for
all citizens. Measures aimed at improving the transparency of international taxation are not
expected to directly impact poverty or the distribution of income. However, positive indirect
effects could occur, through an improved business environment and more employment


                                                26
 
opportunities in the formal sector. As noted in Annex 4, Guatemalan workers from low-income
households are disproportionally represented in the informal sector and have lower earnings.

81.     Measures related to social protection programs are expected to generate significant,
positive impacts for the poor. The size of this impact depends on the quality of targeting of
these programs. The development of tools to improve the monitoring and evaluation of social
programs, including advances in Results-Based Management and the Single Beneficiary Registry
are important milestones in the promotion of shared prosperity in Guatemala. Analysis using the
latest household survey (ENCOVI 2011) as well as the latest National Maternal and Infant
Health Survey (ENSMI 2008-09) suggest potential positive impacts of improving Results-Based
Management. In this regard, evidence from other countries emphasizes the positive impacts of
RBB as a tool to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity, including: (i) an informed
budget that enhances the transparency and accountability of public resources; and (ii) an
enhanced monitoring and evaluation system, in particular with regards to social programs.

82.     Improving the coordination of social policy is also expected to promote shared
prosperity in Guatemala. Pillar 3 of the proposed DPL aims to support Government efforts to
tackle infant malnutrition and maternal mortality in geographic areas with high malnutrition
rates, and to improve the monitoring and evaluation framework and the unique registry of
beneficiaries. Indeed, the implementation of the Zero Hunger Plan through the COMUSANES
and the creation of the Single Beneficiary Registry will help ensure that households receive all
benefits for which they are eligible. The introduction of new inter-ministerial coordination
mechanisms is also expected to improve welfare of vulnerable groups. A better targeted social
program is expected to be more progressive as it will help ensure that the resources will be
channeled to those in most need, who will benefit the most from public social expenditures.
Indeed, the use of the recently completed Poverty Maps17 could substantially help to increase the
effectiveness of targeting mechanisms. Similarly, focusing the budget on results according to
social needs greatly improves its progressive nature.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

83.     The measures supported under the proposed DPL are not likely to have significant
effects on the environment, forests or other natural resources. The increase in the taxes on
motor vehicles (prior action 1) is unlikely to have a negative significant impact on emissions and
air pollution since the taxes are paid as a lump sum annually and are not on a per use basis,
thereby providing limited incentives to have an effect on the use of vehicles. Policy actions in the
areas of tax administration, public expenditure, and social policy are not likely to have either
significant positive or negative environmental impacts.

PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING ASPECTS

84.    The Public Expenditure Financial Accountability, published in 2013, indicates that
the fiduciary environment in Guatemala is adequate, as evidenced by the improvements in
public expenditure management systems made over the previous decade, and the actions
                                                            
17
     A nation-wide Poverty Map was completed in 2006. A rural Poverty Map was completed in 2011.


                                                               27
 
taken by the Government to continue increasing transparency. However, some challenges
remain. The authorities continue strengthening the public fiduciary control framework to tackle
fiduciary issues in many key areas identified by the report. Although Guatemala has advanced
substantially in modernizing its Public Financial Management during the last decade - which was
supported by the Bank-financed Third Integrated Financial Management Additional Financial
Project, and the trust fund Support to the General Auditor’s Office to improve fiscal controls -
some significant weaknesses remain such as budget rigidity, control of arrears (floating debt), or
Trust Funds monitoring.

85.     The Guatemala Government has made continuous efforts to improve its Public
Financial Management System. Approved in October 212, the anti-corruption law increased
penalties for existing crimes and included new crimes such as illicit enrichment, traffic of
influence, and illegal charging of commissions. The Government amended the Organic Budget
Law in October 2013 to improve public expenditure management, aiming to prevent the
emergence of new arrears through the enactment of stricter sanctions, increased budget
flexibility, improvements in cash management, and enhanced controls of trust funds. A revenue
reform and an anti-tax evasion law were approved in early 2012 as well. The Government’s main
challenges are to reach a reliable estimate of the outstanding stock of domestic payment arrears,
to implement measures for their elimination, and to establish a sound mechanism for Trust Funds
monitoring and oversight through the General Auditor’s Office. The General Auditor’s Office
has also been empowered to calculate the outstanding stock of arrears.

86.     The proposed loan will follow the World Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy loans. Once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective
(including compliance with the disbursement conditions), the proceeds of the loan will be
deposited by IBRD in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the
Central Bank of Guatemala at the request of the Borrower. The Borrower shall ensure that upon
the deposit of the loan proceeds into said account, an equivalent amount is credited in the
Borrower’s budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will
report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to the
budget management system and provide certification of its deposit if the Bank request it. If the
proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, IBRD
will require the Borrower to, promptly upon notice from IBRD, refund an amount equal to the
amount of said payment to IBRD. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be
cancelled. The administration of this loan will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.

87.    The foreign exchange control environment of the Central Bank is adequate and,
according to the last available IMF Assessment Report, an external auditing system is in
place and international foreign currency reserves are managed according to prudent
international practice. The external audit for the last two years provided a clean opinion and
was prepared according to accounting regulations of the organic law that differs from the Interim
Financial Reports in: (i) credits to collect from the Government registered at face value; (ii) fixed
assets without fair value periodic reevaluation; and (iii) adjustments of income and expenses of
previous years that should be adjusted on the relevant fiscal year instead on the year of
adjustment if significant.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

88.     The MINFIN is responsible for the implementation of the program supported by the
DPL series. As the main implementing agency, MINFIN will coordinate with other Government
ministries and agencies involved in the implementation of the series, in particular MIDES, SAT,
MOHSA and the CES. Together with MINFIN, these institutions will collect the necessary data
to assess implementation progress and report it to the Bank.

                   VI.     SUMMARY OF RISKS AND MITIGATION

89.     Macroeconomic Risk: This risk derives in part from a potential deterioration in the
external environment, in particular if global uncertainty translates into weaker demand and
employment in the United States. In the last crisis Guatemala was affected mainly through a
direct channel of commercial and trade relations. As the United States economy continues to
improve, a potential risk for Guatemala derives from higher investor risk aversion towards
middle-income countries, following the US Federal Reserve’s tighter monetary policy. If the risk
was to materialize, rigidities and delays in Congressional approval of official external financing
could act as a compounding factor. Additional risks to the economic outlook are posed by a
potential spike in oil prices (caused by supply disruptions or other factors) and in case the recent
rise in global food prices continues unabated. Authorities are aware that fiscal adjustment
through expenditure cuts and reforms aimed at improving revenue management would be
necessary to mitigate macroeconomic risks. However, if revenue collection does not improve,
cutting expenditures in a context of moderate growth and high inequality could negatively
impact the poor and vulnerable. The relatively strong foreign-exchange reserve position provides
the Government with instruments necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability.
Macroeconomic risk is also mitigated by the reform program and medium-term framework
supported by this operation, which envisages the creation of fiscal space and the reduction of the
fiscal deficit so as to regain buffers with which to respond to a potential new global crisis.

90.     Political and Legal Risks: The polarized political climate in Guatemala could affect the
approval in Congress of further reform efforts and of multilateral loans. Concerning the tax
reform, legal claims were submitted before the Constitutional Court challenging the
constitutionality of parts of the tax reforms. As noted above, these legal claims did not affect the
technical structure of the reform and the core objectives of the reform have been kept in place.
Nonetheless, new legal claims could be presented in the future. To mitigate this risk, and
especially given that previous tax reform efforts were reversed because of such legal challenges,
the authorities followed an extensive consultation process on policy reforms. In particular, the
fiscal reform builds on efforts started over a decade ago and on which a broad consensus in
Guatemalan society had been reached. In particular, the tax reforms draw heavily on a proposal
developed in 2008 by a group of 40 economists from across the political spectrum. Aware of
likely legal challenges the authorities relied upon internal and independent expertise on
constitutional tax law to prepare the tax reform.

91.   Institutional Risk: Institutional weaknesses may affect the implementation of some of
the measures supported by the operation. In particular, the effectiveness of the tax reforms
depends on the ability of the tax administration to apply and enforce the new provisions.


                                                29
 
Mitigating measures include donor support aimed at strengthening tax administration, including
analytical and advisory activities by the World Bank.

92.     Natural Disaster Risk: Guatemala is highly vulnerable to multiple natural disasters
risks. According to the World Bank's Natural Disaster Hotspot study, Guatemala ranks 5th among
countries with the highest economic risk exposure to three or more hazards. Guatemala is ranked
as a high-risk country due to the vulnerability of its GDP to multiple hazards, with 83 percent of
Guatemala's GDP located in areas at risk. Guatemala is one of the most densely populated
countries in Latin America, with approximately 13 million inhabitants in a territory of 108,890
square kilometers. During 1902-2005, Guatemala experienced 62 natural disasters that affected
about 6 million people. For instance, recent World Bank Analytical and Advisory Activities
found that Agatha, a tropical storm that hit Guatemala in 2010, reduced consumption by 6
percent among affected households one year after the disaster, pushing many households into
poverty. This risk is being mitigated by reforms aimed at improving Guatemala’s capacity to
implement a disaster risk management framework. The Bank is also supporting Guatemala to
assess fiscal policy instruments to respond to natural disasters. A 2013 study funded by the Bank
notes that fiscal policy can play an active role in reducing social and territorial risk in four
specific areas: (i) the reduction of activities which increase environmental risk; (ii)
improvements in social and economic expenditures that will minimize the risk of natural events;
(iii) improvements in policies and investment in environmental protection and; (iv) counter-
cyclical policies which have an active role in the reconstruction phase of natural disasters.

93.     The overall risk to the achievement of the program development objectives is rated
as moderate. The Government has shown strong commitment to the DPL objectives and is
committed to closely monitoring its expected results. As noted earlier, however, the speed of
reform implementation may vary across policy areas as the Government may face competing
political priorities or implementation capacity constraints.

    Estimado Sefior Tuluy:

    El Gobiemo de Ia Republica de Guatemala dirigido por el Presidente Otto Perez Molina ha
    fijado como una de sus principales metas promover el desarrollo econ6mico sostenible y
    equitativo que responda a las necesidades de toda la poblaci6n, pero en particular las de
    aquellos que viven en situaci6n de extrema pobreza. En ese sentido, el compromiso de Ia
    actual Administraci6n se centra en avanzar en el cumplimiento de los Acuerdos de Paz y en
    las metas establecidas dentro de los Objetivos del Milenio.

    Con ese prop6sito, Ia actual Administraci6n de Gobiemo esta implementando un plan que se
    ha denominado "Agenda del Cambio", el cual establece entre otros, las acciones prioritarias
    para promover el desarrollo econ6mico y social en el pais, a traves de Ia implementaci6n de 5
    Ejes: 1) Seguridad Democnitica y Justicia, 2) Desarrollo Econ6mico Competitivo,
    3) Infraestructura Productiva y Social para el desarrollo, 4) Inclusion Social, y 5) Desarrollo
    Rural Sustentable.

    En ese contexto, y con el prop6sito de dar cumplimiento a la Agenda del Cambio, se ha
    planteado los 3 pactos de naci6n siguientes: i) El Pacta "Hambre Cera" que es una estrategia
    conjunta de atenci6n a Ia desnutrici6n cr6nica y Ia inseguridad alimentaria; ii) El Pacta par Ia
    Seguridad, la Justicia y la Paz que tiene como objetivo garantizar Ia vida de las personas, Ia
    familia, Ia libertad y la justicia mediante Ia protecci6n integral con acciones de prevenci6n,
    control y rehabilitaci6n que generen ambientes seguros en el hogar, Ia escuela, el trabajo yen
    los lugares de recreaci6n; y, iii) El Pacta Fiscal para el Cambia que persigue establecer
    acciones encaminadas a Ia mejora de Ia transparencia y calidad del gasto, la promoci6n del
    crecimiento econ6mico, el combate al contrabando y Ia evasion tributaria, la actualizaci6n
    tributaria y Ia asignaci6n prioritaria de los recursos.

                                      GUATt:MALA. C. A.



    La estrategia de asistencia acordada con el Banco Mundial para el periodo 2013-2016,
    contempla, entre otros aspectos, el acompafiamiento y apoyo a Ia implementaci6n del Plan de
    Gobierno referido, a traves del otorgamiento de dos Prestamos Programaticos de Politica de
    Desarrollo, con el objetivo de crear espacio fiscal y ampliar las oportunidades para los
    segmentos mas vulnerables de Ia sociedad. Desde Ia aprobaci6n del primer prestamo por parte
    del Banco, el Gobierno ha mostrado avances continuos en las areas clave definidas en Ia
    matriz de implementaci6n del Programa, raz6n por la cual se encuentra en capacidad de
    solicitar Ia negociaci6n y aprobaci6n del Segundo Prestamo, por un monto de US$340.0
    millones. AI igual que la operaci6n anterior, este prestamo apoyara los esfuerzos del Gobierno
    de Guatemala en tres areas de politica claves: (i) Fortalecer Ia administraci6n tributaria y Ia
    politica fiscal; (ii) Incrementar Ia calidad del gasto publico; y (iii) Mejorar Ia coordinaci6n y
    Ia gesti6n de Ia politica social.

    A continuaci6n se detallan los principales avances registrados en dichas areas:

    I.   Fortalecer Ia administracion tributaria y Ia politica fiscal. Un objetivo clave del
         Programa de Gobierno es mantener unas finanzas publicas disciplinadas y ordenadas, que
         a Ia vez coadyuven al desarrollo y a Ia disminuci6n de Ia pobreza del pais, y no
         comprometan su estabilidad macroecon6mica con deficit fiscales elevados e
         insostenibles.

         De esa cuenta, el Congreso de Ia Republica por medio de Decreto No. 04-2012 aprob6las
         Disposiciones para el Fortalecimiento del Sistema Tributario y el Combate a Ia
         Defraudaci6n y al Contrabando. Asimismo, por medio del Decreto No. 10-2012, se
         aprob6 la Ley de Actualizaci6n Tributaria, que contempla entre otros, una nueva ley del
         Impuesto Sobre Ia Renta; y, una Ley sobre la primera matriculaci6n de vehiculos
         automotores terrestres.

         En consonancia con las medidas adoptadas, el Gobierno ha emitido la reglamentaci6n de
         implementaci6n de: a) Ia reforma del Impuesto sobre Renta por medio del Acuerdo
         Gubernativo No; 213-2013; b) Ia reforma del Impuesto sobre el Valor Agregado a traves
         del Acuerdo Gubernativo No. 5-2013; y, c) Ia reforma del Impuesto sobre Ia primera
         matricula de vehiculos, por medio del Acuerdo Gubernativo No. 133-2012. Ademas, se
         ha mejorado Ia estructura organizativa de Ia Superintendencia de Administraci6n
         Tributaria (SAT), como se evidencia en el Libro II del Decreto No. 13-2013, que
         contempla las reformas al Decreto No. 1-98, Ley Organica de Ia Superintendencia de
         Administraci6n Tributaria, y sus Reformas.

        Asimismo, el Congreso de la Republica a traves del Decreto No. 14-2013 aprob6la Ley
        de Aduanas, con el objeto de establecer reglamentos y procesos para fortalecer la
        administraci6n aduanera alineado con el Reglamento del C6digo Aduanero Unifonne
        Centroamericano (RECAUCA).

        Por otro lado, con el objeto de aumentar Ia transparencia y el intercambio de infonnaci6n
        en el ambito tributario intemacional, el Gobiemo ha continuado las acciones para
        suscribir otros convenios de intercambio de infonnaci6n tributaria con los lineamientos
        del Foro Global. De esa cuenta, el Gobiemo finn6 un acuerdo bilateral con Australia el
        26 de septiembre de 2013 y se uni6 a Ia Convenci6n Multilateral de Ia OCDE sobre la
        Asistencia Administrativa Mutua en Materia Fiscal, el 5 de diciembre de 2012.
        Asimismo, se ha creado una Unidad de Intercambio de Infonnaci6n Tributaria dentro de
        este Ministerio, para apoyar el intercambio de infonnaci6n relacionada con Ia tributaci6n
        intemacional, conforme lo establece el Acuerdo Gubernative No. 26-2014, Reglamento
        Orgaruco Intemo del Ministerio de Finanzas Publicas.

    II. Mejora de Ia Gestion del Presupuesto y Aumento de Ia Orientacion hacia los Resultados
        del Gasto Publico: El Gobiemo de Guatemala esta comprometido en continuar
        fortaleciendo los procesos presupuestarios a fin de incrementar Ia eficiencia y efectividad
        de las instituciones publicas, para que atiendan la demanda actual y futura de sus
        servicios prestados con el fin de no descuidar las coberturas de atenci6n a los grupos mas
        vulnerables (protecci6n del presupuesto social) y, por otro lado, dinamizar las inversiones
        focalizandolas en proyectos y programas prioritarios.

        Por medio del Decreto No. 13-2013, que contempla las refonnas al Decreto No. 10i-97,
        Ley Organica del Presupuesto, el Gobiemo estableci6 Ia nonnativa para Ia
        implementaci6n de Ia gesti6n por resultados en todos los ministerios. De esa cuenta,
        como parte de Ia implementaci6n progresiva de Ia Planificaci6n y Presupuesto por
        Resultados, por medio del Acuerdo Gubemativo No. 544-2013, se estableci6 que las
        instituciones publicas interesadas en incorporarse durante Ia ejecuci6n al uso del Modulo
        de Presupuesto por Resultados (PpR), deben enviar nota dirigida a este Ministerio.
        Resultado de ello, por medio de comunicaciones del 3 de diciembre de 2013 y 7 de enero
        de 2014, el Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes y el Ministerio de Economia,
        respectivamente, manifestaron su interes en utilizar dicho modulo. Tambien se cre6 un
        mecanismo de implementaci6n entre los Ministerios de Finanzas Publicas y de Salud
        Publica y Asistencia Social para fortalecer Ia gesti6n por resultados en el Sector Salud.

        Por otro lado, para reforzar la transparencia y Ia rendicion de cuentas de Ia gestion
        financiera publica, por medio del Decreto No. 13-2013, que contempla las reformas al
        Decreto No. 101-97, Ley Orgaruca del Presupuesto, el Gobiemo impulso entre otros: a) la
        creacion de la Cuenta Unica del Tesoro; b) se instruyo que todas las entidades que
        utilicen fondos publicos para ejecutar proyectos reporten de forma adecuada sus
        actividades a este Ministerio; c) se introdujeron regulaciones para fortalecer el monitoreo
        y evaluaci6n de prestamos y donaciones extema para todas las entidades publicas; y, d) se
        instruy6 que todas las entidades publicas utilicen el Sistema Integrado de Administracion
        Financiera (SIAF), para consolidar Ia informacion presupuestaria y financiera.

    III. Mejorar Ia coordinaci6n y el manejo de Ia politica social. El Congreso de la Republica
         por medio del Decreto No. 01-2012, aprob6 Ia creaci6n del Ministerio de Desarrollo
         Social (MIDES), como una dependencia del Organismo Ejecutivo, a quien corresponde Ia
         rectoria de las politicas·publicas ·orientadas a mejorar el nivel de bienestar de las personas
         y grupos sociales vulnerables, que sufren de exclusion y viven en situacion de pobreza y
         pobreza extrema, generando oportunidades y capacidades que les permitan mejorar sus
         vidas en forma positiva y duradera, mediante Ia coordinacion, articulaci6n y trabajo en
         alianza con otras instituciones publicas, privadas y de Ia sociedad civil, en el marco de
         protecci6n de los derechos humanos y constitucionales.

        Para mejorar Ia gestion de Ia politica social, el MIDES establecio el Sistema de
        Informacion Social (SISO) a traves de una plataforma que incluye: a) informacion sobre
        los programas y politicas sociales en relaci6n con los beneficiarios, Ia cobertura
        geognifica, y los gastos por tipo de servicio social y por nivel institucional; y,
        b) un Registro Unico de Usuarios (RUU), que incluye informacion individual sobre los
        beneficiarios deal menos 75 programas sociales.

        Por otro lado, el Gobiemo de Ia Republica de Guatemala, consciente que la dimension del
        problema de Ia inseguridad alimentaria y nutricional requiere de una intervenci6n integral
        de acciones y actores publicos, privados y de Ia sociedad, lanz6 el "Plan Hambre Cero",
        como un esfuerzo conjunto, integral, armonizado, articulado y con pertinencia social y
        cultural. Este Plan se fundamenta en el concepto de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricional

Mr.
Hasan Tuluy
Vice President for Latin America and the Caribbean
World Bank
Washington D.C., USA


Dear Mr. Tuluy:

One of the priorities for the Government of Guatemala, under the leadership of President Otto Pérez
Molina, is to promote sustainable and equitable economic development that responds to the needs of the
entire population, but particularly those who live in conditions of extreme poverty. In this regard, the
commitment of the current administration is to advance in complying with the Peace Accords and the
Millennium Development Goals.

With this aim in mind, the current Government Administration is implementing a plan that has been called
“Agenda for Change” which, among other things, establishes priority actions to promote the economic and
social development of the country through the implementation of five pillars 1) Democratic Security and
Justice; 2) Competitive Economic Development; 3) Productive and Social Infrastructure for Development;
4) Social Inclusion; and 5) Sustainable Rural Development.

The following three national pacts have been proposed in this context and for the purpose of complying
with the “Agenda for Change”,: (i) the “Zero Hunger” Pact that is a joint strategy to address chronic
malnutrition and food insecurity; (ii) the Pact for Security, Justice and Peace that seeks to ensure the lives
of individuals and families, secure freedom and justice through comprehensive protection with prevention,
control and rehabilitation actions leading to safe environments at the home, the school, the workplace and
places for recreation, and (iii) The Fiscal Pact for Change that seeks to establish actions aimed at
improving transparency and the quality of spending, promote economic growth, combat contraband and tax
evation, update taxes, and the prioritary allocation of resources.

The Country Assistance Strategy agreed to with the World Bank for the period 2013 – 2016 includes, inter
alia, support for the implementation of the Government Plan mentioned above by granting two
Development Policy Programmatic Loans for the purpose of developing the fiscal framework and
expanding opportunities for the most vulnerable segments of society. Since the approval of the first loan by
the Bank, the Government has shown ongoing progress in key areas defined in the Program´s
implementation matrix, and for this reason is in the position to request the negotiation and approval of the
Second Loan for US$340 million. Like the previous operation, this loan will support the Guatemalan
Government efforts in three key policy areas: (i) the strengthening of tax administration and tax policy; (ii)
increasing the quality of public spending; and (iii) improving the coordination and management of social
policies.

                                                    39
 
Below we outline the progress accomplished in those areas:

I.     Strengthening the tax administration and tax policy. A key objective of the Government’s program
       is to maintain disciplined and orderly public finances which in turn promote development and
       poverty reduction in the country, without compromising macroeconomic stability through high and
       unsustainable fiscal deficits.

       Thus, through Decree No. 04-2012 Congress approved the Provisions to Strengthen the Tax
       System and to Combat Fraud and Smuggling. In addition, the Tax Law Update was approved
       through Decree No. 10-2012, which includes, among other measures, a new income tax law, as
       well as a law for the first registration of motor vehicles.

       In line with these measures, the Government has issued regulations to implement: (a) the income
       tax reform through Government Resolution No. 213-2013; (b) the amendment of Value Added Tax
       payment rules through Government Resolution No. 5-2013; and, (c) the reform of the tax for
       vehicles’ first registration, through Government Resolution No. 133-2012. It has also improved the
       organizational structure of the Superintendence of Tax Administration (SAT), as shown in Book II
       of Decree No. 13-2013, which provides for amendments to Decree No. 1-98, Organic Law of the
       Superintendence of Tax Administration and its Amendments.

       In addition, through Decree No. 14-2013 the Congress approved the National Customs Law, for the
       purpose of establishing rules and processes to strengthen Customs Administration in line with the
       Regulations to the Central American Uniform Customs Code (RECAUCA).

       Furthermore, in order to increase transparency and information exchange in the area of
       international taxes, the Government continues to carry out actions to sign other tax information
       sharing agreements based on the Global Forum guidelines. The government signed a bilateral
       agreement with Australia on September 26, 2013 and joined the OECD Multilateral Convention on
       Mutual Administrative Assistance on Tax Issues on December 5, 2012. It has also created a Tax
       Information Exchange Unit within the Ministry of Public Finance to support the exchange of
       information related to international taxation, as provided by Government Resolution No. 26-2014
       on the Internal Organic Regulations of the Ministry of Finance.

II.    Improved Budget Management and Increased Results-based Public Spending: The Government of
       Guatemala is committed to continue to strengthen budget processes in order to increase the
       efficiency and effectiveness of government agencies to meet current and future demand for their
       services in order to not neglect care coverage for the most vulnerable groups (social protection
       budget) and, on the other hand, to promote investment by focusing on priority projects and
       programs.

       By Decree No. 13-2013, which provides for amendments to Decree No. 101-97 Organic Budget
       Law, the Government established the rules for the implementation of results-based management in
       every ministry. Thus, as part of the progressive implementation of its Results-based Planning and
       Budgeting, Government Resolution No. 544-2013 decreed that public agencies interested in joining
       the Results-based Budget Module while executing the budget must state so in a letter to the
       Ministry. As a result of this, on December 3, 2013 and January 7, 2014, the Ministry of Culture and
       Sports and the Ministry of Economy, respectively, expressed an interest in using this module. An
       implementation mechanism between the Ministries of Finance and of Public Health and Social
       Assistance was also created to strengthen results-based management in the health sector.


                                                  40
 
        On the other hand, in order to strengthen transparency and accountability in public financial
        management, the Government undertook the following actions through Decree No. 13-2013 which
        provides for amendments to Decree No. 101-97, the Organic Budget Law: (a) the creation of the
        Single Treasury Account; (b) instructed all institutions using public funds to execute projects to
        properly report their activities to the Ministry of Finance; (c) the introduction of regulations to
        strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of external loans and grants to all public entities; and, (d)
        the instruction of all public entities to use the Integrated Financial Management System (SIAF) to
        consolidate budget and financial information.

III.     Improve social policy coordination and management. By Decree No. 01-2012, the Congress of
         the Republic of Guatemala approved the creation of the Ministry of Social Development
         (MIDES), as an agency of the executive branch responsible for steering public policies aimed at
         improving the welfare of people and vulnerable social groups who suffer from exclusion and live
         in poverty and extreme poverty, by creating opportunities and capabilities to make positive and
         lasting improvements in their lives through coordination, articulation and work in partnership with
         other public, private and civil society organizations in the context of protecting people’s human
         and constitutional rights.

        To improve social policy management, the Ministry of Social Development established the Social
        Information System (SISO) through a platform that includes: (a) information on social programs
        and policies relating to beneficiaries, geographical coverage, and costs by type of social service and
        by institutional level; and, (b) the Single Registration of Beneficiaries (RUU), which includes
        individual information on the beneficiaries of at least 75 social programs.

        Furthermore, aware that the magnitude of the food and nutrition insecurity problem requires
        comprehensive intervention actions and the participation of the public, private and social
        stakeholders, the Government of the Republic of Guatemala, launched the "Zero Hunger Plan" as
        an integrated, harmonized, coordinated and culturally relevant social and collaborative effort. This
        Plan is based on the concept of food and nutrition security expressed in the Law for Food and
        Nutritional Security, Decree No. 32-2005 of Congress.

        Article 34 on Decentralization in the Decree mentioned above, provides that at departmental,
        municipal and community levels, Urban and Rural Development Councils will form specific Food
        Security and Nutrition (SAN) committees to promote compliance with the objectives of the SAN
        Policy and its Strategic Plan, with their respective programs, projects and activities, in coordination
        with SESAN.

        In this context and in order to support the implementation of the Zero Hunger Pact, the
        Government has established 161 Municipal Councils of Food and Nutrition Security
        (COMUSANES) in priority municipalities with the highest rates of malnutrition.

Thus, the Government of the Republic of Guatemala is highly committed to the promotion and
implementation of the necessary measures to achieve higher sustainable economic growth, increased
productive investment, prioritized in the areas of health and social protection, as well as to strengthening
transparency and efficiency in public spending management, all for the purpose of increasing economic
development and improving the quality of life of the Guatemalan population, especially the most
vulnerable groups.

In this context, the financial support from the World Bank through the Second Programmatic Development
Policy Loan for US$340 million is particularly relevant and is part of the funding strategy of the General
Budget of the Nation.

                        GUATEMALA-ASSESSl\IENT LETTER FOR THE WORLD BANK

                                                     APRIL, 2014
     This letter updates the assessment ofmacroeconomic conditions made in the staffreport for the 2013
     Article IV consultation, 11·hich was discussed by the IMF Executive Board on July 25, 2013. 1 A staffvisit
    followed in November, 2013. I11e next Article IV Consultation is e:o.pected to be concluded in mid-
     September 2014. A WB/Fund FSAP update is taking place this year, with a mission having visited
     Guatemala in March.
    1.       Afacroeconomic conditions are stable. Supported by healthy private constunption, real GDP
    grew about 312 percent in 2013 (the estimated potential growth) and is projected to expand armmd the
    same rate in 2014, maintaining the output gap broadly closed. Inflation stayed within the target band of3 -
    5 percent in 2013, decreasing markedly in early 2014. The ctment account deficit worsened modestly
    from 212 to 3 percent ofGDP between 2012 and 2013. largely financed by FDI, and is expected to return
    to 2012 levels in 2014 owing mainly to higher prices for c01mnodity exports. There have been no net
    capital outflows despite higher U.S. yields, and international reserves are adequate.
    2.       Public finan ces are solid, though efforts to strengthen revenue should continue, and
    weaknesses persist in the budget p rocess. The 2013 deficit of the central govenunent was about 2 percent
    of GDP, below the budgeted 212 percent of GDP. This resulted from expenditure cutbacks caused by
    political vvrangling in congress- exacerbated by legal requirements for separate congressional
    authorization ofloans- that delayed approval of World Bank and IADB financing. Congress failed to
    pass a budget for 2014. Thus, expenditures will be executed on the basis of the 2013 budget, with some
    additional congressionally-approved spending on health and education. The fiscal stance is essentially
    neutral. which is appropriate with the deficit anticipated to rise only marginally tlus year and output at
    potential. Efforts should continue to improve implementation of the 2012 tax refonn-estimated to have
    yielded so far much less than expected because of legal challenges and admi1ustrative problems-to
    provide for more infrastructure and social spending. Budget arrears of around % percent of GDP remain
    unresolved. with a full audit still pending. Amendments to the Organic Budget Law to enhance
    transparency and efficiency of public spending are important, as is the inclusion of official financing in
    congressional approval of the budget.
    3.       Foreign exchange (FX) intervention has remained low and monetlll)l policy has beenlarge~v
    steady. FX intervention, tmder a rules-based framework, tapered off in 2012- 13 as non-FDI inflows
    moderated somewhat and by end-20 13 the quetzal appreciated slightly in nonunal tenus relative to the
    U.S. dollar. As noted earlier, Guatemala has been largely inunune to the adverse impact of U.S. exit from
    unconventional monetary policies experienced by other EMs. The downtick of inflation in early 2014 was
    in part driven by temporary price falls in food prices. The authorities have made only nunor adjustments
    to the monetary policy rate over the last year (ctmently at 4.75 percent), implying a broadly neutral
    stance, which is deemed appropriate under ctment conditions. A gradual increase in the flexibility of the
    exchange rate would be desirable.


    4.      The finan cial system appears to be sound, but efforts to strengthen bank regulation and
    supervision should continue. Bank credit has been expanding fast, especially in FX loans, but it slowed
    toward the end of2013. Banking system liquidity appears to be adequate, while capital comfortably
    exceeds regulatory requirements and non-perfomung loans are low. Nevertheless, improvements are
    needed in consolidated supervision and a gradual move to Basel III standards for capital and liquidity is
    advisable.

                  ANNEX 4: POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS


The measures supported under the proposed DPL are likely to have positive social and
poverty impacts in Guatemala.

Strengthening Tax Administration and Tax Policy

Fiscal revenues in Guatemala are very low, but further compounding the issue is the fact
that the current tax structure relies too heavily on indirect taxes, which reduces the
progressivity of the system (Figure 1). Not only tax revenues are low but most of the tax
collection comes from indirect taxes. While 32.5 percent of tax revenues are collected through
indirect taxes in the OECD countries, a much larger fraction of the fiscal revenues is raised
through indirect taxes in LAC and Guatemala (52 and 57 percent, respectively). In 2013, 66
percent of total tax revenues in Guatemala were levied through indirect taxes. Relying markedly
on taxes for which income has no bearing can place too much of the tax burden on the poor. In
fact, direct taxes are found to be more progressive in several countries in LAC, while indirect
taxation has a small effect on income inequality, undermining the redistributive capacity of the
fiscal system on the revenue side (World Bank 2014).

Building on the poverty and social impact assessment prepared for DPL1, the impact of the
tax reforms is expected to mainly impact the upper decile of the income distribution and is
unlikely to have a direct impact on the poor and vulnerable. Simulation analysis of the
distributional impact of the tax reform using the latest household survey for Guatemala
(ENCOVI 2011) shows that the direct impact of the changes in the tax code will likely be felt
only among the top income decile. Indirectly, the creation of fiscal space made possible by the


                                                      44
 
tax reforms supported by this operation is likely to be pro-poor to the extent that the increase in
expenditure is geared towards social spending.
 
The direct impact on inequality and household welfare is not expected to be strong.
Concerning the changes in tax rates for salaried workers, the reform in the income tax effectively
increased the minimum income above which individuals are taxed, from Q36,000 to Q60,000
due to the single deduction. However, the household survey data suggests that over 90 percent of
salaried workers have annual incomes below the Q60,000 floor. Also, the income tax reform
aimed to simplify the number of tax brackets (from four to two) and rates, as well as to decrease
substantially the actual tax rate. Analysis conducted under DPL1 suggests that the impact of the
income tax reform on inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, is expected to be small and
that the effect of the tax reform will only be felt in the top income decile. It is worth mentioning
that the World Bank team is currently working with the Tax Administration Agency and the
Ministry of Finance to conduct an in-depth study on the distributional effects of the 2012 tax
reform using micro data from tax declarations.

Furthermore, planned reforms intended to reduce fraud and smuggling are likely to have
positive effects on the overall economy, including better opportunities for low-income
families. Customs processes, regulations, and sanctions to curb fraud and contraband are
expected to improve the business environment, foster more competition, and strengthen
entrepreneurship and job creation. The positive effects will probably be more evident in the
formal sector which can result in the generation of more and better jobs. More formal jobs can in
turn create opportunities for low-income households to work in high-productivity jobs and thus
contribute to, and benefit from, stronger economic growth. This is of special importance
considering that workers from low-income households are disproportionally represented in the

                                                          45
 
informal sector and, in part as a result of that, have lower earnings (Figures 2 and 3).
Additionally, reforms to align customs administration with regional regulations and practices are
likely to reinforce these positive effects through more intra-regional trade of goods and services.


Enhancing Budget Management and Increasing the Results Orientation of Public Spending
and Improving the Coordination and Management of Social Policy

Low public revenue collection and limited effectiveness and efficacy of public expenditures
in Guatemala limit the capacity of the State to provide sufficient and quality basic public
goods and services. Public spending in key sectors such as education and health remain low by
regional standards. In 2011, for instance, Guatemala spent 3 percent of the GDP in education,
which is considerably lower than the rest of the countries in Central America and the average for
LAC (five percent). Similarly, health public spending was 2.3 percent of the GDP, lower than the
rest of countries in Central America and LAC as a whole (3.7 percent) (Figure 4).

Unsurprisingly, underinvestment in key social sectors translates into unsatisfactory
development outcomes, particularly in the areas of health and nutrition. Despite achieving
some progress in recent years, infant mortality in Guatemala, at 27.4 per 1,000 live births, is
almost twice as big as the rate for LAC (16.8). Similarly, almost one in two children under five is
malnourished in Guatemala compared to 12.8 percent in LAC. Deficits in the education sector,
particularly in secondary and tertiary education, are also evident (Table 1).

In addition to being modest, coverage of basic goods and services is often unequal, which
limits the set of economic opportunities for some groups of people, particularly the most
vulnerable. The chances of attaining a fully productive life are largely determined by access to
basic and quality goods and services, particularly during childhood and in early adulthood. The
Human Opportunity Index (HOI) measures how equitable is the access to these basic goods and
services (for instance, education, water, electricity and sanitation) according to individual

circumstances that are not under a child’s control, such as place of residence, gender, and
education of the household head. Computed for children 16 or younger to remove effort or
choices, it shows that Guatemala ranks poorly within the LAC Region in terms of access to basic
opportunities (World Bank 2014). The HOI for school enrollment and quality of education is
among the lowest compared to other regional countries. Furthermore, low levels of equal access
to water and sanitation in Guatemala are alarming since access to these services have a strong
influence in other childhood opportunities, such as health and education (Figure 6).

Inequitable access and quality of basic goods and services translate into weak social
outcomes among the poor and low-income households. Micro-data for Guatemala shows that

                                                                                                                                48
 
basic endowments such as education, health, and nutrition tend to deteriorate as family incomes
are lower. School attainment among household heads, a measure of human capital accumulation,
is close to four times higher in the fifth quintile of the income distribution relative to the first
quintile (8.2 v. 2.3 years of schooling, respectively). Similarly, at 2.6 years of education on
average, the school attainment for family heads in the bottom 40 percent is substantially low
(Figure 6). The incidence of malnutrition in children is also closely correlated with family
income. As shown in Figure 7, the percentage of Guatemalan children in primary school with
low-weight-for-height increases with the poverty rate of the municipality.

In this context, and given the high food insecurity in Guatemala, prior actions under the
policy areas of “improving the quality of expenditure” and “improving the coordination
and management of social policy” focus on the targeting of expenditures, and are expected
to have positive impacts on poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The prior actions focus
on improving targeting mechanisms, particularly in relation to the monitoring of the Zero Hunger
Pact, that aim to tackle infant malnutrition and maternal mortality in geographic areas with high
malnutrition rates and to improve the overall results-orientation and coordination of social
policies.

Indeed, countries that have adopted performance-based budgeting and management
instruments are likely to increase the efficiency of public expenditures, which could largely
benefit the poor and vulnerable. Efforts to increase public budget and management
transparency have been adopted in several countries in the region. Cross-sectional data for LAC
seem to suggest that among countries with similar levels of public expenditures in the social

outcomes. For instance, infant mortality rate is lower, and secondary school enrollment higher, in
countries such as Chile, Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay or Brazil, which have adopted results-
based budgeting more broadly, as opposed to countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and
Nicaragua (Figure 9 and Figure 10). It is expected that an improvement in the efficiency of
public expenditures will benefit more the poor and vulnerable, since they are the ones with the
weakest social outcomes.

Creating additional fiscal space and enhancing the effectiveness of public expenditures,
both supported by this DPL series, can help Guatemala close gaps across regions. An
examination of the execution of public expenditures in Guatemala shows that actual expenditures
are not sufficiently pro-poor. While the levels of poverty vary considerably across municipalities
in Guatemala, public resources do not seem to be spent more than proportionally in areas with
the largest fraction of people in need. As shown in Figure 8, there is not a clear association
between public expenditures (measured by the total public expenditures per capita) and the
incidence of poverty (measured by the moderate poverty headcount and extreme moderate
poverty) across municipalities. While budget execution is probably partly constrained by low
capacity in the poorer municipalities, additional resources and mechanisms to track their
allocation and efficiency could help address these disparities.

Stronger social protection and risk management systems are necessary to protect the well-
being of vulnerable households affected by severe natural shocks. The geographic location of
Guatemala makes it prone to frequent and high-intensity geological and weather-related shocks
such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, storms, and hurricanes. In fact, the Global
Climate Risk Index places Guatemala in the 12th place worldwide according to the number of
extreme weather events recorded between 1991 and 2010. The largest most recent event,
Tropical Storm Agatha, which hit the country in 2010 and dropped the largest rainfall since
1963, illustrates well the high vulnerability of the population –particularly low income families–
to natural risks. An impact analysis found that the storm reduced the overall per capita
consumption among affected households by close to 6 percent (Figure 11). The fall in
consumption forced households to cut back on food expenditures, which could further deteriorate
food security and increase malnutrition. Affected households in urban areas, the most hardly hit
by the shock, saw an increase of over 5 percentage points in the poverty rate.

Improving targeting mechanisms for public spending is a necessary step to accelerate
poverty reduction in Guatemala. A clear example is the CCT “Mi Bono Seguro” (formerly
known as “Mi Familia Progresa”) that Guatemala started to implement in 2008 to alleviate
poverty among the poorest and encourage investments in the human capital of children of poor
families. According to program rules, families are deemed eligible on the basis of a proxy-means
system that is intended to channel resources to the poorest segments of the rural population.
Coverage expanded considerably over time so that the program currently serves about one out
three households in Guatemala, with a significant coverage in rural areas. However, the targeting
effectiveness of the program can be improved substantially. Cross-referencing the ranking of
municipalities according to the share of the population covered by the CCT program (a value of
1 indicates the municipality with highest coverage) with extreme poverty rates at the
municipality level, shows a positive but weak correlation. While rural municipalities with higher
rates of extreme poverty show on average slightly higher coverage than the rest of rural
municipalities, it is possible to find many municipalities with above-average extreme poverty
rates that also have relatively low coverage of the CCT program (Figure 12).

The benefits of strengthening the targeting of public social spending are substantial (Figure
11). Simple simulations of geographically targeting a hypothetical lump sum public transfer
intervention (equivalent to 0.5 percent of the GDP) at different levels of disaggregation illustrate
the gains in terms of poverty reduction. The analysis draws from the 2011 rural municipal
poverty map to show that geographic targeting at the municipal level would reduce poverty by an
additional 5 percentage points, compared to a geographic targeting at the department level. The
relative reduction in poverty is even larger (12 percentage points) when compared to a system
that provides uniform transfer to the entire population.

High extreme and moderate poverty in Guatemala are the manifestation of glaring
shortfalls in terms of human capital, access to markets and economic opportunities, and
social and economic inclusion. More than half of the population in Guatemala was deemed poor
in 2011, whereas the corresponding value for rural areas is over 70 percent. Not surprisingly, the
high levels of poverty are strongly correlated with underlying shortages in other areas that are
likely to contribute to such high incidence. For instance, 101 out of the 128 municipalities (79
percent) with levels of illiteracy above the national average have 70 percent or more of their
population in conditions of poverty. Likewise, most of the municipalities that have over half of
their children malnourished are also the municipalities with the largest fraction of people in
poverty. Additionally, municipalities where poverty is rife are those that are father away from the
capital city and in which more than half of their population are indigenous, signaling limited
access to markets and weak social inclusion (Figure 15).
