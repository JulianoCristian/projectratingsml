It consists of a new tire\n            manufacturing plant at Zalau to produce annually one million\n            all steel, radial truck tires and a new tire manufacturing\n            plant at Drobeta-Turnu Severin to produce annually 15,000\n            tractor tires and 20,000 OTR tires. Tires produced in the\n            two plants will be used in virtually all phases of\n            Romania's continuing development effort, including\n            agricultural mechanization, major civil construction and\n            transport of goods. Substantial transfer of technology will\n            take place as a consequence of financing the OTR tire\n            component of the project. About 4,300 new jobs will be\n            created, and net foreign exchange benefits are estimated at\n            about US$150 million annually. Technical risks associated\n            with Romanian manufacture of equipment and the possibility\n            of commercial risk in concentrating tire exports in other\n            COMECON countries have been reviewed and are considered acceptable."}, "docdt": "1978-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
