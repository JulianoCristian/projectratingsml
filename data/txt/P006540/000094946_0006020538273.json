    Lessons learned from the project design of this project\n            include: 1) A clear distinction should be made between a\n            long-term project/program goal and a short- to medium-term\n            project objective. 2) Monitoring and evaluation indicators\n            should be better designed to capture the impact of\n            incremental and partial project intervention. This project\n            was complex and risky. If future projects are to adopt the\n            comprehensive river basin approach, the following lessons\n            should be incorporated into the project design and\n            preparation process: a) The project should be a part of a\n            long-term strategic program. b) To facilitate creation of\n            the river basin agency, introduction of water use and\n            pollution fees, and drafting and enactment of the necessary\n            legal framework, the project should make budget provision\n            for the agency, promote creation of a transitional\n            institution or \"embryo\" unit that would take the\n            lead in the creation of the agency, ensure that users and\n            communities are well informed, and ensure that the legal\n            covenants applicable are realistic and so do not affect the\n            consensus building process adversely. c) Project\n            Coordination Unit personnel should be selected not only on\n            technical qualifications but also on capacity to coordinate\n            a range of government agencies at different levels to lead\n            the reform agenda. d) Risks should be identified and\n            addressed upfront."}, "docdt": "2000-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
