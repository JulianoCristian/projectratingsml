in Brazil. The project consists of five main\n            components: (i) flood control and urban drainage, including\n            macrodrainage of all rivers and creeks in the water basin;\n            (ii) municipal and industrial sewage collection and\n            treatment; (iii) municipal and industrial solid waste\n            collection and disposal, which includes improvements in\n            solid waste collection in the area and a sanitary landfill;\n            (iv) urbanization including the creation of public areas,\n            restoration of vegetation and resettlement; and (v)\n            environmental protection and waterbasin management,\n            including studies for the protection of the das Velhas river\n            and control of industrial pollution in the area and\n            institutional strengthening of the State Environmental\n            Agency (FEAM)."}, "docdt": "1992-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
