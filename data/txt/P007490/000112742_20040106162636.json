By request from the government, the\n            privatization objective and component was eliminated from\n            the project.  Factors generally subject to government\n            control included: macroeconomic performance, resistance to\n            change, and counterpart funding delays.  Factors generally\n            subject to implementing agency control included: delays in\n            recruiting qualified staff, delays in implementing the\n            procurement component, and limited progress in implementing\n            the Human Resources and Financial Management Information\n            Systems  (HRMIS/FMIS).  Lessons learned include the\n            following:  Macroeconomic stability is critical to the\n            sustainability of the public sector modernization process.\n            Greater managerial and financial autonomy is essential to\n            realize the full benefits of modernization. Aligning of\n            incentives is critical to support long-term sustainability.\n            Improve internal accounting systems is essential for\n            informed decision-making.
