    support the Basic Education Support Program of Guinea-Bissau\n            which aims to: (i) expand moderately the coverage of basic\n            education by overcoming impediments to school access and\n            student progression in the school system; (ii) improve the\n            quality of school inputs and the classroom environment; and\n            (iii) improve human and financial resource management in\n            basic education.  As the first stage in a 10-year education\n            sector development program, the project will help to\n            establish the institutional and educational conditions\n            necessary to expand and achieve quality basic education in\n            the country by the year 2010.  The project will help the\n            Government implement a strategy comprising: (i) improvement\n            of school facilities; (ii) enhancement of the\n            teaching-learning process; (iii) implementation of a\n            mechanism to assure the timely payment of teacher salaries;\n            (iv) improvement of human resource management in the\n            Ministry of Education (MOE); (v) strengthening of\n            educational capability for planning, management and\n            evaluation; and (vi) laying the institutional groundwork for\n            the next projects and a sector policy framework.  The\n            project consists of the following components: 1) basic\n            education access, including basic education infrastructure;\n            education planning and management system; and policy and\n            program for promotion of girls' schooling; 2) basic\n            education quality, comprising textbooks and pedagogical\n            materials; in-service teacher training; and pilot education\n            initiatives; and 3) education management, consisting of\n            human and financial resource organization; preparatory and\n            prospective studies; and project coordination unit."}, "docdt": "1997-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
