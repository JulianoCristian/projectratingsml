{"cdata!": "The Basic Education Support Project had\n            a satisfactory outcome, unlikely sustainability, and\n            negligible institutional development impact.  The\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory, while that of the\n            borrower was unsatisfactory.  Exterior factors, namely civil\n            conflict and political upheaval, impeded the projects\n            implementation and it, to a large degree, substituted for an\n            absent Ministry of Education.  Several lessons were learned\n            for future projects in countries with fragile states: A) NGO\n            Partnership program. An important innovation for the project\n            and a key factor in the classroom construction program was\n            the incorporation of a larger number of development actors\n            in the implementation of the project. B) Risk Assessment.\n            The undertaking of a serious, detailed risk assessment by\n            the country team would have helped to steer the project in a\n            more sustainable path and/ or to find other strategies to\n            support a failing education sector. C) Preserving\n            Investments in Institutional Capacity. A potential solution\n            to the loss of hands-on experience and formal capacity\n            training would be to build in a transition strategy for the\n            PCU itself at project inception to evolve the organization\n            into an NGO or Foundation at the end of the project. D)\n            Sustainability Plan. In a post-conflict environment\n            alternative arrangements need to be considered for any\n            investments requiring recurrent cost financing.  E) Stronger\n            Incentives Structure. A monetary incentive system lacks\n            basic non-monetary incentives to motivate its public\n            servants (e.g. certificate or recognition). F)\n            Restructuring of Project. In retrospect, the project should\n            have been restructured to more clearly delineate the revised scope."}, "docdt": "2005-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
