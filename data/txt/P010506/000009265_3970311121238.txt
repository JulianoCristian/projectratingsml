MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR MADHYA PRADESH FORESTRY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to India for the equivalent of SDR 39.4 million (US$58.0 million), on standard IDA terms, with
a maturity of 35 years, to help finance a Madhya Pradesh Forestry Project.
2.    Background. About 22 percent of the land area of India, or about 73 million hectares, is
covered by forests which play an important role in the conse. vation of environmental quality. The
contribution of the forestry sector to GNP has been estimated at less than two percent, but this does
not take into account non-market and external benefits, illegally-harvested fuelwood and timber, nor
the importance of the forests to supporting the cattle population. Most of India's forests are
degraded and productivity is poor. Forest degradation is believed to be increasing with the rising
population and over-exploitation of grazing resources in forested areas. Government is addressing
the problems of the forestry sector through policy reformns, legislation and afforestation. The National
Forest Policy, revised in 1988, treats forests: first as an ecological necessity; second as a source of
goods for use by local populations, with particular emphasis on non-timber forest products; and tird
as a source of wood and other products for industries and other non-local uses. The policy
encourages industries to obtain raw materials from farn forestry. The Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-
97) further emphasizes investments for reforestation and rehabilitation of degraded forests, and for
farm forestry.
3.    The state of Madhya Pradesh, the largest in India, covers about 14 percent of the geographical
area of the country. It encompasses the major part of the highlands of central India and constitutes
parts of the upper catchments of five principal river systems. Maintenance of the ecological balance
in the state is, therefore, of critical national importance. About 20 percent of the nation's forests lie
within Madhya Pradesh amounting to about 15.5 million ha of legally designated forest. Of this,
about 60 percent is closed forest, with canopy cover of greater than 40 percent, and the remainder
is open forest with less than 40 percent canopy cover. Rising human and animal populations put
increasing pressure on the forest resources, reflected in both degradation and an increase in the
proportion of open forests.
4.    Future Development of the Foresty Sector in Madhya Pradesh. The objectives of the
future development of the forestry sector in Madhya Pradesh would be, in accordance with the
National Forest Policy of 1988: to ensure environmental stability and maintain ecological balance;
to conserve the national biological heritage; to increase substantially the forest and tree cover in
forest and farm lands; to increase the productivity of forests; and to give people responsibility for
the management of forests and trees to achieve these objectives. Since these objectives represent a
major change from the traditional objectives for the forest sector, a new strategy for the future
development of the sector has been formulated by GOMP. This strategy would involve: changes in
the sectoral policy framework and the approach of MPFD; changes in planning, monitoring and
evaluation procedures and related information management; and changes in program implementation



2
that emphasize participation of people in the management of forest resources. To realize these
changes would require training for staff and communities, so human resource development would be
a crucial element of the strategy. Implementation of the strategy would be based on programs related
to a classification of the state according to management objectives as follows:
Area                          Primary Management Objcctivcs
(1)    Conservation Armas     Conservation of biodiversity
(ii)   Closed Forests         Maintenance of forest cover
Timber and NTFP production
(iii)   Open Forests         Increase in forest cover
Production of local community requirements for forest products
(iv)   Private and Community Lands  Private and community forestry
(v)    Village common Innds in  Production of local community requirements for forcst products
forest fringe areas
5.    Project Objectives and Design. The main objective of the project would be to assist with
the implementation of the GOMP strategy for development of the forestry sector in Madhya Pradesh.
More specifically the objectives are: to develop the necessary human resources for the planning,
implementation and monitoring of the strategy; to ensure that management pr,ocedures and the
structure and resources of MPFD are appropriate to its role as the nodal public sector agency in the
forestry sector; to assist with the prioritization of various types of land through improved planning
at a macro-scale; to increase both forest cover and productivity through development of participatory
processes for management and use of forest resources, taking special account of the interests of tribal
peoples and other disadvantaged groups; to adapt and improve existing technologies and to provide
technical and management advice; to improve incentives for forest management and the cultivation
of trees; and to promote the conservation of biodiversity.
6.    Future development of the forestry sector in Madhya Pradesh will involve long-term programs,
so a strategic plan is needed for the provision of IDA support to the sector over a period of about ten
years. Given the area of forest in Madhya Pradesh and its economic and environmental impo,tance
to both the state and the nation, investments over a ten-year period could total more than US$200
million. However, the GOMP strategy for the sector, described above, involves substantial change
in the way the sector is managed and the introduction of innovative new programs for participatory
management of forests. Lessons from previous Bank lending show that these changes take time and
may slow implementation. Consequently, strategic planning for the provision of IDA support to the
sector, is based on a two-stage approach. The first stage would be a project of four years duration,
which is described below. This is designed to allow MPFD to develop the new processes, systems
and skills required for implementation of the new GOMP strategy and to provide for necessary
investments in the sector. Project support for improved management would have an impact on the
sector as a whole. Investments in forest development and management would be initiated throughout
the state, but in a small proportion of the 15.4 million ha of forest land and in a representative
number of the 30,000 villages located in forest fringe areas. These would form the basis of larger
scale investments that could be provided in a second-stage project, that would build on experience
gained, and incorporate any necessary modifications to programs and processes initiated during the
first stage project. Approval for such a second stage project could be sought during the fourth year



3
of implementation of the first stage. It is not possible to be precise about its magnitude as it would
depend on implementation experience.  However, it can be assumed that successful forest
development programs would grow exponentially, so investments would be correspondingly greater.
7.    Project Description. The project area would cover the entire State of Madhya Pradesh. The
project is designed to be of four years duration, forming the first stage of planned long-term support
to the sector. Approval for a second-stage project of up to five years duration would be sought
during the last year of implementation of the first stage. This flexible design allows MPFD to
develop the new processes, systems and skills required for implementation of the National Forest
Policy and to modify these in the light of experience as necessary. The project would have four main
components as follows: (i) Management Development to improve the management of the sector
through: changing the approach of MPFD from a predominantly regulatory role, to one in which
communities are treated as partners in the management of forest resources; increasing policy analysis
capabilities; and improving the management skills of senior MPFD staff, supported by the
introduction of improved management systems, for planning, implementation, monitoring and
evaluation procedures, together with improved management information and geographical information
systems; and (ii) Forest Development involving: (a) the promotion of natural forest regeneration,
supported by enrichment planting, improved silvicultural practices, and forest floor management over
an area of about 165,000 ha; and (b) a Village Resource Development Program (VRDP) based on
participatory planning and management of forest resources, integrated with activities to generate
alternative incomes or resources, to reduce the pressure on the forests. A total of about 1,140 villages
would be involved, managing an area of about 74,000 ha of forest land. The phasing of activities for
this component would be determined by progress in training staff in participatory planning; (iii)
Extension, Technology and Research programs with provision of necessary infrastructure and
facilities for the development of extension and research service centers in each ecological zone,
coupled with staff training, providing a base for improved forestry extension services, tree seed
improvement programs, demonstration nurseries and adaptive research trials; and (iv) Biodiversity
Conservation through improved management of 12 high priority Protected Areas (PAs) by providing
support for development of management plans, staff training, equipment and facilities. Special Funds
would be created to support the development of alternative resources or income for communities
resident within PAs and in areas peripheral to them. A lower level of project funding would be
available for 12 lower priority PAs, whilst the identification and planning of linkages to complete the
PA Network would be financed.
8.    Project Implementation. The organintion of the project would be integrated fully with the
coordination and management of the regular program of MPFD, which would be the main
implementing agency. A Project Unit within MPFD would be responsible for administration of
project finances and procurement, but the Departmental Technical Working Groups would ensure the
technical quality of project funded activities. Mechanisms would be established to ensure
coordination of project-financed activities with those of other agencies whose programs affect forest
land, such as the Tribal Development Authority, and the Departments of Rural Development,
Agriculture, and Animal Husbandry. These include a Project Steering Committee that would provide
high-level coordination of the project, with Regional and District Committees providing coordination
at the field level. NGOs would make a major contribution to the implementation of the VRDP and



4
the Ecodevelopment Program, as many have experience of participatory processes. The collaboration
of suitably experienced NGOs would be sought to assist with the orientation and training of MPFD
staff and with the implementation of village-level planning and programs.
9.    Project Sustainability. The sustainability of the project is dependent on the long-term GOMP
commitment to improved management of forest resources. This commitment is evidenced by the
GOMP endorsement of the National Forest Policy, and its willingness to make policy and institutional
changes to facilitate the implementation of the national policy, and involve the private sector and
NGOs in the development of the sector.
10.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The Bank has supported ten projects in the
field of forestry and resource conservation in India, with lending in the amount of US$500 million.
Past forestry projects in India mainly supported social forestry and watershed protection activities
which have had mixed success. Many of the projects encountered implementation problems causing
delay in disbursement and completion due to slow project mobilization, institutional weaknesses and
inadequate local funding. More recent forestry projects such as those in West Bengal and
Maharashtra were designed to provide more comprehensive support to the forest sector as a wh^le.
Based on the earlier experience, both projects provided for improved forest technology, adaptive
research, extension, planning and human resource development. In addition, the projects were
designed to support the introduction of important policy and institutional reform programs, but
implementation of these aspects of the projects has been much slower than expected. The design of
the proposed project would take these lessons into account by seeking early agreement with GOMP
on: a strategy for the future development of the sector and associated implementation programs;
necessary policy and institutional reforms; mechanisms for the improvement of sector management;
and appropriate human resource development programs. The findings of the recent World Bank
Forest Sector Review in India (Report No. 10965-IN), the OED report on Forestry Development - A
review of Bank Experience (Report No. 9524), the Bank's forest policy paper and the strategy for
forestry in Asia have also been taken into consideration.
I1.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The introduction of a new strategy for the future
development of the forestry sector in Madhya Pradesh for the implementation of the National Forestry
Policy, and the associated changes in sector management and policies require long-term commitments.
The Bank is one of the few institutions that could provide the necessary continuity of support. In
addition, the Bank's involvement in similar state forestry projects provides a mechanism for
transferring up-to-date practical experience with project implementation. This experience enables the
Bank to engage in a constructive dialogue on sector management issues with both state and central
governments. The Bank is also in a position to ensure that improved technology will be made
available to MPFD in a timely manner, both through its support for the national Forestry Research,
Education and Extension Project, and through linkages with international forestry research
organizations. The proposed project would be consistent with the Bank's strategy for India, as
discussed in the Country Assistance Strategy of May 1994, which seeks to promote increased
agricultural productivity through better selection of investments and more efficient public sector
management. It is also consistent with the objectives of the Bank's forestry policy and the Asia
Region's strategy for lending, which links policy dialogue with major investments in the forest sector.

12.   Agreed Actions. A strategy for the future development of the forest sector in Madhya
Pradesh has been formulated and a statement of policies and actions that will constitute the framework
for improving the management of forests in Madhya Pradesh was issued by GOMP prior to
negotiations. During negotiations with Gover,ument, the following assurance and agreements were
obtained:
Conditions of Effecfiveness. Two conditions of effectiveness were agree: (a) All necessary
actions for removing restrictions on felling of trees on private land would be taken; (b) A contract,
based on Terms of Reference agreed with IDA would be agreed with consultants acceptable to IDA,
to assist with the proposed review of the management of the system.
Other Assurances. These relate to actions to ensure timely implementation of project
activities and amongst others include: (a) The consultancy to assist with the review of the
management of the sector would be completed by June 30, 1996, its findings discussed with IDA, and
agreed modifications to management procedures and structures introduced not later than June 30,
1997; (b) By December 31 of each year, starting December 31, 1995, a Project Implementation Plan
(PIP) would be prepared in consultation with IDA, for the following financial year. However, for the
first year of the project, the PIP would be prepared no later than July 31, 1995; (c) A Human
Resource Development Plan for MPFD, linked to proposed changes in the management system, would
be developed and reviewed with IDA by June 30, 1996. In addition, an annual training plan would
be prepared not later than July 31 of each year; (d) Implementation of the VRDP and Ecodevelopment
Program would be in accordance with procedures agreed with IDA. Proposals for iunding would be
selected in accordance with criteria agreed with IDA. The first three proposals for funding under both
programs would be submitted to IDA for approval; (e) By December 31, 1995: the State Forest
Research Institute (SFRI) would be established as an autonomous agency with objectives and
responsibilities agreed with IDA; the Research Advisory Committee would be reconstituted with a
membership as agreed with IDA; research posts at SFRI for a tree improvement specialist and a seed
technologist would be filled; and that consultants to assist with the development of a research strategy
would be recruited; (f) The objectives and terns of reference for contract research would be agreed
with IDA not later than June 30, 1997; (g) The five Conservator Forests (Wildlife) would be
appointed no later than September 30, 1995 and the coordinator for wildlife research would be
appointed in SFRI no later than December 31, 1995; (h) There would be no involuntary relocation
of communities resident within PAs, and any proposals for relocation would be preceded by an
independent study to assess the impact of the communities on the conservation of biodiversity. All
proposals would be consistent with GOI provisions and would be agreed with IDA in the light of the
Bank's OD 4.20 and OD 4.30. In addition, an independent monitoring program established; (i) Areas
which impact on PAs would be identified on the basis of criteria agreed with EDA; PA managers
would have the responsibility and sufficient staff to undertake ecodevelopment programs in these
areas; at least two trained Ecodevelopment Planning Teams would be appointed not later than March
31, 1995; and that responsibilities are defined to avoid duplication of the work of Territorial staff.
13.   Poverty Category. Program of Targeted Interventions. The project main beneficiaries, tribal
peoples and forest fringe villagers, belong to the poorest sections of society. Tribal development
concems are central to the project and are addressed in an integral fashion under the rubric of social



6
impact, participation and equity, rather than as a subsidiary tribal developmcnt plan. The projcct also
incorporates specific measures to safeguard the interests of the landless and women, through
participation in village committees, employment preference, and gender sensitive monitoring.
14.   Environmental Aspects. An environmental review, undertaken during project appraisal,
concluded that all project activities would have very low environmental impact potentials and that the
project would have beneficial effects on the environment. The project addresses many of the
priorities in the India Environmental Action Programme, 1993. Specifically: conservation and
sustainable utilization of biodiversity in selected ecosystems, including conservation of endangered
plant and animal species and critical habitats; afforestation, based on community participation in forest
protection and management in watershed and other areas; wasteland development involving private
and commiunity tree planting; and soil and water conservation. Other environmental benefits may
include CO2 absorption, river flow regulation, and meso-climatic and other effects.
15.   Program Objective Categories. The project would include activities that would benefit triPlal
peoples and the poor, including women, as participatory management of forested lands would -esult
in an increased availability of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP), an important source of income
for these groups. Women are the predominant collectors of fodder, fuelwood and NTFPs and would
benefit considerably from the project. The proposed Joint Forest Management (JFM) arrangements
would significantly enhance the availability of many forest products that are collected to provide for
household needs and secondary income. Effective participation of women in JFM arrangements
would be critical to ensure sustained management of the resource. The project, therefore, includes
a number of mechanisms to ensure the participation of women and the representation of their
interests.
16.   Participatory Approach. The design of the VRDP is based on experience in over 200
villages in Madhya Pradesh, and many more villages elsewhere in India, of joint forest management
and ecodevelopment programs. Both programs are entirely based on community participation in the
planning and management of forest lands used by the community. NGO experience of similar
participatory programs would be used for training MPFD staff and in implementation.
17.   Benefits. The project would increase, directly or indirectly, tfie production of wood, NTFP,
and animal products which would benefit the rural poor and improve the supply of wood to forest-
based industries. The project would support a program of assisted natural regeneration in about
165,000 ha of forest. About 1,140 village communities, of which a very high percentage would btz
tribal peoples, participating in the management of about 75,000 ha of forest would receive direct
benefits from the project. The benefits include not only the improved access for communities to
forest products, but also the benefits of improved agriculture and alternative income generating
activities generated through the Village Resource Development Program and the Ecodevelopment
Program. The project would have important benefits in terms of equity as about 18.3 million person-
days of employment would be generated, a benefit which would be almost wholly captured by the
poorest and landless households. Processors and marketers of wood and NTFPs would also benefit
through increased supply of raw material. The direct and quantifiable economic costs and benefits
of the project are mainly due to investments in both closed and open forests. The Economic Rate of



7
Rzturn (ERR) for the projcct as a whole, in terms of di' .ct forestry outputs, and excluding the
biodiversity and researchi components, is estimated at lI .5 percent. However, this understates project
bencfits as significant indirect and environmental benefits have not been included. These are benefits
such ns: protection and management in watershed and other areas, including measures to reduce soil
erosion and improve moisture conservation; maintenance of biodiversity, including conservation of
endangered plant and animal species and critical habitats; and increased productivity of the forest to
reduce pressure on the environment. Other environmental benefits inay include CO2 absorption, river
flow regulation, and meso-climatic and other effects. These were calculated by means of an
environmental premium, associated with each hectare included in the project, to reflect the flow of
external benefits, which is estimated to be about US$12 per hectare per year.
18.   Risks. The main risks facing the project are: (i) the degree of commitment within GOMP to
make the necessary policy and institutional changes that would be necessary for the implementation
of the agreed strategy for the sector; (ii) the effective.aess of participatory arrangements for the
management of forest resources; (iii) the ability of MPFD to provide the private sector with
technological advice, in order to take advantage of a changed policy environment. The first risk is
being addressed through agreement on a sectoral strategy with associated policy changes formalized
through the issue of necessary Government Orders. In addition, as this four-year project forms the
first stage of a planned phased approach to sectoral development, it provides a means for GOMP to
demonstrate commitment to change. The project would minimize the second risk through an intensive
program of training for staff in the principles and practice of participatory forest management, through
building links with NGOs and other government departments involved in village development, and
by rigorous monitoring and evaluation of the program. Project support for forest extension programs,
research programs targeted on the needs of producers, and the creation of an Industrial Liaison Unit
within MPFD would reduce the third type of risk associated with the project.
19.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
