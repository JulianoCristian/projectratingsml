Project will\n            assist with the implementation of the Government of Madhya\n            Pradesh (GOMP) strategy for development of the forestry\n            sector in Madhya Pradesh. Future development of the forestry\n            sector in Madhya Pradesh will involve long-term programs, so\n            a strategic plan is needed for the provision of the\n            International Development Association's support to the\n            sector over a period of about ten years. Given the area of\n            forest in Madhya Pradesh and its economic and environmental\n            importance to both the state and the nation, investments\n            over a ten-year period could total more than US$200 million.\n            However, the GOMP strategy for the sector, involves\n            substantial change in the way the sector is managed and the\n            introduction of innovative programs for participatory\n            management of forests. The project will have the following\n            four main components: (a) management development to improve\n            the management sector; (b) forest development; (c)\n            extension, technology and research programs; and (d)\n            biodiversity conservation."}, "docdt": "1995-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
