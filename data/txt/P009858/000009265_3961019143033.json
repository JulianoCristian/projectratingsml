The specific Project objectives were to:\n            (a) assist in strengthening the operational and financial\n            roles of Kerala Water Authority (KWA), by promoting manpower\n            development and operational efficiency; (b) provide piped\n            water supplies to about one million people residing in seven\n            rural areas; (c) increase the supply of water and extend the\n            distribution facilities in one urban area to about 150,000\n            people; and (d) introduce low-cost on-site sanitation Low\n            Cost Sanitation (LCS) facilities and finance their\n            construction so as to benefit about 200,000 people residing\n            in ten urban areas and to undertake a similar pilot program\n            for low-cost sanitation in rural areas. Bank\u2019s performance\n            was not satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was less\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were: (i) many of the\n            problems of implementation which beset this project could\n            have been foreseen and arose from poor identification and\n            preparation; (ii) the single most important conclusion to\n            emerge from the project management experience, therefore, is\n            that greater effort both by Bank and borrower needs to go\n            into these early stages of the project cycle; (iii)\n            appraisal should occur only when the project is truly ready;\n            and (iv) a subsidiary conclusion for similar projects in the\n            future in India and elsewhere is that field level\n            supervision effort by the Bank needs to be substantial\n            during the early stages of implementation to ensure that the\n            Project remains firmly on the rails."}, "docdt": "1995-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
