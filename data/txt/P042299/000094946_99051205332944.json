structural reform effort. The project consists of two\n            components. The first component supports reform and\n            institutional development. It supports strengthening the\n            institutions involved in the Government's economic\n            policies based on Government priorities, provides support to\n            programs associated with policy reform; and strengthens the\n            capacity of provincial finance bureaus and project\n            implementing agencies to manage implementation of Bank and\n            non-Bank financed projects involved in fostering sustainable\n            development. The second component supports pre-investment\n            and project preparation. It finances consultants'\n            services, training, and equipment required for the\n            preparation of feasibility studies. Subprojects under the\n            first component include institutional strengthening of\n            Chinese academic institutes and government agencies,\n            demonstration zones, and finance bureaus. The second\n            component includes subprojects concerned with sustainable\n            forestry, water conservation, flood control, water supply,\n            agricultural development, and river basin pollution."}, "docdt": "1999-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
