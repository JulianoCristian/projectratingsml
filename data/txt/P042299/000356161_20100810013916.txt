1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

China achieved a sustained economic growth since 1978 following its opening up to the outside
world and reform. Nevertheless, at the time of the project appraisal in Fiscal Year 1999, China
was in the midst of its economic transformation from a centrally­planned to a market economy.
Therefore benefits from the next stages of reform in the financial sector, and public finance in
particular, would be significant. China succeeded in reducing substantially the incidence of
poverty during the period of 1978-1985, but progress since then became more difficult to achieve.
Therefore the Government needed to maintain the momentum of structural reforms to attain its
objective of sustained rapid growth with stability. Under such circumstances, the Government's
Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000) called for actions in five key areas: (a) reforms in banking,
state enterprises, and public finance; (b) infrastructure improvement in the interior regions in
particular; (c) social development, including in particular poverty reduction; (d) sustained and
stable growth in agriculture; and (e) balancing the rapid economic growth, natural resource use,
urbanization and industrialization with a safe and healthy environment for present and future
generations.

The Bank Group's strategy supported these objectives and proposed interventions in a wide range
of sectors and provinces to foster economic and social development through both development
and technical assistance projects and economic studies. This Technical Cooperation Project was
a critical project in China's portfolio as it would allow the Bank to be involved in critical areas
not always amenable to lending support innovation and strengthen organizations in poorer
provinces. It leveraged a relatively small amount of IDA funds over a broad range of important
issues.

Implementation of the project is therefore fully consistent with the government priorities and the
Bank's CAS.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of this project was to provide continued support to the Government of China
(GOC) in its economic and structural reform effort. This would be achieved through: (a)
strengthening institutions that were key to GOC's ongoing but unfinished economic and structural
reform agenda; (b) developing selected economic and structural reform programs which
addressed priority needs of GOC; (c) strengthening agencies involved in poverty reduction and
rural development; and (d) improving preparation of projects involved in fostering sustainable
development .

Key performance indicators at the time of appraisal included: (a) establishment of a national
economic forecasting system; (b) establishment of demonstrative regional models for disaster
prevention and control; (c) number of economic and structural reform activities undertaken; (d)
number of people involved in design of economic reform and/or poverty alleviation programs
who receive training; (e) satisfactory feasibility study reports and procurement documentation
prepared.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification



                                                1
PDO was not adjusted throughout the project implementation.

Nevertheless, more and specific key indicators targeting on individual subprojects were added
with the approval of additional subprojects and after consultations with the Borrower. The
justifications are as follows: (a) The original results framework of this project was weak and
incomplete. Some of the original indicators, such as indicators c, d and e above, are very general
and lack a baseline value. They do not provide a sound basis for monitoring progress or
outcomes. This is partly because that this project was designed as early as 1996 and approved in
1999. (b) This is a highly demand-driven umbrella project, with 42 operations financed
throughout the project life. Therefore it was not possible for the project to identify all the specific
indicators at the time of PAD. (c) It is more appropriate and meaningful to monitor and evaluate
outcome achievement at subproject level, and incorporate a revised results framework at ICR
stage. (d) The approach was endorsed by management.

In summary, key performance indicators at the time of appraisal are therefore elaborated as
follows:

For PDO (a) and PDO (c):
    1) Establishment of a national economic forecasting system
    2) Enhanced agricultural policy analysis and decision making support
    3) Enhanced work efficiency of poverty reduction offices, strengthened capacity in
    agricultural demonstration through informationization
    4) Teaching reform through material and courseware development
    5) Transportation improvement in poor areas
    6) Establishment of demonstrative regional models for disaster prevention and management
    7) Enhanced capacity in performance evaluation

For PDO (b):

    8) Enhanced governance in power sector
    9) Improved legislation on the non performing debts
    10) Public finance reform implemented
    11) Regulatory mechanism for improving the balance of payments in place
    12) Fiscal data management reform implemented
    13) Taxation reform implemented
    14) Promoting city development in a highly efficient, transparent and environmental friendly
    way or promoting regional development

For PDO (d):

    15) Improved quality of investment project preparation
    16) Innovation of investment project preparation

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Main beneficiaries are the central and local government agencies and the institutions involved in
GOC's reform agenda. Other beneficiaries included government staff, technical specialists at the
grassroots units, researchers, teachers and farmers, as well as the relevant units involved in
investment lending.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project consists of two components: (a) Component A ­ Reform Support and Institutional
Development, aimed at strengthening institutions involved in GOC's economic policies based on
GOC's priorities, providing support to programs associated with policy reforms, and capacity
strengthening of Provincial Financial Bureaus/Subproject Implementing Agencies (PFBs/SIAs) in
managing implementation of Bank and non-Bank financed projects involved in fostering
sustainable development; (b) Component B ­ Pre-investment and Project Preparation Support,
financed consultants' services, training, and equipment required for the preparation of project
documents.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

Other significant changes include (a) transfer US$ 2 million from Part B to Part A; (b) two
closing date extensions; and (c) partial cancellation of loan proceeds. Details are provided in the
above Section H under the title of "restructuring".

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

A QAG Review Panel carried out an in-depth review of the quality-at-entry of the project in
March 2000. The Panel rated quality-at-entry as "marginally satisfactory", as the stated project
objectives were too broad; and the sub-project selection criteria were too vague. The main
quality problems included: (a) Objectives of some sub-projects were not clear, and some sub-
projects did not spell out the requested inputs and the expected outcomes. Relations between
inputs and outputs and between outputs and outcomes were not clear. The criteria for sub-project
selection were too broad. (b) There was no discussion of the rationale in the PAD about the need
to use a Bank loan for project preparation, since local resources were cheaper than Bank funds.
(c) There was limited technical oversight in project preparation. New and junior staffs were
assigned to prepare the project and PAD. (d) PAD was not up to the required level, with some
important assumptions underlying the operation and the critical elements being missing.

Meanwhile the QAG Review Panel believed that despite these shortcomings, many of the initial
problems were recognized and steps were to be taken to enhance the potential impact of the
project, including: (a) A skilled Task Manager of the relevant sectors would be assigned to task
management of the sub-projects in the sector, for purpose of better subproject review and
oversight. (b) An experienced overall task manager would be appointed to ensure quality of the
overall project. (c) Closer managerial attention would be paid for purpose of better project
oversight. (d) Field ­ based implementation supervision by the World Bank Office Beijing
(WBOB) would be conducted.

2.2 Implementation

Joint efforts of the Bank and Borrower teams have resulted in successful implementation of the
project. Under the project, a total of 42 subprojects were approved and implemented. Of these,


                                                3
39 are under RSID, and 3 are under PPPS. During project implementation, comments of QAG
were well taken and actions were adopted to improve the implementation quality in the following
ways: (a) Enhanced managerial attention. Project implementation and supervision was under
the direct management of the Country Director. (b) Stricter selection of Task Management. A
senior Bank staff was appointed as the Task Team Leader, who had profound knowledge about
China and good communication skills with the government agencies, and the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) in particular; and was also experienced in project and financial management. Such
selection criteria for Task Team Leader remained unchanged throughout the project
implementation. (c) Sub-Task Management. Sector specialists of the World Bank Office Beijing
(WBOB) were assigned to sub-task management of the respective sectors. They worked closely
with the Task Team Leader and were involved fully in subproject review and implementation
supervisions. (d) Improved subproject selection criteria. Apart from the general subproject
selection criteria indicated in the PAD, more specific criteria were formed, which included in
particular (i) High value added activities by Bank financing; (ii) Activities in critical sectors
where lending is being phased out due to end of IDA eligibility; (iii) Enabling the Bank to
maintain an active dialogue with critical counterpart agencies and institutions. (e) Focusing on
close relations of subproject objectives, activities, outputs and impacts. In reviewing the
subproject proposals, more attention was paid to the close relations between the subproject
objectives and activities; activities and outputs; as well as outputs and impacts. This also became
the focus of project supervision.

Actions were also taken by the Borrower in project implementation in the following aspects: (a)
Government commitment: The Government had a strong commitment to improving capacity and
introducing reforms. There was also strong demand among the beneficiaries for improving skills
and institutional capacities. In a word, motivation and accountability, as well as the strong
government commitment contributed substantially to the successful project outcomes. (b)
Formulation of project'management guidelines. With the help of the Bank's Task Team, MOF
worked out the Project Management Guidelines based on the project's Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) and legal documents and in combination with the government rules on foreign
fund utilization. (c) Serious project management: MOF has set up the project management office
in the Technical Cooperation Division under the International Department. A subproject
management office was also set up by each and every SIA, which was usually headed by a senior
management member of the SIA. Full time subproject staffs were appointed. In addition, rules
and regulations for subproject management were worked out.

While that project implementation was satisfactory in general, the project did experience a
number of setbacks and adjustments. (a) The project was not completed until after two extensions
of four years in total, yet around SDR 2.64 million credit funds remained unspent; (b) A total of
US$ 5.84 million of the loan proceeds under PPPS was cancelled, yet about US$ 3 million
remained unspent; (c) Disbursement of many subprojects was slow, causing slow disbursement of
the project, especially at the initial phases of subproject implementation; and (d) Some SIAs were
dismissed, due to government reorganization, resulting in cancellation of the subproject or weak
impacts of the subproject results. Major factors affecting project implementation are summarized
below:

Factors Not Controlled by the Government

z Nature of the project: Closing date extension was partially due to the nature of the project.
  Economic reform in China is a dynamic process. Therefore the country's needs and priorities
  are changing during the whole process of project implementation.



                                                4
z Natural and man made disasters: During project implementation, two natural and one man
  made disaster occurred, including 9.11 event in 2001, global SARS in 2003 and strong
  earthquake in 2008 in Sichuan Province. The 9.11 event affected or delayed many overseas
  trips due to visa problems. The outbreak of SARS affected almost all on-going subprojects,
  mainly in recruiting international consultants. After the Wenchuan earthquake, the central
  government called the government staff to focus on post disaster relief and rehabilitation,
  which delayed to certain extent the subproject implementation.
z Factors of other agencies: Completion of some subproject activities required data provision
  by other agencies. Delayed release of these data by other agencies affected completion of the
  subprojects, such as A1 and A29.

Factors Controlled by the Government

z Government reorganization and management changes: Government reorganization in 2003
   resulted in dismissal of the Subproject Implementing Agency of A6. While the subproject
   happened to be just completed at the time of government reorganization, it seriously affected
   on the outcome of the subproject. Turnover in local governments led to the dropping of A24
   before implementation started.
z Policy changes of the macro economic and sector agencies: Implementation of B4 was
   seriously affected when the State Council decided to stop developing Mortgage Backed
   Securities by CDB at the time when only about 16% of loan proceed was spent. The
   Decision of Shenzhen municipal government to finance construction of Shenzhen metro
   resulted in the cancellation of subproject B1.
z Inadequate needs assessment: This affected seriously PPPS, since there was limited demand
   for the IBRD loan for project preparation.
z Subproject Programming. There was inadequate subproject programming. Subproject
   requests were submitted individually in the different times of project implementation, which
   caused prolonged implementation.
z Repayment model: Under the project, the repayment responsibilities fell on SIAs. The
   project funds could be fully allocated if the repayment responsibility would be born by the
   central and local finances.

Factors Controlled by the Implementing Agencies

z  Excessive workload of the project staff in MOF TA Division: In 2006, the focus of the
   project staff of MOF TA division shifted to the preparation of "China Economic Reform
   Implementation Project" (TCC 5), which somewhat affected the new subproject processing
   under this project.
z Professional quality of the SIA staff: While China has worked closely with the Bank for
   almost 30 years, this was the first time for many SIAs to work with the Bank. It took them
   time to get acquainted with professional skills of project management, procurement and
   disbursement before they could smoothly implement their subprojects.
z More funding sources: With strengthened international cooperation, some SIAs had more
   funding sources for overseas studies and trainings, resulting in reduced spent of the project
   proceeds..
z Increased counterpart funding: Some subprojects, such as B3 increased counterpart fund by
   over US$ 8 million, resulting in the reduced use of loan proceeds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization




                                               5
Project monitoring and evaluation, implementation and utilization were designed as follows: (a)
A project launch workshop was held soon after the Board approval of the project; (b) Two formal
supervision missions were conducted every year. Regular contacts were maintained by the Task
Team with MOF and SIAs throughout the project implementation; (c) MOF and SIAs submitted
semi-annual progress reports and the annual Implementation Plans; (d) Implementation
Completion and Result Report (ICR) was requested to be prepared and submitted to the Bank
through MOF, immediately after the implementation completion of a subproject. A full project
ICR was submitted by MOF in four months after the project implementation was completed. (e)
Follow up plans for full utilization of the project/subproject results were prepared by MOF and all
SIAs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Assessment: The project was rated as C for environment assessment, hence no
EIA is required.

Financial management: The Technical Assistance (TA) Division of the International
Department of MOF had the overall responsibility for the project financial management. Each
year, the subproject entities worked out the fund utilization plans, which were submitted to the
TA Division and the Bank Task Team for endorsement following review and agreement by the
finance bureau at various levels. Each SIA produced and maintained its respective shares of
project financial activities, supporting documentation and reporting. The TA Division of MOF
was responsible for consolidation of project level reports. Annual audit reports were issued by
the National Audit Office (NAO) in six months after the end of a calendar year.

Disbursement: The special account was opened in the Investment Assessment and Evaluation
Center (IAEC) of MOF. IAEC reviewed disbursement requests of SIAs based on the endorsed
fund utilization plans, the Bank's legal documents and MOF's Guideline for project management.
Funds were disbursed to SIAs through the finance bureau at various levels.

Procurement: Procurement was carried out by SIAs in accordance with the Bank's procurement
guidelines and the legal document. Apart from prior review, ex-post reviews were conducted at
the time of supervision mission, and the post review report was prepared and attached to the Aide
Memoire of the Bank mission's supervision.

Others: All the others, including involuntary resettlement, nature habitats, pest management,
indigenous peoples, physical culture resources, forests, safety of dams, projects on international
waterways, and projects in disputed areas are not applicable to this project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

To ensure the sustainability of the outputs achieved under the project, almost all SIAs have
worked out post ­ completion operation plans, focusing on: (a) dissemination of the subproject
results, including submission of the research reports to the State Council, concerned government
agencies, and legislative establishment agencies; (b) working out plans to follow up the
recommendations of the research reports; and (c) further deepening the research to better meet the
needs of economic development.




                                                6
For example, a set of performance indicators specifically for technical assistance projects was
worked out under A28. Pilot performance evaluation of completed TCC 5 subprojects would
start soon.

Similarly, based on comments made by the experts at the final result evaluation workshop, A29
would further upgrade the databases; improve the functions of the platforms to meet the needs in
agriculture; and further enhance accuracy of forecasts, assessments and analysis; and provide
better support to the government decision. Detailed plans have been worked out for each sub-
system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

As was mentioned in paragraph 1.2 above, the project had four major objectives. Of these, the
first three remain highly relevant with substantial outcomes achieved. The Project addresses
several of the goals of the Bank's China Country Partnership Strategy at the time: (a) reforms in
banking, state enterprises and public finance; (b) infrastructure improvement in the interior
regions; (c) social development, in particular poverty reduction; (d) sustained and stable growth
in agriculture; and (e) balancing the rapid economic growth, natural resource use, urbanization,
and industrialization with a safe and healthy environment for present and future generations. The
last objective - improving the preparation of projects involved in fostering sustainable
development - was partially relevant, as the government would prefer to use more concessional
fund to prepare the investment projects. As a result, only 3 subprojects were implemented under
Part B.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Achievement of PDOs was satisfactory. Implementation of the project has resulted in numerous
research reports, special theme reports, study tour reports, network system and platforms, models,
courseware etc. Many policy recommendations have been adopted by the concerned government
agencies and are playing their due role in advancing China's economic reform in various sectors.
Others have been submitted to the concerned government agencies for their reference or adoption.
The information systems and models set up under the project have contributed substantially to
institutional capacity building and strengthening. The EIA and other documents prepared for
investment lending have helped enhance preparation quality of investment lending and capacity
building of SIAs as well. The major achievements are summarized as follows:

PDO (a) and PDO(c): Strengthening institutions key to GOC's economic and structural reform
agenda and involved in poverty reduction and rural development.

The achievements are mainly reflected in the following aspects: (a) improved economic forecast
and analysis; (b) innovative establishment of open laboratory for agriculture policy analysis and
decision making support; (c) informationization; (d) teaching material and courseware
development; (e) transportation in poor areas; (f) enhanced capacity for disaster prevention and
control; and (g) enhanced capacity in performance evaluation.

(1) Improved economic forecast and analysis. Economic forecast and analysis using economic
models in China started in 1991. However before 1999, most of the models were designed and
constructed on the basis of the planned economy. It was essential to build an economic


                                                7
forecasting model system to meet the needs of market economy. Under subproject A1, the
modeling system, including long-term forecast model, annual macro econometric model, general
equilibrium model and quarterly macro econometric models was established. As a result,
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), one of the most influential policy research
institutes in China, is now able to: (a) use the combined model to make much more accurate
economic forecast and analysis; (b) increase forecast frequency from once to twice a year (blue
paper added); (c) add a quarterly report ­ an internal report for reference of the top Chinese
leaders; and (d) prepare and submit regular and special reports on major and hot economic issues
to the economic decision making agencies, either at their request or at CASS initiation.

(2) Agriculture policy analysis and decision making support. Agriculture has always been a
priority area in China. The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) was the first
Academy engaging in agricultural economic research. Providing the central government with in-
depth analysis and policy recommendations is its major responsibility. Before the subproject, a
traditional qualitative analysis was used. Lack of databases and modern models also affected
accuracy of the analysis. To better serve policy makers, a national agricultural policy analysis
platform and decision making support system were established under subproject A29, which
covered 18 sub-systems, covering almost all aspects of agriculture. Supported by special
economic analysis and statistics software, dynamic links between these sub-systems were
analyzed..      With establishment of the open laboratory, the traditional research method was
replaced by a more comprehensive approach. It also achieved man-machine dialogue, open
networks and platform sharing.

Over 30 research results have been adopted and applied by various government agencies, research
institutes, universities and the various localities. For example, the research result on the impact of
a new round WTO agricultural framework agreement on China's agriculture and
recommendations on negotiation produced by the sub-system of "China's agriculture and medium
and long-term trade forecast" was applied by the Ministry of Commerce in the Ministerial level
negotiation in Hong Kong.

(3) Informationization. Informationization contributed enormously to the institutional capacity
building and strengthening, which is reflected mainly in the following areas: promoting open and
transparent government operations, improving working efficiency, and providing public services.

   (a) Open and transparent government operations. Under A21 - Handan Digital City
   Development, two applied systems were completed, including (i) "Administrative Review and
   Approval System" and (ii) "Basic Geological Data Sharing Platform". Before the project, it
   was difficult to enter into the government building and meet the concerned government
   officials, and it was very time consuming to go through the administrative procedures. After
   the completion of the Administrative Review and Approval System, online review and
   approval was achieved for over 300 official operations. Meanwhile business flows and
   procedures of over 2000 official business were released online. As a result, Handan
   formulated for the first time in China (i) a "list of government administrative power"; (ii) a
   "list of Mayor's administrative power"; and (iii) a flowchart for open and transparent
   operation of administrative power. In addition, the municipal government re-opened the
   "administrative power hall", and one stop service was provided, which was unprecedented,
   hence innovative.       "Management Methodology for Promoting Open and Transparent
   Operation of Administrative Power (pilot)" was officially promulgated in May 2006.
   Establishment of the basic geological data sharing platform has enabled e-map searching of
   the city area of the entire Handan Municipality. The "Report on Handan Information



                                                  8
  Industrial Development" prepared by the subproject contributed to the formulation of the
  "Eleventh Five Year Development Plan of Handan Information Industry".

  (b) Improving working efficiency. Xinjiang is one of the poorer provinces (autonomous
  regions) in China. Before the subproject, the informationization level was very low, and over
  90% of the finance staffs were illiterate in computers and Information Technology (IT). It
  was extremely difficult for the finance system to handle large volume operations. Under
  subproject A9, the concept of informationization was introduced and the information system
  was set up. Staffs of the Finance system also received corresponding training. As a result,
  work efficiency was greatly improved. Use of E-mail and Video Conference (VC) has
  strengthened the Department's links with various prefectures and counties; especially in view
  that Xinjiang has a vast area with an average distance between the prefectures of over 500
  KM. With the equipment procured under the project, the Poverty Reduction Offices of the
  subproject provinces achieved office automation. On top of that, informationization was
  realized by connecting the offices' systems with the national poverty reduction information
  system. As a result, online data transmission and report submission were achieved; exchanges
  among the poverty reduction offices nationwide were realized. With the help of the project,
  the Xinjiang Poverty Reduction Office self developed a set of software for poverty reduction
  fund management. The information system has been extended to all counties and
  municipalities of the Region. Online supervision of the poverty reduction project
  implementation and fund utilization was enabled, thus enhancing poverty fund utilization
  efficiency.

  (c) Providing public services. Yangling is located in Shaanxi province - one of the poorer
  provinces in China. Yangling Agricultural High-Tech Demonstration Area (YAHTDA) ­ the
  only agricultural high-tech demonstration area in China - was established in 1998 when
  subproject A7 was under preparation. The project helped YAHTDA establish three major
  information networks of "Yangling Agriculture Revitalization Network" and "Yangling
  Agricultural High-Tech Exhibition Network", "Yangling e-government", which have greatly
  enhanced YAHTDA's capacity in providing public services to agriculture, rural development
  and farmers. In 2006, these network stations were connected to over 30 agriculture related
  networks. Over 4 million people had visited the networks. They became the most influential
  networks in Shaanxi Province or even the northwestern region. In addition, seven applied
  information service software systems were established, which helped bridge the scientific
  research institutions and experts of YAHTDA with the farmers and agriculture related
  enterprises, thus playing key role in science and technology demonstration. With the help of
  YAHTDA, a series of special networks, enterprise networks, and information databases were
  set up, and multi-media products were developed. With the enhanced capacity, YAHTDA is
  now able to play its demonstration role in an innovative manner. Informationization has
  greatly improved and will continue to improve YAHTDA's capacity in demonstration.


(4) Teaching material and courseware development. The National Administrative College is an
institution responsible for training of senior civil servants and senior SOE managers. Before
subproject A2, the faculty lacked of experience in teaching market economy. Therefore it was an
urgent need to first train the teachers with the knowledge of market economy and develop new
teaching materials/courseware to match the needs of market economy. Under the project, six
teaching materials were compiled. In addition, courseware was developed based on the research
results under the project, thus enhancing the capacity of the College.




                                              9
To help develop China's lagging western region, the government formulated the western region
development strategy towards the end of the last century. To contribute to this important
strategy, the Bank worked closely with UK DFID and helped establish 11 distance learning
centers (DLCs) in this region and one hub center in Beijing through cooperation with the
Western Region Development Office (WRDO), forming China Development Distance Learning
Network (CDDLN). In view of the importance of courseware in DLC operation, courseware
development was supported under subproject A31. As a result, over ninety sets of course
materials were developed, and much WBI courseware was localized. Courseware quality has
been constantly improving, when criteria for courseware development were worked out.
Cooperation among DLCs was promoted, in the form of joint courseware development and
resource sharing. Capacity building and strengthening in courseware development contributed to
the sustainable development of DLCs. With the initial support of the Bank, CDDLN is now
being extended to the prefecture and county levels by mobilizing government funds. The third
phase of DLCs development to the grassroots level is now under way.

(5) Transportation development in interior areas. In developing highways in Inner Mongolia,
semi-rigid material was extensively used. Nevertheless, the road surface crack could easily
happen due to severe cold weather. With project A17 financing, Inner Mongolia conducted: (a)
technical research on road surface crack prevention and treatment of semi-rigid black base asphalt
high grade highway; (b) a pilot program of highway maintenance; and (c) construction of a road
maintenance information system. As a result, the optimal mixing proportion of asphalt mixture
was defined; optimal mixing proportion of semi-rigid black base was designed; measures for
comprehensive prevention and treatment of road surface cracking was proposed; and
recommendations on designing and implementation technologies for investment lending was
made. The subproject results have been applied not only in the Laoyemiao-Jining project with
Bank financing, but also in all the other highways of Inner Mongolia.

Road maintenance was traditionally carried out by the Transportation Department in Inner
Mongolia and progress in contracted maintenance was slow at the time of subproject preparation.
The purpose of the pilot was to reform the road maintenance systems through pilots of various
alternatives. Contracted maintenance was proofed to be feasible and effective, as it constantly
raised the rate of good road and comprehensive value of road maintenance section. Such a
method is now adopted by the Bank financed Laoyemiao-Jining Highway Project.

As less technical qualification and fund shortage, the road management system and road
condition database had been separated, which made the data sharing and transmission very
difficult. These had prevented the users of the management system from timely and accurately
updating the relevant technical data. Road maintenance information system was officially
completed and became operational in April 2006, representing one of the highlights of the
subproject. Informationization of road maintenance helped establish links between the
management systems at various levels. This system is now connected with all the twelve
prefectures and municipalities of the Autonomous Region. The integrated data, video and audio
network information platform for road maintenance of the entire Autonomous Region is now set
up. In this way, capacity of the Transportation Bureau in road maintenance management was
greatly improved.

(6) Enhanced capacity for disaster prevention and management. China is one of the countries in
the world where natural disasters frequently occur, which caused 3-6% of GDP losses annually in
the 90's of the last century. To enhance China's capacity for disaster prevention and
management, it was important to establish demonstrative regional models for disaster prevention
and management. The Chinese Government was also considering establishing the National


                                               10
Disaster Reduction Center and the Emergency Response System. It was at this critical point that
subproject A3 was approved and implemented. The most important contributions of this
subproject were: (a) working out the general technical design of the National Disaster Reduction
Center, (b) working out the technical design of the satellite disaster reduction applied system; and
(c) promoting establishment of the Emergency Response System of the State Council by
preparing a series of emergency plans. The enhanced capacity in disaster management was fully
shown in the post May 12, 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake relief

(7) Enhanced capacity in performance evaluation: TA projects play an important role in
promoting institutional development, system innovation and China's reform efforts.
Nevertheless, implementation quality of TA projects varies greatly. To better monitor and
evaluate the implementation quality of TA projects, subproject A28 proposed in an explicit way
methodologies, indicators and detailed steps of performance evaluation of technical cooperation
projects financed by international financial institutions, through in depth research on "pilots and
methodologies for performance evaluation of technical cooperation projects". The research
results will guide performance evaluation of technical cooperation projects in the future. It
provides an important reference as well to the performance evaluation of China's finance
budgeting system. A28 had filled a gap in performance evaluation of technical cooperation
projects in terms of methodologies and indicators. Staff was trained through SHIPDET. As a
next step, MOF would make full use of the subproject results to launch pilots of performance
evaluation of the already completed subprojects under TCC 5, which would be used to promote
result driven project management, raise fund utilization efficiency and effectiveness, and
provide a decision making basis for future technical cooperation projects.

PDO (b): Developing selected economic and structural reform programs addressing priority
needs of GOC.

Impact of the project on the economic and structural reform is great, which is reflected mainly in
areas of (a) supervisory mechanism reform; (b) legal reform of bad debt treatment; (c) public
finance reform; (d) regulation of international revenues and expenditures; (e) fiscal data
management reform; (f) taxation reform and (g) city development.

(1) Governance reform: Many of the policy recommendations of subproject A16 on reforming
the governance on oil and gas have been adopted by the concerned government agencies and
played an important role in sector planning, structural adjustment; government governance
system reform; legislation set up and price reform. For example, the "Tenth Five Year Plan of Oil
Industry" adopted the project's recommendation on breaking the regional monopoly and
promoting competition. The official document of "Development Outline of National Gas
Pipeline Network Construction" adopted the recommendation on setting up of non discriminated
market access mechanism and reforming the government management system by separating its
policy formulation and supervisory functions. The "Reform Program on Gas Price Formation
Mechanism" formulated by NDRC adopted the recommendation on abolishing the double track
price system. The "Gas Management Regulation" proposed by the project has been submitted to
the State Legislation Office after endorsement by the Ministry of Construction.

The project also conducted research on power governance reform, which focused on core issues
in establishing modern governance, including capacity building of China State Electricity
Regulatory Commission (SERC). It also carried out an in-depth study on establishing a
competitive power market and its supervision. Ever since the completion of subproject A12 in
2007, good progress has been made in power governance such as establishing a competitive
power market by conducting multi provincial and regional power transactions, power generation


                                                11
right transactions, and direct power purchasing by major clients; achieving transparent
supervision by improving the supervisory system and standardizing transaction behaviors;
strengthening information disclosure with annual power supervisory notices and other special
notices. An information system for real time power governance is now under construction and
some follow up research on power supervision is being carried out. In this regard, two research
reports are completed, including "Research on Analysis and Evaluation System of Power
Market", and "Research on Standardization of Power Market". In addition, the third research
report on "Function of Power Market Governance Information System and Technical
Requirement" was under preparation.

(2) Lifting legal constraints for non performing loans.       Before the project, legal constraints
prevented China's banks and financial property management companies from forcefully handling
their bad debts. Lifting the legal constraints would require revision of relevant laws. Subproject
A20 was approved at this critical time, for the purpose of helping lift legal constraints through
revision of the relevant laws. Many of the recommended revisions of the relevant laws were
adopted by the legislative bodies and the concerned government agencies, and were reflected in
the revised laws and regulations. The project also contributed to the revision of other relevant
laws, including the Bankruptcy Law, Corporate Law Securities Law, Land Management Law,
Contract Law, Guarantee Law, Code of Civil Law and Criminal Law. As a result, most legal
constraints have been or are likely to be lifted, which will enhance forcefully handling efficiency
and effectiveness of the bad debts.

 (3) Public finance reform. China's public finance used to be biased towards urban areas. The
government has realized that economic development can only be sustainable if the rural area is
well covered by the public finance. Under such circumstances, project A32 supported research
on public finance covering the rural areas. Recommendations were made based on the research,
including continuing the policy of getting less from and giving more to the rural areas; gradually
setting up the unified urban and rural public finance resource distribution system; reforming
financing models; setting up fair, multiple and efficient financial expenditure systems; improving
the inter-governmental transfer payment system; improving governance of the county and
township governments; improving input decision making mechanism; and setting up demand
driven rural public service systems. Most of these recommendations have been adopted and
reflected in MOF's activities.

The public finance reform subproject of Jiaozuo Municipality of Henan Province (A40) focused
on promoting equalized basic public services and formulating relevant performance evaluation
indicators and basic database. A recommendation on developing specialized agricultural
cooperative organizations has been adopted by the Economic Committee of National People's
Political Consultative Group (NPPCG). Recommendations on agricultural industrialization and
standardization have become the major cases in the policy analysis report prepared by the
Ministry of Agriculture. Recommendations on setting up an integrated system of maintenance
funds, investment and co-finance system, water source protection and emergency security are
regarded as the guiding programs of the Twelfth Five Year Plan for Drinking Water Construction
of Jiaozuo Municipality. Recommendations on community public service system establishment
are highly appreciated by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Municipal Civil Affairs.
Recommendations on public health service system construction are regarded by Ministry of
Health and MOF as the important reference in promoting public service system reform, and have
become the blue books for Ningxia, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces in their public
health service system construction. Setting up of Health Files of the Residents and experience in
setting up of information system in public health service management are already reflected in the



                                                12
"Standardized Service of Basic Public Health (2009 version)"promulgated by the Ministry of
Health.

(4) Regulatory mechanism of the balance of payments. While large surpluses in the Balance of
Payments brought some benefits for China, they also brought adverse effects on China's
economic outcomes. Recommendations made under subproject A37 on improving the regulatory
mechanism for the balance of payments, as well as strengthening coordination of macro economic
policies and the economic management agencies involved in business with foreign countries have
been adopted by CPC and NPC. For example, the Seventeenth Congress of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) called explicitly for "adopting comprehensive measures to improve the balance
of payments". Policies on expanding domestic demand and promoting structural adjustment were
formulated by various government agencies.           Many of the recommendations are being
considered. Some were already adopted by the concerned government agencies.

 (5) Fiscal data management mechanism reform. With the development of the market economy
and integration with the world, the demand for more timely and accurate fiscal data by both
domestic and international society is increasing. It has therefore become an urgent task to reform
China's fiscal data management system. Recommendations made under subproject A38 include:
(a) improving the consistency in classification between China's fiscal statistics and international
standards; (b) standardizing fiscal statistical surveys by using unified questionnaire formats,
survey methods, submission procedures and channels, as well as date updating frequencies; (c)
enhancing technology for financial and economic analysis and forecasts; (d) improving
transparency of fiscal data. In 2008, MOF started to release its the monthly budget
implementation report, the monthly tax revenue analytical report and other fiscal data. In
addition, MOF distributed the "Guiding Principles on Further Promoting Financial Budget
Information Disclosure". The 2009 Central Budget Report and major data were released on
March 20, 2009 in MOF web, immediately after their adoption by the National People's Congress
(NPC).

(6) Taxation reform. The purpose of financing a taxation reform subproject (A26) was to meet
post WTO needs. Implementation of the subproject enabled the SIA to have a good knowledge
of the taxation legislative systems of the major countries, including United Kingdom, France,
Germany, Japan, Russia and India. Based on the experience learned, China's taxation legislative
system was proposed. Based on the recommendations of the subproject, the State General
Administration of Taxation released in November 2009 the Notice on Rights and Obligations of
the Tax Payers, which indicated for the first time in China's history the 14 rights and 10
obligations of the tax payers.

(7) City Development. City development under the project took three forms: (a) digital city
construction represented by Handan and Panzhihua municipalities; (b) city/provincial
development for promoting Regional Development (Yinchuan Municipality and Anhui Province);
and (c) ecological city construction.

(a) Digital City Construction: Digital City Construction of Panzhihua (A22) focused its research
on criteria, standardization, policies, legislation and management systems for digital city
construction, operation and management. The "General Design of Digital Panzhihua" was
worked out to guide construction of a public network information infrastructure and public
information service platform. The outcomes of the project would play an important role in
guiding and standardizing informationization of various sectors and would provide users with
basic and high quality space information data. Many activities have already launched after the
research was completed, including (a) development of planning management information system,


                                                13
which would help coordinated urban and rural space distribution and sustainable urban and rural
economic and social development; (b) construction of emergency response system of urban
infrastructure, etc. In future, all space information related projects could be developed and
expanded based on the platform, such as the city planning and management system,
transportation management system, urban emergency command system, geographical information
system for police use, digital city management system, state land management system,
environment geographic information system and agricultural and forestry geographical
information system.

(b) City/provincial development for promoting regional development. To promote regional
development, one of the ways is to first develop some selected core cities/province. Yinchuan
Municipality is such a core city in view of its geographic location, natural resources, and role in
the region, and hence was supported by the project. The general research report (A23) defined
the development trend of Yinchuan Municipality in the next 50 years, with a focus on the
development strategy of the next ten years. The research concluded that water was the decisive
factor for the city's development. Based on this, the research clearly indicated that the population
of Yinchuan should be controlled to around 2 million. This conclusion has contributed to the
formulation of the "Eleventh-Five Economic and Social Development Plan" of Yinchuan
Municipality. Many other research recommendations were also adopted by the government, such
as developing a non public ownership economy, which was adopted by the municipal government
in the form of municipal government notice entitled "Comment on Promoting Non Public
Ownership Economic Development". To follow up the recommendation of strengthening
cooperative development with the surrounding provinces, meetings on common development
were organized jointly with the surrounding provinces and cooperation agreements were signed
between Yiuchuan and Xian. Other research results concerning city planning, industrial
development, regional cooperation, and competitiveness enhancement are now extensively
applied in government decision making process and policy formulation. Core city development
would benefit not only in Yinchuan city, but also the whole western region development.

Anhui is an important province in central China, hence has an important bearing on the regional
development. Connection with China's Eastern Region is an important strategic decision of
Anhui Province, which is supported by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Government.
Many of the research results under subproject A39 in areas of transportation, investment, labor
mobility, energy, distribution, tourism, service, infrastructure, and human resources development
are reflected in the relevant government documents, such as the "Implementation Comment on
Comprehensive Reforming Experiment Areas of Wuhu and Bengpu (pilot) ", which was
promulgated by the Provincial CPC Committee and the government; the "Pilot Area Planning of
Undertaking Industrial Transfer by Wanjiang City Zone"which was promulgated by NDRC, etc.

(c) Ecological City Construction: Based on the research and pilots carried out in the three cities of
Baotou (Inner Mongolia),Wuyishan (Fujian) and Wanzhou (Chongqing) under subproject A34,
the indicator system was established by combining the characteristics of the pilot cities and the
state requirements. In addition, "Guidelines on China's Ecological City Construction Planning"
was formulated. Many recommendations are adopted by various localities and reflected in their
"Eleventh Five Year Plans". The subproject outcomes are highly replicable by other cities, due
to formulation of "Guidelines on Ecological City Planning of the pilot Cities (Guidelines)"by the
subproject.

PDO (d): Improving preparation of projects involved in fostering sustainable development.




                                                 14
Despite the fact that over 50% of the project funds under PPPS were cancelled and about US$ 3
million loan proceeds remained unspent, the majority of the approved subprojects achieved good
results in capacity building and quality enhancement of the investment project document
preparation.

Under B2-preparation for Laoyemiao-Jining Highway project, the project loan was mainly used
to prepare (a) Environment Impact Assessment (EIA); (b) Action Plan (AP) for environment
protection; (c) Social Assessment (SA); (d) Geological survey; (e) Risk assessment of geological
disasters of the land used for highway construction; and (f) Soil and water conservation program.
The EIA and AP received high acknowledgement of the Ministry of Environment and the
Regional Environment Department, which was regarded as the model document for future
highway projects in China. Other documents prepared including SA, land acquisition and
settlement action plan, ethnic minority development report and cultural relics survey ensured that
the investment project implementation is in full compliance with the Bank's safeguard policies.

Subproject B3 was to prepare for the investment project on micro credit for medium and small
enterprises. The important contributions included: (a) preparation of EIA. It raised CDB's
awareness of the importance of safeguard policies in its future lending operations; (b) formulation
of a strategic planning for micro- credit; (c) setting up of operational unit and the core team; (d)
extensive training of the core team members and the cooperative banks; (e) preparation of the
technical manual and governing regulations; (f) development of the IT system; and (g) launch of
pilot operations. All these activities have laid a solid foundation for the future operations. As a
result, a US$ 100 million investment loan was approved in 2007.

3.3 Efficiency: N/A

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The overall outcome is rated satisfactory. As is shown from Section 3.2, significant outcomes
have been achieved by the project although its implementation had some weaknesses. The
Project objectives are fully met. Project implementation was in legal compliance and in line with
the Bank's operational policies and guidelines. The Bank Task Team felt strongly that a small
size credit (for a subproject) can have good impact on the government's policy reforms and
institutional strengthening, if its timing is fully aligned with a political window of opportunity for
reform.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Impacts on poverty reduction and gender are prominent. The following are some examples: (a)
Qinghai is one of the poorest provinces in China. By working closely with the local Youth
League, micro credit was provided by CDB under subproject B3 to the poor yet bright young Sala
ethnic minority for starting their undertakings, such as opening of restaurants in Beijing,
Shanghai and Tianjin. CDB also worked closely with the local Women's Federation in providing
micro credit to poor women to develop geese production. All these have resulted in better off
lives of the local youth and women. (b) The proposed village based poverty reduction approach
by the "poverty reduction" sub-system under A29 was adopted by SCLGPR as the background
report in its mid-term review of the "Poverty Reduction and Development Outline in China's
Rural Area (2001-2010)", which benefits the poverty reduction in general in China. (c) To enable


                                                 15
the poor farmers to receive a subsidized poverty reduction loan, the recommendations made
under A5 on replacing assets guarantee by credit guarantee, as well as developing a community
fund were adopted jointly by SCLGPR, MOF, People's Bank of China and China's Bank
Federation in the form of a circular entitled "pilot in promoting micro credit to the farmer
households". In this way, more poor farmers were able to receive subsidized poverty reduction
loans.
.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Paragraph 3.2 has detailed description of the institutional changes and strengthening.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Apart from direct impact of the project outcomes, indirect or extended outcomes and impacts are
obvious, which are shown in the following aspects: (a) Sound implementation and project
outcome has helped the project and SIAs win credit. Many of the SIA staffs are now frequently
invited by other agencies as consultants in the research projects. (b) Good results of project
implementation helped the SIAs obtain more international assistance. For example, the all-in-one
resident card activity under Handan Digital City subproject received continued support from
"China-EU Information Social Project". Jiaozuo Municipality was selected as one of the pilot
cities on local finance reform under UK financed Strategic Program Fund. (c) Some subproject
cities are selected as pilot cities by various sectors. For example, Handan is selected by the
Ministry of Construction as the pilot city for digital city management. Jiaozuo Municipality is
selected by MOF as one of the three pilot cities in formulating a rolling budget.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

To prepare the ICR, a stakeholder workshop was held on January 22, 2010 jointly by the Bank
Task Team and MOF, with participation of majority SIAs. The workshop highlighted that: (a) A
number of subprojects ICRs were well written with clear layout of objectives, activities and
evaluation of implementation. (b) The subproject ICRs suggested that outputs of the subprojects
as indicated in respective proposals are in general satisfactorily delivered and the original
objectives have been largely achieved. (c) Completion of the subprojects had generated much
impact. Some subprojects had generated many timely, valuable and unprecedented studies on a
broad range of issues concerning different sectors, contributing knowledge and analysis that
influence the policy-making process of the government. Nevertheless, the review also pointed
out a number of areas for improvement in terms of ICR quality submitted by SIAs. The
undisbursed balance from the loan (approximately USD3 million) and credit (SDR2.64 million)
was also high.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible to low

Risk to development outcome under RSID is low. The Government commitment to policy
reform, institutional strengthening and motivation to obtain know-how are among the most
important factors behind the success and sustainability of the project. In China, such commitment
and motivation are strong. Even without Bank assistance, the government would continue to
carry out economic and policy reform projects. The Bank's most significant value is to introduce
advanced concepts, ideas and innovative methods and help China's international integration.



                                                16
Risk to development outcome under PPPS is also low. Although only three subprojects were
approved and implemented, and the undisbursed loan amount was stood high, PPPS helped
enhanced the project preparation quality and capacity building of the concerned SIAs, thus laying
a solid foundation for future investment lending. Project preparation went beyond the traditional
document preparation, to include also institutional set up and strengthening, hence was innovative
to certain extent.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately Satisfactory.

Review of the subproject proposals by the Task Team was less careful and thorough. For some
subprojects, the objectives were unclear, for others, the activities to be financed were not spelled
out. Subproject selection criteria were not clearly defined and the relations between the requested
inputs and the expected outcomes were not specified. There was lack of analytical work needed to
judge the likely impact of the interventions. Needs assessment of PPPS was not adequate,
especially on issues such as if IBRD funds were still needed for project preparation at the time
when local resources were increasingly cheaper than the Bank funds. In short, the Bank did not
exercise adequate quality assurance on the initial program of subprojects.            Despite these
shortcomings, many of the initial problems had been recognized and steps had been taken to
enhance the potential impact of the project.

(b) Quality of Supervision: Satisfactory

The Bank Task Team conducted two supervision missions a year. Field visits were made to some
selected subprojects, mainly the newly approved subprojects and subprojects requiring
procurement post reviews. Supervision of a majority subprojects was carried out through
interviews in Beijing. To prepare for the supervision missions, semi-annual progress reports of
all subprojects and the procurement documents of those subprojects subject to procurement post
review were requested and submitted. Apart from implementation progress and disbursements of
the subprojects, the supervision mission discussed with the Borrower and SIAs problems in
implementation and solutions or advice for solution, activity adjustment needs and their
justifications, and training needs for smooth project implementation. Taking the supervision
opportunity, the Task Team also conducted trainings on a case by case basis in areas of project
implementation, guidelines of Bank operations, and procurement and disbursement in particular.
In addition, the SIAs were encouraged to participate in the Bank organized trainings on
procurement and disbursement. After 2007, intensive and consolidated training on project
implementation was organized for the needy SIAs. In some cases, the Bank team provided
advice on international experience and best practice. The Task Team reminded the Borrower and
SIAs in a timely manner the remaining project funds and encouraged the Borrower to select and
process new subprojects based on the government's priorities and in line with the Bank's
Assistance/Partnership Strategy.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Satisfactory

The project approved and completed in total 42 subprojects, covering a wide range of sectors.
Many SIAs were working with the Bank for the first time. The complexity and difficulties in



                                                17
managing and supervising such a project were obvious. Great efforts were made by the Bank
team to ensure general satisfactory implementation of the project. In addition to normal
supervisions, the Bank team also maintained daily communication with MOF and SIAs through
telephone calls, E-mails and other communication means. Special meetings were arranged upon
needs or request by the Borrower. Sector resources were also mobilized and involved in new
subprojects review and implementation supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance: Satisfactory

The government is highly committed to the economic and policy reforms and has a strong wish to
continue working closely with the Bank in this effort. Counterpart funds were provided by the
government to the project. TA Division of International Department of MOF appointed a full
time staff member responsible for daily routine work of the project. The Division acted as the
first reviewer of the subproject proposals before officially submitting to the Bank, and acted as
the bridge between the Bank and the SIAs. To provide overall guidance to subproject preparation
and implementation, Guidelines of the project management procedures were worked out with the
assistance of the Bank Task Team. MOF maintained good contact with the various SIAs, and
provided good support to the Bank supervision/ICR missions by organizing meetings and field
visits, as well as participation in the Bank missions. Cooperation between the Government and
the Bank was good at all times of project implementation. Procurement ex-post review and the
auditing showed legal compliance. However, like the Bank, frequent staff turnover of MOF
affected to a certain extent project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Satisfactory.

All SIAs had established subproject implementation teams with full time staff appointed. They
prepared and submitted to the Bank, through MOF, their progress reports on a semi-annual basis,
the audit report in a timely manner, and provided useful support to the Bank's supervision
missions. They paid high attention to the subproject outcomes. They kept good contact with
MOF and the Bank team. However performance of different agencies was uneven. Some were
less efficient than the others and two were even dropped due to government reorganization.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Satisfactory

Despite the fact that quality at entry was only moderately satisfactory, lessons were learned.
Closer attention was paid to the relations between objectives and outputs and between outputs and
outcomes. The project objectives were fully met.

6. Lessons Learned

Slow disbursement, delayed implementation completion and large amount of unspent project
funds are among the major challenges facing the Task Team during project implementation. To
avoid such problems from happening in future TA projects, the following lessons are learned:

(a) Ensuring timely completion of project implementation. The project involved a flexible
approach in subproject proposal review. While appropriate given the uncertainties of the demand
for TA and of a changing environment, this could easily cause implementation delays - a common
problem of almost all TA projects. To ensure that the future TA projects are completed in a



                                               18
timely manner, yet to respond to the needs of the policy makers, a more strategic approach should
be adopted. In this sense, it is proper to (i) define a longer implementation period than for normal
investment lending projects; (ii) the Bank and MOF teams meet on a semi annual or even a
quarterly basis, to discuss the priorities, the assisted areas and to agree on the lending program.
As a matter of fact, this approach has already been adopted and applied by TCC 5; (iii) set up a
deadline for new subproject proposal submission; (iv) formulate multiple procurement methods,
in view of the importance of procurement and disbursement in ensuring timely implementation
completion. This project defined only one procurement method(QCBS) for selection of the
consulting firms at the time of project preparation, which somehow affected effective
procurement; and (v) work out a realistic disbursement schedule, taking into consideration the
characteristics of TA projects.

(b) Ensuring high preparation and implementation quality. (i) Quality at entry is essential for
maintaining high implementation quality. To ensure quality at entry, it is important to have a
strong and competent task manager and task team; well thought-out interventions; clearly defined
project activities; and close relations between the requested inputs and the expected outcomes. In
addition, there must be a plausible demonstration of "value added and result driven" by the
project. (ii) In umbrella operations, subproject selection criteria are perhaps the most important
factor, as they help ensure that project financed activities all serve the ultimate objective of the
operation. (iii) It is also important for both the Bank and the Borrower to form the subproject
review committees, with full involvement of sector expertise. (iv)It is important to work out
project management guidelines to ensure high quality implementation. This project had a good
beginning in this regard. (v) It is also important to provide timely trainings to SIA staffs and the
new SIAs in particular, especially in areas of procurement and disbursement.

(c) Full spending of project funds. (i) Needs assessment of project funds should be carried out
seriously and carefully to avoid cancellation of large volumes of project funds; (ii) It is proposed
that MOF considers changing the repayment responsibility from SIAs to MOF and local finances,
so as to allow participation of more potential priority agencies and localities; and (iii) Efforts
should be made to find grant funds to soften the loan terms.

(d) Other lessons. Other lessons included (i) Stabilizing the Task Teams of both the Bank and
the Borrower; keeping a good filing system, and the e-filing system in particular, to maintain
continuity of the project implementation, and to avoid adverse effect caused by the task team
changes. (ii) Cooperation and communications among subprojects with similar nature is
encouraged, so as to achieve information sharing, avoid duplication and promote each other's
work.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


1       By the time of project closing in December 2009, 90% of subproject implementation
agencies (SIAs) of the approved 42 subprojects have conducted respective evaluation of outcome
achievement through preparation and submission of individual ICRs. MOF PMO also provided
assistance in translating available ICRs into English.

2        A thorough desk review was conducted for all subproject level ICRs available. The
review highlighted that: (i) A number of ICRs were well written with clear layout of objectives,
activities and evaluation of implementation. (ii) The ICRs suggest that, in general, outputs of the
subprojects as indicated in respective proposals were satisfactorily delivered, and the original
objectives are largely achieved. (iii) Completion of the subprojects had generated much impact.
Some subprojects had generated a bunch of timely, valuable and unprecedented studies on a
broad range of issues concerning different sectors, contributing knowledge and analysis that
influence the policy-making process of the government.

3.      On the other hand, the review pointed out a number of areas for quality improvement of
some ICRs: (i) Inadequate inclusion of evidence justifying subproject achievements in the current
write-up; (ii) Mis-interpretation of the concept of outcome, output, and input and therefore
unclear presentation of project storyline; (iii) Lack of identification and analysis of major factors
hindering project implementation such as slow disbursement and delay of completion; (iv) Lack
of information on follow-up actions (i.e., sustainability) and assessment of Bank and borrowers'
performance; and (v) Lack of depth and spectrum on lessons learnt

4.       To address the above issues, 25 SIAs were selected and an interview was conducted with
each of them through a one-day workshop in Beijing. Customized questionnaire was prepared to
facilitate the interview during the process.

5.      By February 12, 2010, 23 enhanced ICRs and/or supplementary information on project
evaluation were submitted by the interviewees and the quality was found satisfactory.

2. Project Objectives

2.1 The objectives of the Project are to provide continued support to the Government of China
(GOC) in its economic and structural reform effort. This would be achieved through: (a)
strengthening institutions that were key to GOC's ongoing but unfinished economic and structural
reform agenda; (b) developing selected economic and structural reform programs which
addressed priority needs of GOC; (c) strengthening agencies involved in poverty reduction and
rural development; and (d) improving preparation of projects involved in fostering sustainable
development .

2.2 The Project consists of two parts: Part A: Reform Support and Institutional Development, and
Part B: Pre-investment and Project Preparation Support.


2.3 Revision of the objectives: No revision happened to the objective during the project
implementation.

3.   Comments on Project Design

3.1 During project implementation, MOF and World Bank had approved 39 sub-projects under
Part A and 3 sub-projects under Part B according to the Chinese Government's requirements for
reform priority and progress at different stages.

3.2 In general, the project design is reasonable and feasible. MOF and World Bank fully
absorbed the experiences summarized from the previous 3 completed technical assistance projects
during project appraisal, and meanwhile, fully considered China's real needs of economic
construction and social development in a new period. The project involved a flexible approach in
subproject proposal reviewing. While it is appropriate given the uncertainties of the demand for
TA and of a changing environment, it could easily cause implementation delays - a common
problem of almost all TA projects. To ensure that the future TA projects are completed in a
timely manner, yet to respond to the needs of the policy makers, a more strategic approach should
be adopted.

4. Realization of Project Objective



                                               33
4.1 General speaking, the realization of project objective is substantive. All the sub-project
objectives were closely related to project objective. Majority of sub-projects had been realized
their objectives.

4.2     Under the Reform and Institution Development Component, a total amount of SDR
23,058,613.47 (US$ 33,804,388.52 equivalent) was utilized to support 39 sub-projects, among
which 19 ones were implemented by central-level government departments and institutions, 20 by
local-level government departments and institutions. The subprojects covered fields of macro-
economic management, regional economic development, urban development, agriculture and
rural area development, disaster prevention and reduction, human resources development, power
sector regulation, oil and gas sector regulation, fiscal and taxation system reform, financial
system reform, comprehensive transportation system reform, road maintenance system reform,
informationization, environmental protection, tourism development, high-tech industry
development and high education development. All the fields covered were among the
development and reform priorities mentioned in the Government's Working Reports presented by
the Premiers each year during project implementation. During project implementation, a lot of
policy recommendations were adopted by central and local policymakers and became the action
guidelines and implementation programs of reform in the concerned fields.

      For example, many of the policy recommendations of the Research on Oil and Gas
Supervisory Framework on reforming the supervisory mechanism of oil and gas have been
adopted by the concerned government agencies and played an important role in sector planning,
structural adjustment; government supervisory system reform; legislation set up and price reform,
etc. For instance, the      Tenth Five Year Plan of Oil Industry          adopted the project's
recommendation on breaking regional monopoly and promoting competition. The official
document of Development Outline of National Gas Tube Network Construction adopted the
recommendation on setting up of non discriminated market access mechanism and reforming the
government management system by separating its policy formulation function with supervisory
functions. The Reform Program on Gas Price Formation Mechanism formulated by NDRC
adopted the recommendation on stopping price double track system. The Gas Management
Regulation proposed by the project has been submitted to the State Legislation Set Up Office
after endorsement by the Ministry of Construction.

4.3     Under the Pre-investment Component, a total amount of US$ 1,121,781.41 was utilized
to support 3 sub-projects. The subprojects covered the fields of housing mortgage loan, highway,
and capacity building. All of them were vital to the national economy and the people's livelihood,
and having urgent need of support from public financing. In spite that about 50% of the project
funds under PPPS was cancelled, majority of the approved subprojects achieved good results in
capacity building and quality enhancement of the investment project document preparation.

     For example, subproject B3 was to prepare for a US$ 100 million investment project on
micro credit for medium and small enterprises.         The important contribution included: (a)
preparation of EIA. It was the first time that CDB was aroused the awareness of importance of
safeguard policies in its future lending operations; (b) Formulation of a strategic planning for
micro credit; (c) Setting up of operational unit and the core team; (d) Extensive training of the
core team members and the cooperative banks; (e) Preparation of technical manual and governing
regulations; (f) Development of IT system; and (g) launch of pilot operations. In between 2005
and 2009, a total of 115,000 micro credits with the total lending amount of 10.18 billion Yuan
were issued by the 12 cooperative banks (exclusive CDB itself). All these activities have laid a


                                               34
solid foundation for the future operations. As a result, the US$ 100 million investment lending
was approved in 2007.

5. Institutional Development Impacts

5.1 During project implementation, all the subproject implementation agencies' capacity were
strengthened. They accepted new management concepts, established new management
mechanisms, used new management methods, and finally improved their management efficiency.

5.2 Under the Reform and Development Component, the subproject implementation agencies are
government departments and institutions responsible for reform policy research, development,
dissemination and implementation. Strengthening their capacity not only made effect on their
own development, but also the country's macro-economic and micro-economic operation,
allocation of public resources, balance of regional development and order of market competition.
A lot of research results have been adopted and applied by various government agencies, research
institutes, universities and the various localities of the country, which was influential to the
government decision at various levels. For example, the research result on impact of a new round
WTO agricultural framework agreement on China's agriculture and recommendations on
negotiation produced by the sub-system of "China's agriculture and medium and long-term trade
forecast" was applied by the Ministry of Commerce in the Ministerial level negotiation in Hong
Kong.

5.3 Under the Pre-investment Component, the subproject implementation agencies are
government departments and enterprises responsible for public investment and construction.
Although only three subprojects were approved and implemented, and undisbursed loan amount
has stood high, PPPS helped enhanced the project preparation quality and capacity building of the
concerned SIAs, thus laying a solid foundation for future investment lending. Project preparation
went beyond the traditional document preparation, to include also institutional set up and
strengthening, hence innovative to certain extent.

6. Key Factors Affecting Project Implementation and Outcomes

6.1 Key factors affecting project implementation and outcomes are: nature of technical
cooperation projects, the Chinese Government's continuous requirements for deepening
economic reform and enlarging opening up to the outside world, reorganization and staff
adjustment, natural and man-made disasters. The effects of these factors are both positive and
negative.
.
6.2 One of the big differences between TA project and investment project is the requirement of
diversity with the deepening of China's reform of economic regime. Therefore, it is impossible to
identify all contents during assessment period as what it did in investment project, and thus in
accordance with the actual situation, we need to add and implement new sub-project
continuously. The approval of a single sub-project is tailored to the needs of the reform of
economic regime.

6.3 On the other hand, the complexity of reform made negative effect on project implementation.
Reform could not be accomplished in an action. A lot of investigations and discussions work
needed to be done before issuing a reform measure. In particular, China is now at a rapid
development stage. For some subprojects, it needed more integrated dynamic and in-depth
researches because of the change of policy environment in the process of project implementation,



                                               35
which made a number of subprojects have to make time frame adjustments or postponement in
order to adapt to the changes.

6.4 During project implementation, natural and man-made disasters that made major effect on
project implementation and outcomes, such as 9.11 Disaster in 2001, SARS Epidemic Situation in
2003, AHI in 2006, snow disaster in 2008, Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008, H1N1 influenza and
Global Financial Crisis in 2009. Generally, the effect of such disasters is negative, which was one
of the important reasons for delay of project implementation. For example after Global Financial
Crisis happened, it was necessary for the Chinese Government to undertake necessary policy
measures to keep steady economic growth. For this purpose, adjustments had to be made on
general and specific working plans developed originally. Under such circumstances, adjustments
had to be made accordingly by some relevant subprojects. The 911 event had prevented a lot of
international consultants from coming and providing consulting services to the subprojects.
Likewise, it also affected many overseas trips of the Chinese policy researchers. All these had
heavily affected progress of project implementation. The same effect happened after SARS.

6.5 Reorganization and staff adjustment happened on both World Bank side and Chinese side.
Basically, the effect of World Bank's reorganization and staff adjustment was negative. During
project implementation, the World Bank task team leader of the project was changed relative
frequently. Such a situation made it impossible for the task team leader to provide consistent and
continuous guidance and supervision to project implementation. The effect of MOF and
subproject implementation agencies' reorganization and staff adjustment had positive and
negative effects. The goal of reorganization and staff adjustment was transition of government
functions, optimization of staff structure and improvement of management efficiency, which was
consistent with the project objective, but reorganization and staff adjustment resulted in an
unsteady project coordination and subproject implementation team, which effected on the quality
and progress of project implementation and became one of important reasons for delay of project
implementation..

6.6 Undisbursed amount remains substantial. This project was restructured in October 2007. Its
closing date was extended to December 31, 2009, with an intention to achieve the project
objectives in a more effective manner with continuation of several ongoing subprojects and by
utilizing the majority of the fund savings in the current priority areas on the China's agenda.
However, despite of the joint efforts of the MOF PMO and the Bank task team on calling for
proposals, only one proposal (out of the 10 applicants) was approved in the first year following
the restructuring, largely due to unsatisfactory quality of proposals. Given the closing date and the
fact that a subproject would need 1-2 year to complete, no more applications were considered
after late 2008. Qualified proposals have been funded under the China Economic Reform
Implementation Project, which has a closing date of end of 2011. As a result, the undisbursed
balance from the loan and credit has stood high of around USD3.04 million of loans and SDR2.64
million of credit, or 11% of the total loan/credit amount. However, it has become increasingly
clear that it is difficult to take any decisive action to reduce the potential project savings by the
closing date.

7.   Sustainability

7.1 The sustainability of the Fourth Technical Cooperation Credit Project is good. Firstly, the
Chinese Government considers reform and opening up to the outside world as one of the 3
historic huge changes in the development process of China since one century ago. The Chinese
Government clearly put forward that, combining socialism with market economy, needs
deepening reform and enlarging opening up. Therefore, the demand of cooperation with World


                                                 36
Bank on reform and institutional development is continuous and steady. In 2006, World Bank
approved China Economic Reform Implementation Project, a similar project with the Fourth
Technical Cooperation Project. As of today, most project loans under China Economic Reform
Implementation Project have been allocated to support 39 reform and institutional development
subprojects.

7.2 Secondly, the umbrella type project enables MOF and the subproject implementation agencies
to have strong ownership in ascertaining subproject objectives and contents, so that the subproject
outputs can meet well the real needs, and produce continuous impacts.

7.3 Thirdly, key economic management sectors strengthened their capacity and meanwhile
obtained very valuable experiences from experiment, which laid a solid institutional foundation
for future reform.

7.4 Fourthly, comprehensive quality and professional skills of the staffs related to reform policy
and development measure research, dissemination and implementation were improved rapidly
and in an overall way, which had laid a solid talent foundation for future reforms. For example,
under the Strengthening the Capacity of MOF Subproject, over 100 staffs studied and received
training overseas in areas of public administration, economic management, trade and finance,
information technology, accounting, law and taxation, etc. All of them returned China after
completion of their studies and trainings. Some of them were either promoted to higher positions
in MOF, or were exchanged to other departments to undertake more challenging tasks.

8. World Bank and Borrower Performance

8.1 Generally, World Bank performance during project implementation was satisfactory. The
Bank staff evaluated project and subproject objective based on priorities of the Chinese
Government reform agenda, and designed a simple but effective procedure to review subproject
proposals, in order to increase the efficiency of project management. They regularly supervised
project implementation and took seriously and fully the comments and suggestions put forward
by Chinese side, and guided them to solve problems during project implementation. Meanwhile,
in order to assure quality of project implementation, they used each and every opportunity to train
the project coordination and subproject implementation staffs from Chinese side on project
management, procurement and disbursement, such as subproject launching workshop, training
course, round-table discussion and telephone dialogue, etc.

8.2 Generally, as the central project coordination unit, MOF's performance during project
implementation was satisfactory. They ascertained the principles and emphases of utilizing the
allocated credit according to the Chinese Government's overall requirements for deepening
reform and enlarging opening up at different stages, introduced the nature, characteristics of
technical cooperation project to concerned government agencies and institutions, guided them to
prepare subproject proposal, reviewed and discussed with World Bank about those proposals,
guided subproject implementation agencies to handle procurement and disbursement, managed
the special account, accepted auditing, organized project supervision with World Bank and
prepared concerned project implementation plans and project progress reports. Even though the
closing date of the project was extended twice, the reasons for extension were understandable,
and the project results were obvious. Supervision and auditing results showed that, project
contents were in line with the project objectives, the quality of project implementation was
guaranteed and project impacts were significant.

8.3 Generally, subproject implementation agencies' performance during project implementation
was satisfactory. They prepared and submitted subproject proposals by strictly following the
Management Regulations of Fourth Technical Cooperation Project prepared and circulated by
MOF. All subproject activities were strictly in line with the approved contents and objectives,
handled procurement and disbursement by strictly following World Bank guidelines and
handbooks, duly prepared and submitted subproject implementation plans and progress reports,
accepted and fully cooperated with the concerned supervision missions and auditing teams,
undertook necessary measures to enlarge subproject impacts.

9. Experiences Learned

9.1 Long-term implementation and wide coverage both in areas and sectors are two major
characteristics of Fourth Technical Cooperation Project. Each subproject is independent. The
main experience learned during project implementation is that, strong government support,
reasonable subproject design and steady project management team are the three footstones for the
success.

9.2 A reasonable subproject design should include an innovative and clear subproject objective,
and an operational subproject implementation plan. Deepening reform and enlarging opening up
is a dynamic process, if the subproject objective lacks of innovation and clarity, as the direct
result, the subproject outputs will lose the meanings of direction and demonstration. Meanwhile,
deepening reform and enlarging opening up is a complex process, if the subproject
implementation is non-operational, as the direct result, the subproject output will be
unmarketable.

9.3 A steady project management team of project management personnel can guarantee the
innovation of project implementation to the largest extent. It has been testified by practice that
innovation is the soul of technical assistance. The core contents of technical assistance are to
analyze new development situations, summarize up new development experiences, probe into
new development ways, set up new development mechanism, develop new development tools,
and solve new development problems. However, innovation is not innate. It is the rime of long-
term hard work and intelligence. Therefore, frequent deployment of staff could always heavily
effect on the quality and efficiency of project and subproject implementation.


Borrower's comments on Draft ICR

The World Bank Implementation Completion and result Report (ICR) reviews the overall
implementation and outcome of TCP IV project in a fairly comprehensive way and makes
objective comments on project objectives, project management, outcomes and achievements,
sustainability, experience and lessons learned, etc.. The issues and recommendations raised in the
Report provide good reference for the implementation and management of future technical
assistance projects, and it is helpful to further strengthen the result-driven management.

In view of this, the Ministry of Finance has no objection to the Report.
