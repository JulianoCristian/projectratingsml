           Program Project for Honduras were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, project sustainability was uncertain, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            deficient. Some lessons learned included: adapting\n            successful models from other countries can be extremely\n            helpful in preparing a reform program and the Bank is well\n            placed to facilitate this kind of cross-country transfer of\n            knowledge and experience. In this case, the Chilean\n            Electricity Law, enacted in 1982, served as a sound basis on\n            which the Honduran Electricity Law was designed. Adjustment\n            lending aims to support both structural reforms and to\n            alleviate the country's balance of payments\n            constraints, with the latter often requiring relatively\n            quick disbursements. Consequently, major conditions should\n            be required up front (i.e. for Board presentation), and a\n            few others (aimed at making the program sustainable) for the\n            release of not more than a second tranche. If it is foreseen\n            that the complexity of the sector adjustment requires a\n            longer implementation period, it will be advisable to\n            explore options for doing it through more than one lending\n            operation, over perhaps a longer period of time. A Contract\n            Plan (or Performance Contract) between the Government and a\n            Government-owned power utility, may not be an effective\n            mechanism for improving the operational and financial\n            performance of the sector or the utility. It may be more\n            appropriate to concentrate efforts on reducing the role and\n            monopoly status of the public utility and correspondingly\n            increasing the participation of the private sector. This, in\n            fact, is the Government's present policy, with its plan\n            to privatize ENEE's distribution functions."}, "docdt": "1997-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
