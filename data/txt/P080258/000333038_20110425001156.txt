2. The Project has been restructured in August 2009 and December 2010. Since then it
   successfully launched activities that enabled the commercialization of research results
   and research capacity and increased the ability of small and medium sized companies
   to invest in research and development activities. The project rating is satisfactory.

3. The project will close on May 31, 2011, and proposed reallocation is necessary to
      optimize the use of funds until the project closing date. The percentage of financing
      under the loan expenditure categories remains the same. The funds are being
      reallocated to the sub-financing programs funded by BICRO, as follows:

         Revised allocation for the RAZUM Program amounts to EURO 7,193,124
         Revised allocation for the TechCro Program amounts to EURO 5,387,656
