The project has been\n            restructured in August 2009 and December 2010. Since then it\n            successfully launched activities that enabled the\n            commercialization of research results and research capacity\n            and increased the ability of small and medium sized\n            companies to invest in research and development activities.\n            The project rating is satisfactory. The project will close\n            on May 31, 2011, and reallocation is necessary to optimize\n            the use of funds until the project closing date. The\n            percentage of financing under the loan expenditure\n            categories remains the same."}, "docdt": "2011-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
