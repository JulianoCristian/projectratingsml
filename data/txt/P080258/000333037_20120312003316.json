Some lessons learned included: a\n            first lesson learned from the STP is that innovation related\n            projects may achieve tangible results within a relative\n            short time. STP achievements indicate that Croatia's\n            innovation performance was not constrained by a lack of\n            ideas, as sometimes argued, but by the availability of\n            appropriate institutions, such as Technology Transfer\n            Organizations (TTOs), early-stage financing and mentoring\n            services. A second lesson derives from factors seemingly\n            critical for STP achievement focus on well defined,\n            quantifiable targets (enabling commercialization of publicly\n            funded research and supporting Small and Medium Size\n            Enterprises, or SME investments in Research and Development,\n            or R&D). A third lesson can be learned from what STP\n            could not achieve, namely: restructuring research institutes\n            and promoting a venture capital industry. The failure in\n            fostering restructuring of research organizations was caused\n            by a combination of political and technical difficulties.\n            While a complex political economy is to some extent inherent\n            to any restructuring process, a technical difficulty found\n            in STP was related to definition of the own concept of\n            restructuring, as BI did not count with direct government\n            support and was financially self-sustained. Finally, a\n            fourth lesson relates to sustainability of achieved results.\n            By the end of the project, funds for continuation of the\n            newly created programs had not been secured. The legal\n            status of Business Innovation Centre of Croatia (BICRO) and\n            Unity through Knowledge Fund (UKF) is currently being\n            reviewed by the new administration. TTOs still have to fully\n            integrate with their parent organizations (RBI and\n            Universities of Zagreb and Rijeka) and are currently\n            struggling to finance operating costs. Solutions, however,\n            are envisaged."}, "docdt": "2012-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
