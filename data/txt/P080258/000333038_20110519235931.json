The project will close\n            on May 31, 2011, and proposed reallocation is necessary to\n            optimize the use of funds until the project closing date.\n            The percentage of financing under the loan expenditure\n            categories remains the same."}, "docdt": "2011-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
