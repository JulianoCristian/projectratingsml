                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has achieved its key objectives of: (i) enabling the commercialization of public R&D through research contracts with industry, patenting, licensing agreements and

                         spillover companies; and (ii) increasing the ability of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to invest in R&D activities. Rudjer Innovations, a commercialization agency of Rudjer
                         Boskovic Institute, has established five spillover companies, concluded 12 licensing agreements, including to the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Brown
                         University. Two major universities joined the project in 2008 - the University of Zagreb and the University of Rijeka, established its Technology Transfer Offices and getting first IP
                         transferred and patents filed. Brodarski Institute concluded 41 research contracts with industry, of over EUR9.0 million, and doubled its share of revenues from private companies
                         from 22 (2006) to 45 percent. Croatian public research institutions concluded through the Unity through Knowledge Fund 28 contracts with private sector and attracted 50 industry
                         partners. There is a steady increase in the volume of private R&D mobilized through program financing, currently over EUR13.7 million. From 2006 to 2008, the share of Croatian
                         SMEs that have new or significantly improved products new to the market raised from 7.2 percent to 10.8 percent. Data for the 2008-10 period is under preparation by the Croatian
                         Statistical Office and should be available during the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report. Preliminary evaluation of the project-supported innovation programs
                         shows that RAZUM program significantly increased the SMEs R&D capability, capacity to conduct innovation, and it positively affected the new product development process.
                         Further, 89 percent of SPREAD program financed projects resulted in new products and/or services, which improved their competitive positions both nationally and internationally.
                         One of the impacts of the project is increased capacity of participating institutions to absorb the EU pre-accession funds and prepare for a better use of post-accession funds. As a
                         result: (i) Business Innovation Center of Croatia - BICRO was awarded EUR 18.0 million from EU IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) and is currently undergoing a
                         certification process to become an intermediate body for EU structural funds; (ii) Ministry of Science, Education and Sports has designed a EUR 6.0 million IPA fund for technology
                         transfer based on Science and Technology Project model; (iii) with EUR 4.0 million invested by Unity through Knowledge Fund, Croatian public research organizations attracted EUR
                         9.0 million of R&D funding entitled to Croatian partners from the highly competitive EU Seventh Framework Program.
