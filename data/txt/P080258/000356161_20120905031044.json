Research and Development (R&D) and\n            innovation institutions to implement Europe 2020 strategy\n            for increased investments in R&D through efficient\n            absorption of European Union (EU) funds, and to develop a\n            pipeline of public and private R&D projects, including\n            research groups, that could qualify for financing through EU\n            structural funds. Negative impacts most commonly include:\n            dust and noise due to excavation, demolition and\n            construction; management of demolition construction wastes\n            and accidental spillage of machine oil, lubricants, etc.,\n            encroachment to a private property, damage to historical or\n            cultural property or unknown archaeological sites, traffic\n            disturbance, surface or ground water, and soil pollution or\n            erosion. Mitigation measures include: 1) the local\n            construction and environment inspectorates and communities\n            have been notified of upcoming activities; 2) during\n            interior demolition use debris chutes above the first floor;\n            3) there will be no open burning of construction/waste\n            material at the site; 4) during operations the engine covers\n            of generators, air compressors and other powered mechanical\n            equipment should be closed, and equipment placed as far away\n            from residential areas as possible; 5) the site will\n            establish appropriate erosion and sediment control measures;\n            6) waste collection and disposal pathways and sites will be\n            identified for all major waste types expected from\n            demolition and construction activities; 7) monitoring of new\n            wastewater systems (before/after) will be carried out; and\n            8) special facilities for segregated healthcare waste."}, "docdt": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
