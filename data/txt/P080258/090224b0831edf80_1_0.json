And of Rudjer\n            Boskovic, whose 18th Century studies inspired the field of\n            electromagnetism and whose work improved the performance of\n            the royal society's telescopes and strengthened the\n            dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Croatian\n            scientists are still making important contributions,\n            although most have yet to boost the country's economic\n            development. Croatia's experience shows that innovation\n            policies focused on supporting business R&D and enabling\n            the commercialization of public research can achieve\n            tangible results in a relatively short period of time. This\n            is of particular importance in times of economic crisis when\n            budgets are constrained and when economies need to unleash\n            innovation and productivity as new drivers of economic\n            growth,' says Paulo Correa, World Bank task manager for\n            the Science and Technology Project."}, "docdt": "2011-01-10T01:43:00Z"}
