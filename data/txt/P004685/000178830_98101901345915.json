establishing the\n            Townsville stylo on about 83,000 hectares of fallow and\n            permanent grazing lands in intensive development areas\n            covering about 640 villages. These areas located throughout\n            the Northeast Region have been selected on the basis of\n            farmer interest, cattle concentrations and proximity of\n            breeding stations that would be centers of technical\n            assistance. Research and production facilities of five\n            Livestock Development Department breeding stations and the\n            two substations in the Northeast would be expanded. To meet\n            the immediate needs of the loaned bull and artificial\n            insemination programs, it is proposed to import 300 Brahman\n            bulls and 600 Brahman cows for research and production and\n            to expand the loaned bull program by 455 bulls at full\n            development. To meet the projected expansion of the\n            artificial insemination program to service 72,000 additional\n            cows annually by the fifth year, it is proposed to import\n            144,000 doses of Brahman and holsteinfriesian semen. For\n            improving disease control, expanded facilities for vaccine\n            production would be established. Technical assistance to the\n            project would be provided."}, "docdt": "1975-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
