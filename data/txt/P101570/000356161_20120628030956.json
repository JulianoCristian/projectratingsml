as follows: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate; Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was also highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            ownership, leadership, commitment and capacity of the\n            authorities, at the highest level, in design and\n            implementation of the policy reform agenda have been the\n            most important factor in the success of an operation.\n            Technical assistance in parallel to the operations which\n            builds capacity as well as nurture collaboration and joint\n            work improves performance. Alignment with Government\n            priorities and incremental dialogue provides valuable weight\n            to immediate and short term policy exigencies while building\n            consensus for broader and bolder reforms. The ability of the\n            team to work in close collaboration with Development\n            Partners (DPs) resulted in harmonizing results framework\n            through common policy dialogue with the Government. Close\n            coordination has proven to be an effective way to support\n            budget planning and execution. The timing of one of the\n            operations also changed to match the change in budget\n            timeframe which moved the financial year from July- June to\n            align with the calendar year. This meant that there was a\n            six month bridging gaps (i.e. a financial year of six\n            months) and to sustain the reform momentum, an operation was\n            prepared within this time frame."}, "docdt": "2012-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
