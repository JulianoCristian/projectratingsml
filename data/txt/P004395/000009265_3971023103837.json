"This is the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Special Interventions Project in Papua\n            New Guinea (PNG). As stated in the Staff Appraisal Report\n            (SAR), the objectives of the Bankfinanced Special\n            Interventions Project (SIP) were to: (a) address the more\n            urgent social needs arising from PNG's ongoing economic\n            adjustment by enhancing employment opportunities among low\n            income, unemployed and under-employed urban workers; and (b)\n            strengthen the institutional capacity of the government to\n            better formulate and implement projects. Bank's\n            performance was not satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was not satisfactory. The key lessons learned\n            were as follows: (a) when project objectives are clear and\n            stakeholder support is widespread, as in the case of the\n            drainage component, good implementation performance is an\n            entirely reasonable prospect in Papua New Guinea; (b) in the\n            preparation of projects, there is a clear need for\n            consistency between project objectives and project design as\n            evidenced in the failure of the housing component; (c) the\n            design of the project should relate the short-term\n            objectives to the overall policy framework for the sector\n            and any long-term sector reform effort;(d) institutional\n            development through provision of consultant advisory\n            services may fail to deliver results in the absence of a\n            stable operating environment characterized by decisive and\n            stable project management dedicated to well defined and\n            widely agreed objectives; and (e) project complexity, as\n            reflected by a large number of participating agencies, must\n            be calibrated carefully in line with the Borrower's\n            capacity, otherwise it may impose an undue burden of\n            oversight on the Borrower and adversely affect project\n            performance as it did in this case."}, "docdt": "1997-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
