       Fund Project is to help the government sustain its poverty\n            alleviation efforts and maintain social cohesion while the\n            line ministries strengthen their institutional capacities\n            and complete their reform programs. The credit will finance\n            a range of small-scale subprojects in four broad categories:\n            (a) social infrastructure; (b) economic infrastructure; (c)\n            social services; and (d) credit to small informal sector\n            entrepreneurs. Wherever feasible, the subprojects will be\n            carried out by small private contractors using\n            labor-intensive methods.  The credit will also provide\n            institutional support through technical assistance to the\n            Honduran Social Investment Fund.  Finally, the credit will\n            provide technical assistance to the Nongovernmental\n            Organization Liaison Office, to strengthen the partnership\n            between the public sector and nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs) in addressing poverty problems, and to promote\n            NGOs' role in the preparation of subprojects in poorer\n            communities, so that the poor can actually take advantage of\n            all funds targeted on them."}, "docdt": "1992-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
