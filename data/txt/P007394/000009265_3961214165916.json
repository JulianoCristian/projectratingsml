Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Second Social Investment Fund Project\n            in Honduras. The specific objectives were to help Government\n            of Honduras (GOH) to sustain its poverty alleviation efforts\n            and maintain social cohesion during the period of economic\n            adjustment, while the line ministries strengthened their\n            institutional capacities and completed policy reform\n            programs, building upon the achievements. The Second\n            Honduras Social Investment Fund (FFHS II) mandate was to\n            serve as the implementing arm of the line ministries in the\n            management and financing of priority small and medium-scale\n            social and economic infrastructure subprojects, as well as\n            to fund priority programs in basic needs. Some main lessons\n            learned are that: (a) Bank supervision should be intensified\n            during election years, and following a change in\n            implementing agency management, especially when management\n            changes are related to a change in government\n            administration; and (b) the Bank and the implementing agency\n            should agree on detailed, practical key performance and\n            impact indicators which the project entity and the Bank will\n            use to monitor and evaluate the achievement of project\n            objectives, while recognizing that the implementing agency\n            may use other indicators for its own purposes. The Bank\n            should also pay more attention to the information technology\n            aspects of the monitoring and evaluation system."}, "docdt": "1996-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
