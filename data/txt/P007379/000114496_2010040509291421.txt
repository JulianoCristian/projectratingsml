                            SCHEDULE 2
                    Description of the Project
     The objectives of the Project  is to improve the rural credit
system in Honduras by  identifying  and promoting innovative forms
of channelling more credit  to low-income producers, rationalizing
interest  rates,   and   utilizing   monitorable  and  enforceable
performance criteria by Financial Intermediaries.
     The Project consists of the  following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower  and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:   Provision of Credit to Financial Intermediaries
(1)  The financing,  through  Long-term  Sub-loans  to  be made by
Financial  Intermediaries  other  than  FACACH  Credit  Unions, of
investments in the  fields  of  livestock development, orchard and
tree crop establishment, soil  conservation and land improvements,
farm machinery and equipment, on-farm storage, seed processing and
distribution,   small-scale    agro-processing   facilities,   and
collection centers,  including  the  provision  of Short-term Sub-
loans to complement such Long-term Sub-loans.
(2)  The financing, through Short-term  and Long-term Sub-loans to
be made by FACACH Credit Unions, of investments in the same fields
mentioned in (1) above by  Small-scale  Farmers who are members of
certain credit unions affiliated to FACACH.
(3)  The financing,  through  Long-term  Sub-loans  to  be made by
Financial  Intermediaries  other  than  FACACH  Credit  Unions, of
investments  aimed  at  the  establishment  of  PTAUs,  and  their
development  under  Part  B(1)   of  the  Project,  including  the
provision of  Short-term  Sub-loans  to  complement such Long-term
Sub-loans.
Part B:   Extension Services and Training
(1)  Development  of  privately-owned  technical  assistance units
(PTAUs) which  will  provide  their  services  to assist medium-to
high-income agricultural producers in their activities.
(2)  Utilization of group  and  mass  media (radio and television)
techniques to provide  extension  services to low-to medium-income
farmers, particularly to Beneficiaries.
(3)  Organization of training courses on financial, managerial and
agronomy  matters  for  the   staff   of  UPCA  and  of  Financial
Intermediaries.
Part C:   Studies
     The carrying out of studies by Banco Central, through UPCA:
          (i)  to evaluate the extent  to which credit provided to
               marketing agents of agricultural products and other
               intermediaries  could  increase  market competition
               and encourage  on-lending  on  competitive terms to
               low-income producers;
         (ii)  to  determine  and  propose  legal,  regulatory and
               procedural   changes   aimed   at   increasing  the
               effectiveness   of   utilization   of  agricultural
               chattel  mortgages  and   reducing   the  costs  of
               establishing such mortgages;
        (iii)  to analize and review  the system of rural property
               rights and land title recording in order to improve
               the ways and means  to  resort  to  the use of land
               mortgages to secure agricultural credits;
Page  13
         (iv)  to analize  transaction  costs  of  UPCA, Financial
               Intermediaries and Beneficiaries  so as to identify
               financial intermediation costs  and  ways to reduce
               them or to review margins and spreads, or both; and
          (v)  to develop and  establish  a cost accounting system
               for UPCA.
                 *               *               *

                            SCHEDULE 4
                          Special Account
1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:
     (a)  the  term  "eligible  Categories"  means  Categories (1)
through (4) set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement;
     (b)  the term "eligible  expenditures"  means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost  of goods and services required for
the Project and to be  financed  out  of  the proceeds of the Loan
allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  eligible  Categories  in
accordance with the provisions  of  Schedule  1 to this Agreement;
and
     (c)  the  term  "Authorized   Allocation"   means  an  amount
equivalent to $4,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account and
deposited into the Special Account  pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of
this Schedule.
2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for eligible expenditures  in  accordance  with  the provisions of
this Schedule.
3.   After the Bank has received  evidence satisfactory to it that
the Special  Account  has  been  duly  opened,  withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent  withdrawals to replenish the
Special Account shall be made as follows:
     (a)  For  withdrawals  of   the  Authorized  Allocation,  the
Borrower shall furnish to  the  Bank  a  request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which  do  not  exceed the aggregate amount of
the  Authorized  Allocation.  On  the  basis  of  such  request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from
the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such amount or
amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
     (b)   (i)  For  replenishment  of  the  Special  Account, the
                Borrower shall furnish  to  the  Bank requests for
                deposits  into   the   Special   Account  at  such
                intervals as the Bank shall specify.
          (ii)  Prior to or at the  time of each such request, the
                Borrower shall furnish  to  the Bank the documents
                and  other  evidence  required  pursuant  to para-
                graph  4  of  this  Schedule  for  the  payment or
                payments  in  respect  of  which  replenishment is
                requested.  On the basis of each such request, the
                Bank shall, on  behalf  of  the Borrower, withdraw
                from the Loan Account and deposit into the Special
                Account such  amount  as  the  Borrower shall have
                requested and as  shall  have  been  shown by said
Page  15
                documents and other evidence to have been made out
                of the Special Account for eligible expenditures.
                All such deposits shall  be  withdrawn by the Bank
                from  the  Loan   Account   under  the  respective
                eligible  Categories,   and   in   the  respective
                equivalent amounts, as  shall  have been justified
                by said documents and other evidence.
4.   For each payment  made  by  the  Borrower  out of the Special
Account, the  Borrower  shall,  at  such  time  as  the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to  the  Bank such documents and other
evidence  showing  that  such  payment  was  made  exclusively for
eligible expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph  3  of  this
Schedule, the Bank shall not  be required to make further deposits
into the Special Account:
     (a)  if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be  made  by the Borrower directly from
the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of Article V of
the General Conditions and paragraph  (a)  of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
     (b)  once the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan allocated
to the eligible  Categories,  less  the  amount of any outstanding
special commitment entered into  by  the  Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Conditions  with respect to the Project, shall
equal  the  equivalent  of  twice  the  amount  of  the Authorized
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal  from  the  Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures  as the Bank shall specify
by notice to the Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made
only after  and  to  the  extent  that  the  Bank  shall have been
satisfied that  all  such  amounts  remaining  on  deposit  in the
Special Account as of the date  of such notice will be utilized in
making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
payment  out  of  the  Special   Account:  (i)  was  made  for  an
expenditure or in an amount  not  eligible pursuant to paragraph 2
of this  Schedule;  or  (ii)  was  not  justified  by the evidence
furnished to the Bank,  the  Borrower  shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A)  provide  such  additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit  into  the Special Account (or, if the
Bank shall so request, refund to  the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or  the  portion thereof not so eligible or
justified.  Unless  the  Bank  shall  otherwise  agree, no further
deposit by the Bank into  the  Special Account shall be made until
the Borrower has provided  such  evidence  or made such deposit or
refund, as the case may be.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special  Account will not be required to
cover further  payments  for  eligible  expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice  to the Bank, and with the
Bank's consent, refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds
on deposit in the Special Account.
     (d)  Refunds to the Bank  made  pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan Account
for  subsequent  cancellation  or   withdrawal  as  the  Bank  may
determine.
