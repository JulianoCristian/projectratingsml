SECTION I.    PROJECT ADMINISTRATION CONTRACTS
1.   Banco  Central   will   enter   into  Project  Administration
Contracts with  BANADESA  and  any  other  Financial Intermediary,
other than a FACACH Credit Union, wishing to participate in Part A
of the Project. Each  Project Administration Contract shall stipu-
late that, in order to  have  access  to financing under Part A(1)
and Part A(3) of  the  Project,  the commercial banks and BANADESA
will have to meet at the beginning of the First Year, and maintain
during the First Year and each  Successive Year, all at the satis-
faction of UPCA, the following criteria:
     (a)  Commercial Banks
          (i)  an economic  leverage  coefficient  not higher than
               35.  For  the  purpose  of  this  Section, economic
               leverage  coefficient  is  the  ratio  of  debt  to
               estimated economic net worth,  and net worth is the
               accounting net worth minus net estimated losses due
               to non-performing assets;
         (ii)  a recovery rate for  the UPCA portfolio, which will
               consist of Sub-loans,  if  any,  and of outstanding
               loans made under previous  projects financed by the
               Bank, higher  than  65%.  For  the  purpose of this
               Section, the recovery rate  will be measured by the
               total amount  of  cash  collected  as  debt service
               payments under  outstanding  loans  under  the UPCA
               portfolio during  a  given  period  expressed  as a
               percentage of total amounts  due and payable during
               that period under the UPCA portfolio;
        (iii)  for continued  participation  during any Successive
               Year,  a  commercial  bank  shall  be  required  to
               maintain (A) an  economic  leverage coefficient not
               higher than 30 for  the first Successive Year, than
               25 for  the  second  Successive  Year  and, for the
               third Successive  Year  and  every  Successive Year
               thereafter, than  one  point  below the coefficient
               for the preceding  Successive  Year, (B) an absence
               of additional problems that  may imply high risk of
               insolvency   as   determined   by   the  Borrower's
               Superintendency of Banks,  and  (C) a recovery rate
               of its UPCA portfolio higher than 70% for the first
               Successive Year, than 75% for the second Successive
               Year and, for the  third  Successive Year and every
               Successive  Year  thereafter,  than  two percentage
               points above the  recovery  rate  for the preceding
               Successive Year.
     (b)  BANADESA
          (i)  this institution will not  have access to financing
               under Part A(1) of  the  Project as a whole because
               there are  substantial  differences  in performance
               among its  various  branch  offices  and thus, each
               BANADESA branch  office  will qualify independently
               to the extent the branch  in question meets, at the
               satisfaction of  UPCA,  the  criteria stipulated in
               (ii) and (iii)  below;  provided,  however, that to
               enable said access to  its branches, (A) during the
               First  Year  and,   subject   to  (C)  below,  each
               Successive  Year,  BANADESA,  as  a  whole  will be
Page  8
               required to maintain  an  amount of funds disbursed
               and outstanding  under  Sub-loans  and  under Loans
               made by BANADESA under Prior Agreements equal to no
               more  than  1.1   times   the  amount  of  deposits
               outstanding from the general public during the Year
               in   question   (excluding    any   compulsory   or
               compensating  deposits  and/or  any  deposits  from
               public sector institutions),  (B)  such ratio shall
               be reviewed at the end  of  the Year in question by
               UPCA  with  a  view  to  requiring  a  higher ratio
               between funds  disbursed  and  outstanding from the
               Loan Account and  from  the  accounts opened by the
               Bank or the Association  under the Prior Agreements
               and deposits, and  to  exploring the possibility of
               having this criterion on  a branch by branch basis,
               and (C) if no higher  ratio  or no branch by branch
               based  criterion  are  agreed  with  the  Bank  the
               following Successive  Year  and,  further provided,
               that, if another ratio  is agreed, such ratio shall
               be deemed replacing,  for  the  period in question,
               the ratio stipulated in (A) above;
         (ii)  at least 55%  of  the  aggregate of amounts payable
               under the  total  loan  portfolio  (excluding loans
               funded  under  Fideicomisos)   of   the  branch  in
               question are fully on  time  in  the First Year, at
               least 60% are fully on time at the beginning of the
               first Successive  Year  and  at  least a percentage
               equivalent  to  two  percentage  points  above  the
               percentage applicable  to  the preceding Successive
               Year are fully  on  time  at  the  beginning of the
               second Successive  Year  and  every Successive Year
               thereafter;  for  the   purpose  of  this  Section,
               "amounts fully  on  time"  means  the  aggregate of
               amounts not under the aforesaid portfolio, that are
               still payable  as  of  the  time  of  the review in
               question, excluding from such  aggregate the sum of
               (A)  amounts   that   have   been   rescheduled  or
               refinanced and (B) amounts  not yet due under loans
               in respect of which there are amounts overdue as of
               the date of such review; and
        (iii)  the recovery rate for  the  UPCA portfolio (both as
               described under (a)(ii) above)  at the beginning of
               the  First  Year  shall  be  higher  than  65%. The
               recovery rate shall  be  increased at the beginning
               of each  Successive  Year,  as  follows:  to a rate
               higher than  70%  at  the  beginning  of  the first
               Successive Year, than 75%,  at the beginning of the
               second  Successive   Year,   and   higher   than  a
               percentage  equivalent  to  two  percentage  points
               above  the  preceding   Successive   Year,  at  the
               beginning of the  third  Successive  Year and every
               Successive Year thereafter.
2.   (a)  each Project Administration  Contract  with a commercial
bank or BANADESA will  require  that  the  proceeds of the Loan be
used  exclusively  for  granting  Sub-loans  to  Beneficiaries for
carrying out simple  Investment  Plans  under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank.  The  objectives  of the lending program
would be to promote rural development through increased production
and improved extension services by providing long-term and related
short-term credit,  all  in  accordance  with  the eligibility and
lending terms set  out  in  Section  II  of this Schedule. Project
Administration  Loans  will   be   denominated  and  repayable  in
Lempiras;
     (b)  each Project Administration  Loan  will finance not more
than 85% of the amount of  each Sub-loan made by the corresponding
Financial Intermediary to  a  Small-Scale  Farmer  and  75% of the
amount of each Sub-loan made to any other Beneficiary;
Page  9
     (c)  interest on the  amount  withdrawn and outstanding under
each Project Administration  Loan  will  be  variable and adjusted
every six months  during  the  life  of the Project Administration
Loan. The initial rate will be  set  at  12% per annum and will be
reviewed and adjusted as necessary to reflect the marginal cost of
funds to commercial banks, for  the  period in question, as deter-
mined by UPCA;
     (d)  each Financial  Intermediary  will  agree  to  repay the
principal of,  and  to  pay  interest  and  other  charges on, the
Project Administration Loan on  the  same dates that repayments of
principal and payments  of  interest  on  the Sub-loan in question
fall due and the amortization schedule of each Project Administra-
tion Loan  shall  be  amended  from  time  to  time  to the extent
required to conform in  relevant  part substantially to the aggre-
gate  of  the  amortization   schedules  applicable  to  Sub-loans
financed thereunder;
     (e)  each Financial Intermediary  will  finance  in full each
Sub-loan providing, from its own  resources and in addition to the
portion thereof funded under  the  Project Administration Loans in
accordance with paragraph  (b)  above, the necessary complementary
funds;
     (f)  each Financial Intermediary will  assume the credit risk
on each Sub-loan made;
     (g)  each Financial Intermediary will make its best effort to
accept interim land titles  and  chattel mortgages on agricultural
products as security for Sub-loans;
     (h)  technical  staff  of  the  Financial  Intermediary  will
assist, or cause assistance  to  be  provided to, each Beneficiary
for the preparation of Investment Plans and also provide financial
supervision to each Beneficiary through the period of investment;
     (i)  each Financial Intermediary  will establish and maintain
a separate Project account with  as many Sub-loan accounts as will
be reasonably required by the Bank  and UPCA, pursuant to the pro-
visions of Section 4.01 of this Agreement;
     (j)  each  Financial  Intermediary  will  have  its accounts,
including its Project  account  and  Sub-loan accounts and related
statements, audited annually by  external auditors satisfactory to
Banco  Central  and  the  Bank   pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
Section 4.01 of this Agreement;
     (k)  each Financial  Intermediary  will  provide  UPCA or the
Bank with such  other  information  concerning the Project account
and Sub-loan accounts and related  statements  as UPCA or the Bank
might reasonably request;
     (l)  the Project  Administration  Contract  may be suspended,
partially or totally, or terminated  by Banco Central in the event
of any one or more of the following circumstances:
          (i)  that the Financial Intermediary  has failed to make
               due and punctual  payment  to  Banco Central of any
               amount  payable  under  the  Project Administration
               Contract;
         (ii)  that the Financial Intermediary has failed to carry
               out satisfactorily any  other  obligation under the
               Project Administration Contract;
        (iii)  that the Financial Intermediary  has been unable to
               pay its debts as they matured;
         (iv)  that  any  legal   proceeding  has  been  initiated
               whereby  any  of  the  property  of  the  Financial
               Intermediary could be  attached, foreclosed or dis-
               tributed among its creditors; and
Page  10
          (v)  that the Financial Intermediary  has ceased to have
               access to  the  Loan  proceeds  by  not meeting the
               criteria set forth in Part  1 above or in paragraph
               (o) below; and
     (m)  compliance with the following  criteria is required from
each of  the  Financial  Intermediaries  other  than FACACH Credit
Unions wishing to participate in  Part  A(1)  and Part A(3) of the
Project  in  order  to  have  continued  access  to  the financing
thereunder:
          (i)  maintaining   adequate   financial   condition  and
               management, including compliance  with the auditing
               requirements established  by  the relevant national
               laws; and
         (ii)  maintaining an adequate  agricultural unit in terms
               of  number,   experience,   and  qualifications  of
               personnel to be  assigned  thereto for the Project,
               and in terms of performance  in question by UPCA on
               the  basis  of:  (A)  satisfactory  preparation and
               submission of feasibility  studies by the Financial
               Intermediary in  question  at  the  time of seeking
               UPCA's prior  approval  of  the  corresponding Sub-
               loans, when such  prior  approval  is required, and
               (B) satisfactory compliance  with  terms and condi-
               tions for making Sub-loans,  in respect of at least
               90% of Sub-loans made by the Financial Intermediary
               in question,  when  UPCA's  prior  approval  is not
               required,  based  on  a  reasonably  representative
               sample of Sub-loans.
SECTION II.   SUB-LOAN CONTRACTS -  Procedures  for  and Terms and
Conditions of Sub-loans
Eligibility of Sub-borrowers
3.   Any farmer, organized  group  of  farmers,  contract or other
entity proposing a technically, financially and economically sound
Investment Plan for Part  A(1)  of  the  Project, and any group of
professionals organized or in the  process of being organized as a
PTAU for the provision  of  agricultural extension services, under
some reasonable form  of  legal  entity,  proposing a technically,
financially and economically sound Investment Plan for purposes of
Parts A(3) and B(1) of the  Project, will be eligible to apply for
a Sub-loan. Investment Plans may  include  any  one or more of the
following categories:  infrastructure,  construction  of buildings
and facilities, machinery and equipment, land clearing or improve-
ment, including the establishment or renovation of pastures, semi-
permanent and permanent crops and  trees, and breeding cattle less
than four years of age. The  Sub-loan may include the cost of land
survey and titling, and of consultant services for the preparation
of the Investment Plan and  for assistance during its execution to
the extent that each such cost does  not exceed up to 10% of total
costs of the Investment  Plan  in  question. With the exception of
the reference to consultant services, all of the aforesaid applied
only in respect of Part A(1) of  the Project while, in the case of
Investments Plans for Part  A(3)  of  the  Project, said Plans may
include acquisition and  utilization  of  office  goods, tools and
equipment, minimal renewal or adaptation of facilities, and promo-
tion services.
Classification of Beneficiaries
4.   (a)  An applicant for  a  Sub-loan  will  be  classified as a
Small-scale Farmer if it  has  total  assets (including land, farm
machinery and livestock) directly  related to agricultural activi-
ties not exceeding the equivalent of $40,000.
     (b)  An applicant for  a  Sub-loan  will  be  classified as a
Medium or Large-scale Farmer if  it  is  a  PTAU or if it does not
Page  11
qualify as a Small-scale Farmer.
Technical Assistance and Supervision
5.   Credit applicants  will  be  assisted  in  the preparation of
Investment  Plans  by  the   technical   staff  of  the  Financial
Intermediary. The cost of  private consultant services, other than
those of the Financial Intermediary  staff, will be acceptable for
financing in accordance with paragraph 3 above.
6.   UPCA and the Financial  Intermediary will ensure that amounts
drawn on Sub-loans are applied exclusively to expenditures for the
Investment Plans to be financed thereunder.
7.   The  staff  of  each  Financial  Intermediary  will regularly
inspect the farms that have received Sub-loans therefrom to ensure
that  each  Beneficiary  effectively  and  punctually  carries the
investments proposed under  the  corresponding Investment Plan and
complies with the provisions of its Sub-loan Contract.
8.   The staff  of  Banco  Central  will  regularly  inspect, on a
random sample basis, the farms  that have benefited from Sub-loans
to  ensure  that  the  Financial  Intermediary  is  fulfilling its
responsibilities.
Creditworthiness and Approval of Investment Plans
9.   The evaluation of the  creditworthiness of applicants and the
preparation and analysis of Investment  Plans and of credit appli-
cations will be made by Financial Intermediaries that will approve
each Investment Plan  of  up  to  the  equivalent  of $35,000. The
approval by UPCA of an Investment  Plan expected to cost more than
the equivalent of $35,000, will  be required before the respective
Sub-loan  Contract  could  be  declared  effective.  Any Financial
Intermediary may be authorized  by  the UPCA to approve Investment
Plans with higher  amount  than  the  ones previously mentioned in
this  paragraph,  having  regard   to   the  past  experience  and
performance  of  the   Financial   Intermediary   in  question  in
agricultural lending.
Maximum Aggregate Borrowing
10.  No  expenditures  for  goods  or  services  required  for  an
Investment  Plan  shall  be  eligible  for  financing  out  of the
proceeds of the Loan unless:
     (a)  the Sub-loan for  such  Investment  Plan shall have been
approved by the Bank; or
     (b)  the Sub-loan for such Investment  Plan shall have been a
free-limit Sub-loan for which  the  procedures under 9 above shall
have been followed. For  the  purposes  of this Agreement, a free-
limit Sub-loan shall  be  a  Sub-loan  for  an Investment Plan the
estimated cost of which shall  not  exceed  the sum of $300,000 or
equivalent, when added to  any  other outstanding amounts financed
or proposed to be financed out  of  the proceeds of the Loan or of
any other loan provided  for  in  any outstanding Prior Agreement,
the proceeds of which have  been  or  are being used for financing
goods  and  services  directly  and  materially  related  to  such
Investment Plan, the foregoing amount being subject to change from
time to time as determined by the Bank.
11.  (a)  When presenting a Sub-loan (other than a free-limit Sub-
loan) to the Bank for approval,  the Borrower shall furnish to the
Bank an application, in  form  satisfactory  to the Bank, together
with: (i) a description of the Beneficiary and an appraisal of the
Investment  Plan,  including  a  description  of  the expenditures
proposed to be financed out of  the proceeds of the Loan; (ii) the
proposed terms  and  conditions  of  the  Sub-loan,  including the
schedule of amortization  of  the  Sub-loan;  and (iii) such other
information as the Bank shall reasonably request;
Page  12
     (b)  applications made  pursuant  to  the  provisions of sub-
paragraph (a) of this paragraph shall  be presented to the Bank on
or before June 30, 1991; and
     (c)  for the purposes of this provision, any Sub-loan made to
partnerships or firms or  joint  ventures or cooperatives in which
the Beneficiary  in  question  has  a  financial  interest will be
deemed to be, to the  extent of such financial interest, Sub-loans
made to such  Beneficiary.  A  Financial  Intermediary will not be
permitted to lend to a Beneficiary an amount in excess of one time
the Beneficiary's total  assets  or  in  excess  of the $1,500,000
equivalent limit stipulated in paragraph  2  (ii) of Schedule 1 to
the Loan Agreement  whichever  is  lower. For Small-scale Farmers,
the Sub-loan amount  could  not,  in  any  event, exceed an amount
aggregating together with amounts  outstanding under previous Sub-
loans (including any loans made and financed under any outstanding
Prior Agreement) equivalent to  $40,000. For groups of Small-scale
Farmers organized under the Agrarian  Reform Law, the maximum will
be the equivalent of $40,000,  multiplied by the number of members
of the group, provided that  this  amount does not exceed one time
the value of the Small-scale  Farmer's total assets or the equiva-
lent of $1,500,000, whichever is lower.
Livestock Development
12.  The purchase  of  breeding  livestock  under Investment Plans
will be subject to the following limitations:
     (a)  livestock will be four years old or less;
     (b)  Financial  Intermediaries  will   not  be  permitted  to
approve any Sub-loan for  an  Investment  Plan which proposes that
more than 50% of the  investments  be used for livestock purchase;
and
     (c)  notwithstanding  the  provisions   of   (b)  above,  the
Regional Director of the UPCA  will  be able to approve Investment
Plans in which no more  than  60%  has been assigned for livestock
purchase, provided that at that time and in the foreseeable future
no more than 35% of the value of all Investment Plans approved for
the Project has been assigned to the purchase of livestock.
13.  Pasture  improvement  will   be   emphasized  vis-a-vis  land
clearing as a mean to increase animal feed.
Sub-loans
14.  Each Sub-loan Contract will, inter alia, provide:
     (a)  that such Sub-loans will be denominated and repayable in
Lempiras;
     (b)  that each Sub-loan may  consist  of  two portions, one a
Long-term Sub-loan and  the  other,  one  or  more Short-term Sub-
loans, provided, however, that  Short-term  Sub-loans will be made
available only during an eighteen-month  period during the life of
the Sub-loan in  question  and  only  to  the  extent the proceeds
thereof are to be applied to  the financing of 100% of incremental
working capital associated with, and required by, the carrying out
of the Investment Plan financed under such Sub-loan Contract;
     (c)  that repayment terms of Short-term Sub-loans will be the
shortest possible, but  never  exceeding  eighteen months from the
date of the first disbursement thereunder;
     (d)  that interest will initially be  set  at the rate of 16%
per annum on the principal  amount withdrawn and outstanding under
each Sub-loan  and  will  be  variable  and  adjustable  every six
months, reflecting  changes  in  the  market  on-lending  rate but
without any adjustment exceeding of one percentage point every six
months unless there has been a significant change in the inflation
rate  during  the  immediately   preceding  six-month  period,  as
Page  13
determined by the Bank and  Banco Central; provided, however, that
interest rate on overdue amounts  of principal will be the highest
interest rate allowed by Banco Central within the Honduran banking
system plus two  percentage  points  to cover collection expenses.
The aforesaid rates will  be  inclusive of any applicable charges,
fees or commissions  other  than  the  charge  referred  to in (f)
below;
     (e)  that the  amount  of  the  Long-term  Sub-loan  will not
exceed  the  equivalent  of   the  following  percentages  of  the
estimated cost of the  Investment  Plan  to be financed therewith:
(i) 80%,  in  the  case  of  Medium  and  Large-scale Farmers; and
(ii) 90%, in the case of Small-scale Farmers;
     (f)  that a commitment charge of 2% per year on the principal
amount of the Long-term  Sub-loan  not  withdrawn will be applied,
commencing immediately following the  end of the investment period
shown in the respective Investment Plan;
     (g)  that the repayment terms  of  Sub-loans reflect the pay-
ment ability of the Sub-borrower and the cash flow position of the
Investment Plan, provided, however,  that  such terms will, in the
case of Long-term Sub-loans,  include  a grace period commensurate
to the repayment term but not exceeding five years;
     (h)  that procurement procedures  will  be in accordance with
the requirements contained in Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
     (i)  that the Beneficiary will  insure, or make adequate pro-
visions for the insurance  of,  goods  to be imported specifically
for an Investment Plan and to be financed out of the proceeds of a
Sub-loan, against hazards incident to the acquisition, transporta-
tion and delivery to the place of use or installation;
     (j)  that the goods and services financed out of the proceeds
of the Sub-loan be used exclusively in carrying out the Investment
Plan;
     (k)  for  the  right  of   Banco  Central  or  the  Financial
Intermediary  to  require  the   Beneficiary   to  carry  out  the
Investment Plan in question and to operate the facilities included
therein with due diligence  and  efficiency and in accordance with
sound technical, financial and  managerial standards, and to main-
tain adequate records;
     (l)  for the right of the  Bank,  the UPCA and the  Financial
Intermediary  to  inspect  the   goods,  land,  sites,  works  and
construction financed under a  Sub-loan, the operation thereof and
any relevant records and documents; and
     (m)  for  the  right  of   Banco  Central  or  the  Financial
Intermediary to suspend  or  terminate  access by the Beneficiary,
respectively, to the  use  of  the  proceeds  of the Sub-loan upon
failure by the Beneficiary to perform any of its obligations under
the Sub-loan Contract.
SECTION III.  REVIEW OF LENDING CONDITIONS
15.  The Bank, the Borrower and  Banco  Central will, from time to
time, amend the lending  terms  and  conditions  set forth in this
Schedule to the extent necessary to:
     (a)  ensure  the   compatibility   of   the   interest  rates
applicable under the Project  with  interest rates in Honduras for
lending  for  investment,   provided   that   the  interest  rates
applicable under the Project remain positive in real terms; and
     (b)  ensure the continuance  of  the incentives for Financial
Intermediaries, including those  designed  to encourage lending to
Small-scale Farmers.
