            Re:   Loan 2991-110 (Fourth Agricultural Credit Project)
                  Amendment to BCH Project Agreement
Dear Sir:
      Please refer to the Loan Agreement dated November 21, 1988,
between the Republic of Honduras and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), and to the Project
Agreement between the Bank and the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH
Project Agreement), and to the Project Agreement between the Bank
and the National Federation of Credit Unions (FACACH Project
Agreement), both also dated November 21, 1988.
      Pursuant to your request dated February 2, 1989, and
acknowledging that the ration "UPCA's portfolio to deposits from the
general public" in BANADESA is currently higher than the one
stipulated in the BCH Project Agreement, and to permit that those
BANADESA branches that fulfill the loan recovery performance
criteria stipulated in Schedule 2, Section I, para 1 (b) (i) of the
BBCH Project Agreement to participate in the Project, the Bank has
agreed to amend said ratio from 1.1 to 1.5.
      The Bank, therefore, hereby proposes to amend Schedule 2,
Section I, para 1 (b) (i) of the BCH Project Agreement as follows:
      "(b) BANADESA
            (i)   this institution will not have access to
                  financing under Part A (1) of the Project as a
                  whole because there are substantial differences
                  in performance among its various branch offices
                  and thus, each BANADESA branch office will
                  qualify independently to the extent the branch in
                  question meets, at the satisfaction of UPCA, the
                  criteria stipulated in (ii) and (iii) below;
                  provided, however, that to enable said access to
                  its branches, (A) during the First Year and,
                  subject to (C) below, each Successive Year,
                  BANADES, as a whole will be required to maintain
                  an amount of funds disbursed and outstanding
                  under Sub-loans and under Loans made by BANADESA
                  under Prior Agreements equal to more than 1.5
                  times the amount of deposits outstanding from the
                  general public during the Year in question
                  (excluding any compulsory or compensating
                  deposits and/or any deposits from public section
                  institutions), (B) such ratio shall be reviewed
                  at the end of the Year in question by UPCA with a
                  view to requiring a lower ratio between funds
                  disbursed and outstanding from the Loan Account
                  and from the accounts opened by the Bank or the
                  Association under the Prior Agreements and
                  deposits, and to exploring the possibility of
                  having this criterion on a branch by branch
                  basis, and (C) if no lower ratio or no branch by
                  branch based criterion are agreed with the Bank
                  the following Successive Year and, further
                  provided, that, if another ratio is agreed, such
                  ratio shall be deemed replacing, for the period
                  in question, the ratio stipulated in (A) above."
