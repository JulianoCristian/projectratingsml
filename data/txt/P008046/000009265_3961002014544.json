Project\n            recognizes the major trade reform measures taken between\n            August 1990 and September 1991 and comprises: (i) a\n            reduction in tariff protection; (ii) the elimination of most\n            non-tariff barriers; (iii) the elimination of export\n            subsidies and improvement in schemes allowing exporters to\n            recuperate indirect taxes; and (iv) the abolition of the\n            agency which formerly administered trade control; reform of\n            the customs functions; and passage of a legislative decree\n            that raises many of the previously enacted trade reforms to\n            the status of law. The sectoral conditions relate largely to\n            the maintenance of the current reforms, and measures for\n            futher reform are generally considered a secondary issues,\n            except insofar as further action is felt necessary to secure\n            the current reforms."}, "docdt": "1992-01-10T00:00:00Z"}
