F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The project development objective was to conserve Georgian biodiversity through the
creation of three ecologically and socially sustainable protected areas, and to build
capacity for mainstreaming biodiversity conservation into the production landscapes
which connect them.

 The project would (i) support protected areas planning in the Central and Eastern
Caucasus; (ii) establish protected areas management and build awareness of biodiversity
conservation at three sites in the Eastern Caucasus and their ecological corridors; and (iii)
reorganize and strengthen the Department of Protected Areas to conserve and manage
biodiversity. The project was consistent with the GEF Operational Program for
biodiversity conservation.

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
and Key Indicators and reasons/justifications
The Global Environment Objective was not changed.

 At Negotiations, the GEO indicators originally selected in agreement with Government
counterparts during project preparation and listed in the PAD were refined to better
measure achievement of the project objectives. During this exercise, an indicator
reflecting the improved management of protected areas in eastern Georgia was added and
an indicator considered overly ambitious in terms of the achievements that could
realistically be expected at the close of the project (the stable or increased number of
Caucasus tur) was removed. These revised indicators were documented in a
Supplemental Letter to the Grant Agreement. No further revisions were made to the
indicators after project approval.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Georgia hosts a large diversity of landscapes and natural ecosystems harboring a large variety of
animal and plant species some of which are endemic to Georgia or the Caucasus. In particular, the
ecosystems in Central and Eastern Georgia cover foothill and mountain forests and subalpine
meadows of the Greater and Lesser Caucasus and arid steppe and deserts. The region is home to
animal species typical of Europe (e.g., bear, lynx, wolf, chamois, red deer), Central Asia (e.g.,
Caucasian tur or mountain goat, leopard) and the Middle East (e.g., hyena, gazelle).

Georgia had a strong tradition of nature protection with the first nature reserve being established
in Lagodekhi in 1914. Fourteen additional strict nature reserves were subsequently established
during the Soviet era. However, the system focused on protection excluding any uses other than
scientific research. Local communities had no say on the management of the nature reserves and
did not derive any benefits from them. In the face of dire budget shortfalls and rural poverty,
enforcement was no longer possible. The result was degradation of habitats due to widespread
poaching for game or fuelwood and overgrazing. The Department of Protected Areas (DPA)
which reported directly to the President of the Republic was significantly understaffed, the
average age of its staff members was quite advanced, and staff was unfamiliar with modern
approaches to nature conservation. DPA premises did not fulfill basic requirements of a
professional work environment, such as heating or computers. Protected areas (PA) were severely
understaffed and lacked equipment and skills to carry out their protection duties.

On the other hand, Georgia had become party to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1994
and the 2000 National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) identified "wildlife and biodiversity"
as a key issue highlighting the ineffective PA system. The Ministry of Environment Protection
and Natural Resources (MEPNR) championed the overhaul of the system while a strong NGO
movement demanded more effective conservation. Reflecting these sentiments, one of the
objectives of the 1997 Country Assistance Strategy was to "protect the environment, support
sustainable natural resources management, and foster private sector rural development". The
Project would support this objective through the provision of technical assistance to groups and
individuals to provide nature-based tourism services and develop alternative conservation-linked
income generating activities.

The Project was also designed to closely collaborate with the USD 21.37 million IDA-supported
Forests Development Project (FDP) which became effective on October 31, 2002. The FDP
aimed to establish sound forest management systems which would maximize the contribution of
Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty reduction on an environmentally
sustainable basis.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO was to conserve Georgian biodiversity through the creation of three ecologically and
socially sustainable protected areas (PAs) in forest ecosystems, and to build capacity for
mainstreaming biodiversity conservation into the production landscapes which connect them.
Achievement of the PDO would be measured by1:



1PDO indicators which were refined at Negotiations were documented in the legally binding Supplemental
Letter to the Grant Agreement and subsequently used during supervision. However, through an
administrative error they were not updated in the Board PAD. The key change was to (i) exclude an


                                                    1

i.   Protected Area Plan for the Central Caucasus (CC) supported by local communities and
     adopted by Government;
ii. Protected Areas in eastern Georgia under full protection, with management plans under
     implementation, total 185,000 ha;
iii. Comprehensive PA management plan for the CC planning region adopted by Government;
iv. Improved biodiversity conservation measures under implementation through two corridor
     plans in eastern Georgia;
v. Recovery, through natural regeneration under improved management systems, of overgrazed
     alpine and steppe habitats within Project protected areas and corridors;
vi. Social indicators monitored at Project sites show continued support for protected areas;
vii. Revenue from tourism and resource use covers at least 70% of non-salary protected area
     operating expenses by Year 5.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

Neither the PDO nor the Key Indicators were revised after project approval.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

There were three key groups of beneficiaries:

 Communities living in and around PAs who would benefit from more sustainable use of
     natural resources and from PA related visitor related tourism revenues.

 DPA professional staff whose mandate would be modernized (from a control and command
    protection orientation to a participatory, multiple use orientation) and management capacity
    enhanced.

 The Georgian society which derived value from knowing that their country's biodiversity and
    landscapes are better protected.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Project was designed to have four components along with areas of cooperation with FDP and
estimated FDP (IDA) funding that contributed to the Project PDO.

Component 1: Support Protected Areas Planning (USD 6.87m, comprising USD 6.00m IDA,
USD 0.72m GEF and USD 0.15m Government funds) aimed at supporting PA planning in
Georgia through:
i.  Preparation of a PA plan for the CC Mountains Ecoregion; and
ii. Preparation and implementation of corridor plans in the Eastern Caucasus Mountains.
Prepared in a consultative manner and in accordance with international standards, these plans
would support the PDO by laying out specific socially acceptable and technically sound steps to
incorporate biodiversity conservation into production landscapes. PADP and FDP would jointly
implement three activities for the 7,430 sq. km CC planning region: (i) inventories and analyses
of the landscape diversity, as inputs to the PA planning process. The PADP would finance




indicator on tur populations considered unrealistic since it was highly unlikely that changes in biodiversity
would be evident over the relatively short life of the project; (ii) specify the number of corridor plans as
two and their location as eastern Georgia; and (iii) introduce a new indicator on protected areas in eastern
Georgia given this was a key aspects of the PDO.


                                                       2

biodiversity studies and the FDP would finance forest inventories; (ii) harmonization of policies
and classifications for land-use, resource-use and PAs, resulting in a unified classification of PAs
for the CC region; and (iii) preparation of a PA plan, with management plan guidelines for each
PA category. The PADP and FDP would also collaborate on two activities to promote
biodiversity conservation in the production landscape in corridors connecting PAs in two areas of
eastern Georgia: (i) the alluvial floodplain forests along the Alazani River, and (ii) the mosaic of
grasslands and forests in key corridors connecting PAs in the Caucasus mountains which provide
critical habitat for globally threatened species such as the Dagestan tur, Caucasian black grouse
and Caucasian snow cock.

Component 2: Establish Protected Areas Management and Build Awareness of Biodiversity
Conservation (USD 17.20m, comprising USD 10.00m IDA, USD 6.10m GEF and USD 1.10m
Government funds) aimed to develop PAs at three sites in eastern Georgia which are effective in
conserving the region's rich biodiversity and also to generate revenue for local communities and
park maintenance. The outputs listed below would contribute directly to the achievement of the
Project's objective (i.e., creation of three ecologically and socially sustainable PAs in forest
ecosystems).

i.   Finalize management plans for three PAs;
ii. Undertake studies to improve park and resource management;
iii. Support professional development of PA staff;
iv. Establish park infrastructure;
v. Establish nature-based tourism infrastructure;
vi. Build local awareness;
vii. Undertake socioeconomic monitoring to inform management plan implementation;
viii.Integrate PA plans into regional and local plans; and
ix. Implement a small grants program for biodiversity-friendly activities.
The FDP would revise and update the process for preparing forest management plans (FMPs) to
ensure sustainable flows of goods (e.g., timber, non-timber forest products, wildlife) and
environmental services (e.g., watershed protection), and implement these over a part of the CC
planning region. The FDP would finance technical and social inputs to the updated FMPs which
would, in turn, inform the PA management planning process.

Component 3: Reorganize and Strengthen the Department of Protected Areas (USD 4.50m,
comprising USD 3.00m IDA, USD 1.25m GEF und USD 0.25m Government funds) aimed at
restructuring and strengthening the DPA to update and implement its mandate. The below listed
outputs would build institutional capacity essential for the sustainability of the PDO.
i.   Support institutional reorganization;
ii. Build capacity of the DPA to administer the system of PAs;
iii. Develop and implement a biodiversity monitoring program for the PAs; and
iv. Develop informational materials for visitors.
The IDA financed FDP would assist the Department of Forestry (DoF) to implement its new
mandate to establish sound forest management systems that would maximize the contribution of
Georgia's forests to economic development and rural poverty reduction on an environmentally
sustainable basis, through: (i) restructuring of the DoF and consolidation of district offices; (ii)
development of national standards for sustainable forestry that would be incorporated into forest
management guidelines and implemented in specific areas under the FDP; (iii) establishment of a
forest information system and completion of a national forest inventory which included
identification of high conservation value forests; and (iv) training and incremental logistical



                                                   3

support. The effective implementation of DoF's new mandate would significantly contribute to
biodiversity conservation in PAs and corridor areas.

Component 4. Project Management and Monitoring (USD 1.73m, comprising USD 1.00m
IDA, USD 0.63m GEF und USD 0.10m Government funds) would support a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) that would be located within DPA and responsible for contracting
providers of goods, works, and consultant services under the direction of a multi-sector steering
committee. PIU staff would include a project director, financial management specialist, an
additional accountant if required, and one or more procurement specialists. Good technical and
fiduciary management would make the achievement of the PDO possible.

1.6 Revised Components
No formal restructuring occurred2. Revisions to components agreed during the course of project
implementation included (i) dropping from Component 2 the planning of the Eastern Caucasus
Alpine Corridor which had not yet been initiated, and channeling funds to management plan
development for the David Gareji area which had better prospects for fast completion; (ii)
dropping from Component 2, the reintroduction of the gazelle into the Vashlovani PAs as a
formerly agreed donation from Azerbaijan did not materialize; and (iii) dropping from
Component 2 the development and implementation of grazing management plans to avoid
resettlement impacts. None of these revisions required amendment of the Grant Agreement.

1.7 Other significant changes

The Grant Agreement was amended several times, including:

 Changing the disbursement percentages for works (from 80% to 85%), consulting services
    (80% to 100%) and operating costs (90% to 100%) to reduce Government's counterpart
    funding burden and speed up disbursement (March 29, 2004).

 Increasing the contract ceilings for various procurement methods (September 19, 2006), and
    providing for procurement from UN Agencies as an alternative to the International Shopping
    method instead of linking it to the National Shopping method (February 12, 2007);

 Extending the Project closing date from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, and then
    to December 31, 2008. The justification for the first extension was that while project
    implementation had been behind schedule, it was making good progress and additional time
    would enable the achievement of the PDO. The second extension was granted to provide an
    additional construction season to complete a small volume of outstanding civil works in the
    high mountainous Tusheti PAs, which had been stalled by poor meteorological conditions.

 Reallocating funds (i) from "goods", "training", "small grants", "operating costs" and
    "unallocated" categories of disbursement to "works" and "consultants' services" categories
    due to higher than originally anticipated cost of civil works (May 17, 2007), and (ii) from
    "works", "training", and "small grants" categories of disbursement to "consultants' services"
    and "operating costs" categories to cover consultant costs and incremental operating costs
    resulting from project extension.




2ISRs No. 9 ­ 19 indicated that a restructuring had taken place on March 16, 2004 due to an erroneous
entry. Information Solutions Group (ISG) removed the entry from the ICR Data Sheet following clearance
by the Investment Policy Group (OPCIL).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis. Several highly informative background
studies/analyses were carried out:

 A Social Assessment based on a household survey and focal group meetings in the
communities surrounding the project-supported PAs emphasized: (i) high level of poverty (the
income of more than half of the households constituted the bare minimum of survival), lack of
employment opportunities, especially in Tusheti, and heavy reliance on fuelwood; (ii) low
awareness of the Vashlovani PA among local residents contrasted with high awareness and pride
of the PAs in Lagodekhi and Tusheti; but general support for PAs in all three areas and concern
about the poor state of pastures; (iii) somewhat unrealistic expectations in Tusheti about the
benefits of the Project regarding resource use (such as the notion that use of natural resources in
the PA or livestock production may increase as a result of better/expanded protection) and the
potential of tourism, contrasted with low expectations from tourism in Lagodekhi and
Dedopliskaro; and (iii) heavy reliance on land resources for agriculture, grazing, fuel wood, and
water (in Vashlovani). The Social Assessment recommended a participatory approach to PA
planning from the earliest stages in order to correct unrealistic expectations and prevent losses to
resource users.

 A nature / culture tourism assessment of Georgia carried out by an international tourism
specialist found that the natural and cultural landscapes of the Caucasus Mountains have medium
to high potential as an international nature tourism destination. Tusheti, Svaneti, and Lagodekhi
were the areas with the highest potential among the project sites. Targeted marketing must be an
integral part of a tourism development strategy aimed at creating an image of Georgia as a
tourism destination. The Project's investments in facilities for improved park management (e.g.,
administration offices and information centers) and capacity to provide environmental education
and park interpretation services to national and international visitors would also promote
ecotourism. A medium case scenario of 5% growth for Georgia's nature tourism at the national
level from a current level of 5,000 tourists, would conservatively yield USD 5.5 million to local
communities and USD 7.8 million nationally by year 5 of the Project.

 A survey of willingness to visit Georgian parks and pay for visitor services was carried out
among Georgian city dwellers, short term foreign visitors to Tbilisi, and expatriate residents of
the region (Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia). The survey found that the factors most likely to
influence PA visitation were accessibility and cost. Expatriates and visitors were the most likely
group to visit PAs, with Tbilisi expatriates expressing interest in as many as five PA trips within
the next year. Among the six PAs presented in the survey3, the Borjomi National Park was the PA
preferred by most respondents, followed by Central Caucasus, Tusheti and Lagodekhi.
Vashlovani was the least preferred. The PA visitor service that most respondents were interested
in was "guided tour on animal and plant species". Finally, the average willingness to pay daily
entrance fee ranged between USD 9 and USD 16 among international respondents.

Incorporation of lessons learned in project design. Three lessons learned from earlier GEF and
Bank projects in the region were incorporated in project design:

i.  Projects should be initiated by building capacity for implementing project activities, and
    addressing policy changes needed for successful implementation.




3Borjomi, Central Caucasus, Kolheti, Lagodekhi, Tusheti, and Vashlovani PAs.


                                                  5

     During the first year of implementation, the Project would focus on (i) institutional reform of
     the DPA; and (ii) building capacity in implementing project activities.

ii. Projects should have broad support in the government, civil society, and local communities
     where the three PAs are proposed to be created or expanded.

     The Project was recognized as a national priority and had the support of central and district
     government officials, local communities and NGOs. Evidence for this support is threefold: (i)
     creation / expansion of the three PAs supported under the Project had been approved by the
     district governments; (ii) the public meetings held during project appraisal were well-attended,
     and highly supportive of the Project; and (iii) the President and the Speaker of the Parliament
     publicly expressed support for the Project.

iii. GEF projects should develop mechanisms to improve sustainability.

     The Project supported tourism development in the PAs and assisted local communities with
     income generating activities that are consistent with the PAs' biodiversity conservation
     priority.

Rationale for the Bank's intervention. The Bank's involvement was justified based on the
extensive history of cooperation, including Bank assistance to Georgia with preparation of its
National Biodiversity Strategy/Action Plan, National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), and
Forest Sector Review, which together provided a strategic foundation for the Project. The Bank
had developed an understanding of Georgia's environment and development issues and gained
experience with government and civil society. Through the IDA/GEF financed Integrated Coastal
Management Project (ICMP), the Bank was assisting a PA management activity in Kolkheti
which would be linked with this Project and benefit from the Project's support to strengthen the
central DPA and US National Park Service (NPS) technical assistance in PA management.

Assessment of the project design. The objectives and components of the Project were in line
with Georgia's objectives with regard to biodiversity conservation as outlined in the NEAP. The
design also took into account the need for social sustainability by promoting sustainable natural
resource use by local communities and supporting nature-based tourism in and around PAs.
Project implementation arrangements were not overly complicated. The decision at appraisal to
shift project implementation responsibility from the MEPNR (which had prepared the Project) to
the DPA4 was correct and in line with the overall vision of DPA managing the Network of
Protected Areas in Georgia. Furthermore, support for restructuring the DPA in the early phase of
the Project was highly appropriate to prepare it for its new mandate to manage a network of
multi-purpose PAs. Geographic dispersion was not a problem since the country is relatively small
and two of the three new PAs are within 2-3 hours from Tbilisi. The link with the IDA-financed
FDP was appropriate and provided an opportunity for technical cooperation between DoF and
DPA to incorporate biodiversity conservation into forest management using state-of-the-art
geographical information systems.

The inclusion of the biological corridor management in the Eastern Caucasus Mountains with the
objective of incorporating biodiversity conservation into production landscapes was appropriate
given the importance of these corridors for the region's key endangered species and the need to
raise stakeholder awareness on this issue. The political climate in Georgia at the time of project
preparation was also fully supportive of environmentally sustainable development and
biodiversity conservation beyond the boundaries of formal PAs. Nevertheless, in the light of later



4At the time of Appraisal in 2001the DPA was reporting to the President's Office; it became part of
MEPNR in 2005.


                                                  6

knowledge of capacity for management plan implementation (Section 2.2), it would have been
more effective to design a less ambitious activity focusing on most critical habitat areas to ensure
passage of key species between PA "safe islands" rather than a more ambitious goal to
mainstream conservation in productive landscapes.

Project design should have paid more attention to traditional herders who used pastures in the
project-supported PAs. Resettlement plans should have been introduced during project
preparation, rather than during implementation.

Adequacy of government's commitment, stakeholder involvement and/or participatory
processes. The Project was developed on the basis of Georgia's commitments to global and
regional biodiversity conservation as evidenced by its ratification of the Convention of Biological
Diversity, and signing of the Bonn and Bern Conventions, the Bucharest Convention for the
Black Sea, and the Convention of International Trade of Endangered Species. Project preparation
also benefitted from collaboration between central and district governments, local communities,
scientific institutions and NGOs. Project design incorporated the key finding of the Social
Assessment that local communities expected these PAs to lead to improvements in their standards
of living, mainly though ecotourism services.

Assessment of risks. The overall project risk was appropriately rated moderate based on four
"from outputs to objective" risks and one "from components to outputs" risk. The recognition of
political instability as a substantial risk is noteworthy given that the Rose Revolution in late 2003,
two and half years after appraisal. However, political instability has also posed a substantial risk
for Georgia's and hence its PAs' tourism prospects, which was not recognized. While the team
noted that cross sectoral planning might face resistance from Government and other stakeholders,
the rating should have been substantial rather than moderate given the importance of maximizing
the intensity of agriculture for local stakeholder livelihoods in a predominantly rural country, and
lack of an institutional and legal framework for biological corridor management.

2.2 Implementation

The Project did not become effective for 11 months after Board approval due to delay in meeting
of effectiveness conditions. This caused a significant break between the preparation and
implementation phases. Government's difficulties in providing counterpart funding affected the
implementation of PADP as well as other Bank-financed operations. This situation improved
significantly following an overhaul of the national public revenue and expenditure management
system after the Rose Revolution and an increase in the disbursement ratios for the Project in
2004. The 2005 transformation of DPA from a department within MEPNR into an autonomous
legal body of public law - Agency of Protected Areas (APA) - subordinated to the MEPNR
slowed down project implementation resulting in the downgrading of progress towards
achievement of PDO and implementation progress to moderately unsatisfactory. Particularly
impacted were Components 2 and 3 as the transformation process hindered enactment of
legislation establishing the three PAs and adoption of their management plans. While project
implementation proceeded smoothly following the institutional transformation, time lost during
this transition and the reorganization of MEPNR PIUs into one unit, the Sustainable Development
Projects Implementation Agency (SDPIA), necessitated the extension of the project closing date.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The M&E key indicators (Section 1.2) as agreed in the Supplemental Letter at project
negotiations adequately cover the breadth of outcomes needed to achieve the PDO. Four of the




                                                   7

six5 key indicators fulfilled the requirement of ease of measurement, data availability, and
availability of a baseline. Indicators (i), (ii) and (iv) were straightforward to measure as they
required only verifying the status of various management plans. For indicator (vii), it was
reasonable to expect that the specific PAs would keep records of the fees collected. Indicators (v)
and (vi) were more problematic. In particular, it was unrealistic to expect that impact of project
activities on natural habitats would be measurable within the life of the Project. An output
indictor on measures put in place to halt degradation would have been more appropriate instead.
Indicator (vi) did not specify a baseline, stages, and a measurable aspect of community support.
Presumably, it was assumed these indicators would be refined with support during project
implementation along with the details of an M&E system. Nevertheless, while the key indicators
(i), (ii), (iv) along with associated process indicators were monitored from project effectiveness
by the PIU and the Bank supervision team, consultants to design biodiversity and social
monitoring systems were not engaged until late 2004. It appeared that the PIU and other
stakeholders in MEPNR were not fully familiar with the project logframe and all key
performance indicators, which was addressed through a stakeholder workshop in early 2004.

The implementing agency tracked PA revenues systematically from 2006 when user fees were
instituted. The APA tasked a staff member to collect, analyze and post on the web data obtained
from individual PAs as well as Government budget allocations (see Table 1 in Section 4). With
regard to community support, a PA community survey instrument was developed under the
Project and implemented by the specific PAs in the final two years of the Project. Analysis of the
data was not completed within the project life due to shortage of statistical analysis skills at APA.
Nevertheless, APA is working to build staff capacity in statistical analysis to gain better
understanding of relationships between various variables gauged in the survey. Under the
Biodiversity Monitoring Program, implemented mainly by specific PAs, a leopard was spotted in
the Vashlovani PA, which was seen as a early indicator of decreasing disturbance of the
ecosystem as occurrence of leopards had been extremely rare in Georgia over many decades.
Indicator meadow and steppe habitat recovery (v) was monitored in the context of a pilot
demonstration activity in Tusheti.

Two of the key indicators from the Supplemental Letter and 6 intermediate outcome indictors
from the PAD's Output Indicators were closely monitored by the Bank. The wording of a few
indicators changed slightly over time and one intermediate outcome indicator combined two
related PAD output indicators.

PA Managers carried out the PA Management Self-Assessment Questionnaire twice during the
Project, once at the MTR and a second time a year later to help strengthen the quantitative
measurement of capacity gains. The Questionnaire allowed PA Managers to step back from daily
management tasks and take a broader view of their performance. The results show an overall
improvement for all PAs. Ratings for most of the assessment criteria grew from 2004 to 2005 and
2006. Ratings for a few indicators dropped after the first round of assessment and then rebounded
in 2006. Interestingly, the PA administrations explained this by lack of understanding and over-
scoring at the baseline, followed by a more informed and realistic self assessment in the
subsequent years (see Annex 1).

The project indicators helped the DPA / APA to monitor and evaluate project progress. The use
of indicators related to PA system funding was and remains exemplary considering a lack of
capacity to do this at the time of Project effectiveness. APA has used PA revenue data to plan
short and medium term ecotourism promotion activities and pursue other funding sources when
visitor revenues lagged behind projections and PA operational costs. Information on the status of

biological corridor plans was also readily available. Furthermore, APA continues to make efforts
to develop the social M&E as they consider the information collected useful in designing
awareness campaigns and community-PA cooperation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards:

Environmental safeguards

Project preparation triggered Operational Policy (OP) 4.01 Environmental Assessment (EA) only,
while relevance of OP 4.04 Natural Habitats, and OP 4.36 Forestry were "to be monitored". In
late 2002, the Bank team determined that the latter OPs were also triggered and began rating
compliance. The Project was classified as Category B. The EA identified minor risks of
disturbance to flora and fauna associated with (i) small-scale construction and/or renovation of
national park infrastructure, including administrative buildings, checkpoints and guard stations,
trails and tourism infrastructure; and (ii) increased noise and refuse due to increased recreational
use of the three national parks under the Project. An environmental management plan (EMP) laid
out mitigation measures. During project implementation, compliance with the EMP was adequate
and the Project's rating for OPs 4.01, 4.04 and 4.36 remained satisfactory throughout
implementation.

Involuntary Resettlement

At appraisal, the Project did not trigger OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. The Social
Assessment identified resource use, notably fuelwood and pastures, as a critical issue in all three
project-supported PAs and recommended that the PA administrations "should not restrict access
to fuelwood resources within the protected zones without assisting the local populations in
finding alternative sustainable sources. In addition, the PA administrations will work with local
shepherds and local administrations to ensure that leases for pastureland on lands within the
zoned PA will not be altered until and unless leases for equal or better pastureland elsewhere have
been allocated." It appears that the non-triggering of OP4.12 was based on the understanding that
the above recommendations would be followed. However, as the process of PA management plan
development got underway, it became clear that OP4.12 was triggered and the Bank team began
rating compliance in the Bank's Project Status Reports in mid-2003. In September 2005 and
again in June 2006, the task team carried out a comprehensive assessment of resettlement-related
issues. The assessment found that the implementation of some components of the PA
management plans would lead to restriction of the established patterns of natural resource use and,
possibly, to conflicts. Upon the task team's recommendation, MEPNR commissioned a reputable
NGO to prepare a Resettlement Plan and Process Framework (RPPF). Submitted to and approved
by the Bank in December 2007, the RPPF covered people who lose access to natural resources.

Project implementation did not cause any resettlement, as APA carefully avoided confrontation
with local communities and opted to delay enforcement of those elements of the PA management
plans which would discontinue current resource use patterns until transition arrangements and
agreements could be reached through negotiations with the local community as laid out in the
RPPF. Once the RPPF was developed, Government demonstrated political commitment to
addressing the identified issues. Specifically, in Lagodekhi, the current conflicting pasture lease
agreements with sheep farmers within PA boundaries will not be renewed when they expire at the
end of 2009 and farmers will be offered alternative pastures, as recommended by the RPPF. In
Tusheti, current zoning is being revisited to adjust boundaries around various categories inside
the PAs to the historically established traditional patterns of land use. The most complex issues
are encountered in Vashlovani where shepherds are reluctant to accept the offered terms for
moving to the proposed alternative pastures. While use of winter pastures in Vashlovani PAs may


                                                   9

be tolerable in the medium term perspective from the point of view of pasture management, it
must be discontinued eventually if a gazelle population is to be reintroduced in this area. The
APA is actively searching for a solution to this outstanding matter. Discussions are ongoing with
potential donor organizations willing to address the gazelle re-introduction program in a
comprehensive manner, including the habitat problem.

Procurement. The procurement performance of the implementing agency was moderately
unsatisfactory. While the implementing agency's procurement capacity was adequate initially, it
weakened due to frequent staff turnover. During the last two years of project implementation, the
procurement specialist (PS) was replaced twice and for an extended period of time, SDPIA had
no PS at all. During this period, the consultant who carried out procurement functions had no
procurement qualification, responses to queries from the Bank were slow, and documentation was
poor. Furthermore, the Bank's guidelines on post- and prior-review were misinterpreted.

The City of Tbilisi Prosecutor's Office investigated a contract for PA boundary demarcation and
concluded that the quality delivered did not match the technical specifications in the contract and
deemed it a misappropriation. The Bank's assessment that the contractor's performance did not
violate the Bank's Procurement Guidelines was officially communicated to the Government.
Nevertheless, the Government found the contractor guilty and received as a result of a plea
bargain an amount deemed misappropriated, USD 231,608.21 which was reimbursed in
December 2008 to the Project Account.

Financial Management (FM). While FM was initially considered satisfactory, as in the case of
procurement, FM arrangements deteriorated significantly due to staff turnover. Budgeting and
planning capacity was poor, the internal control system demonstrated deficiencies, and FM risks
were rated as substantial. Quarterly FM reports were often of inadequate quality and submitted to
the Bank with delays. As a result, the FM rating was downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory in
September 2007. Despite these problems, the financial statements and other supporting
documents received unqualified (clean) audit opinions with the exception of FY06. In 2006, a
qualification was issued due to insufficient evidence for eligibility of some expenditures. The
qualification was later removed, and a clean audit opinion was issued for the FY07 statements.
The audits were carried out according to the International Standards of Auditing; however the
audit reports for 2007 and 2008 were submitted to the Bank with significant delay.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Gradual transition of a lead role in management of project activities from SDPIA to the APA
occurred during the final two years of the Project, as SDPIA's capacity grew weaker and APA
took more control, primarily by strictly supervising investments in project-supported PAs and
taking over the awareness raising / tourism promotion function. At this time, APA is a dynamic
organization with a vision to expand on the Project's achievements. It has secured Government
resources and is working hard to broaden revenue sources for the PAs, from visitors, international
donors, and the private sector.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDO is highly relevant to Georgia's present priorities in biodiversity conservation. Having
put in place a network of 25 PAs in the past decade and achieved significant institutional
strengthening to effectively manage this network, the Government's short and medium term
priorities are to strengthen administrative capacity in individual PAs (especially those that have



                                                 10

not benefitted from GEF or other donor support), further improve the financial sustainability of
the PA system, outsource some of the visitor services, adjust PA boundaries to better reflect
community land use patterns, and further involve communities in PA management. The Project
played a large role in laying the institutional and physical groundwork on which this next round
of interventions can be built. Furthermore, lessons learned in the project areas will be helpful in
managing other PAs.

While the Government strongly supports biodiversity conservation within PAs, the environment
is not ripe for managing habitats and biodiversity conservation in production landscapes as they
fall outside the authority of APA and would necessitate more complex institutional arrangements
involving multiple local government and line agencies.

Neither the present Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) not the CPS under preparation for
Georgia includes any operations focusing on environmental protection. The focus given limited
resource constraints is on infrastructure, reflecting the Government's more immediate
development agenda. In the longer term, the Bank's experience through this Project and its global
experience can support environmental protection, nature-based tourism, and diversification of
rural livelihoods.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PDO has been achieved at a moderately satisfactory level.

Component 1: Support Protected Areas Planning was moderately satisfactory in supporting the
PDO. The component fully achieved its objective of supporting development of a detailed plan
for biodiversity conservation and forest conservation. Management plans were produced for two
new PAs. Their participatory development ensured community support. MEPNR is fully
committed to granting legal designation to these PAs by 2010. The component also achieved the
objective of supporting corridor conservation planning in eastern Georgia as well as development
of participatory of management plans and guidelines for the Alazani flood plain forest and the
David Gareji protected landscape. Although the management plan for the Alazani flood plains has
not yet been formally adopted, this process has succeeded to raise awareness of key
environmental issues. Establishment of the David Gareji protected landscape is on hold due to
political sensitivities given proximity to the border with Azerbaijan.

Component 2: Establish Protected Areas Management and Build Awareness of Biodiversity
Conservation was satisfactory in supporting the PDO by helping establish the Lagodekhi,
Vashlovani, Tusheti, and Batsara-Babaneuri and Ilto PAs, covering a total area of 189,000ha.
These PAs have legal designation, formally registered boundaries, and approved management
plans. The outcome "full protection" is ensured by increased PA staff numbers and skills in
managing multiple-zone PAs, and growing coverage of basic operating costs through government
budget allocation (see Section 4). The Small Grants Program, which supported 61 environment-
friendly local initiatives in PA gateway communities, contributed to raising local public
awareness of local PAs.

Component 3. Reorganize and Strengthen the DPA also satisfactorily contributed to the PDO.
The DPA underwent a dramatic transformation to a dynamic, adequately staffed and highly
skilled APA, which has a clear legal mandate to manage the country's PA network and strong
ownership of the multiple use PA planning and management approach. APA's legal status allows
it to generate, retain and reinvest revenues in the PA system. APA has skills in revenue
management, and tourism marketing and development. APA and its branches have fully adequate
premises, office and field equipment, and means of transportation and communication. The
Project has developed and implemented a Biodiversity Monitoring Program for the PAs. The



                                                  11

Project also supported production of high quality printed information materials, including
booklets and leaflets on PAs, Georgia's flora and fauna species, and calendars in the Georgian
and English languages. APA also has a highly attractive, functional and informative web site.
These outputs are crucial for the sustainability of Project outcomes.

3.3 Efficiency

At the time the Project was designed, economic or financial efficiency analyses were not required
for GEF-funded projects; as such net present value/economic rate of return or cost effectiveness
was and would be extremely difficult to assess ex-post. However, a GEF incremental cost
analysis (ICA) was carried out at appraisal. Review of the implementation of the Baseline and
GEF Alternative Scenarios indicates that a significant part of the GEF Alternative Scenario was
accomplished. The exception is that management plans for biological corridors in Eastern
Georgia have not been implemented although APA has indicated that the management plan for
the David Gareji area would be implemented when the border dispute with Azerbaijan is resolved.
As a result, the attainment of the PDO and the GEF Alternative Scenario is rated moderately
satisfactory (see Annex 3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory because the PDO was achieved to a
significant extent. Three ecologically and socially sustainable PAs were created in eastern
Georgia and this component is highly relevant to Government's short and medium-term plan;
however, capacity necessary to mainstream biodiversity conservation into the production
landscape connecting these areas was not fully achieved.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Project has begun to make small differences in the local communities' welfare through PA
visitors and private organizations who spend 1-2 days in Lagodekhi and Dedopliskaro to use the
conference facilities within the PAs. Local families that have refurbished their homes to
accommodate visitors, cater food services to the conferences, and provide visitor services as
guides or by providing horseback rides are able to earn extra income. However, the number of
such families is limited and the number of visitors has been below the capacity of the existing
facilities. This has been a disappointment to some families who expected large and quick gains
(as cautioned against by the Social Assessment). External factors, such as the August 2008
hostilities with Russia or news of other political unrest, have and will continue to limit the extent
to which nature-based tourism can contribute to the local communities' welfare. Therefore, it is
important for local communities to recognize that a level of nature-based tourism development
that can sustain entire families is not feasible in the short term.

Adherence to the Resettlement Plan and Process Framework in the project-supported PAs will
prevent negative impact on the livelihoods of herders and other PA resource users. The
Government is taking action towards improving rural livelihoods and mediating human-wildlife
conflicts around Tusheti and Vashlovani PAs in line with the Process Framework with the
assistance of international environmental NGOs, using resources provided by the EU.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening




                                                   12

The Project contributed significantly to capacity development in the DPA (and APA), and the
three PAs supported under the project. This includes training of PA officials in various aspects of
modern protected area management, including financial management, visitor management, public
relations, and English language skills; as well as proper equipment and secure user rights to
adequate premises. The Project's innovative collaboration with the US NPS was instrumental in
achieving higher staff capacity. Under the partnership established between DPA / APA and NPS,
Georgian PAs were matched with US national parks of similar natural conditions whose
superintendants visited the Georgian PAs and vice versa. A mentoring relationship emerged
whereby Georgian PA directors received guidance over several years on the above-mentioned
issues and saw US national park management through study tours.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative). Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

On July 10, 2008, a stakeholder workshop reviewed the experiences made with the small grant
program supported by the project and had the following key findings and conclusions:

 Establishment of new PAs or significant expansion of existing PAs should be accompanied
    by outreach to communities in buffer zones, aimed at adapting local communities to new
    natural resource management regimes;
 Community participation in the development and operation of PA financing schemes is
    critical to ensure that beneficiary interests are duly incorporated and the schemes are operated
    with transparency and accountability;
 Maintaining tight links between PA administrations and community support financing
    schemes is important to enhance collaboration between communities in the buffer zone and
    neighboring PAs.
 While beneficiary communities should have an important role in shaping the support schemes
    and defining priorities, in most cases they will need significant technical assistance to
    organize themselves, formulate viable proposals, and manage their activities.

Surveys of the project-supported PA administrations demonstrated a positive trend in their
success rate, as detailed in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

This section examines the factors that might hinder the Project's PDO outcomes from being
maintained.

Low local community support to PAs. This risk is moderate due to restrictions on natural resource
use within the boundaries and lower than initially expected tourism benefits to local communities.

 While the management plans generated under the Project allowed for sustainable use of
    natural resources in certain locations within PA boundaries, they did not fully accommodate
    existing land use patterns, which led to leading to conflicts with local communities. These
    conflicts will be resolved when APA implements the Resettlement Plan and Process
    Framework and adjusts PA boundaries and zones as it intends in the short term. Consultation
    with the local communities on PA management issues is an area that needs improvement. The
    practice of "advisory councils" failed; the dominant pattern of communication appears to be
    lectures given by park rangers on what local communities may not do in the PAs. It would be
    helpful for PAs to include community relations specialists who can deepen positive
    relationships with the communities.




                                                   13

 PA visitation is highly dependent on political stability and sense of security. This was
    evidenced by massive visitor reservation cancellations in response to the August 2008
    hostilities which occurred in the vicinity of the project PAs. Even in the best of times,
    development of an area as an ecotourism destination takes meticulous marketing work and
    patience. To mitigate the risk of community disillusionment, it is important to encourage a
    longer term perspective and diversify revenue sources. For example, some project-supported
    guest houses in Dedopliskaro have attracted business or religious visitors to the area as well.
    The PAs' strategy to offer their conference rooms for business conventions to be catered by
    local businesses also provides revenue opportunities for the local communities. Outsourcing
    of visitor services (e.g., management of PA guest houses and bungalows) would help
    generate more business opportunities for the communities.

Insufficient PA budgets to cover basic expenses. This risk is low. Government budget allocations
to the PA Network have increased dramatically in recent years. In 2007, Government funding was
USD 1.25 million; in 2008, this amount increased by more than 50% to USD 2.77 million. The
budget allocation for 2009 is approximately USD 3.65 million, representing another significant
increase. Budget allocations to project-supported PAs have also increased by 350% to 500%
between 2006 and 2008 (Table 1). These budget increases have allowed the hiring of new rangers
and administrators and salary increases, and cover basic management functions. Given
Government's commitment to the country's PA network a return to previous insufficient funding
levels is not expected. While revenues from project-supported visitor amenities, such as picnic
and camping areas, and guesthouses and bungalows, are still modest (Table 1), they are expected
to increase in the medium to long term as the PAs become more known locally and
internationally. The increasing number of visitors in the past three years bodes well for this
prospect (Table 1). However, more comprehensive PA management, including community
relations and rangeland management, will require additional specialist staff and hence higher
funding levels than now.

Inefficient management of PAs. This risk is moderate. Under normal circumstances, the capacity
built at both APA and PA administrations and ongoing partnership with the US NPS is sufficient
to allow adequate implementation of the modern PA management mandate in the foreseeable
future.6 However, strict centralization of administration of individual PAs poses a risk for the
proper upkeep of project-supported investments. At the present time, even the smallest
maintenance contracts are handled by APA in Tbilisi and may take up to six months. The



6Extraordinary circumstances would include a drastic reversal in Government policy towards biodiversity
conservation similar to the shift in forest policy that occurred in the aftermath of the Rose Revolution.
Government chose to auction long term leases for forest parcels to private operators without putting in
place an adequate environmental safeguards system. While official guidelines for forest inventories
prescribe coverage of biodiversity resources, such inventories are to be prepared by private lease holders,
which represents a clear conflict of interest.

administrations of the project-supported PAs have the capacity to handle such functions with
greater efficiency.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Project design was overall sound and included novel elements. Preparation activities included
input from a prominent international ecotourism operator who advised on facilities that would
attract ecotourists. Also noteworthy is the cooperation agreement with US NPS which provided
invaluable guidance to project PAs and DPA / APA in all aspects of PA management. This
cooperation was later replicated in other Bank-supported projects in the region. Nevertheless,
there were three areas where performance could have been stronger. The first area is the failure to
prepare a Resettlement Plan and Process Framework at the time of appraisal (see Section 2.4).
This document would have guided the PA management plans that were developed during Project
implementation. Second, in designing the mainstreaming biodiversity concerns in production
landscapes sub-component, the Bank should have carried out a review of the institutional and
legal issues as well as different stakeholder interests that might influence biodiversity
conservation in biological corridors. Finally, project preparation would have benefitted from
greater stakeholder consultations, especially in M&E design.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Supervision performance was generally strong. As the 2004 QAG review also noted, the Bank
made a significant effort to jumpstart project implementation after the long delay in project
effectiveness, although it failed to address M&E design and implementation until early 2004. The
team was proactive afterwards in engaging the implementing agency to focus on the M&E
framework and triggering the OP on Involuntary Resettlement. The Bank also discussed with
counterparts a possible restructuring and setting clear short-term performance targets at MTR
when the pace of implementation slowed. At MTR, the Bank agreed with the Government to drop
the planning of the eastern Caucasus alpine corridor which had not yet been initiated, thus scaling
down the slow-performing Eastern Georgia Corridors sub-component. Furthermore, in an effort
to ease the impact of Government's low counterpart financing capacity on disbursements, the
Bank agreed to increase disbursement ratios for certain categories. The supervision team included
Bank staff with considerable experience in biodiversity conservation as well as international PA
management and ecotourism consultants who strongly supported project implementation
especially with regard to institutional capacity building. The Bank continued effective
cooperation with US NPS. The fact that the TTL was based in Tbilisi during the final two years
of the Project was beneficial in resolving day-to-day implementation issues. Similarly, the
Procurement and FM specialists were also Tbilisi-based, allowing for closer supervision and
more effective communication with the PIU. The supervision team could have also done better in
documenting safeguards ratings in mission aide memoires and better filing of project related
documents in the Bank's IRIS.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance is considered moderately satisfactory.




                                                  15

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government commitment to the Project remained strong through major political shifts, including
the Rose Revolution in late 2003. Despite its highly de-regulative and liberal approach to
economic and natural resources management, the post-Revolution Government supported the
expansion of existing PAs, establishment of new PAs, and strengthening of the agency in charge
of the PA network. On the other hand, Government did not support incorporation biodiversity
conservation into production landscapes. Changes of Minister of Environment (there were six
changes during the Project), along with a lower level position changes invariably negatively
impacted Project performance by slowing down decision making. Government fulfilled a legally
binding commitment to establish and maintain a Project Steering Committee mandated to provide
guidance to Project implementation, though the Committee gradually lost its function as (i) an
overly high level membership insisted on by the Government would not allow a sufficient number
of members to participate in Committee meetings, and (ii) the non-binding recommendations of
the Committee did not bring added value as after the Rose Revolution DPA / APA took a strong
lead in Project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Project administration progressed from reasonably satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory
during the life of the Project. The merging of MENPR PIUs under one unit, the SDPIA, created
significant disruption in Project implementation as key Project staff left. In the final year of the
Project SDPIA lacked key administrative staff, including a Technical Manager, a Financial
Manager, and a Procurement Officer. For several months in late 2008, the SDPIA Director
position was also vacant, which paralyzed SDPIA. On the other hand, APA stepped in to fill the
vacuum by playing an important role in supervising the ongoing contacts signed by SDPIA,
which was critical for completing construction works and delivering infrastructure to the PAs
supported by the Project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall Borrower commitment to the Project remained high through politically challenging times,
which resulted in a well-functioning PA network and administration with much promise that
remaining challenges will be overcome gradually. This picture is in striking contrast with that in
1999 when Project preparation started (Section 1.1). On the other hand, lack of borrower
commitment to push for institutional reforms required for biodiversity conservation in production
landscapes in part prevented the full achievement of the PDO. Administrative bottlenecks caused
by institutional re-arrangements throughout the Project slowed down Project implementation.

6. Lessons Learned

 It is important that resource use restrictions are indentified during Project preparation and
    evaluated in the framework of OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement. Preparation of a
    Resettlement Plan and Process Framework during Project preparation may have reduced
    delays and complications during implementation.

 In a country with no precedent for incorporating biodiversity conservation in spatial planning,
    it is unrealistic to expect that it can be achieved within the relatively short lifetime of a
    project. It is advisable to limit such activities to a pilot level to demonstrate their benefits.



                                                   16

 Establishing consultative bodies for PA is not a guarantee that they will operate in a
    meaningful way. It takes substantial work and effort to develop adequate and country-specific
    tools for successful stakeholder representation in PA management.

 Top quality technical assistance from peer organizations coupled with adequate resources can
    significantly improve national standards and practice of PA interpretation and visitor
    management, by raising awareness about expectations of foreign visitors and modern
    international good practice.

 Competitive Grant Schemes (CGS) inevitably produce winners and losers. Full transparency
    of the decision-making process, a good public information system and appropriate
    community participation in the CGS cycle can help avoid the risk of turning losers into
    enemies of PAs and their administrations.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies. A draft of the ICR was shared with APA for comments.
In its response, APA indicated that it considered the ICR's analysis of the project's results fair

                                                  populations as well as national audiences were produced, including TV
                                                  video clips; postcards; a directory of bird species of East Georgia;
                                                  newspaper stories; lecture series in local schools and press briefings;
                                                  calendars for 2006 and 2007 with attractive pictures from the PAs; and
                                                  booklets and leaflets with pictures, maps and factual information. The

SMALL GRANTS PROGRAM

Under the Georgia Protected Areas Development Project

The Small Grants Program (SGP) was implemented in the buffer zones of Vashlovani, Lagodekhi
and Tusheti protected areas. The overall objective of the SGP was to facilitate community
participation in biodiversity conservation in and around PAs. More specifically, SGP promoted
environmental protection and biodiversity conservation awareness among local communities;
helped poor and vulnerable communities living in and around PAs to identify and implement sub-
projects to provide for their livelihood needs and improve their living conditions in an
environmentally sound manner; disseminated knowledge and skills for traditional methods of
resource use; and established partnership between the local communities, NGOs, and PA
administrations.

SGP was administered in accordance with an Operational Manual by a non-governmental
organization (NGO) contracted under the Project. The NGO maintained a database of the sub-
projects funded, received progress reports from sub-grant recipients, and authorized payments to
recipients based on the interim deliverables. The NGO had a strong field presence throughout SGP
implementation. A Board was established to review and approve grant proposals, resolve issues
emerging in the course of sub-projects implementation and provide professional advice on technical
matters. The Board was comprised of representatives of governmental and non-governmental
organizations, academia, and the Church.

A Total of 732,800 USD equivalent was disbursed under SGP during three grant award cycles,
which were held in April-August 2004, October-December 2004, and July-September 2005.
Approximately 600 initial grant applications were received. After the initial screening, some of
them were developed into full grant applications and eventually 63 were approved for financing,
out of which two were canceled at the early stage and 61 entered into implementation. The amount
of individual grants was ranging between 4,000 and 25,000 USD equivalent.

The main types of sub-projects supported from SGP are as follows:

         Rehabilitation of village water supply systems;
         Revival of technologies and support to folk arts and crafts;
         Ecological summer camps for youth;
         Family-owned bread-and-breakfast facilities;
         Development/management of simple nature tourism infrastructure;
         In-situ conservation of agro-biodiversity;
         Production of seedlings for windbreaks; and
         Restoration and conservation of cultural heritage.

The success rate of SGP was 92%, meaning that 58 out of 63 projects fully achieved their
objectives as set out in the initial grant applications, or as revised with the SGP Board's
endorsement. Two projects had problems with start-up and did not materialize. The grant
resources were therefore cancelled. Three sub-projects failed to produce the planned outputs due to
poor budgeting and weak management.

                              Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

No economic or financial efficiency analyses were required at the time of GEF approval, so no net
present value/economic rate of return, cost effectiveness or financial rate of return were calculated.
This would be extremely difficult to assess ex-post.

An incremental cost analysis (ICA) was prepared during Project preparation. The cost of the Project
Baseline Scenario was estimated at USD26.47 million. The Forests Development Project (FDP)
under preparation was assumed to cost USD20.00 million of which USD18.00 million would
contribute to the baseline and USD2.00 million to the GEF Alternative Scenario. Specifically, FDP
was expected to have considerable direct biodiversity conservation benefits, addressing the root
causes of forest biodiversity loss by promoting forest policy reform; preparing and implementing
model sustainable forest management plans (FMPs);, and building the capacity to plan, better
regulate, and monitor forest harvesting and sustainable use. Other portions of the Baseline Scenario
included support from the ICMP, World Wildlife Foundation, UNDP Environmental Capacity
Building Project, the WWF and KfW-funded Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park, and the UNDP
Arid and Semi-Arid Ecosystem Conservation in the Caucasus Medium Size Project.

The cost of the GEF Alternative was estimated at USD 38.77 million. The difference with the
Baseline Scenario, USD12.30million, represented the incremental cost of achieving sustainable
global environmental benefits. Of this amount, the GEF would finance USD8.70 million, the
Government USD1.45 million, and FDP USD2.00. Additionally, USD0.15 million was leveraged
from USAID for technical assistance from the US National Park Service (NPS). FDP would
support forestry planning in the Central Caucasus and inclusion of biodiversity objectives in forest
management plans in production forests.

The cost of the Project was estimated at USD30.30 million. The Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) stipulated that the GEF grant of USD8.70 million leveraged USD20.00 million co-funding
from the FTP, USD 1.45 million from the Government, and USD 0.15 million from the US NPS..7
Table 1 below lays out the activities on which FDP and PADP would collaborate and the
corresponding FDP co-funding amounts, by PADP component.
The FDP delivered some but not all of the activities identified in the Protected Areas Development
PAD. In fact, FDP was suspended and later cancelled in 2008 as a result of the Government's
determination to lease forests to commercial operators in the absence of adequate institutional
measures to ensure the environmental sustainability of the leased forests. Of the approximately
USD20.63 million IDA credit, roughly USD10.97 million was cancelled. Total project costs,
including Government counterpart financing were USD11.35 million.




7There was inconsistency between the ICA in Annex 4 and Section C of the PAD in terms of the FTP funds
presented as leveraged by the GEF grant. For example, while according to ICA, in the GEF Alternative
Scenario, activities supporting the "Establish Protected Areas Management and Build Awareness of
Biodiversity Conservation" component were estimated to cost USD 10.37 million with GEF financing of
USD 6.20 million and USD 4.17 million of cofinancing leveraged; in section C the total cost of the
component was presented as USD 17.20 million with the same amount of GEF funding and USD 10.00
million in co-funding from the FTP.

FDP's key contribution to the Project's PDO was the preparation of landscape-ecological
composition zoning maps and level 1&2 inventories in Oni and Ambrolauri in Central Caucasus
which was an important building block in the preparation of the management plans for two PAs
in the Central Caucasus region. Had it not been for the close cooperation between this GEF-
financed project and the IDA-financed FDP, these outputs may not have been possible. On the
other hand, some FDP outputs that would have contributed to this Project were not accomplished,
as detailed in Table 1. The total amount in FDP funds that the Project leveraged are thus
estimated at USD4.28million.

Other co-financing that the Project leveraged include USD0.94 million of Government
counterpart funds and USD0.15 million in USAID funded technical assistance from the US NPS.
The value of the latter was likely much higher if in-kind support provided by US NPS staff, US
national park superintendants and the ongoing training program were to be monetized. The total
amount of co-funding realized is thus estimated at USD13.90 million.

A significant part of the GEF Alternative Scenario was accomplished. One exception includes
management plans (MPs) for biological corridors in Eastern Georgia which have not been put in
place although APA has indicated that the MP for the David Gareji area would be implemented
when the border dispute with Azerbaijan is resolved. As a result the attainment of the PDO and
the GEF Alternative Scenario is rated moderately satisfactory.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Lagodekhi, Tusheti, and Vashlovani PAs were periodically surveyed using a simple site-level
tracking tool developed for the World Bank and WWF and intended for reporting progress at
protected area sites. The first time this tool was used in 2004 to document the baseline in terms
of legal and institutional status of the project-supported PAs as well as their functionality and
effectiveness of management. Based on the scores, Lagodekhi PAs were found 42.39%
successful in 2004, Tusheti ­ 38.04% successful, and Vashlovani ­ 43.48% successful. In 2005
the evaluation outcomes were: Lagodekhi ­ 46.74%, Tusheti ­ 40.22%, and Vashlovani ­ 51.09%.
The last evaluation was carried out in 2005, which found Lagodekhi 69.57% successful, Tusheti -
65.22 %, and Vashlovani ­ 63.04%.

The summary evaluation sheet below demonstrates a positive trend in the assessment results from
all project-supported PAs. According to the instruction on the use of this tracking tool, the
evaluation was done by the PA administrators under the professional guidance provided by the
Bank consultant.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A Small Grants Program (SGP) beneficiary workshop was held at the Ministry of Environment
Protection and Natural Resources (MEPNR) on July 10, 2008 to summarize outcomes of two
grant schemes aimed at diversifying sources of income and improving livelihood of gateway
communities residing in proximity to the PAs of Kolkheti, Tusheti, Dedoplistskaro, and
Lagodekhi. Kolkheti was covered by a grant scheme operated in parallel with the World Bank
and GEF financed Integrated Coastal Management Project, while the SGP under PADP covered
other protected areas. The workshop was attended by the representatives of gateway
communities, grant recipients, NGOs, and academia ­ all involved in SGP implementation as
either direct beneficiaries, technical supporters and administrators of grant-funded activities, or
members of the SGP Board. The management of the MEPNR and the Agency of Protected Areas
were also present and took part in discussions. The workshop helped to analyze outcomes of the
grant schemes, compare different modalities of running these schemes, issues associated with
community mobilization and benefit-sharing.

Following are the key findings and conclusions of the workshop:
 Establishment of new PAs or significant expansion of existing PAs should be accompanied
    by outreach to communities in buffer zones, aimed at adapting local communities to new
    natural resource management regimes;
 Community participation in the development and operation of PA financing schemes is
    critical to ensure that beneficiary interests are duly incorporated and the schemes are operated
    with transparency and accountability;
 Maintaining tight links between PA administrations and community support financing
    schemes is important to enhance collaboration between communities in the buffer zone and
    neighboring PAs.
 While beneficiary communities should have an important role in shaping the support schemes
    and defining priorities, in most cases they will need significant technical assistance to
    organize themselves, formulate viable proposals, and manage their activities.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Sustainable Development Projects Implementation Agency, acting as a PIU for the Georgia
Protected Areas Development Project, submitted Recipient's ICR on behalf of the MEPNR to the
Bank. Below is the summary of this document:

Introduction

GEF Grant Agreement for the financing of Georgia Protected Areas Development Project
(GPADP) was signed by the Government of Georgia and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development on October 4, 2001. In April 2002 the Project became effective.
The total amount of the grant financing made 8.700.000 USD. Implementing agency for this
Project was the Agency of Protected Areas of Georgia (APA) under the Ministry of Environment
Protection and Natural Resources (MEPNR), along with administrations of Lagodekhi,
Vashlovani, Tusheti, and Batsara-Babaneuri and Ilto protected areas, which are the branch offices
of the APA.

Project Goal and Objectives

The goal of the GPADP was to conserve Georgian biodiversity through the creation of three
ecologically and socially sustainable protected areas in forest ecosystems, and to build capacity
for mainstreaming biodiversity conservation into the production landscapes which connect them.
The Project would (i) support protected areas planning in the Central and Eastern Caucasus; (ii)
establish protected areas management and build awareness of biodiversity conservation at three
sites in the Eastern Caucasus; and (iii) reorganize and strengthen the Department of Protected
Areas to conserve and manage biodiversity. The Project was consistent with the GEF
Operational Program for biodiversity conservation.

Project Components

Component 1. Support Protected Areas )Planning.
Support to the development of the detailed plans of biodiversity and ecosystem conservation in
the Central Caucasus region and management plans for ecological corridors in the East Caucasus.

Component 2. Establish Protected Aras management and Build Awareness of Biodiversity
Conservation.
Development of four protected areas in East Georgia (Vashlovani, Lagodekhi, Tusheti, and
Batsara-Babaneuri and Ilto) with the purpose of conserving rich regional biodiversity, which
would also support income generation by protected areas administrations and the gateway
communities and stimulate sustainable development in the surroundings of protected areas.

Component 3. Reorganize and Strengthen the Department of Protected Areas
Restructuring and institutional strengthening of the Department of Protected Areas to enable this
institution protection and management of Georgia's landscapes and biodiversity.

Expected Result of the Project

    1. Improved planning of natural resource conservation and management in the Central
         Caucasus;

    2. Approval of the biodiversity corridor management plans;Improved protection of
        biodiversity in East Georgia following recommendations of IUCN and requirements of
        Georgian legislation through establishment of two national parks and expansion of one
        nature reserve;
    4. Protected areas contribute to the local economic growth and poverty
        alleviation;Sustainable use of natural resources is introduced in the support zones of
        protected areas;Revenues generated by protected area administrations cover considerable
        part of their operating costs;Restructuring of the protected areas authority is completed
        and it functions with a new, expanded mandate.

Activities Implemented Under the Project
                                              Component 1
1.1 Preparation of the Central Caucasus Protected Areas Management Plans
         In 2004 GPADP, in cooperation with Georgia Forests Development Project, carried
            out studies on biodiversity conservation in Ambrolauri, Lentekhi, and Tsageri
            administrative rayons, based on which a group of biodiversity and forestry experts
            developed recommendations on target areas for the establishment of protected areas.
            Biodiversity specialists carried out training for forestry specialists on the
            methodology of identifying biodiversity hotspots and areas of high conservation
            value;
         Outputs of Central Caucasus studies used to develop plans of new protected areas in
            this region, which propose multiple categories defined by IUCN, which are also
            recognized by Georgian legislation;
         For the purposes of developing detailed management plans for the proposed protected
            areas, a consortium of NGOs comprising Georgia Protected Areas Programme,
            Dzelkva, Georgia ICOMOS, and Geophysical Society of Georgia commissioned;
         Report on the desk review of literature, report on the outcomes of field studies, report
            on the synthesis of baseline information, guidelines for management planning, draft
            management plans and draft laws on the establishment of Central Caucasus protected
            areas were produced.

1.2 Development and implementation of biodiversity corridors in the East Caucasus
         NGO Georgia Protected Areas Programme was commissioned for management
            planning in biodiversity corridors;
         Following documents were produced: (i) Management planning guidelines for David
            Gareji landscape conservation, and (ii) Management plan for Alazani river flood

            premises along with office furniture and IT equipment.

2.2 Upgrading and adoption of management plans
         Management plans were drafted at the early stage of the Project preparation.
            Upgrading of these plans continued during project implementation, through a
            participatory process. In 2004 and 2005 stakeholder workshops were held to upgrade
            draft management plans;
         Revised management plans for the beneficiary protected areas formally approved and
            entered into operation;

2.3 Professional development for protected areas management

            gaps in the existing information on species and populations of flora and fauna in
            protected areas and to improve management of wildlife in these protected areas;
         A stakeholder meeting on pasture management held in September 2004 in
            Dedoplistskaro region, with the purpose of drafting work plan for conservation and
            sustainable use of meadows and pastures in East Georgia. The meeting was attended
            by the representatives of academia, local government, MEPNR, Ministry of
            Agriculture, and NGOs. A work plan with some 40 proposed actions was drafted, and
            methodology for assessing carrying capacity of pastures and for monitoring pastures

Evaluation of the Project Outcome

The main goal of the Project is achieved. Recipient appreciates high professionalism and
constructive cooperation on behalf of the Porject Task Team, the World Bank consultants
engaged with project implementation (Mr. Christian Gonner, Ms. Emanuela Montanari Stephens,
and others), and the Environmental Specialist of the World Bank Office Tbilisi (Darejan
Kapanadze). Project supervision by the World Bank had always been constructive and highly
sensitive to the needs, priorities, and preferences of the Recipient. Discussions held and the
decision made through meaningful exchange between the World Bank's Task Team and the
Recipient were instrumental in achieving final results of the Project.

A summary of feedback received on the ICR Report from Ms. Mariam Shotadze, Environment and
Energy Team Leader, UNDP Georgia

Overall opinion on the Implementation, Completion and Results (ICR) Report for Georgia
Protected Areas Development Project (GPADP) is positive.

In general, evaluation of the project design and the achievement of DOs and as well as of the
specific outcomes is made objectively in a consistent way, and the ratings are fair. Indeed, the
GPADP objectives were relevant to the country's context at the stage of the project design and
continue to be such to present. Development of protected areas (PAs) and their expansion is one
of the major environment priorities of the country and the Project may be considered as a catalyst
for creating an enabling environment for PA development, introducing international standards to
PA management in Georgia, and raising the profile of biodiversity conservation within PA
boundaries and beyond. Moreover, almost all later projects targeting PAs are built upon the
experience and knowledge gained by through the GPADP. However, the ICR Report could have
elaborated more on its contribution to the institutional strengthening of the Department of
Protected Areas, flashing out the exact role of the Project in turning this Department into the
Agency of Protected Areas and further developing capacities of this institution. The ICR Report
is explicit in describing its contribution to the institutional strengthening of the administrations of
individual PAs.

A few shortcomings of the GPADP design and implementation are well articulated in ICR Report.
For instance, it is correctly mentioned that the Project could have aimed at having not too
ambitious objective for mainstreaming the biodiversity into production landscapes country-wide
and could have chosen a piloting this initiative at a more modest scale. It is also correctly noted,
that any project associated with introduction of the new patterns of regulation within PAs and
delivering infrastructure to PAs needs to scrutinize the established patterns of natural resource use
in the project sites and analyze a potential of involuntary resettlement. ICR Report could have
provided a better coverage of the reasons for less than expected success of the beneficiary PAs in
marketing their services and business planning. It would have been interesting to lean more about
lessons learned from this experience. In UNDP's opinion, the GPADP should have invested
more in the achievement of financial sustainability of PAs. Seeing this as a persisting weakness
of PAs, UNDP, with GEF funding, has recently launched a project aimed at addressing financial
sustainability of Georgia's PAs. A couple of other areas, of which ICR Report could have
provided a deeper analysis, include: (i) project risks - for instance, possibility of changes in the
political context and government's vision should have been mentioned as one of the major
risks/challenges for the Project; and (ii) risk management in the course of the project
implementation. Also, the ICR Report would have benefited from the description and discussion
of any innovations introduced through the GPADP, e.g., new approaches, tools, and technologies.
