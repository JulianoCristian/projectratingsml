Some lessons learned included: in a country\n            with no precedent for incorporating biodiversity\n            conservation in spatial planning, it is unrealistic to\n            expect that it can be achieved within the relatively short\n            lifetime of a project. It is advisable to limit such\n            activities to a pilot level to demonstrate their benefits.\n            Establishing consultative bodies for protected area (PA) is\n            not a guarantee that they will operate in a meaningful way.\n            It takes substantial work and effort to develop adequate and\n            country-specific tools for successful stakeholder\n            representation in PA management. Top quality technical\n            assistance from peer organizations coupled with adequate\n            resources can significantly improve national standards and\n            practice of PA interpretation and visitor management, by\n            raising awareness about expectations of foreign visitors and\n            modern international good practice. Competitive Grant\n            Schemes (CGS) inevitably produces winners and losers. Full\n            transparency of the decision-making process, a good public\n            information system and appropriate community participation\n            in the CGS cycle can help avoid the risk of turning losers\n            into enemies of PAs and their administrations."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
