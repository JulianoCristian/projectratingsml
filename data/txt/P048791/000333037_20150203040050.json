Established in the 20th century as a nature reserve,\n            Lagodekhi became a sanctuary which only researchers and\n            educators armed with permits could visit. Today, Georgians\n            are working on the forest's third incarnation. Since\n            2003, the park has been divided into a 2,000-hectare managed\n            area, open to the general public; and a 22,000-hectare\n            pristine nature reserve, off-limits to all but fauna.\n            Lagodekhi is one of five protected areas in Georgia that\n            have received funding from the Global Environment Facility,\n            a pool of money managed by the World Bank and other\n            international agencies that helps poorer countries reach\n            higher environmental standards. The Protected Areas\n            Development Project was designed to preserve Georgia's\n            biodiversity by spreading environmental awareness,\n            strengthening Georgia\u0092s Department of Protected Areas and\n            developing ecologically-friendly tourism. Georgia, a\n            crossroad of European, Central Asian and Middle Eastern\n            climates and terrains, is an important migration path for\n            birds and mammals."}, "docdt": "2006-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
