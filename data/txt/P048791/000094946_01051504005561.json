The main components will: 1) support the\n            development of a detailed plan for biodiversity, and forest\n            conservation in the Central Caucasus region, and, support\n            corridor conservation planning in Eastern Georgia.\n            Biodiversity studies will be financed, and, a policy/legal\n            framework will rationalize the mandates of the Framework Law\n            on Protected Areas, and the Forest Code for the Central\n            Caucasus; communal vegetation types, and rapid biological\n            assessments will be mapped to implement corridor plans in\n            the Eastern Caucasus Mountains; 2) establish protected areas\n            management, and, build awareness of biodiversity\n            conservation. Monitoring, and applied research will guide\n            park management, and evaluate results of management actions,\n            through the development of an information base, livestock\n            assessments, and through special studies focused on species,\n            plants, and animals to improve management decision-making.\n            Training on protected areas management planning will be\n            provided, to enforce ranger practices, and, enhance business\n            planning; 3) reorganize, and strengthen the Department of\n            Protected Areas, through: training in park administration;\n            revenue account management; technical training in protected\n            areas, and resource management; and, monitoring biodiversity\n            programs; and, 4) finance project management, and operating\n            costs within the Department of Protected Areas."}, "docdt": "2001-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
