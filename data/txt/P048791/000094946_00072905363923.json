Negative environmental impacts include the\n            following: The small-scale construction of infrastructure\n            will have minor, short-term direct impacts on vegetation and\n            local species-mainly due to soil excavation, dust, and\n            noise. Increased recreational use of project sites may\n            produce a direct impact because of under-management of\n            tourist sites and facilities, possible overuse of campsites\n            or trails, increased waste, harvesting of live wood for\n            campfires, purposeful disturbance of wildlife, accidental\n            fires, disturbance of flora and fauna, trespassing into\n            fragile areas, and non-maintenance of trails lading to slope\n            erosion. Mitigation measures include: incorporating\n            environmental considerations into engineering design to\n            ensure that waste is managed: waste bins, and technology for\n            toilet facilities like leaching fields, organic composting,\n            and septic tanks. To reduce pressure on overgrazed\n            pasturelands, park administration will provide shepherds\n            with basic extension services and provide basic veterinary\n            assistance. Reducing the level of grazing through land\n            zoning will reduce disturbances to wildlife, in particular\n            the mountain goat. Shepherds will be allocated new grazing\n            leases to replace existing leases within park boundaries."}, "docdt": "2000-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
