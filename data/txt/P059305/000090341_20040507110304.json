modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that the project\n            confirmed that conservation is linked intimately with the\n            welfare of the communities and that interventions must\n            address both. Addressing welfare and livelihood issues\n            comprehensively is important for achieving conservation. The\n            linkage between food security and availability of paddy\n            rice. The project found that: (i) a household that does not\n            have sufficient rice for year-round consumption is not\n            automatically food insecure, and (ii) not every poor family\n            is best helped by providing it with wet rice or the means to\n            produce it. The project also found that an in-depth analysis\n            of public policies and institutions is required for project\n            success, and that analysis of the problem of the\n            beneficiaries alone will not suffice. The project developed\n            a low-cost mechanism of effective local organization to\n            strengthen delivery of poverty alleviation programs linked\n            to conservation. This mechanism is able to address welfare\n            and conservation issues in remote places where public\n            services are limited and/or where public servants are\n            reluctant to serve. The Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL)\n            instrument itself proved to be valuable because of the\n            ability to make key changes during implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
