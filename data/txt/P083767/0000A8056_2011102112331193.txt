                         The Tertiary Education Project (TEP) was supported with funding from International Development Association (IDA) and the European Community (EC). IDA provided US$5 million
                         in support to the Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) under the original project and US$5.0 million through the additional financing approved in 2009 and the EC provided US$5.5 million

                         This is a best practice project. QIF has a five year track record of being an instrument that provides funds for Tertiary Education Institutions (TEIs) for innovative projects. Forty five
                         projects have been completed to date. The QIF has supported 45 projects wherein 24 partnerships were developed among TEIs and the public and private sector. The QIF has also

                         been characterized by wide participation of TEIs with 100% of universities and 50% of colleges in WBG implementing QIF grants. A external evaluation of QIF conducted by AGEG,
                         an international Consulting Firm based in Germany, confirmed the uniqueness of this experience and the effectiveness of most projects supported by QIF.

                         The second phase of the project geared towards supporting TEIs to put in place programs to promote innovations of teacher education is currently underway. Using the same
                         competitive scheme put in place during the first phase of the project, QIF recently awarded US$4.2 million to eight universities/tertiary education institutes to support the
                         implementation of innovative proposals geared to improve teacher education programs in these institutions.
