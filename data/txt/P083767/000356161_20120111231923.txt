                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY and PROPOSED CHANGES:
1.      The closing date for West Bank and Gaza Tertiary Education Project,
International Development Association Trust Fund Grant Agreement [TF055089,
P083767] is December 31, 2010. The project will be extended from December 31, 2010
until December 31, 2011.

2.     This will be the second extension of the project which would bring the cumulative
closing date extension up to two years.

3.     In addition, this will be accompanied by a reallocation of grant proceeds.

PROJECT STATUS:

4.      Implementation of the Tertiary Education Project is satisfactory and project
development objectives have been largely met. All project activities under Component 1:
Strengthening the Policy-Making Role of the Ministry of Education and Higher
Education (MOEHE), Council of Higher Education (HEC) and the Accreditation and
Quality Assurance Commission (AQAC) and Component 2: Capacity Building Program
to Increase Internal and External Efficiency of Tertiary Education Institutions have been
completed. Activities under Component 3: Support to Quality Improvement of the
Tertiary Education Institutions (Quality Improvement Fund (QIF)) are nearing
completion. To date, with the support of TEP, the QIF has completed 42 out of 45 sub-
projects with the remaining sub-projects scheduled to be completed by December 31,
2010. These diverse and innovative projects have increased the relevance of TEI
programs and training to labor market realities, supported TEIs in remaining competitive
and have strengthened their capacity to develop income-generating activities. The
success of the QIF provided justification for an additional financing (AF) in the amount
of US$5 million (TF094590) which was approved on May 28, 2009 to provide continued
support to the QIF and institutional strengthening.

5.      A one-year extension of the closing date and a reallocation of funding is
necessary to further support the PA in their continued efforts to improve the tertiary
education system. As a result of currency fluctuations, there is an additional US$700,000
of grant proceeds which have not been committed. An extension and reallocation will be
essential to finance a first and thorough evaluation of ongoing academic programs in
Science and Humanities in TEIs. This evaluation and analysis would be useful for TEIs
in the development and modification of programs; MOEHE in providing strategic
direction for their support or TEI; and AQAC in informing their review and accreditation
process. This proposed evaluation is similar to one that was undertaken for Engineering
and IT Education Programs supported under the TEP which proved extremely useful and

                                            6
informative to all stakeholders. This activity is fully consistent with the objectives of the
TEP and this would further strengthen and concretize achievements made to date. In
order to implement this activity effectively, a reallocation of grant proceeds to increase
funds under Category 2: Consultant Services is necessary.
