performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: well-structured and designed quality\n            improvement funds for tertiary education can be a powerful\n            instrument and force to promote quality improvement and\n            stimulate innovation. The Bank, borrower, and implementing\n            teams' continuity and skills mix are crucial to\n            effective implementation. The project's overall\n            implementation success was positively affected by the\n            quality and consistency of the Bank technical and\n            supervision staff and the Project Coordination Unit's\n            (PCU's) personnel and leadership. It was negatively\n            affected by some staffing and institutional decisions for\n            other project-related government entities-such as the\n            Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) support team. If designed and\n            implemented properly, well-planned study visits and ongoing\n            collaboration with external technical experts and\n            institutions are an important part of an overall strategy to\n            build capacity of actors in the tertiary education system.\n            Numerous program participants indicated that the close and\n            ongoing interactions with external professional colleagues\n            provided them with critical knowledge and experience they\n            will almost certainly not have received any other way than\n            through the project."}, "docdt": "2013-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
