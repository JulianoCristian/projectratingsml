                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The first phase of the Tertiary Education Project (TEP) was supported with funding from the World Bank (WB) and the European Community (EC). IDA provided a total of US$10.0
                         million in support to the Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) under the project and the EC provided US$5.5 million to the QIF (component 3) in the context of the original TEP.

                         All activities under the EC agreement were completed by December 31, 2010, while activities under the WB were completed by October 31, 2011. By February 29, 2012, total
                         disbursements were US$16.2 under the TEP. The difference between the original allocation and the total amount disbursed is due to currency exchange gains.

                         The second phase of the project was approved in 2009 through a WB additional financing (AF) of US$5.0 million geared towards supporting Tertiary Education Institutions (TEIs) to

                         project, QIF has already awarded US$4.2 million to eight universities/tertiary education institutes to support the implementation of innovative proposals aimed at improving teacher
                         education programs in these institutions. The closing date of the AF is December 31, 2012.
