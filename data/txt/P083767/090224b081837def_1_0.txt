                         The project development objectives are: 1) to improve the regulatory environment for tertiary education management, governance and quality assurance; 2) increase
                         internal and external efficiency of the tertiary education system, as a first step towards achieving sustainability; and 3) to create incentives and provide the basis for

                         Additional Financing (AF) for the Tertiary Education Project became available in 2009. The objective of the AF was to support the implementation of the Palestinian Authority Teacher
                         Education Strategy through the Quality Improvement Fund (QIF). Eight teacher education projects were selected for funding from several that submitted proposal for consideration to
                         the nationwide competitive process organized under QIF. A condition of funding was that each leader organization selected through QIF would link with two or three partner

                         The selected projects addressed pedagogical issues and core curricular areas that are critical to the reform of teaching/learning and teacher education in Palestine. Project
                         preparation was almost invariably thorough and was done in close and constant cooperation between the international consultants, local consultants, and faculty in the participating
                         institutions.

                         Indications are that, of all the factors involved in the Quality Improvement Fund Additional Financing (QIF-AF) projects, the study visits made the greatest impact and, more than any
                         other input, inspired the visiting Palestinian faculty members to revisit and rethink their own approaches to teaching/learning, teacher education, and to the content areas targeted in
                         the projects. Faculty involved in these study visits reported back to colleagues in subsequent workshops, thus extending the reach of the projects and the benefits of what had been
                         observed and learned in the institutions and systems visited.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is scheduled to close on December 31, 2012. Significant progress has been made on the implementation of QIF funded projects by participating universities. However, in
                         order to ensure that short and long-term impact remains, the PA education authorities should begin addressing capacity challenges such as closing the gaps between the ability of
                         most tertiary education institution program participants to articulate the reasoning and value of proposed innovation approaches, and the institutional and organizational capacity of
                         their respective tertiary education institutions to translate these approaches into practice.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
