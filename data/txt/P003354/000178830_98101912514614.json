the efficiency and product quality of the teak\n            processing industries in Burma through the reconstruction\n            and modernization of two teak sawmills of about 105,000\n            hoppus (H) tons capacity, rehabilitation of two plywood and\n            veneer mills and the existing furniture factory, expansion\n            of flooring production, construction of a central workshop,\n            strengthening of log storage and handling, and provision of\n            training and technical assistance. The project's\n            incremental output would generate annual revenues of about\n            US$17 million of which about 72% would be in foreign\n            exchange. Additional direct employment of about 600 would be\n            generated after mill construction. Environmental conditions\n            and worker safety would be enhanced by the provision of\n            better dust and waste material collection facilities in the\n            reconstructed and rehabilitated mills and factories. The\n            main project risk would be possible delays in civil works\n            construction. However, appropriate arrangements have been\n            made to ensure that the project would be within the\n            implementation capacity of the agencies concerned."}, "docdt": "1981-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
