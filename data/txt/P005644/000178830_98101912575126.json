irrigation perimeters.\n            It consists of investments in irrigation infrastructure;\n            farm access roads and related structures; fruit and\n            vegetable processing centers; cold stores, and milk\n            collection centers; buildings, vehicles, and equipment for\n            Medjerda Valley Development Agency (OMVVM) and Nebhana\n            Irrigation Development Agency (OMIVAN); credit for farmers\n            and cooperatives; extension services; training; fellowships;\n            and technical assistance. About 7,800 farmers will directly\n            benefit, and about 5,200 man-years of additional employment\n            will be created; this labor will be supplied mainly from\n            depressed areas of the country."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
