It consists of investments in irrigation infrastructure;\n            farm access roads and related structures; fruit and\n            vegetable processing centers; cold stores, and milk\n            collection centers; buildings, vehicles, and equipment for\n            OMVVM and OMIVAN; credit for farmers and cooperatives;\n            extension services; training; fellowships; and technical\n            assistance. About 7,800 farmers would directly benefit, and\n            about 5,200 man-years of additional employment would be\n            created; this labor would be supplied mainly from depressed\n            areas of the country."}, "docdt": "1982-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
