MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TILE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
FOR A HEALTH PROJECT
I.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Croatia for the equivalent of US$40.0 million to help finance a
Health Project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
17 years, including a grace period of five years.
Part I - Recent Country Developments
2.          Introduction. Over the last three years, Croatia has successfully adjusted to its newly
independent status, tackled many problems associated with the heavy toll of the recent war and the
loss of traditional markets, and embarked upon an ambitious economic reform program. The
Republic of Croatia became a member of the International Monetary Fund as of December 1992, and
The World Bank as of February 25. 1993. The difficult situation in the region has meant that the
Bank's approach in assisting Croatia has necessarily been cautious. Although a macroeconomic
dialogue was established and a project to assist in reconstruction of war-related damage was defined
with the Government soon after independence, our dialogue was interrupted for about one year due to
security concerns. Following normalization of relations, primarily due to the Washington Agreements
of March 1994, signed between the Bosnian and Croatian authorities, the Emergency Reconstruction
Project (Ln. 3670-HR) was approved in June 1994. The Bank plans to assist Croatia in meeting its
economic challenges with a broad-based strategy, building on the excellent dialogue that has already
been established on the economic front and in several major sectors. A Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) is currently being discussed with the Government, and is designed to assist Croatia in bringing
the economic reform program to fruition, and establishing itself as a small, but relatively prosperous
part of the European economy, and a contributor to stability in the region. The CAS is currently
scheduled to be presented to the Board in April 1995, together with the recently negotiated Highways
Sector Project. The project proposed today addresses urgent needs in the health sector and supports
Croatia in the implementation of a far reaching sector reform program. which is already well-
advanced.
3.          Political Developments. Croatia declared its independence from the former Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in June 1991. Hostilities erupted over the control of portions
of Croatia which had large Serb populations, and lasted until the end of the year.  Although they
were designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) in January 1992. limited hostilities
nonetheless took place around these occupied territories within Croatia for some time thereafter. In
March 1994, a cease-fire was agreed with the Croatian Serb leaders in these areas, ending hostilities
within Croatia itself. The areas are still in contention and include nearly one-fourth of the two
million hectares normally under cultivation, some major gas and oil fields, and large sections of
major highways and railways. Also in March. the "Washington Agreement" effectively ended
hostilities between Croatian and Bosnian forces, and provided for a federation of Croatian and
Muslim Bosnians within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
4.          Despite these improvements, serious tensions persist within Croatia and within the
region. A permanent solution to Croatia's territorial problems has yet to be reached, and there is
continuing political pressure to regain control and resettle residents displaced from the occupied areas
during the war. An agreement signed in December 1994 allowed for the re-commissioning of some



infrastructure in the UNPAs, and the continuation of negotiations on several issues, including the
return of refugees and displaced persons. While Croatia has shown considerable restraint and
prudence over the UNPAs issue, trying to reach a negotiated solution with the Croatian Serbs, the
Croatian Government. supported by all other political forces in the country on this issue, has made it
clear that full control over the territories within Croatia's internationally recognized borders remains
the country's first priority. The political environment inside Croatia is evolving. The development of
a fully stable and democratic society is made more difficult by the regional environment and the
unsettled issue of Croatia's territorial integrity.
5.          Economic Developments. Croatia is the second richest of the former Yugoslav
republics, with a 1994 per capita income of US$2,500, down from US$3,350 before independence.
Notwithstanding its good geographical location, rich endowment and well-developed manufacturing
and tourism industry, its economic performance mirrored that of Yugoslavia as a whole in the 1980s.
The decade saw economic stagnation and inflation, with a dramatic deterioration towards the end of
the decade, when monthly inflation accelerated to two-digit levels. At independence. Croatia faced
significant inherited inflation, a sharp recession, an increasing current account deficit and a mounting
public expenditure burden, and no access to foreign exchange. In addition, Croatia inherited its share
of the former SFRY's foreign debt (US$4 hillion equivalent). Crisis management after independence
focussed on rebuilding foreign exchange reserves and combatting hyperinflation. The Government
suspended servicing its debt (except with the Bank). thereby freeing foreign exchange for essential
imports and building up of reserves, and was remarkably successful in containing the fiscal accounts
through tight cash management.  However, the successful balancing of fiscal accounts has meant
that important expenditure items, such as health, education, infrastructure investments, and bank and
enterprise rehabilitation were reduced or deferred, and these underlying needs will need to be
provided for over the coming years.
6.          All this occurred against a backdrop of major sector difficulties. The war severely
affected the economy, imposing additional costs related to defence and refugees, and causing the
volume of trade among the former republics to fall abruptly. Considerable damage was also inflicted
on the country's infrastructure. As a result, Croatia experienced a decline of about 31 % in GDP
between 1991 and 1993. The authorities embarked on a comprehensive stabilization program in early
October 1993. To eradicate inflationary expectations, the program introduced a foreign exchange
nominal anchor, and was supported by tight incomes, fiscal and monetary policies. The stabilization
strategy proved very effective. Intlation was curbed over a one-month period and the price level
actually declined between November 1993 and September 1994 (minus 1.9% cumulative).  Following
the successful stabilization program, Croatia introduced a new currency, the kuna, on May 30. 1994.
Croatia was also able to agree with the IMF on a Stand-by Agreemelit and a purchase under the
Structural Transformation Facility covering a period ot eighteen months, which was approved on
October 14, 1994.
7.          Although the stabilization program has been successful in the short-term, the main
potential source of inflation -- the problem of the banking and enterprise sectors -- has not yet been
dealt with. Indeed, the stabilization-induced recovery in money demand and the remonetization that
ensued allowed the banking system to continue financing enterprise losses in a way that will not be
sustainable in the future. Enterprise and banking system reform is therefore a central element of the
Government's agenda. The Bank is working closely with the Governrnent and plans to provide
assistance through an Enterprise andl Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FFSAL).
8.          The Government strategy also calls for public expenditure reduction, where feasible, in
order to make room for the outlays needed for restructuring and investment. Progress has already



- 3 -
been made, particularly in reducing subsidies and transfers, and initiating reforms in public sector
enterprises. Overall transfer expenditures have been reduced by about 40% in real terms in 1991-93,
while a well-targeted 'social safety net' system, in the form of cash and in-kind support to those
below the poverty line, has been established. A main contributor to the decrease was health
expenditure, as a result of a stringent and very successful reform program launched in 1993. The
proposed project would support the continuation of the Government's program in the health sector.
Part 11 - The Project
9.          Sector Background. Croatia has a population of 4.8 million and its overall
epidemiological conditions are characteristic of an aging population, with high adult mortality,
especially among males, dominated by lifestyle-related non-communicable disease. In 1991, life
expectancies were 67 for men and 75.5 years for women. The main causes of death are circulatory
diseases (55%), neoplasms (22%) and injury and poisoning (15%). The infant mortality rate is 12.8
per 1,000 live hirths. While there is good access to primary care and preventive programs,
interventions are limited mainly to referral services and elementary prescription and public health
services focus mainly on "traditional" approaches such as hygiene and sanitation rather than to the
prevention of non-communicable disease. The system has heen inefficient and overly-reliant on
hospital services, with no built-in incentives for cost control. The stock of equipment and
infrastructure has deteriorated to a point where some radiological equipment is reported to present
risks for staff and patients (over 80%  is more than 20 years old).
10.         In the early 1990s, the health sector was in a state of crisis. Government revenues were
lagging far behind expenditures, c-osts were rapidly escalating, and there were no systems in place for
effective management.  The revenues of the Health Insurance Fund (HIF), the extra budgetary fund
through which most health expenditures are financed, dropped from 7.7%  to 5.5%  of GDP between
1991 and 1992, while expenditure increased from 7.9% to 8.1 % of GDP. a high level by
international standards. Recognizing that the existing system was no longer sustainable. the Ministry
of Health initiated reforms in the health sector. The reform strategy had two immediate objectives:
(a) to end the state of chronic financial deficit; and (b) to increase the efficiency of health services by
moving from an over-reliance on curative and secondary clinical care to primary and preventive care.
The reform called for: (a) a reduction in the role of the state; (b) a difterent allocation of
responsihility between central and local governments, (c) a re-definition of basic health services and
improvement in qualitv of these services; and (d) a revamping of health financing.
I1.         To meet these objectives, the Government took tough decisions and tollowed up with
actions that few countries have been willing to undertake. In August 1993. the Government passed
two important laws. The Health Care Act established primary care as the toundation ot the health
care system, transferred ownership of most health facilities from the central Government to the
districts, defined a new management structure for all health institutions (including a Management
Board with representation from the local government, the Health Insurance Institute (HIl), health
practitioners, and a Chief Executive Officer who reports to a Management Board), authorized private
practice, and mandated the MOH to define a national network of health institutions that would be
eligible for financing under the health insurance system. The Health Insurance Act estahlished the
HiI with considerahle authority to enforce collection of contributions, negotiate and sign contracts
with health providers, and supervise and control business transactions of health facilities and private
practitioners. Together, these two acts have instilled the discipline essential to the success of the
Government's reform strategy in the health sector and to control costs in the fiture.



- 4 -
12.          Following passage of the Health Care Act and the Health Insurance Act, the MOH
defined standards for coverage for primary care services as well as aCLite, highly specialized and
chronic care heds, taking into consideration the current financial capability within the system.
Regional maps ot' epidemiological status have been prepared on the basis of which health insurance
contracts have been drawn up.  The HIl has imnplemented a point system with "caps" on overall
expenditures for reimbursing hospital costs and a capitation system for primary care physicians.
Other measures to control costs, including limits on the number of prescriptions and referrals, have
also been introduced and are closely monitored. These measures resulted in a decline in expenditure
to abouLt 6%  ot' GDP in 1994 and, combined with strenuous efforts to collect unpaid contributions.
nearly eliminated deficits. A program of debt negotiations, incltu(ling lpartial write-offs, debt-equity
swaps and subsidized payments t'rom the national hudget, have resulted in a reduction in health sector
debts trom  US$210 million in 1990 to US$8.9 million in mid-1994. It is noteworthy that this
restructuring of health sector t'inances has occurred in the midst ot' the stresses of wartime and refugee
hurdens on the health system.  Through the efforts of the Ministry of Health and the strong
commitment of the Government, the implementation of retform  is off to a successful start and could
provide a useftul mo(ldel tfor other Pastern European c(untries.
13.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The policy chaniges introlduced in the health sector
have been effective in reducing the financial deticit and in shifting resoiurces froim curative to primary
and preventive care. 'I'he retform, therefore, plrovides a SoLund hasis t'(fr new investments and should
he supported hy the international colmmuinity. To sustlin the reforim, investment resources are badly
needed. A Bank operation woul(d provide the needed suipport and woLuld he consistent with our overall
social sector ohiectives and with the reco(lnmendationis ot' the draft "Croatia Social Sectors and Social
Expenditures Review".  The C'ountrN Assistance Strategy identifies the health sector as a priority for
public investment.
14.          Project Ohiectives. The primary goal of the Heailth Project is to support and sustain the
Government's health care reform  program. To achieve this goal, the specific ob jectives of the Project
are to: (a) implrove the operational and financial management systems ot the Health Insurance system:
(h) improve the utialitv otf the health care delivery system; an(d (C) improve the health status ot' the
population. Specitiic project outcomes to measure the sUccess of mneeting, these objectives are inClUded
in the Proiject Impilementaitioin Plan.
15.          Proiect Description. The Project would providle, over tour years, tinancing tor
compLIter hardw are an(i so(ftware, mnedical equiLpmenit tellowshilps, study tOUrS, training, technical
assistance, and p)uhlic edILuCation materials. TIhhe Project consists of the ftlIlowint' co impo mnents
(a) Health Insurance Adiministration (estimated hase cost US$13.9 million). This
comrponenit will improve health insurance adnministration hy developing the information
technologs network linikinig centratl, district and branch o iffices ot the H ll and by
intrid lu ing  credit card'' style health insuarance idlentification Cards.
b) Primary Care and Health Promotion Services (estimated hase cost US$14.9 million).
iThis co(mnponent will improve the (IUality and availahility of hasic diagnostic services for
the primary care networki through the prt visio n otf standard  liagntostic equipment
(standard and specialized  x-rays and siiimple laboratories) as well as the required
rai ing tor melical, nursing, and paramedical perstonnel. It is anticipated that roughly
ten percent ot the eqLuipinient will he allocated to health tfacilities which serve the refugee
populatti0  frtm the Republici ol Bosrnia-Herzegovina. Tfhis comrponent will also
intensif\ proigran1S to prorilote healthier lifestles arltong the p opulation through the



- 5 -
training and support of community health promotion teams, primary care providers, and
school teachers, and through mass media education programs.
(c) Essential Hospital and Emergencv Services (estimated base cost US$19.3 million).
This component will upgrade essential acute care services through the provision of basic
equipment for the emergency medical system, intensive care units, and perinatal care
units in selected hospitals, as well as related training for medical, nursing, and
paramedical personnel.
16.         Facilities receiving equipment through the Project will be required to repay the cost of
the equipment through a leasing scheme from the HIl over a period equal to the estimated economic
life of the equipment (e.g., eight years for x-ray equipment). This will introduce private sector
business practices into the public health sector without adding to the public sector debt burden.
17.         Project Implementation and Sustainability.  The Project will he implemented over a
four-year period hy the HIl. Retroactive financing of US$4.0 million (of which US$1.8 million in
contracts has already been awarde(l) has heen provided to ensure timely im-plementation of the
Project. In view of HIl's strong im)plementation capacity, which has heen demonstrated during
project preparation, a separate project impliementation unit is not envisaged. Nevertheless, a full-time
Project Implementation Officer (PIO) has been appointed within the HII to coordinate the day-to-day
project activities. The Assistant Minister for Economilics and Planning, MOH, has been designated as
Project Coordinator. In this capacity, the Assistant Minister will provide linkage hetween the MOH,
whose primary function is that of policy-maker. a,i the HII whose ftunction is tt) carry OUt MOH
policy. The HIl will recover full debt service costs through the provider reimbursement formula and
will create a reserve fund for future investments in equipiment. Project suipport for HIT information
and monitoring svstems will improve financial control sector-wide and ensure continued fiscal
sustainahil ity.
18.         Aizreed Actions.   During negotiations, assurances were provided that: (i) facilities
receiving equipment under the Pro-ject will repay the cost of equipment to the Hil; (ii) a ftull-time
Project Implementation Officer (PIO) will he maintained within Hl during the execution of the
Project; and (iii) the Project Advisory Committee (responsible tor providing policy advice and
guidance) will be maintained within MOH during the execution of the Project. As a condition of
effectiveness, a subsidiary Loan Agreement would be signed between the Government and the HiI.
19.         Environmental Aspects. This is a Category C Project: "No appreciable environmental
impact". Replacement of old equuipmilent (such as x-rays and labs) that presents a health risk will
contribute to improving environmental safety. Although waste disposal is not a significant prohlem.
utpdated protocols fotr dlealing with waste management will he introduced.
20.          Progzram Obiective Categories. The Project supports the Government's policy of
imiproving health and increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the health service delivery system.
With a tocus on upgrading primary care and essential hospital and emergency services, the Project is
expected to contribute indirectly to poverty alleviation and the role of women in development. The
Project falls into one category: Poverty Reduction and Human ResoLurce Development (100%).
21.         Participatory Approach. The Project was prepared largely by the Government agencies -
MOH, HIl and National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) - who will he involved in project
execution. During the preparation phase these agencies. represented hy six working groups.
developed the individuial components through dialogtie with project heneficiaries and stakeholders.



- 6 -
including staff of primary health care centers, hospitals, medical universities and HI! local offices.
These working groups have now evolved into the Project Advisory Committee, with responsibility for
overseeing policy guidance on implementation aspects of the project. In addition, there was close
collaboration during the preparation process with the World Health Organization (WHO) which will
also he involved in project implementation activities.
22.          Project Benefits. Health promotion activities, together with increased early screening for
chronic disease, will contribute in the long run to a reduction in premature mortality, particularly
concerning cardiovascular disease and cancer. Primary care and essential hospital and emergency
equipment to be provided under the Project will be installed selectively in areas where the
infrastructure is most outdated or insufficient and in certain areas where there is a large population of
refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. (Currently, the Republic (of Croatia pays approximately 93%  of
the total cost of US$296 million per year tor displaced persons andl refugees. Approximately 15%
[US$46 millioni of this total is spent on health care and other social sector expenditures.) This will
improve the quality and acceptability of care, as well as value tor money of services and will make a
substantial contribution to health gains through a re(luction in mortality and morbidity from accidents.
acute medical emergencies and perinatal complications. Increase(d cost- effectiveness will he achieved
by shifting part of the care from the secondary and tertiary levels to the primary levels. Imnprovements
in health insurance administration will facilitate financial control and help monitor the effects of
financial controls on health outcomes. Tangible imlprovements in care wvill strengthen the credibility
of the on-going reform efforts.
23.          Risks. The Project itselt' does not face many project-specific risks. The reform policy
for the health sector is heing imnlemented hy a team which coinmands respect on all sides of the
political spectrum. Preparation for inplementation and procurement is far adivanced, which should
lead to good dishursement pertfoimance. The main risk remains, unfortunately, a country risk
stemming from the unresolved status ot the zones currently not controlle(d hy the Cr-oatian
Government. This situation creates ongoing tension which could erupt in renewed hostilities, and
would no doubt delay the suiccessful implementation of this Project. While most observers consider
the risk of major hostilities on Croatian territory to be small, it is not insignificant. On the other
hand, the Croatian authorities have repeatedly committe(d themselves to a negotiated settlement, and
over the last two years. have shown great interest and willingness to cooperate with the international
community. They have also honore(d all their obligations to the Bretton-Woods institutions and have
embarked on an active program of cooperation with the IMF. the IBRD and the EBRD which has
already made two imrportant loans, paralleling our own efforts. 'I'he substantial econiomic gains
achieve(d through the stabilization andL reformin programn are in fdct strengthening the long-term
prospects for a lasting peace.
24.         Recoimmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comiply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
