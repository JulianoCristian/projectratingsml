The project will\n            consist of three components: 1) the health insurance\n            administration component will improve health insurance\n            administration by developing the information technology\n            network linking central, district and branch offices of the\n            Health Insurance Institute; and by introducing \"credit\n            card\" style health insurance identification; 2) the\n            primary care and health promotion services component will\n            improve the quality and availability of basic diagnostic\n            services for the primary care network through the provision\n            of standard diagnostic equipment, as well as the required\n            training for medical, nursing and paramedical personnel; and\n            3) the essential hospital and emergency services component\n            will upgrade essential acute care services through the\n            provision of basic equipment for the emergency medical\n            system, intensive care units, and perinatal care units in\n            selected hospitals, as well as related training for medical,\n            nursing, and paramedical personnel."}, "docdt": "1995-01-26T00:00:00Z"}
