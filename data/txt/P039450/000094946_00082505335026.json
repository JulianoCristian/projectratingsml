Therefore, a health insurance administration\n            component was incorporated to consolidate achievements, and\n            keep the project simple, with lesser complex components.\n            However, the initial project expectations, for preparation\n            of bidding documents, or terms of reference for technical\n            assistance, were overly ambitious, given the fact that the\n            Bank assumed a faster initiation, and the Government was\n            seemingly unaware of the extent of procedural, and\n            administrative requirements. Hence, a realistic focus on\n            both parts, could have contributed to accurate\n            implementation targets, since, additionally, the amount of\n            work the project entailed, was under-estimated, for although\n            originally, policy guidance, and management were to be\n            supported by the Government, essential activities were made\n            the responsibility of one project implementation officer,\n            whose extremely competent work, eased success, but,\n            additional staff would have been beneficial."}, "docdt": "2000-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
