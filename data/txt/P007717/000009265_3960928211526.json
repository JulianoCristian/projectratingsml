regulate telecommunication\n            services and networks; (b) to assist the SCT to modernize\n            and improve its management and monitoring of the radio\n            spectrum; and (c) to assist Telecommunications of Mexico\n            (TELECOMM) to develop its business activities.  The project\n            consists of three components: (a) regulation of services and\n            networks which will be undertaken in 3 stages; (b)\n            regulation of the radio spectrum which will be undertaken in\n            2 stages; (c) a TELECOMM business development component\n            which will plan the expansion and modernization of\n            TELECOMM's satellite system, assess the market\n            potential of new services and explore opportunities for\n            joint ventures."}, "docdt": "1990-05-03T00:00:00Z"}
