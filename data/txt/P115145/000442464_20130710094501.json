were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            stand-by arrangement was suspended in mid-2011, mainly\n            because the Dominican Republic did not bring electricity\n            prices in close alignment with cost recovery as envisaged. A\n            new government elected in 2012 has not been completely clear\n            about its intentions with respect to increasing electricity\n            tariffs, but the consensus seems to be that tariffs will not\n            be increased. The education and health ministries with Bank\n            support continue to make progress in the implementation of\n            programs for results. There is a need to decide on a\n            transition period for families that were classified poor\n            under the 2004 survey and are no longer categorized as poor\n            under the 2012 survey. The imperative to respond at a time\n            of crisis can be in conflict with starting a dialogue on\n            requirements for longer term reform. The extensive policy\n            dialogue and meaningful analytic work that go along with a\n            normal development policy operation were not part of this\n            operation's preparation. An overly complex design\n            typical of a normal development policy loan without short\n            term indicators that can be monitored (for reforms that will\n            take far longer than the duration of the operation) can\n            detract from efficacy. In light of the previous two lessons,\n            a development policy loan may be the wrong instrument to\n            support a country in a financial crisis. The lack of updated\n            political economy analysis can hamper reforms and Bank value\n            added. A critical mass of Bank interventions in a country\n            can act as a shock absorber for shortcomings in individual\n            operation and help deliver results at times of crisis."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
