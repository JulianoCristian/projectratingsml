                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This operation supported two key development objectives: 1) Improvement of the quality and efficiency of public spending, especially for poverty reduction and human development
                         and 2) Mitigation of the impact of the ongoing global economic crisis on the DR's public finances. These objectives have been largely achieved given that key reforms and
                         government interventions have been implemented. Amongst these: a) Targeting of social spending has been improving through the process of updating the SIUBEN (the targeting
                         instrument); b) financing of the Subsidized Regime (which covers the poorer population) for health insurance has been maintained in the government budget; c) Reduction of the

                         It is important to emphasize that this operation was conceived as a single tranche but that most of the reform momentum gained during the preparation, negotiation and
                         implementation of this DPL has not been lost. In fact in most of the areas indicated above - especially in terms of improving the quality of expenditure for poverty reduction and
                         strengthening the macroeconomic framework - the government has achieved further progress through the support of the PASS DPL series and of the IMF Stand By Arrangement.
