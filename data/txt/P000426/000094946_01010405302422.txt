3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
As defined in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the objective of the project was to: "(a) achieve universal
primary enrollment by the year 1999, while maintaining equity between boys and girls, by providing a
minimum of six years of basic education for all children through the introduction of an integrated basic
education cycle (EBI), (b) increase the skill levels of labor market entrants and the productivity of the
workforce by developing a more effective and coherent training system, and (c) enhance the institutional
capacity to develop and implement policies and programs in education, training and the labor market."
The project objectives were consistent and relevant with the government's aspiration to improve human
capital, and were presented at a Donor Round Table in November 1992. The objectives were also
consistent with the Bank's strategies for promoting sound economic growth and enhancing productivity, as
well as improving access and quality of social services, notably at the primary education level. Project
objectives were satisfactorily achieved, with the exception of those relating to enhancing institutional
capacity which were only partially achieved. It should be noted, however, that the project's impact on
quality of education and the relevance of training programs could not be fully appraised due to the lack of
indicators to evaluate these important dimensions.
The following three risks were identified in the SAR: (a) limited planning and management capacity of the
Ministry of Education; (b) training institutions slow to adjust their programs to changes in labor market
demands; and (c) possible inability by the Government to fully meet the recurrent cost implications. The
first risk was mitigated through strong project support during the period of deployment of teachers and the
identification of sites for the infrastructure component. However, institutional strengthening activities to
strengthen the Ministry of Education's capacity, as well as regional educational bureaus, did not take place.
In relation to the second risk, there is no clear evidence to suggest that in fact training institutions adjusted
their programs to labor market demands. With regard to the third risk, the project did not include specific
assurances that Government resources would be available to meet recurrent costs for both primary
education and vocational training. The difficulty in mitigating these risks limited the project's impact,
specifically it failed to provide the institutional capacity- a chronic weakness in the country- needed to
provide educational planning and management of education services, as well as the financial sustainability
which continues to be a major challenge for the education and training sectors in Cape Verde.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the project remained unchanged.
3.3 Original Components:
The Total Project Costs were budgeted at US$15.776 million of which US$11.45 million was financed by
IDA. Actual project costs were US$17.424 million, of which 3.4 million were government contributions to
up-grade teacher's salaries, and a Dutch Grant of US$2.4 million for school construction. The project
consisted of the following components:
Establish nationwide an Integrated Basic Education System (EBB: (US$113)
Upgrade school infrastructure
(US$6.7 million, 42.7% of Base Costs)
Upgrade and deploy primary school teachers
(US$3.8 million, 24.2% of Base Costs)

*     Establish a sustainable textbook supply and distribution system
(US$.774 million, 4.44% of Base Costs)
Improve the relevance of technical education and training: (US$2.1 million)
*     Improve quality and relevance of technical secondary education
(US$ 0.3 million, 1.9% of Base Costs)
Improve the effectiveness of training programs
(US$ 0.4 million, 2.5% of Base Costs)
*     Expand apprenticeships and professional training
(US$1.2 million, 7.6% of Base Costs)
Enhance the institutional capacity to develon and implement policies and programs: (US$2.5 million)
Reinforce MECJD planning, implementing and managerial capacity at the central and regional
levels
(US$ 0.5 million, 3.1% of Base Costs)
Strengthen the institutional capacity to monitor training and provide employment services
(US$1.2 million, 7.6% of Base Costs)
Support project management and coordination
(US$ .737 million, 4.23% of Base Costs)
Assessment of Project Design
Tlhe overall assessment of the design of the project is unsatisfactory. The project incorporated some lessons
learned from prior Bank experience in the education sector in Cape Verde (CR. 1853-CV), mainly:
Establishing an effective project unit with management abilities and coordination capacity for
project implementation; (procurement, accounting and financial management) and
Sequencing investments in light of limited financial and managerial resources.
However, the project design suffered from being too ambitious, and lack of adequate instruments to provide
monitoring and evaluation of project's impact. Implementation processes, quality targets and long-term
sustainability concerns received insufficient attention. The project components did not include measures or
indicators to assess actual impact or quality of implemented activities. The SAR presents a detailed
description of key issues and weaknesses for both the education and training sectors, and defines project
objectives accordingly. However, there is no clear indication as to how actual actions proposed in the
project could achieve them. More specifically,
(a) The SAR espoused improvements in the quality of basic education as an important goal, yet
the project design did not address it through a specific project component. Even though there were
some activities related to education quality enhancement, such as teacher training and provision of
textbooks, they were not monitored or evaluated in terms of their impact on educational practices
or outcomes. The emphasis was placed on expanding access without necessarily addressing key
issues such as improvements in teaching quality, learning achievement or relevance of textbooks.
(b) Increasing the skill levels of labor market entrants and the productivity of the workforce were
defined as program goals. These objectives, however, were not matched with sufficient resources
- 3 -



to fulfill them. Resource allocations for this component were meager in comparison to the rest of
the project. Additionally, there were no provisions to monitor the impact of capacity building
schemes on workforce performance. The project design omitted to include specific activities to
determine the improvement in quality, relevance and effectiveness of technical secondary education
and training programs.
(c) The institutional capacity of the Ministry of Employment and the Ministry of Education was
critically overestimated. The SAR's objective to enhance the institutional capacity of the ministries
was not matched with concrete steps for improving management, or education planning, at central
nor at the regional level. At the end of the project there was no clear indication of an institutional
framework capable of providing education and training policies. Likewise, despite the fact that the
SAR advocated strengthening the relationship between school and community, no specific actions
were incorporated to realize it. In addition, the project design did not identify indicators to measure
improvements in decentralization efforts or increased community participation.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components remained unchanged.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The overall quality at entry rating for the Basic Education and Training Project is partially satisfactory.
The project is clearly aligned with both the CAS and the Government of Cape Verde's strategy for
enhancing its human resources. The project design could have been strengthened with the inclusion of
quality indicators and monitoring tools to measure impact. The SAR properly identified institutional
capacity and human resources within the participating ministries as areas needing strengthening. Yet, the
project did not take adequate measures to achieve this objective effectively or address the institutional
environment and management obstacles contributing to the weakness of institutional capacity, such as the
high turnover of staff, and the fact that the PCU had become and implementation unit.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Project activities were focused in three distinct arenas:
expansion of the basic education system;
enhancing technical training; and
strengthening managerial institutional capacity
Expansion of the basic education system. The project was highly satisfactory in achieving the objective of
expanding the EBI and therefore attaining universal primary education with almost a 99% net enrollment
ratio. The SAR specified equity between boys and girls as a project objective. In this respect, there is still
a slight gap between net enrollment rates for males and females (net enrollment rate for girls and boys is
97% and 100% respectively).
In terrns of efficiency of the education sector, there is evidence of significant improvements. Repetition
rates in EBI dropped from 19.5% in 1992/93 to 9.7% in 1998/99. Also, dropout rates decreased
significantly during the course of the project, from 20% in 1992/93 to 2.4% in 1998/99. The proportion of
students promoted from EBI to secondary education increased from 52% in 1992/93 to 84% in 1998/99.
The number of students per teacher improved slightly from 29.5 in 1992/93 to 28.7 in 1998/99. See Table
1 (for statistical data and comparisons on coverage, enrollments, and efficiency of the system).

Enhancing technical training. During the project implementation period, the curriculum of the technical
secondary schools was modified with technical assistance from Belgium. Teachers at technical secondary
schools received training to upgrade their skills and increase the technical content of the courses. No
evaluation of the new cuniculum or of the teacher training programs, however, was conducted.
Under the project, the supply of technical training offerings increased considerably (see Table 2). These
training schemes were supported through the Training Support Fund (TSF) or various apprenticeship
programs. A technical audit of the TSF in 1997 showed that 90% of the trainees completed the training
program, while 60% of the trainees who began coursework unemployed found employment by the end of
the training. There are still important imbalances between labor market requirements and the supply of
training nonetheless. Enterprises continue to demand better qualified workers, but the training and
education systems, although improving, lag behind. Improvements in the quality of technical training
currently supplied are difficult to demonstrate in the absence of survey data, however, preliminary
informnation suggests that some improvements in the quality of the labor force have taken place. According
to the Ministry of Labor, the number of workers without having completed primary education has
decreased, while the percentage of the labor force that has completed secondary schooling has increased in
the period 1994-1999. Even if some challenges still lie ahead, the objectives of this component were
satisfactorily achieved.

Strengthening managerial institutional capacity. The project objective of enhancing the institutional
capacity to develop and implement policies and programs in education, training and the labor market was
not satisfactorily achieved.
This project objective sought primarily to address the adniinistrative and managerial weaknesses within the
MECJD at the central level and its 17 regional education offices (administered by delegates). At the end of
the project there is no discemible improvement in the institutional capacity of the MECJD and the
organizational structure of the system continues to be heavily centralized. With regard to the Ministry of
Labor, its ability to undertake surveys of the labor market and training issues was indeed strengthened by
the project. Nevertheless, its overall capacity still requires further reinforcement. In both instances, the
medium to long-term sustainability of capacity-building initiatives in govemment ministries is threatened by
high staff tumover.
In addition, the project aimed at bolstering school-level monitoring of student achievement. Although two
standardized evaluations in mathematics and Portuguese were conducted throughout the life of the project,
these experiences did not lay the foundations of an evaluative culture in Cape Verde. The analyses
performed focused primarily on determining the number of students that have reached a minimum academic
performance level. The study found student achievement levels to be satisfactory on the whole; however,
the scoring scheme adopted may have contributed to an overstatement of student outcomes and achievement
gains. There is little indication that assessment data served as an input for policy formulation among policy
makers or for pedagogical reflection and the enhancement of school-based practices among educators. The
student assessment unit established at the Pedagogical Institute for this activity was later disbanded.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Establish nationwide the Integrated Basic Education System (EBI):
Upgrade school infrastructure (Highly Satisfactory). During the project, 276 classrooms were built and
equipped, representing 92% of the targeted 300 classrooms. The 300 classrooms originally planned were
not built since the actual cost of construction was 7.7% higher than originally budgeted. In addition,
- 6 -



administrative space was included in the school construction plans since this was determined to be a
necessity by MECJD; thus increasing unit costs. Pedagogic kits were distributed to 186 pole-schools as
part of the upgrading of educational establishments.
Upgrade and deploy primary school teachers (Unsatisfactory). Teacher training on the EBI curriculum
and textbooks took place during calendar years 1996 - 1998. By the end of the project, 876 out of 1332
teachers trained were certified. The low number of teachers passing the certification test was due to high
performance standards as well as an emphasis on curricular content. Field interviews with stakeholders,
international donors, government representatives and teachers suggest that the training focused mainly on
the EBI curriculum subjects rather than on teaching methodologies and classroom management.
Coursework was reported to have been delivered frontally, rather than utilizing participatory or other
non-traditional adult-learning pedagogical techniques. There was no formal evaluation of the quality of the
training or of teachers' performance. At project close, the Pedagogic Institute had certified 68% of all EBI
teachers.
One hundred and forty three pedagogic advisers had been specially prepared to deliver these teacher
training courses and to provide assistance to newly trained teachers. The educational level of most of these
pedagogic advisors was below secondary education. In addition to a weak skill base, the quality of training
received was insufficient to up-grade pedagogic advisers to a "trainer-of-trainers level". Finally, pedagogic
advisors depend on scarce resources available at regional offices (such as transportation), making it
difficult for them to provide adequate and continuous support to teachers and schools.
Government funds (US$2.3 million) were used to raise teacher salaries and for new teacher recruitment.
Five hundred new teachers were hired during the project. However, due to financial constraints, this
important commitment from the government is at risk of being unsustainable at the end of the project. On
the other hand, higher salaries for teachers have become an incentive for central administration staff to
move to schools, without being trained to teach.
Establish a sustainable textbook supply and distribution system (Satisfactory). The project surpassed
the original number of teacher's guides and textbooks reprinted. Forty percent of books were sold to the
Cape Verde Institute of Social Action (ICASE), financed by subsidies from the Government, for rental to
low-income students. Textbook quality and relevance improved as a result of the project, and distribution
was quite successful. According to a UNICEF study, 90% of students have textbooks. In order to ensure a
sustainable supply of textbooks to poor children, a Textbook Revolving Fund (FEE) was established. The
proceeds from the sale of textbooks through the private market and the Government subsidies were
deposited in this Fund. To appraise the long-term sustainability of this scheme for sales and distribution, it
is crucial to conduct an analysis of the private demand for textbooks.
Improve the relevance of technical education and training:
Improve quality and relevance of technical secondary education (Satisfactory). This project made an
important contribution in changing the technical curriculum and focusing on demand-driven technical
education and training. Under the project a new technical curriculum was developed with external
assistance from Belgium. Although the new curriculum has not been evaluated, student and parent
satisfaction seems high. Yet, the supply of technical training does not appear to meet local labor demands,
and, according to field interviews, it seems to be perceived by graduates as a stepping stone towards
Tertiary Education.
Strategic choices remain to be made regarding the role of technical and vocational education within the
- 7-



Cape Verde education system and economy. A cost-effectiveness analysis of demand-driven technical and
other professional training programs is currently underway under the Consolidation and Modernization of
Education Project launched in October, 1999.
Improve the effectiveness of training programs (Satisfactory). The project was successful in supporting
on-the-job and demand-driven training through the Training Support Fund (TSF). Although initially the
TSF was slow to begin, and its Employment Centers were not fully functional until late 1996, the Fund
supported 60 projects with 1,046 trainees, surpassing the originally planned 53 projects. The training
programs covered many sectors (services management, tourism, manufacturing and industry) identified as
key sectors by the Government. A technical audit in 1997 found the program generally satisfactory, despite
the low quality of equipment in the practical portion of the program. The technical audit also found
inequality across islands, with the vast majority of projects funded in the major cities of Praia and Mindelo.
Moreover, the limited local capacity available in Cape Verde makes it difficult to identify qualified
instructors to provide the kind of quality training required in these types of programs.
Several issues remain to be addressed, such as whether these programs meet local market demands, and
who their target audience is. The demand for this type of training comes from young people who do not
have access to technical or professional education, posing additional questions in relation to course content
and scope of the curriculum offered. Although monitoring and supervision of the funded projects appear to
have been adequate, no tracer study was conducted to assess the medium-term success of the trainees or to
determine the relevance of the training.
Expand apprenticeships and professional training (Satisfactory). A total of 1,304 apprentices received
training under the program, surpassing the originally planned 900 apprentices. The apprenticeship
program also included center-based training and supervision. As a result of the project, a systemized
apprenticeship program was introduced in the country, providing apprentices with basic skills and
qualifications. Although there has been neither a formal evaluation of the program nor a tracer study of the
apprentices' post-training, there is strong support of and demand for apprenticeships from businesses and
trainees.
Field interviews suggest that the center-based training is weak in incorporating good hands-on exercises.
Furthermore, the quality of the practical experience students receive varies, depending on the
characteristics of the firm in which apprentices are placed, many of which are small and ill-equipped
informal businesses. Like the TSF, the apprenticeship program also failed to reach other islands and rural
areas outside of the two main cities.
Only one professional training program to expand local capacity in scarce professional skills was funded
by the project, rather than the five planned. This program trained 20 private sector managers in
computerization, marketing, finance and planning in eight two-week modules. Lack of interest in this kind
of professional training may be attributed to the many competing training and education programs
overseas. The poor response raises questions over the relevance of the Bank's role in funding these types
of activities in the future.
Enhance the institutional capacity to develop and implement policies and Programs:
Reinforce MECJD planning, implementing and managerial capacity at the central and regional levels
(Unsatisfactory). Some of the activities planned under this component were not carried out, and others,
although conducted as planned, did not lead to the achievement of intended objectives. More specifically, a
school map of 7 of 9 islands was completed. The mapping of the 2 remaining islands is currently being
- 8-



finalized. Although the school map was primarily intended as a policy planning instrument to assist in
determinations such as teacher deployment or school construction, there is no firm evidence that indeed this
has been the case. The development of this technical instrument has not necessarily led to better planning
or managerial capacity at the central or regional levels, nor has it signified the establishment of a statistical
and management information system for the ministry.
In addition, the comprehensive training in administration and management only took place at the central
level. Unit directors' attendance was sporadic and training was not extended to regional delegates.
Furthermore, the training provided had no effective impact on the over-centralized management style of the
Ministry of Education.
Finally, in spite of the fact that the decentralization process was formally introduced through legislation, it
did not translate into actual changes in regional autonomy. Decision-making remained highly centralized at
the end of the project. Although regional delegates exercise some responsibility over personmel issues, all
administrative and budgetary decisions are still largely made at the central level.
Strengthen the institutional capacity to monitor training and provide employment services
(Satisfactory). The labor market and employment studies financed by the project were carried out by the
Institute of Employment and Training (IET). As in the case of the Ministries of Labor and Education, IET'
s institutional capacity was greatly diminished due to the high staff turnover over the course of the project.
Those trained would subsequently leave IET, therefore weakening its human resource base and reversing
any gains in institutional capacity achieved.
The creation of Employment Centers assisted in the development of a data collection system on
employment and training needs. However, the studies produced by IET have been used sporadically in the
professional training activities of the project, with staff continuing to rely on their own informal
information rather than on IET research.
T'he creation of the National Advisory Council for Employment and Training (NACET) was to have
provided a means for the private sector to advise on the development of national policies toward
employment and training. However, NACET failed to fulfill this function. It only met three times during
the course of the project. The NACET's failure may be attributed to the large number of members, their
high profile, and weak capacity to manage the process on the part of IET.
Support project management and coordination (Satisfactory). The Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
achieved most of its assigned responsibilities successfully. In particular, the PCU was instrumental in
steering the project to fulfill its objectives of expansion of EBI and in its reaching completion before the
project closing date. However its role to promote inter-agency coordination and monitored implementation
activities of the Ministries involved was weak Also at times, the PCU was perceived to function in an
implementation capacity in lieu of the respective govermment departnents, exacerbating the project's
difficulties to contribute to institutional capacity building.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implemnenting agency:
The implementation of the Government's plan to restructure general secondary education was supported by
the African Development Bank. The AfDB project was expected to begin operations at the same time as
this project but was delayed for three years. As a result, the technical secondary education component was
delayed. The deferral of the AfDB project caused greater difficulties as the expansion of access to basic
education exacted strong pressure on the secondary education system, which was not fully prepared to meet
the increase in demand for services. Consequently, some of the classrooms built under this project were
temporarily used to reduce the pressure on the lower secondary education levels.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Throughout all phases of the project, the government remained committed to the strengthening of human
capital in the country, particularly in the sectors of basic education and technical training. This
commitment was stable even with repeated changes at the helm of both the Ministry of Education and
Labor. The overall instability of professional staff in the Ministry of Education and IET, in turn, did
occasion disruptions in the smooth implementation of the project and made it difficult to achieve the
capacity-building component of the project.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The contracting of a project coordinator and an accountant ensured that close attention was paid to
implementation and disbursement issues and kept the project on track, resulting in the completion of the
project ahead of schedule. The two component coordinators were to be based in the respective line
ministries in order to provide technical advice, however, the placement of the education coordinator outside
of the Ministry of Education inhibited the Ministry from assuming a stronger implementation role in the
project.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
By January 1998, 80% of the project's funds had been disbursed and the attainment of physical goals in
some activities had surpassed the 70% mark. Higher than anticipated costs for activities such as classroom
construction, higher demand for some training programs, and loss on the exchange rate resulted in some
financing shortfall, which in turn led to the fast tracking of the follow-on project. The project experienced
no problems with non-compliance, procurement or financial accounting. Although some expenditures were
higher than budgeted, these differences were not significant to affect overall project implementation. Figure
1 summarizes estimated and actual disbursements.

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Unsatisfactory. Cape Verde has demonstrated impressive gains in expanding access to educational services.
This is no trivial feat, particularly in the African context where "education for all" has largely remained an
elusive goal. Currently, there are discussions aimed at increasing the number of mandatory years of
schooling, indicating Government's continued commitment to augmenting the minimum skill requirements
of school leavers.
On the other hand, attending to the quality of educational services comprises one of the major challenges
that Cape Verdeans must now turn to. Enhancing teaching conditions and student learning represents a
major concern. Teacher capacity and training, the implementation of curricular programs, and the
evaluation of student learning, for instance, must be buttressed. Teacher training schemes (both pre- and
in-service) and curricular programs should rest on solid and consensual standards of expected student
performance. The existing pedagogical supervisory mechanisms must be bolstered in order to build an
adequate teacher support and monitoring system. The efficacy and efficiency of educational provision
ought to be measured against actual student academic achievement and opportunities for securing gainful
employment.
The achievement of these developmental objectives will depend considerably on the government's ability to
consolidate the human and institutional capacity of the Ministries of Education and Labor. In particular,
there is an imperative need to strengthen administrative management at the regional level. Effective
decentralization of budget control and decision-making authority are salient ingredients for the long-term
sustainability of policy initiatives designed to enhance educational quality. Given the current fiscal situation
and the vulnerability of Cape Verde to external shocks, it will be very difficult to achieve the objectives of
projects and programs contained in the budget without delays and possibly resource shortages. This is
particularly important for MECJD's budget, which is highly concentrated in personnel expenditures. Since
1998, there has been a significant reduction in the investrnent budget of MECJD due to Government's
restrictions on new foreign debt, resulting in the use of limited domestic resources to finance investments.
From 1997 to 1998, investment expenditures in the MECJD's budget were reduced by more than 88%.
The significant reductions in capital expenditures pose a high risk to the sustainability of the education
- 11 -



system reform process.
Financial Sustainability
The design of future investments in the sector will need to take fiscal sustainability into account. In 1998
Cape Verde and the IMF signed a Stand-By Agreement, which provides the framework for macroeconomic
and fiscal policies. Although, this agreement expired in March 2000, and the country has made impressive
progress in macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms, fiscal problems are still a concern, and
they are in a large part, beyond of the authorities' control. As a consequence of chronic deficits,
Government has had to tighten fiscal policy, reducing current and investment expenditures in 1999, and
restraining expenditures in the 2000 budget. This situation sets severe limits in Government's ability to
maneuver on the expenditure front and affects the normal functioning of the public administration.
The SAR established as an objective to reduce the number of rented classrooms, which in turn would help
MECJD to reduce costs. In the period covered by the project, the number of rented classrooms was
reduced by 60%, which represents a significant cost reduction in the operational budget of MECJD.
Budgeted total recurrent expenditures for education were ESC 1.3 billion in 1993, equivalent to 18% of the
Government's recurrent budget. In 1999, budgeted total recurrent expenditures for education were ESC 2.5
or 22.5% of the Government's recurrent budget. Actual current expenditures in the education budget have
been increasing steadily since the early 1990's. Due to fiscal difficulties and the IMF agreement in 1998,
the education budget was reduced by 19%. Although the proposed budget for 1999 has been increased
around the levels of 1997, repetition rates and the establishment of the mandatory 6 years primary
education cycle have caused a steady increase in the total number of students, leading Government to
increase the number of teachers accordingly. Around 90% of current expenditures are for wages and
salaries, which means that there is small room for other expenditures such as goods and services, transfers,
and other current expenditures. Given that expenditures in goods and services have a close relationship
with the quality of education, the current trend threatens the sustainability of the reform being implemented
by MECJD. A summary of economic and fiscal indicators for MECJD' budget are presented in Table 3.

6.2 Transition arrangenment to regular operations:
A follow-up project to extend the Basic Education and Training Project was approved and launched in
October 1999. The Education and Training Consolidation and Modernization Project seeks to maintain
and strengthen the reforms in primary education, and demand-driven training. The project will also carry
out a comprehensive sector analysis, addressing issues of quality, equity and sustainability. The set of
studies to be conducted under this project will identify cost-effective options for the sustainable
development of the education/training system in the medium-term. The project will also provide capacity
building in order to enhance the institutional framework needed to provide a coherent government strategy
- 13 -



for the education and training sectors. It is expected that as a result, the government will have a blueprint
for a 10-year human resource development program, to be launch in 2003 with broad donor support.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
(Satisfactory). The project was identified in early 1994 and was consistent with the Bank's assistance
strategy at the time. The project was to build upon lessons learned in the previous project and expand the
pilot program of basic education reform to the entire country. Two high-level meetings were held during
the negotiation stage in order to ensure agreement on the objectives and design of the project. The one area
of disagreement was over the sustainability of the Training Support Fund, which was resolved by the
inclusion of a technical audit to assess its progress at the mid-tern point of the project.
7.2 Supervision:
( Satisfactory). Supervision trips were well timed to provide technical assistance when required, however
for fiscal years 97 and 98, only one supervision mission per year was conducted. The continued
involvement of the first task manager as an implementation manager contributed in providing continuity in
supervision during the change of task managers. Missions included staff of various specialties, providing a
good mix of technical support to the project. Supervision could have been stronger in providing technical
advise regarding long-term sustainability and capacity building issues, that remained key issues for both
sectors.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Having provided good support to the project during preparation, implementation and follow-up, the overall
rating for Bank performance is satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
(Satisfactory). Government demonstrated a strong commitment to the education and training sectors
during the preparation of this project. Ministry staff was closely involved in project design and
demonstrated a clear understanding of project objectives.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Satisfactory). Government commitment to the project continued during implementation and was supported
by a supportive policy environment through the development of necessary legislation (basic education
reform, administrative decentralization and vocational training) and the creation of national advisory bodies
(NACET).
7.6 Implementing Agency:
(Satisfactory). The Project Coordination Unit successfully managed and oversaw project procedures,
financial management and technical assistance. The Project Coordination Unit was central in the timely
disbursement of funds and completion of the project ahead of schedule. It could have played a more active
role in project coordination between the involved ministries and donors, as well as in providing necessary
support for meeting capacity building objectives which were not met.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
(Satisfactory). Overall performance of the borrower was satisfactory. The project achieved most of its key
objectives. Enrollment targets and physical infrastructure goals were met highly satisfactorily. However,
institutional capacity for planning and management remain important challenges and monitoring of the
quality impact of the project components could have been stronger.

8. Lessons Learned
Several important lessons may be extracted from the design and implementation of the Basic Education and
Training Project:
(a)    Synergies between access and quality. Even when the main objective of a project is the expansion
of access to schooling, it is important not to lose sight of the educational quality dimension. Rising
enrollment rates were undoubtedly a major accomplishment. However, the project could have benefited
from a stronger focus on quality concerns. Project design and monitoring activities were heavily geared
towards tracking access and efficacy indicators. Synergies between educational access and quality issues
could have been more carefully structured into the project, so as to enhance children's educational
experience.
(b)    Importance of Monitoring and Evaluation. The availability of good baseline and outcome
indicators, in terms of outreach as well as quality of services provided, are indispensable elements for
appraising project impact. In particular:
Teacher training - Prior to the development of the teacher training program, a needs assessment
should have been conducted. This would have allowed the customization of this training to reach specific
goals, such as the strengthening of pedagogic skills. Trainees should have participated in a program
evaluation. In addition, an external evaluation could have examined training contents, teacher classroom
performance after training, or teacher test results.
*     Professional training - External evaluations of the TSF and apprenticeship training programs
should have been conducted to determine the quality and relevance of the training provided. Tracer studies
of trainees would also have allowed the project to appraise whether these programs prepared students
adequately for the labor market and whether they met labor demands.
(c)    Securing Financial Sustainability. Future investments in the sector will need to pay close
attention to fiscal sustainability. Continued access to World Bank and other international donors funds has
assured some financial sustainability for the education and training sectors for the short-term but not the
long-term. Project gains, however, may be lost if this situation is not attended to. For instance, at present,
the Ministry of Education has no resources allocated for the maintenance and rehabilitation of schools,
thus jeopardizing the school infrastructure provided under this project. The long-term financial
sustainability of the professional training and apprenticeship programs is also uncertain given the lack of
government, private sector or trainee financial contributions to the functioning of these programs.
(d)    Sustaining Capacity Building. Key elements of the Cape Verde context, such as migration
patterns of its population and high turnover of government employees, should have been taken into account
during project design. The project ought to have paid closer attention to potential incentive schemes for
government officials, that might have mitigated high staff turnover and diminished losses in institutional
capacity building.
(e)    Improving Donor Coordination. Several international donors are involved in the education and
training sectors in Cape Verde. Donor coordination is an imperative to ensure a comprehensive and
coherent government policy strategy, as well as to achieve specific program objectives. For instance, the
- 15-



delay in the AfDB project had a detrimental ripple effect on this project. The evidence suggests the need
for stronger donor collaboration in order to avoid such negative consequences. Donor collaboration will
also facilitate exchanges of information, sharing of lessons leamed, the elimination of duplication of efforts,
the cost-effective use of resources, and the attainment of common objectives.
(f    Supportfor Teacher Training. Future in-service training of teachers should be preceded by a
thorough assessment of training needs. Training should be facilitated in a participatory manner using
adult-learning techniques. A well fimctioning monitoring and evaluation pedagogical support system based
in each district could act as an important vehicle for continued enhancement of teaching practices.
(g)    Preserving Equity. Greater attention and effort still needs to be directed to address inequities
between rural and urban areas. Nearly all of those trained under the TSF and apprenticeship programs
lived in the country's two main urban centers. Alternatives such as voucher programs, or other types of
incentive mechanisms, to increase access to these programs for young people in nral areas need to be
explored.
(hl)    Private Sector involvement. If the Training and Employment strategies are to succeed in
increasing skill levels of labor market entrants, and improving productivity of the workforce, the JET has to
work in close collaboration and consultation with the private sector, as well as with other government
sectors, such as Tourism, Commerce and Industry.
