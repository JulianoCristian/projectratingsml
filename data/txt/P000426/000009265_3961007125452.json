country's\n            human resource potential such as fisheries, tourism, export\n            processing and services. The project will assist the\n            Government in implementing this strategy by: 1) supporting\n            the infrastructural, pedagogic, and managerial improvements\n            needed to introduce the revised integrated primary education\n            cycle nationally; 2) improving the quality and relevance of\n            the technical, vocational and professional training system\n            to provide skills relevant to the labor market; and 3)\n            strengthening the institutioanl capacity to develop policies\n            and implement programs for education, training and\n            employment. The project comprises three major components.\n            First, the establishment of a national Integrated Basic\n            Education System (EBI) inclusive of upgraded school\n            infrastructure, primary teacher training and the\n            establishment of a sustainable textbook supply and\n            distribution system. Second, the improvement of the\n            relevance of technical education and training through a rise\n            in entry requirements to secondary education, changes in\n            curricula and teacher training and an improvement in\n            effectiveness of technical training by establishing\n            apprenticeship programs overseas. Third, developing the\n            institutional capacity to develop programs and implement\n            policies by reinforcing ministry planning and managerial\n            capacity and monitoring training and employment activities."}, "docdt": "1994-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
