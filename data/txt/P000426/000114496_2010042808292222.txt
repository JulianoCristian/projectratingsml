Credit No. 2675 CV (Basic Education and Training Project)
Amendment to Development Credit Agreement
We refer to the Development Credit Agreement (the Agreement), dated February 24, 
1995, for the above-mentioned Project between Cape Verde (the Borrower) and the 
International Development Association (the Association) and to your December 18, 1996 
letter to the Association, requesting the Association to increase the Authorized 
Allocation of the Special Account from $250,000 to $400,000.
We are pleased to confirm, therefore, our consent to amend Schedule 4, Section 1 
(c) of the Agreement as follows:
“(c)
the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to $400,000 
to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited into the Special Account 
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the 
Association shall otherwise agree, the Authorized Allocation shall be limited to an 
amount equivalent to $150,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals (from the 
Credit Account plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered 
into by the Association pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions) shall be 
equal to or exceed the equivalent of $1,000,000.”
All provisions of the Agreement, except as amended herein, shall remain in full 
force and effect.
Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing amendment by signing and 
dating the confirmation form on the attached copy of this letter and returning it to 
us, while keeping the original for your records.
This amendment will become effective as of the date of confirmation of this 
letter.
Sincerely,
