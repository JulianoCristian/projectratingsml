MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO TH EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERDE FOR
A BASIC EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memrandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Cape Verde for SDR 7.8 nillion, the equivalent of
US$11.5 miion, on standard IDA terms, with a maturt  of 40 years, to help fiance a basic
education and training project. The Govenment wil contibte US$4.3 nillion equivalent, which
would include US$3.5 million to cover incremental teachers' salaries and direct budgetay support
from the Govmet of the Netherlands and the CaLose Gulbenkia Founan unde already
secured argments.
2.           Country Economic Background. The Republic of Cape Vede consists of an
arcbipelago of ten islands (nine inhabited) about 650 km off the coast of Senegl. Poor natural
resoure, advse  climatic conditions and limited dommdc markts have created ausoere
conditions for the estiated 344,000 population (1990 census) and encouraged a strikingly high
level of enigation. Population growth is estimated at 2.7% p.a., but net of emigmtion at the rate
of 1.5%. As a result of this rapid population growth and high level of emigration (mostly young
men), 64.5% of the population is under 25, and women represet 53% of the population. Despite
the physical constains, Cape Verde has the best social indicators in the Sahlian regon and
among the best in sub-Saharan Aflica (SSA). Lif expctcy is 65 years (compared with 52 for
SSA), primnay school gross enrollment (ages 7-12) is 85% (68% for SSA), adult literacy rate is
52% (49%/o for SSA), and inf  morality is aromund 55 per 1,000 live birts (104 for SSA). These
indicaos, however, hide wide differe    in povet levels betwe  islands and between rurll and
urban areas. These diffences are prmarily due to the conctation of economic opportnies in
the two major towns (Praia and Mindelo). Key sectors of the economy are commerce and
tansportation servces, contributing 60% to GDP (1991). These sectors also provide te bulk of
jobs, employing 33% of the active population.
3.           After indpendence in 1975, the Goverwnet adopted a dominanu epreneuri
role in the economy to compensate for the weak and mall private sector. Pmdent eoonomic
man _.ement~ conbined with substantal invesents in social services, i ctue, and public
enterprises providing distnbution, cmunion and tanrtation services, contibuted to an
aveage 6% annual growth in GDP from 1980-88. However, by 1988, world-wide economic
stagation, persistent drought rid a decline in demand for intem al martm  and aviation
servces contributed to a slowdown   economic growth. Strutural deficiencies resultig fom
Govenment intervention (md  competition, limited private ilVestmn, a weak financial systen)
prvented the economy from respoding adequately to the siuation. As a fesult, the Govermnent
began to retink its development policies. Chief among these was political reform, and a transiton
to multi-party democacy was peacefully accomplished with the election of the opposition party
ovement for Democacy - MfD) in early 1991.
4.           To implement the objective of reducing its participation in the economy and
promoting the emewce of the pnvate sector, the Government has undertake  refomns to: (i)
privatize public enteprises; (d) mit govemnment investmt to basic infiastruchre and social
services; (iii) stremline public adminisaion and reduce administrative procedures; and (iv)



-2-
develop an institutional analytical capacity and policy-making. These reforns are accompanied by
policies to promote specific sectors that take ad-.antage of the country's resources: fisheries,
tourism, export-processing, and services.
5.           Sector Background. To support its economic reform program, the Govemment
is committed to developing the country's human resources. Its strategy is spelled out in its Third
National Development Plan which was presented at a Donor Roundtable in November 1992 and
includes measures to: (a) establish nationwide the integrated basic education system; (b) extend the
coverage of secondary education; (c) develop an integrated vocational training system; and (d)
develop an institutional capacity to plan, coordinate, and manage education and training programs.
These measures are intended to address the issues in the education and training sectors and in the
sectoral institutions.
6.           The education system is currently inefficient: less than 50% of Grade I students
complete the six-year cycle, and only 25% continue to lower-secondary education. This
inefficiency is due to the system's current dual structure which provides basic literacy and
numeracy skills for students in Grades 1-4, and then prematurely introduces secondary curriculum
and teaching techniques to students in Grades S and 6. The result is a high drop-out rate (35%).
The system is also inequitable. Students completmg the first four years of the primary cycle must
tansfr to separate schools to finish the cycle. These schools are few and most often found in
urban areas. In the absence of a higher-education system, the secondary cycle is fmal. Graduates
are not well prepared either for the labor market or continuing education overseas. The science and
mathematics content of the curriculum is weak. and students must take an additional year of
schooling for the end-of-cycle qualification to be recognized internationally.
7.           The technical and vocational training system also faces problems of inefficiency
and poor quality. Technical secondary education produces graduates of low quality. The majority
of students admitted to this cycle are those having failed admission requirements for general
secondary schools. Remedial general education courses reduce curriculum time for technical and
scientific subjects and, consequently, reduce the skills and trainability of the graduates. In
addition, technical students are trained for jobs in the formal modern sector, which are few, and
most of them return to the general secondary education system. Regarding the training system, it is
small, unresponsive to demand, and programs offered by training institutions are limited. Although
unemployment is high, the public and private sector cannot find workers with the right skills and
competencies, because the educational attainment of the workforce is low and the type of training
techmical students receive is unmatched with labor market dmands.
8.           The Ministry of Education and Sports is responsible for fonnal, non-formal and
technical education, through its Directorates.  Its planning and implementation capacity is
inefficient: its implementation capacity is iveak, the delineation of responsibilities among
Directorates is unclear, planning is overly centralized, and staff lack administrative skills, since
most of them are trained teachers. Technical and vocational training is offered by technical
ministries, NGOs, and small, private for-profit centers. Although an nstitute for Employment and
Training was recently created in the new Ministry of Labor, Youth and Social Affairs to oversee
and coordinate employment policies and strategies and training programs with the employment
sector, it has yet to develop that capacity.
9.           The Government's strategy for the education and training sectors over the next five
years (1995-2000) is spelled out in a "Letter of Sector Development Policy", transmitted to IDA on
December 8, 1994 For basic education, the Government intends to reform the primary education



-3-
structure to provide all children with six years of basic education, improve the curriculum to
include more relevant life scills, refocus the community towards the school, and increase resource
use efficiency. Te stategy wil} also reform technicl secondary education to improve the
relevance and quality of traiing programs to better prepare graduates to meet labor market
demanmds. For x  tiot Mining, the stratey aims at upgrading the relevance, with respet to the
labor market, ofthe vocational trainig system and making it more demand dnven and fostenng the
private sector's participation in the tining system. Institutional reforms will also be introduced to
stregth  the planning, nmangent, and administrative capacities of the Myistry of Education
and the Ministry of Labor.
10.          Project Objectives. The proposed project would be a specific investnent credit
operating within an agreed poligy framework established in the Policy letter and designed with the
specific development objectives to (a) achieve universal primary enrollnent by year 1999, while
mainta     equity betwee boys and girls, by providing a minimum of six years of basic education
to all children through the introduction of an integted basic education cycle (EBI), (b) increase
the skill levels of labor market entrants and the productivity of the workforce by developing a mnore
effective and coherent training system linked to employment demand through support to demand
driven and on-the-job traing programs and involvement of the private sector In tra g activities
an policy making, and (c) eniance the institutional capacity to develop and implement policies and
programs in education, training and the labor market by supportng the Ministry of Education
through the reinforcement of its planning, implementation and managerial capacity at the central
and regional levels, and supporting the Ministry of Labor through the strengthening of its capacity
to monitor trnig and labor market. Progress in achieving the projects kibves would be
assessed against monitoring indicators, developed and agreed upon with the Goverment, which
include ana targets for teacher recuitment and deployment, , textbook printing and distribution,
implementtion of quality surveys and sectoml refomis, and apprenticeship and trnng programs.
11.          Project Description. To achieve the above objectives, the project would finance
an investmnt program to: (a) establish nationwide the integraed basic education sM   by: (i)
upgrading the primary school infiastructre trough a classroom construction and equipment and
rehabilitation program, (ii) upgrading and deploying pnrmay school teachers, and (iii) establishing
a sustinable textbook supply through the settng of an efficient distribution system and the
establishment of a textbook revolving fund where proceeds from the sale of books and the
Goverment subsidies will be placed and used exclusively for financing of reprinting sevices; (b)
improve the relevance of technical eduction and traing by (i) improving the quality and
relevance of technical secondary education through the upgrding of entrance requirment, the
development of new curricula and upgrading of technical teachers, (ii) improving the efectiveness
of vocatonal twaining progrm  through the establishment of a Trainmg Support Fund (IS) to
support on-the-job and 4emand driven training, and (iii) expanding apprenticeships and
professional education programs; and (c) develop the istitutional capacity to design prgms and
implement oicies by: (i) strengthening the planning and progmming capacity of the Ministry of
Education at the central and regional levels, (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the
Ministry of Labor to monitor training- and employment-related services, and (iii) supportng
project management and coordination.
12.          Total project costs are estimated at US$15.8 million; the share of the basic
education component is US$11.3 million, that of the technical education and training componen,
US$2.1 million, and that of the institutional stengtheing component, US$2.4 million. The cost
estimates and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procureent arranments, and the
allocation and disbursement plan of the IDA Credit are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key



-4-
project processing steps are shown in Schedule C. The sttus of Bank Group Operations in Cape
Verde is shown in Schedule D.
13.          Project Implementation. The on-mm &Mon            of the project would
be implemetd by the following exist  departme   within the Ministry of Education: the
Administraion D irctrate would be responsible for school construction, with support from the
Public Worss Directorate in the Muustry of Infiastructure, and the Pedagogic Institute would be
respaoble for teacer training, student evaluation, and texbooks distribution. The Ediwadii
D te would bc responsible for implementing the policies, including the refonn of technical
education, and coordinaton of regional delegates and school directors. Txe rog    and
employment oomponent would be managed by the Insdtute for Employment and Training in the
Mistry of Labor, Youth and Social Affairs. A National Adinsory Council for Employment and
aminina (NACET), composed of representatives fom training- and employment-related mniwstries,
employs, trade unions, and NGOs, would be established to guide the development of national
employment and tramg policies. Two compont coordiators, to be located in their respective
ministries, would be nominated to monitor the implementaton of each component, advise the
executig agencies, and work closely with the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCU, in the
Ministry of Economuc Coordination, would be responsible for the coordinton and monitoring of
project implementation, as well as for financial and administrave matters. The project is expected
to be completed over a fve-year period, and the IDA Credit disbursed over six years.
14.          Project Sustainability   To ensure that the progams would continue once the
project is completed, the following actions have been incorporated into the project design:
redeployment and retraining of primary school teachers resulting in a more cost-ective use of
available resources, establishment of a cost-recovery system for the supply and distibution of
tboo  in order for the system to become self-sufficient, improvment of the quality and
relevance of raining programs resuling in an adequate and conftinu    supply of skilled workers,
and creation of the position of Secretary General in the Ministry of Education to coordiate the
Governmens overall education progrm. Apart from the textbook supply systm, these measures
woud ru in dc net budgety increases in recut costs, equivalent to 7% of the 1994
education budget. Ilis increase would be offset by government budgetary resources, assuming an
increase in the Govenes budgt of 3% p.a. and a constat alocation to the education sector.
It would also be offsdet by savings gerated by replacing rented classrwoms with newly costructed
ones. Tring progrmn costs are expected to be bome increasingly by the beneficianes, both
trunees and employers.
15.          Lessons Learned. Ihis project was designed on the basis of lessons leaned from
seven previous IDA-financed projects in Cape Verde, the ongoing education sector project (Cr.
1853-CV), and other education projects within and outside the Region. In particular, the project
builds upon the achievm s of the ongoing project, especially for the design of teacher traing
and textbook prntig and publhg. The project also folows the Bankes rcommndations on
primary and tchnical education and vocational training policies by strgthening basic education,
introducing applied technical non-job specific subjects in secondary technical education, and
supportig a demnd driven on-the-job training.
16.         IDA-financed projects in Cape Verde are now considered among the best
implemented portfolio, after having    uted implenion problems in the past, with the
eception of the Port of Praia Project which was mplemented ahead of schedule. These problems
resulted mainly from poor coordination among executing agencies and unfliarity with Bank
proceme  and disbursm t procedures. Intr-agecy coorination has improved due to the



creation in the Ministry of Economic Coordination of a project coordination unit for monitoring the
implementation of bilateral and multilateral cofinanced projects. This unit will be strengthened
with a project coordinator and an accountant who will be in charge of the proposed project. A
disbursement seminar for project managers was organized by the Bank in Lisbon in November
1993, and a second seminar on procurement and disbursement wIll be held afler proect
effectiveness.
17.          Rationale for Bank Ivolvement.  Cape Verde faces a difficult development
agenda. There are few economies of scale in production, infiastructure or services provided to the
domestic market. The key issues are: (i) building capacity, developing human resources, and
reducing unemployment; (ii) eliminating infrastructure bottlenecks; (iii) maintaining an enabling
envirounent for private sector activity; (iv) pursuing poverty aleviation; and (v) fostering
sustainable development. IDA's recent economic report on Cape Verde and the Coumfly Assistance
Strategy (CAS). reviewed by the Board in March 1993. outlines IDA!s objectives and priorities to
support the Government. Long-term poverty alleviation, consolidating and improving on the
remarkable achievements in social indicators, financial sector development and infrastructure
improvements are major objectives.
18.          Country Assistance Strategy.   The strategy rests on five building blocks: (i)
building public and private sector institutions to promote private sector growth; (ii) addressing
long-term human resource issues; (iii) removing infrastructure bottlenecks; (iv) helping Cape Verde
integrate into the Region and world economy; and (v) increasing the efficiency of public resource
management. The proposed project supports the strateg by strengthening human resources and
removing bottlenecks to private sector development by targeting tmining programs to better
respond to market demands, supporting ongoing restructuring measures of the prinary education
sector to expand coverage and enrollment while -Amproving efficiency and quality, and increasing
the quality of general and technical secondaty education.
19.          Agreed Actions. As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Government would:
fnnish the proof that it has: (a) adopted the Implementation Manual and TSF Procedural Manual;
(b) (i) appointed an extemal auditor under a multi-year contract to conduct semi-annual technical
audits of the TSF, and (ii) designated members of the Executive Committee (EC); (c) numinated
and appointed individuals responsible for program implementation within the responsible
Departments of MOES; (d) (i) appointed an independent auditor under a multi-year contract,
acceptable to IDA, and (d) (ii) established a financial management and accounting system for the
Project as well as selection of a qualified accountant in the PCU acceptable to IDA, who will be in
place;
20.          Environmental Aspects. The project is a Category C and is not expected to have
an adverse effect on the environment. New primary classrooms would be built on existing sites
and according to national environmental standards. There will be no resettlement issue.
21.          Program  Objectives Category.  The project supports the Govenment's
objectives to develop its human resources and alleviate poverty. Expandiag the primary school
system nationwide balances urban and rural children's access to primary education. Achieving
universal primary enrollment and improving the quality and relevance of training programs
provides job opportnuities to the labor force and a steady supply of better qualified and more
productive workers to the economy, in the short and long tern.



*6-
22.          Participatory Approach. The Government's decision to expand the integrated
basic education system camne as a result of stroag public support for introducing the system
nationwide, given the positive achievements of th1 pilot program implemented under the ongoing
project. Private sector employers and trade unions were also actively involved in the design of
training policies, which should foster their financial support. They will participate in the
implementation of this project through the Training Support Fund and the National Advisory
Council for Employmnent and Training, which would also include NGOs' representatives.
23.          Project Benefits.  By project end, Cape Verde would be the first Sahelian
country to achieve universal primary education, vith an increase in enrollment from 75,500 to
80,300 students resulting in a 98% net enrollment rztio by 1999. The introduction of compulsory
basic education, combined with quality improveme.ats, would ensure that about 85% of students
entering Grade 1 will pass the primarv school leavers' exam. Furthermore, the new curriculum will
ensure that primary education graduates will be better prepared for continuing education and will
be provided with general life skills including; improved health practices and environmental
awareness. The Training Support Fund-supported programs, apprenticeships, and correspondence
courses will provide training and skills &quisition for about 1,000 people annually. The Fund
would encourage the growth of still-nascent private sector, promote the decentralization of training
opportunities, and provide incentives to improve planning and management of training centers and
strengthen their links with employers, thereby increasing efficiency in resource use. Improvements
in employment services would respond to the need to provide information about market demand
and e.j-,oyment trends and issues.
24.          Risks. There are two main risks. Eigrs the generalization of the integrated basic
education syse.em could be threatened by the limited planning and management capacity within the
Ministry of Education to implement the programs that promote the rational use of classrooms and
deployment of teachers. This will be mitigated by intensive support for the Directorate of Planning
during the transition period, and continuous strengthening of the Ministry Directorates throughout
the project. Second, training institutions may be slow to adjust their programs to changes in labor
market demands. This will be mitigated by establishing an effective monitoring system to provide
the signals required to adjust training programs to labor market demand and by involving the
private sector in the design and delivery of training programs.
25.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

STATUS OF DISBURSEMENTS IN CAPE VERDE
NOTE ON PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
1.    Overall portfolio performance is very satisfictory and has shown an improvement as
compared to last year. Te portfolio is problem-free, and its steady performance and progress
have been vsible across sectors. Our portfolio and/or activities in Cape Verde are distinguished by
two chaactriscs which have a positivs effect on the implemention environment: (i) the largely
capacity-building nature of the portfolio, and (i) the collaborative manner in which the
GX. rnmrent and I1)A have approached the execution of various activities relatd to portfolio
implementation. Other key features are regular consultations, frequent exchange of visits by both
sides and constant communication.
2.    Disburseme   in FY94 amounted to US$5.63 million, compared to US$1.21 million in
FY93. Some of these improvments could be attributed to the holding of a disbursement seminar
for Portugus-spean Afican countries, which proved to be very helpfil. In addition, staff
from LOAAF visited Cape Verde in November 1993 and held seminars and workshops for all
project staff on disbursement matters and resolved pending issues. With the recent instllation
(June/July 1994) of Bank electronic mail connons in various agencies in Cape Verde, delays in
communications between the Bank and the county should continue to be reduced, and we expect
this to help in fiuther increasing disbursements.
3.    Since    resolution in FY92 of the proument probtem surrounding the constuction of
the pedagogic institute under the Primary Education Project (Cr. 1853-V, no other such
problems bave been encountered under the various projects in the portfolio. Stanard biddig
documents have been made available to all PMUs. The Government is nevertheless planning to
take measures under the PSRCB project (Cr. 2566-CV) to continue to streamnline its owr intenmal
procedues and fre train procurmet staff  There were no major accountig or auditing
problems, and no overdue audit. However, two projects (Prumy Education and I ctures
Rehabilitation) have had 12 and 8 qualified and unsatisfactry audits, respectively, over their life
spans, due in part to a lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities of institutions involved in the
financial reporfing during the early stages of the projects. AU projects in the portfolio now have
accounting and financial mangment systems established with IDA approval. Also, all projects
are currendy operational on the basis of multi-year contacts with audi. firms. To help with long-
term capacity building in accounting, IDA assistance is being provided under the IDF.
4.    With respect to the 'Development Objectives" (DO) ratigs which are now the key
indicators for problem status, durng FY94 four out of the five projects in the portfilio were rated
'HS', and one was rated "5". By comparsn, in FY93 thre projects were rated "HS" and two
projects were rated S".
