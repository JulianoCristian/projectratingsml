The project is funded through two main instruments: a\n            Global Environment Fund (GEF) Trust Fund (TF091199) which\n            supports the Recipient for the establishment of an\n            operational institutional, legal and regulatory regional\n            bio-safety framework for the regulation of living modified\n            organisms and an International Development Agency (IDA)\n            Credit to Burkina Faso (Cr. 4368-BUR) which supports  the\n            West African Economic and Monetary Union for the\n            establishment of an operational institutional, legal and\n            regulatory regional bio-safety framework for the regulation\n            of living modified organisms.

In specific, it proposes the following changes:\n            (i) the amendment of the PDO and PDO Level Results Indicator\n            to reflect a more realistic objective taking into account\n            current level of implementation and time left before closing\n            date; (ii) introduction of changes in the description of the\n            three project components in support of the revised PDO and\n            in accordance with the recommendations of the MTR; (iii)\n            reallocation of GEF Trust Fund and IDA Credit proceeds; and\n            (iv) addition of a Goods category to the list of categories\n            of Eligible Expenditures in the GEF Grant Agreement mainly\n            for the purchase of equipments for eligible Member States\u0092\n            national bio-safety laboratories."}, "docdt": "2011-08-16T00:00:00Z"}
