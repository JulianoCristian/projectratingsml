builds capacity for risk assessment of transgenic\n            crops, particularly Bt-cotton. While the potential benefits\n            of Bt-cotton includes improved yields, decreased pesticide\n            use, and labor savings, the potential impacts upon the local\n            environment and the socioeconomic fabric of the region needs\n            to be assessed. This environmental impact assessment focuses\n            on biodiversity, insect resistance management, and the\n            co-existence of different production systems. The assessment\n            regarding biosafety involves evaluating the extent of gene\n            flow and the potential displacement of native strains or\n            non-target plant species. Insect resistance management\n            assessment will compare bollworm damage to other types of\n            insect damage to guide pesticide applications for Bt-cotton,\n            and it will also address the issue of refugia (areas\n            reserved for target species) and the capacity of the\n            extension service to train farmers in agronomic practices\n            involving Bt cotton. Also the interest of certain countries\n            in organic cotton production and different production\n            systems will also be assessed. An assessment of the\n            socioeconomic impact will focus on seed pricing, the risk of\n            farmer dependency on monopolistic suppliers, and issues\n            concerning intellectual property rights. Capacity will be\n            improved among extension services and farmer organizations\n            to increase knowledge of the technical issues involved,\n            including seed price negotiations. In addition, specific\n            attention will be directed to support the countries in\n            registering varieties and in negotiating licenses for\n            intellectual property rights."}, "docdt": "2010-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
