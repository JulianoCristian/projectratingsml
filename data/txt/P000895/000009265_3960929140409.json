       remove physical constraints in transport infrastructure,\n            reduce transport costs for goods and passengers, and support\n            exports, farm production, and the mobility of people.  It\n            will also help alleviate rural poverty in one of the poorest\n            areas of Ghana.  The project includes the following four\n            main components:  (a) road rehabilitation which includes a\n            three-year (1991-1993) time slice of the trunk road\n            stabilization program; (b) railway rehabilitation; (c)\n            support to transport sector agencies; and (d) a Northern\n            Region Pilot Scheme comprising labor-intensive\n            rehabilitation/construction of rural infrastructure with\n            emphasis on employment of women and involvement of local\n            nongovernmental organizations."}, "docdt": "1990-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
