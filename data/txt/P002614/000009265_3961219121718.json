The project's main objectives\n            included (i) establishing a privatization implementation\n            unit; (ii) strengthening the supervisory capabilities of the\n            Ministry of Finance over public enterprises, (iii) providing\n            technical assistance to support the public enterprise reform\n            and privatization effort; (iv) designing and implementing a\n            restructuring program for a select number of troubled\n            strategic public enterprises; and (v) providing training and\n            logistical support to facilitate the public enterprise\n            reform and privatization effort.  Bank's performance\n            was satisfactory. Borrower's performance was not\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            the importance of not exaggerating project objectives, and\n            the need to include adequate monitorable actions; and (ii)\n            the need to design projects with a clear understanding of\n            the political environment. The implementation of a\n            privatization or restructuring program in Sudan did not\n            adequately take into account political constraints."}, "docdt": "1995-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
