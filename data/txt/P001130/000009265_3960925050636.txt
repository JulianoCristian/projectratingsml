PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
(LOAN 1914-IVC)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project was the seventh for higbways in Cote d'Ivoire.  The
first too projects were for road construction while the Third (1972)
consisted of a four-year road maintenance and betterment program. The
Fourth Highway Project (1973) consisted of road construction and a atudy of
feeder roads which formed the basis of a rural development project. The
Fifth Highway Project (1975) included pavement strengthening, road
construction and a study for the preparation of the feeder road component.
The sixth lending operation, the Feeder Roads and Highway Maintenance
Project (1977), included a feeder road component as well as a road
maintenance and betterment component. The Highway Sector Project, the
seventh in the sub-sector, was followed by the Second Highway Sector
Project (1985), making Cote d9'voire the Bank's largest borrower for
highways in Western Africa (para 1.01).
Obiectives
The main objectives of the project w6,  tot  (a) assist Government
in its policy of restrained investments, by evaluating its absorptive
capacity, establishing investment ceilings for the road sector, and
ensuring that only high priority projects are undertaken; (b) strengthen
highway sector planning and coordination, including the adoption of sound
engineering and economic criteria for project selection; (c) provide low
cost financing of foreign exchange costs of priority investments to be
included in the road investment program as a substitute for more expensive
sources of funds; and (d) reinforce road maintenance operations and
increase productivity of equipment, and make efficient use of the allocated
budget through further training (para 2.05).
Implementation Experience
The project got off to a difficult start as the Government did not
carry out the agreed on feasibility studies of the sub-projects, and
continued to rely extensively on supplier credits as a major source of
foreign exchange financing. Finally, however, after a prolonged series of
discussions, the Government was eventually convinced of the need for
thorough economic Analysis of sub-projects, and made full use of the loan
funds (paras 3.01-3.03).



- v -
Substantial dollar appreciation vis-a-vis the CFA franc in which
project contracts were denominated, enabled considerable expansion of
project works under an additional work program which was extended to the
end of 1986 (prar 3.04).
Overall, the civil works were carried out satisfactorily. The
executing entity, the DCGTX, was a very efficient works manager which
enhanced private sector participation in civil works and concurrently
reduced expensive and difficult-to-control force account works (paras
3.04 and 3.05).
The technical assistance component of the project was somewhat
less successful, with the training of road maintenance personnel falling
short of targets due mainly to funding constraints (para 3.07).
Results
An economic revaluation of the sub-projects carried out by DCGTX
ranged from 21 to 51%, as against 12.6 to 17.2X at appraisal (para 4.01).
One of the major objectives of the project was to establish an
efficient framework for planning, constructing and maintaining the road
network. This objective was largely met as various road planning
institutions were considerably strengthened. A major step forward was the
Government's acceptance of the concept that highway investments should be
based on sound economic and engineering criteria, including the flexible
application of design standards (para 5.01).
Strict application of loan covenants initially ctused
disagreements between the Borrower and the Bank. But later, with
perseverance and flexibility on the part of the Bank and the Borrower, the
major objectives of the project were achieved (pars 6.01).
The project provided a sound basis for the Second Highway Sector
Loan (para 7.06).
Sustainability
Given the institutional improvements resulting from the Highway
Sector Project, the subsequent Second Highway Sector Project, and the
likelihood of a continued involvement in the highway sector by the Bank,
the Highway Sector Project should be considered sustainable.
Findings and Lessons
The training program for road maintenance staff fell short of
target, but it has great potential for increasing road maintenance
effectiveness, and the program should, therefore, be continued under
follow-up projects (paras 3.09 and 7.02).
Responsibility for overall project progress reporting and
disbursement coordination should in future 'e given to only one of the
project executing agencies (paras 3.12 and 7.03).



REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVPIRE
HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT, LOAN 1914-IVC
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The above project was the seventh for highways in ("Ote d'Ivoire.
The first two projects were for road construction while the Third
(Loan 837-IVC, US$17.5 M, 1972) consisted of a four-year road maintenance and
betterment program.  The Fourth Highway Project  (Credit 406-IVC, US$7.5 M,
1973) consisted of road constructior. and a study of feeder roads which formed
the basis of a rural development project. The Fifth Highway Project (Cred-
it 1161-IVC, US$43 M, 1975) included pavement strengthening, road construction
and a study for the preparation of the feeder road comronent.  The sixth
lending   operat.Lon,  the  Feeder  Roads  and  Highway  Maintenance  Project
(Loan 1501-IVC, US$29.0 M, 1977) included a feeder road component as well as a
road maintenance and betterment component. The Highway Sector Project, the
seventh in the sub-sector, was followed by the Second Highway Sector Project
(Loan 25Z!-IVC, US$110 M in 1985), making Cote d'Ivoire the Bank's largest
borrower for highways in Western Africa (US$223 M for eigh. projects).
1.02      In 1:'9 i; the road network consisted of 45,200 km of roads of which
about half were feeder roads and 11,000 km were tracks and other low standard
roads. Over the period 1976-1980, about 1,300 km were paved (i.e., 60% over
the paved network existing in 1976) and 2,000 km of earth roads and 4,500 km
of feeder roads were improved. As a result of these operations, 90% of the
paved network and 35% of the primary and secondary network was in good condi-
tion. However, many of the older paved roads needed strengthening to avoid
extensive pavement failure and to accommodate traffic growth. The Government
had made a start in strengthening these older roads with assistance from the
Bank. The Sector Project was not only meant to continue such assistance, but,
in addition, it sought to address a number of issues which the implementation
of the 1976-1980 plan had raised, namely that:
(a)  past rates of investment  in the sector could not be sustained
without endangering the country's balance of payments position;
thus, more selectivity was needed in determining future investment
priorities;
(b)  with the expansion of the network, a more efficient highway mainte-
nance department was necessary, yet planning and organization of
highway maintenance remained weak; the problem of division of
responsibility between central and local authorities in both plan-
ning and execution of road maintenance was unresolved; there was an
acute shortage of trained and experienced technicians; basic data
for programming was inadequate; and the Ministry of Public Works had
yet to come to grips with the problem of planning and improvement of
secondary roads, and of defining sound and economical design stan-
dards for these roads; and
(c)  past  road investments had been costly:  in terms of financing
source, through excessive use of supplier credits; in terms of



-2
procurement, methods through large negotiated contracts spread over
30 months and often amended as works were in progress; and in terms
of technical characteristics, through the adoption of much higher
design standards than justified on the grounds of safety or economy.
1.03      Execution of the Project was the responsibility of the Ministry of
Public Works, Transport, Construction  and Urbanism  (MPWTCU)  through  the
following services: Direction de l'Entretien Routier (DER) for road mainte-
nance planning, Direction Centrale du Contr8le des Grands Travaux (DCGTX) for
the execution of civil works, Direction Centrale des Tansports Terrestres
(DCTT) for statistical data collection, and Direction Centrale de la Formation
Professionnelle (DCFP) for the road maintenance training program.
1.04      The information for this report was obtained from the staff apprais-
al and President's Reports for the Highway Sector Project (Reports
No. 2792-a-IVC of October 16, 1980 and P2884-IVC of October 15, 1980, respec-
tively), Bank supervision reports, Bank files, project execution progress
reports, and interviews with Bank staff formerly assocl.ted with the Project.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFTCATION, PREPARATION AN) APPRAISAL
Identification and Preparation
2.01      Discussions to introduce highway sector lending operations in C8te
d'Ivoire started during the appraisal and implementation of the Fifth Highway
Project, and continued during the execution of the sixth project. As a result
of the experience gained in the sector, and the dialogue established with the
MTPTCU, the possibility of a Highway Sector Loan as the next Bank operation
was fully explored. The Transport Sector Memorandum of June 7, 1978 outlined
the conditions necessary to proceed with a sector loan in Cote d'Ivolre. In
October 1978,  a  project preparation mission visited CMte d'I'oire.   The
Back-to-Office and Full Report dated November 20, 1978 gave a full account of
the extent to which the lending strategy conditions were fulfilled, as well as
the general conditions necessary for a s3ctor loan operation. Follouing the
analysis of the report, within the Bank, a pro-appraisal mission of March 1979
discussed in detail with the Government the concept of sector lendirg in the
Ivorian  context.   Issues  revealed  during  supervision of ongotag ttghway
nrojects were notably the rapidly rising costs of road construction due to the
.arge volume of contracts financed by suppliers' credits, the inadequate
collection and analysis of basic transport data, and the acute shortage of
qualified technical personnel in the administration.
Project Appraisal
2.02      The March 1979 pre-appraisal mission also prepared the Project's
Technical Assistance Program, including the training program for mechanics,
medium and low level technicians, truck drivers and small entrepreneurs and a
program for the promotion of small and medium firms in the construction
industry.  Project appraisal took place in July 1979.  But the issues of
suppliers' credit financing, domestic contracting industry and training
programs for road maintenance personnel, truck drivers and small business
entrepreneurs, needed further study. A post-appraisal mission took place in
September 1979 to review these issues. A program and calendar for actions to
be taken by the Government was agreed during the mission. A public investment



- 3-
review mission of 3Jnuary 1980 concluded that proposed highway investments
were higher than the ceiling considered acceptable bv the Bank.  Finally, a
road investment ceill'g of CFAF 40 billion was agreed.
2.03      Negotiations were held in Abidjan in May 1980.  The main issues that
emerged were:
(a)  the road investment ceiling ard the Government's position on con-
tracting considerable supplier credits which implied commitments of
CFAF 52 billion in 1980 and 63 billion in 1981, to be financed
mainly through suppliers' credits left no room for an additioncl
program to be financed under the proposed sector loan;
(b) the Government's "pre-condition" that the loan could not be signed
before January 1981;
(c) the Government's unwillingness to agree to a covenant specifying
that agreement should be reached with the Bank on the total highway
sector investment program for iny period; and
(d) the Government's reluctance to agree to a covenant requiring the
application of sub-project selection criteria to Its total invest-
ment program rather than merely to those projects to be financed out
of the proposed loan.
2.04      A  Bank mission headed by  the Department Director visited Cote
d'lvoire in June 1980 to address these issues. Faced with a public finance
squeeze due to falling coffee and cocoa prices, the Government finally was
persuaded that a reduced 1981 investment program was in the national interest
and that the prompt use of the proceeds of the sector loan to substitute for
commercial bank financing was highly desirable, especially since the Bank
appeared ready to reduce Ivorian counterpart funding by introducing the
concept of a variable disbursement ratio, higher in the first years or two,
and declining later. Negotiations were resumed and completed in August 1980,
with the Bank agreeing to a slightly higher 1981 road investment ceiling of
CFAF 56 billion, or 12% of total public investment, but prevailing on its
initial position on other issues. Because of expected delays in releasing
loan funds, part of the technical assistance components were to be picked up
through a reallocation of funds under the Feeder Roads and Highway Maintenance
Project. The loan was finally approved on November 4, 1980 and the agreements
signed four and a half months later, on March 19, 1981. The loan was declared
effective on July 31, 1981.
Project Objectives and Description
2.05      The main objectives of the Project were to:  (a) assist Government
in its policy of restrained investments, by evaluating its absorptive capaci-
ty, establishing investment ceilings for the road sector, and ensuring that
only high priority projects are undertaken; (b) strengthen highway sector
planning and coordination, including the adoption of sound engineering and
economic criteria for project selection; (c) provide low cost financing of
foreign exchange costs of priority investments to be included in the road
investment program as a substitute for more expensive sources of funds; and
(d) reinforce road maintenance operations and increase productivity of equip-
ment, and make efficient use of the allocated budget through further trainina.



-4-
2.06      To reach these objectives, the Project financed:
(a) civil works including main road construction, reconstruction and
pavement strengthening;
(b) technical assistance and training for the various MTPTCU director-
ates;
(c)  road maintenance equipment for training brigades; and
(d) road laboratory equipment for further research into pavement design
standards.
2.07      In addition, criteria and procedures for selection of specific road
works and for their financing were agreed.  The majority of road projects
included in the investment program were to have a minimum 12% economic rate of
return, based on preliminary engineering cost estimates, projected vehicle
operating costs savings, eventual road maintenance savings, and eventual
intermodal effects. Each project was to be prepared to sound engineering and
economically justified standards; in particular and as applicable, alternate
layouts and cross-sections, in line with MTPTCU standards, were to be investi-
gated and the detailed engineering was to aim at the least total cost solution
after careful evaluation of alternatives.
2.08      A ceiling of CFAF 56 billion or about 122 of total public investment
program for investments in main roads was agreed for 1981. Interurtin road
investments were to stay In tha order of this percentage in ensuing years,
subject to review in response to changing economic conditions. Completion of
ongoing works and programs and new road paving and strengthening was estimated
to reach, over five years, CFAF 211 billion in 1980 prices, or an average
investment of about CFAF 42 billion a year. In 1981, commitments carried over
from the previous year alone were estimated at CFAF 44 billion in current
prices. To these, a volume of new works was to be added to the Project to a
total investment level of CFAP 56 billion, as an alternative to contractor
financing arrangements.
2.09      Institution building was one of the principal objectives of the
Project. Some of the issues raised during the supervision of previous proj-
ects and which the sector project sought to address from a sectorwide perspec-
tive were the inadequate collection and analysis of basic transport data and
the acute shortages of qualified technical personnel in the Administration.
The Project provided for 137 man-months of technical assistance as follows:
(a)  72 man-month extension of tue technical assistance under the Feeder
Roads and Highway Maintenance Project to bridge the gap until the
training program included under the Highway Sector Loan is opera-
tional;
(b) 32 man-months to assist in organizing and training Ivorian personnel
in road transport planning in DCTT;
(c)  32 man-months to assist in organizing a data unit and training
Ivorians in preparing and updating road inventory and traffic counts
in DCTT;



(d) one man-month to assist in preparing a training program for drivers
of heavy trucks, eventually to be implemented with additional
technical assistance;
(e) an on-the-job training program, including technical assistance,
teaching materials and equipment for mechanics and equipment opera-
tors in all the directorates, including the regional ones;
(f) trainir.3 of domestic contractors; and
(g)  fellowships and research equipment for the National Soil Laboratory.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Because of delays in loan signature, project implementation began in
earnest only in the third quarter of 1981. By December 1981, 702 of civil
works had been committed through signed contracts.   The overall level of
investments in highways programmed for 1982 was found adequate on the assump-
tion that construction of the expressway to Yamassoukro beyond km 114 would be
postponed indefinitely. However, at the onset, it became evident that not all
loan covenants were being complied with. In particular, ro,'d projects were
being inserted into the investment program without a technical and economic
evaluation of investment alternatives, or in the case of sub-projects financed
under the sector loan, onity perfunctory feasibility studies were carried out
on the basis of predetermined technical soiutions. Overall economic studies
seemed to be of little usage in investment decision making. Field inspections
confirmed that this practice had resulted in over-investments in roads and
selection of doubtful priorities. Furthermore, Government still seemed to
give preference to supplier credits over other sources of financing for
investments in the sector, thereby heavily borrowing on the future but avoid-
ing the need for counterpart financing. The Ministry of Public Works, Con-
struction, Posts and Telecommunications (MTPCPT), which had replaced MTPTCU in
1984, was obviously under pressure to carry out numerous and expensive works
as fast as possible. Economic studies and ICB were considered to slow down
the process and were, therefore, not popular.
3.02      Confronted with these issues,  the Government indicated that its
interpretation of the loan covenants was that only sub-projects financed under
the project were to be the subject of an economic analysis, but it finally
agreed to abide by the loan covenants. The issue of pre-investment studies
was, however, far from being resolved. The Road Planning Unit at the Central
Bureau of Technical Studies (BCET) which carried out economic studies was weak
and created a bottleneck in the preparation of the investment programs. The
unit was eventually strengthened with an additional, expatriate economist
seconded as needed by short-term consultants, granted an r'perational budget,
and put under the control of MTPCPT, along with the Directorate of Investments
Programming (DPI).  Still, there were to be several acrimonious exchanges
between the Bank and the Borrower on the subject of technico-economic evalua-
tions of design alternatives which the Bank required. Finally, the issue of
economic studies was resolved on a case-by-case basis. By the end of the
project, economic evaluation of projects was becoming an accepted practice.
3.03      Contrary to what was expected at appraisal and agreed during negoti-
ations, the Bank discovered that the sector loan was not the major source of



foreign exchange financing, as 66% of the 1983-85 draft investment program
were being financed by supplier credits or private banks. With the (-overnment
facing a shortage of funds, road works that could have been included under the
sector loan were being negotiated with contractors providing 100% financing.
For sector loan sub-proJects, an average of only 59% of expenditures was
covered by loan funds. To reduce the share of supplier credlts in financing
the investment program, the Bank finally agreed to increase the percentage of
financing for civil works to an average of 70% of expenditures. However, it
is likely that it was not the increase in the financing percentage, but the
general economic downturn caused by the fall in coffee and cocoa prices which
discouraged private investors, that finally contributed to the reduction of
the share of supplier credits in financlng the investment program.
Execution of Sub-projects
3.04      Works on the first two approved civil works contracts  for the
strengthening of the Issia-Man and San Pedro-Issia Roads started in Octo-
ber 1981 and March 1982, and were completed in February 1983 and October 1984,
respectively. Other civil works of the original program of 566 km were also
completed by the end of 198Is within cost estimates and established schedules.
Because of dollar appreciation vis-a-vis the CFAF in which contracts were
denominated, a substantial additional civil works program was carried out,
including the purchase of ferries and improvement of secondary and feeder
roads which, because of the phasing out of the Directorate for Periodic Road
Maintenance of MTPCPT, could not be executed by force account. Under the
program, a total of 612 km of paved roads were strengthened and widened to a
width of 7.4 m, with paved shoulders of 0.5 to 1.8 m, for a total cost of
CFAF 26.6 billion, i.e., an average of CFAF 43 million per km. In addition,
there were 161 km of new paved roads for CFAF 173 billion (CFAF 107 mil-
lion/km), and 100 km of gravel roads for CFAF 3.0 billion (CFAF 30 mil-
lion/km). A 380 m bridge (Pont de Moussou on the Ebrie Lagoon) and 13 other
drainage structures were constructed for a total cost of CFAE 3.6 billion. A
list of civil works completed both under the initial and additional work
programs is in Table 4.
3.05      Overall, the civil works were carried out satisfactorily, ahead of
schedule by competent contractors under the very good control of DCGTX. This
entity has prodticed remarkable results in bringing down unit prices of civil
works, preparing bidding and contract documents, evaluating bids, resolving
implementation problems, controlling works, meeting budgets and schedules.
Following reorganization of the MTPCPT in 1984, highway investment planning,
engineering design, and contract supervision were put under the responsibili-
ty of DCGTX resulting in improved efficiency, but also a growing rivalry
between DCGTX and the MTPCPT.
3.06      Two main issues arose in connection with the execution of the civil
works:   selection of road standards and compliance witk. Bank procurement
guidelines. Although DCGTX vas good at work preparation, supervision and
control, when it came to investment selection, use of reasonable standards,
identification  of  least  cost  solutions,  DCGTX  often  took  a  rigid  and
non-negotiable approach. The Bank initially took a somewhat similar approach,
which resulted in acrimonious discussions on the reasonableness of proposed
widths of surfacing and base courses, design speeds, shoulder treatments and
the merits of high initial investment for lesser futureexpenditures on periodic
maintenance.   This  issue was  finallv  resolved  on  a case-by-case basis.
Concerning procurement, the main problem was the insistence of DCGTX that all



-7-
bids be denominated in CFA francs, leaving the exchange rate risk to bidders.
This issue, which was first temporarily resolved through the Bank waiving its
opposition to the Borrower's stand until the end of 1984, was finally resolved
during preparation and negotiations of the follow-up Second Highway Sector
Loan.
Technical Assistance
3.07      Technical assistance to DCTP for the establishment of a Road Data
Unit to centralize, process and analyze data on road conditions and traffic
characteristics started in September 1981. The program suffered considerable
start-up delays due to delays in appointing competent personnel and setting up
of the necessary budget to carry out the tasks, as well as weaknesses in
coordination between the unit and other central and regional services of the
MTPCPT. The assistance was extended until 1985 and the unit integrated into
the Directorate of Investment Programming in the MTPCPT. After 15 months of
assistance, Ivorian nationals were running the unit and a computerized data
bank is now being established.
3.08      Technical assistance to DCTT for the analysis and organization of
the road transport market started in November 1981, but fell behind schedule
due to the illness of the team leader. The final reports on this assistance
delivered in 1985 provided a comprehensive review of transport policy issues
in C8te d'Ivoire. The documents served as the basis for a Government action
plan aimed at improving productivity in the road transport sector.
Training
3.09      The training program for road maintenance staff by a joint venture
of the country's two main technical schools, called FORMAROUTE, formally began
in June 1982. Plagued with rivalries between the two partners and funding
constraints, the training program which in effect began only in 1983, fell
short of target and is being continued under the follow-up Second Highway
Sector Loan. About 482 trainees or 60% of project target were trained, and
only about 55% of these are considered well trained. Major problems were the
poor quality of personnel assigned to training and the dissatisfaction of
trainees once they have reported for training due to what they perceive as
insufficient per diem for outstation posting.   The training program has,
however, resulted in improved efficiency of road maintenance operations and
the overseas training of eight Ivorian trainers to ensure the success of the
operation.
Project Costs
3.10      The total project cost was estimated at appraisal to be about
US$166 M or CFAF 35 billion for civil works, including taxes of about 29% of
total costs.  Final project cost for the original program is estimated at
CFAF 32.4 billion  of  which  the  Bank  financed  about  CFAF 22.6 billion
(US$58 M).  Final project costs for the revised program are estimated at
CFAF 56.1 billion (US$141.3 M) of which the Bank financed CFAF 38.8 billion or
US$99.2 M. Overall, the project benefitted from substantial dollar apprecia-
tion.



-8-
Disbursements
3.11      The loan was first amended on November 25, 1981 to increase the
percentage of civil works expenditures to be financed under the loan with the
aim of thus reducing recourse to expensive suppliers' credits (para 3.03). A
second amendment was effected on October 8, 1982 to expand project activities
to be financed out of the loan (para 3.04), and on January 26, 1984 to allow
for 100% financing of training abroad. The loan closing date was extended
twice for a total of two years to allow for project completion, from Decem-
ber 31, 1984 to December 31, 1985 and December 31, 1986.   The undisbursed
balance of the loan amounting to US$0.8 m was cancelled on June 30, 1987.
3.12      Initially,  disbursements  lagged  considerably  behind  appraisal
estimates as the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA), which is responsible
for the country's foreign debt management, delayed submission of disbursement
applications due to budgetary constraints, which made it difficult for Govern-
ment to come up with counterpart financing. This problem was compounded by
the fact that CAA was reluctant to use any other disbursement procedures than
procedure I which is for reimbursements. A major complaint in the past of
project executing agencies was that they were unable to follow-up disbursement
applications because of the application re-numbering system adopted by CAA. A
single project executing agency should have been made responsible for dis-
bursement coordination and follow-up.
Consultants' Performance
3.13      The Project originally provided for 137 man-months of technical
assistance for the various directorates of the MTPCPT. This assistance was
considerably expanded due to the fact that many of the tasks to be undertaken
were initially undefined, but also because of initial delays due to lags in
appointing personnel, budgetary constraints, and sometimes sickness. Addi-
tional short-term services were also provided to the Road Planning Unit. The
consultants' overall performance was generally satisfactory.
IV. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
4.01      In the feasibility study, BCET assumed that the roads would be
opened to traffic in 1982 and have a life of 15 years before further strength-
ening is required. The benefits considered were: vehicle operating cost
savings accruing to normal and induced traffic, diverted traffic benefits
applicable, maintenance cost savings, and in the sensitivity test, time
savings to passengers. At that time, the ERR for different sub-projects was
estimated to be between 12.6% and 17.2% without time savings benefits and 14%
and 18.9%, including time savings benefits. A similar approach was followed
by DCGTX in re-evaluating the sub-projects.  The ERR of the sub-projects
ranged from 22 to 53Z and 21 to 51% with and without time savings benefits,
respectively.



V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      One of the major objectives of the Project was to establish an
efficient framework for planning, constructing and maintaining the road
network.   This objective has been largely met, as Ivorian road planning
institutions were considerably strengthened, Basic data on road use and on
the current condition of the network is now being systematically collected,
analyzed, and used for planning purposes. Data on the road transport market
is also being collected and analyzed to help in updating transport policies.
Most important of all, economic analysis is now accepted as a tool in invest-
ment selection. There is a basic awareness of the road maintenance problem
and the need for cost control. An efficient organization for planning and
controlling road construction and maintenance is now in place.
VI. THE ASSOCIATION'S PERFORMANCE
6.01      Bank supervision was adequate.  Strict application of loan covenants
initially caused disagreements between the Borrower and the Bank, resulting in
almost a two-year delay in the implementation of the Project.  But with
perseverance and flexibility on the part of the Bank and the Borrowers, the
major objectives of the Project were achieved. The Project provided a sound
basis for the follow-up project, the Second Highway Sector Loan.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The  Project  contributed  to  establishing  and  enhancing DCGTX's
capacity for project preparation,  supervision and control;  in particular,
DCGTX gained invaluable experience in contracting civil works to the private
construction industry (para 3.05). Project implementation coordination was a
major task as several project implementation agencies were involved.
7.02      The training program for road maintenance staff was less successful,
but it has great potential for increasing road maintenance effectiveness, and
the program should, therefore, be continued under follow-up projects (pa-
ra 3.09).
7.03      Responsibility for overall project progress reporting and disburse-
ment coordination should in future be given to only one of the project execut-
ing agencies (para 3.12).
7.04      The Project contributed to the implementation of a sizable road
improvement program and succeeded in putting in place a comprehensive mainte-
nance management system (para 5.01).
7.05      The systematic introduction of economic criteria based on sound
engineering and economic analysis in the decisions for investment selection,
planning and programming constitutes a major achievement of the project. Most
important of all, economic analysis is now accepted as a tool in investment
selection.   The project also brought about a greater awareness for road
maintenance and more cost control consciousness among road maintenance staff.



- 10 -
The road planning institutions were brought together through the Project
(para 5.01).
7.06      Considerable dissension initially resulted between the Bank and the
Borrower because of the Bank's effort to achieve compliance with loan cove-
nants and procurement guidelines. While these issues delayed prompt implemen-
tation at the outset, the major objectives of the Project were eventually
achieved, and it provided a sound basis for the Second Highway Sector Loan.
(para 6.01).
