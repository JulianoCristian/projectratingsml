The project\n            achieved its major objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was substantial, sustainability is likely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Two main lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, although the training program for road\n            maintenance staff fell short of target, it still has great\n            potential for increasing road maintenance effectiveness and\n            should be continued under follow-up projects. Second, in the\n            future, responsibility for overall project progress\n            reporting and disbursement coordination should be given to\n            only one of the project executing agencies."}, "docdt": "1989-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
