FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Loan and Project Suimary
Borrower:             Republic of Cyprus
Amount:               US$20.00 million
Terms:                Fifteen years including three years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate.
Proiect Description: The project aims to establish a transport planning
and policy framework, implement a sustainable and
cost effective highway maintenance system, upgrade
priority highways, and further improve highway
safety. The proposed project comprises a four-year
time slice of the highway rehabilitation,
strengthening and maintenance program, and includes
upgrading the Larnaca-Nicosia Road and continuation
of rural road improvements, procurement of highway
maintenance, safety and traffic survey equipment and
consultancy services to assist in institution
building. The Bank loan will provide financing for:
(a) road rehabilitation and strengthening; (b)
periodic maintenance; (c) procurement of equipment;
and (d) consultancy services. Benefits lie primarily
in institution building associated with the
implementation of effective highway maintenance and
pavement management, the preparation of a transport
sector strategy and further development of project
evaluation.  The project would lead to savings in
pavement reconstruction costs, savings in vehicle
operating costs and reductions in traffic accidents.
There are no tnusual risks but allowance has been
made in project implementation for delays in the
major construction components.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
1.01     Cyprus has limited domestic resources and, hence, they have to be
managed efficiently. They consist particularly of:
(a)    high value agricultural produce, much of which is perishable and
requires both a good rural road network and export transport
facilities to maintain quality and to benefit from early markets
in North Europe;
(b)    a tourist industry that requires both good air communications
and internal road transport; and
(c)    a growing position in the highly competitive east Mediterranean
entrepot trade, especially since the decline of Beirut.
Government's policy is to encourage the development of these activities which
themselves are largely managed by the private sector, while not overstraining
the country's financial and environmental resources and this policy requires a
careful balance.  Consequently careful attention must be paid to the way in
which individual development projects, including transport, contribute towards
economic growth especially in the above resource areas.
1.02       The Government's current transport sector policy objective is to
achieve a well balanced transport industry by focussing on high priority,
quick yielding projects and by placing greater emphasis on the preservation
and upgrading of the existing infrastructure and thus operate the system to
maximum advantage. The transport sector as a whole is efficiently managed.
The majority of services are operated by the private sector or autonomous
services, the few bottlenecks that do exist are being actively addressed and
those in the roads subsector will be tackled under the proposed project. The
transport sector administered by the Government is limited to that part of the
island, about 6,105 sq.km, in the south and west. Since appraisal of the on-
going Third Highway Project (Loan 2128-CY), in October 1981, there have been
significant changes in the transport sector. Until 1981 most investments were
closely connected with relatively short term emergency works stemming from the
events of 1974. After 1981, a longer term approach has been adopted towards
transport development projects and institutional reforms which will continue
under the proposed project.

B.  Traffic
Road Transport
1.03     Road transport, which is discussed in greater detail in Chapter II,
is responsible for all domestic movements of people and freight. There are
approximately 161,000 motor vehicles excluding motor cycles (see Annex 3) all
of which are imported in a fully assembled state. Only the older village
buses have locally made bodies.
Ports
1.04     With the exception of certain specialized cement, oil and fertilizer
operations, the ports of Limassol and Larnaca, handle nearly all of Cyprus'
import and export traffic. Limassol port serves over 70Z of general cargo,
60Z of the passengers and 80Z of the containers handled by both Limassol and
Larnaca. Uncertainties arising from the situation in Lebanon and the develop-
ment of container facilities at Limassol, has developed Cyprus as an important
center in the East Mediterranean transit trade.  The following table shows
port traffic in Cyprus.
_ of
Annual
1980   1981   1982   1983   1984   Growth
General and Bulk Cargo (MT)       2.22   2.25   2.28   2.14   2.11   -1.2
Domestic Containers ('000 TEU)  54      54     59     54      63       4.0
Transit Containers ('000 TEU)   37    123    121    128    209        54
Passengers (Thousands)           95    101    167    203    237       26
Transit traffic is liable to fluctuate as the political and security situation
in Beirut changes. Transit traffic is also a highly competitive business and,
with developments in other ports of the region, Cyprus will have to upgrade
the operations at Limassol port to improve or to maintain its share of this
traffic. In addition, the tariff structure and system of calculation is not
appropriate to modern shipping operations and income has declined, consequent-
ly the system is currently being analysed by the Cyprus Ports Authority (CPA)
Commercial Department and will be revised to: (a) generate adequate income;
and (b) be competitive with other ports in the region.
AirPorts
1.05     Following the closure of Nicosia International Airport in 1974
Larnaca International Airport was developed rapidly as a replacement. Whilst
some improvements have been undertaken in accordance with a master plan pre-
pared in 1977, about 701 of the buildings are still temporary. Although air-
craft parking areas and the single 2,750 meter runway are adequate for the
foreseeable future and a parallel taxiway is under construction, other

facilities have not kept pace with the traffic increases and there are,
consequently, capacity problems. These capacity problems are likely to
increase as several large international carriers have proposed to transfer
their transit opera- tions from Beirut to Larnaca. The following table shows
the growth in air traffic.
Annual Z
1980    1981    1982    1983    1984     Growth

Source:  Department of Civil Aviation
Paphos airport about 150 kms to the west, which opened in late 1983, has
aircraft movement facilities built to international standards but passenger
handling takes place in modified warehouses. Although tne traffic is likely
to grow as tourism in the Paphos region increases, it is unlikely to take much
passenger traffic from Larnaca. Paphos has, nonetheless, attracted agricul-
tural and horticultural air freight from Larnaca as much of this traffic
originates in the Paphos hinterland.
1.06     Cyprus is served by about 30 international airlines operating
scheduled services. In 1983, the national carrier, Cyprus Airways Ltd.,
operated with a load factor of nearly 70X compared with the industry average
of about 62S.  Profits, after deducting depreciation and interest on loans,
amounted to CE4.8 million (US$8.4 million) representing 121 of revenue.
C. The Role of the Transport Sector
1.07    The transport sector contributes approximately 101 of Cyprus' Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and, at an annual rate of about 101 in constant terms,
is growing slightly faster than overall GDP in constant prices. Approximately
71 of the non-agricultural work-force is employed in the transport sector.
This figure rises to 11% if the estimated 7,000 transport related construction
industry workers are included.
1.08    The transport industry runs smoothly and provides adequate freight
and passenger services both domestically and in entrepot trade. Nonetheless,
some of the infrastructure has reached capacity point and requires upgrading
or replacement if serious problems are to be avoided. This applies to much of
the road system and to Larnaca International Airport. The land-side facilit-
ies at Limassol port will also start affecting port performance if suitable
equipment, proposed under the Second Port Project (Loan 1540-CY), is not pro-
cured and put into operation. This matter is currently under discussion with
Government and also being addressed during preparation of the Second Port
Project, Project Completion Report

D. Transport Planning Policy
1.09     The Planning Bureau, in association with the Ministry of Finance, is
responsible for overall economic planning and for the coordination of the
individual sectors. The 1982-86, Fourth Emergency Economic Action Plan repre-
sented a transition from the earlier remedial measures to deal with pressing
short-term needs, to the development of a longer-term strategy and this will
.be continued under the next Five Year Plan. However, there has been no inte-
grated approach to transport planning and planning has been more concerned
with setting broad targets and the evaluation of independent projects. One
exception to this has been the rural road improvement program, financed under
the Third Highway Project (Loan 2128-CY), which was based on a review of rural
development transport needs. It was recognized in the 1982-86 plan document
that a longer term planning framework was desirable for the transport sector,
as it was estimated to account for nearly 18% of total public development
expenditure and is critical to so many other sectors. Preparation of a
Transport Sector Master Plan will be included under the proposed project
(para. 3.08).
1.10     Major capital investment expenditure in the transport sector during
1981-85, is given in the following table.

1/ Estimates.
In a small country such as Cyprus, since addition or completion of one major
project will cause large changes in overall figures, trends are difficult to
define. There has been a general levelling off in expenditure since 1983 and
this is expected to be maintained at least for the period 1986-1988. In this
context the Government has shown:
(a)    a greater awareness of the need to devote adequate resources to
undertake cost effective maintenance; and



(b)    even where economic studies show that certain investments in
roads are highly justified these should be planned so as to
match the country's resources and absorptive capacity (para.
4.05 (b) and (c)).
Associated with this is the growing pressure for profit earning entities (e.g.
Cyprus Airways and CPA) to be more self reliant in financing their development
objectives. However, care should be taken not to run down the existing infra-
structure and equipment so much as to precipitate major problems (e.g. para.
1.08). The proposed project mainly through institutional measures involving
the PWD aims at achieving a suitable investment/maintenance balance in the
highway sector.
E. Organization and Regulation of Road Transport
1.11     Road transport in Cyprus is mostly in the hands of the private sector.
Trucks are operated mainly by individual owner operators but with a few com-
panies operating small fleets of up to ten vehicles.  A successful prefit mak-
ing private company operates about 130 buses in Nicosia and there are also two
relatively new but less successful government promoted bus companies in
Limassol and Paphos. One bus line operates between Nicosia, Limassol and
Paphos. A unique system of about 1,000 owner operated buses serve the out-
lying villages and are based in the villages they serve. Currently two
studies are underway, financed under the Third Highway Project Loan 2128-CY,
to examine the advantages of rationalizing rural bus services and to suggest
ways in which, if it is desirable, such rationalization should be imple-
mented. There are also eight-passenger taxis which ply between cities.
1.12     By comparison with elsewhere, Government regulation of road transport
is modest. The Department of Inland Transport (DIT) reviews requests for
changes in passenger fares and controls the number of bus and truck operating
licenses. However, the wrjmber of bus licenses, for all intents and purposes,
is fixed at about 3,000, and either remain within the operator's family or,
with the sanction of the DIT, are bought and sold privately. Requests for
changes in passenger fares must be accompanied by disclosure of costs by the
bus company and are first discussed in the transport committee of the DIT.
The Director General, DIT then makes a recommendation to the Price Commission
(within the Ministry of Commerce) which approves or rejects the increase.
Fare increases have taken place over the last five years roughly in line with
local inflation.
1.13    The transport industry is largely self regulating with nearly all
owner operators belonging to one of two unions or associations which, in addi-
tion to supporting their members' interests, perform cargo forwarding and
traffic management functions including port/land transport interface needs.
Representatives of these associations sit on a committee chaired by the
Director General of the DIT to discuss a wide range of transport matters.
While there would be a possibility that these associations might act as
cartels and, indeed, some informal allocation of routes exists, except for the
movement of grapes where prices are fixed by DIT, tariffs are traditionally



subject to bargaining. Hence although entry into the transport business is
controlled, competition is keen, prices are dictated by the market place and
the industry is responsive to customers' needs.
F. Previous Bank Experience in the Sector
1.14     The Bank has participated in five previous projects in the transport
sector. These were: First Highway Project (Loan 904-CY), Second Highway
Project (Loan 1344-CY), Third Highway project (Loan 2128-CY), which is ongoing
and is expected to be completed in December 1986; First Port Project (Loan
628-CY), and Second Port Project (Loan 1540-CY). The Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development (KFAED) participated in parallel co-financing in the
Second and Third Highway Projects and has indicated its firm intention to
co-finance the proposed project (para. 3.15). The First Highway Project was
amended to take account of the events of 1974 and, with the exception of part
of its studies component, was combined with the Second Highway Project which
included construction of the new Nicosia-Limassol road and studies which
assisted in the preparation of the Third Highway Project and Second Port
Project. A combined Project Completicn Report (PCR) has been prepared for the
First and Second Highway Projects, and a PCR for the Second Port Project is
under preparation. The Third Highway Project has as its main objectives the
improvement of about 200 km of rural roads, studies of road maintenance needs
and institutions, implementation of a road maintenance management system,
feasibility studies for improved road links between Nicosia and Larnaca,
Larnaca bypass and the Larnaca-Airport link, Limassol-Paphos road, traffic
management needs in Limassol and the rationalization of public passenger ser-
vices. Although contractual problems delayed the implementation of the Second
Highway Project, all the projects have met or are meeting both physical and
institutional objectives.
1.15     Not only have the physical achievements of the projects been
successful, they have also served as a basis for a continuing policy dialogue
and institution building. In particular the Government has:
(a)    recognized the advantages of undertaking rigorous technical and
economic evaluations of proposed projects. This is shown in the
routine application of feasibility studies to proposed highway
projects and recent expressions of intent to apply economic and
financial evaluation to ports and airport projects. This will
be developed under the proposed project by moving to the next
stage of integrating individual projects into an overall policy
orientated Transport Master Plan (paras. 1.09 and 3.08);
(b)    accepted the need to review road user charging policies and
included the implementation of appropriate legislation in the
proposed project (para. 5.02 (d));



-7-
(c)    been taking action to establish a sound revenue base for
financing maintenance and development through commercial
charging policies at ports and airports;
(d)    adopted a policy of working towards 4sistituting a pavement
management system that will not orly lead to lower highway
reconstruction costs but also inryrove the cost effectiveness of
maintenance and reduce transport costs. The proposed project
will support this through technical assistance and by financial
support of the maintenance and rehabilitation program; and
(e)    accepted the advantages of using International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) in procuring a wide range of goods and services
and has also adopted more effective procurement evaluation
procedures which reduced the earlier numbers of contractual
delays and difficulties. The proposed project will continue to
support these developments.
II. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Network
2.01     Cyprus has about 10,600 kms of roads, of wh -h about 6,000 kmsc are
bitumn surfaced (Ann-ex 2). Main routes and those caxrying high traffic
volumes, about 2,100 kms in all, are administered by PWD and are surfaced.
The remainder of the network is made up of district, forestry or municipal
roads, many of them gravel surfaced and carrying only small amounts of traffic.
The relatively high proportion of total road expenditure devoted to new con-
struction over recent years (para. 2.16), has been due to the need to reorien-
tate parts of the network after the de facLo division of the Island in 1974.
The Bank and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development have assisted in
this reorientation process with the construction of the Nicosia-Limassol road
and the Limassol bypass under the Second and Third Highway Frojects.. The
proposed project plans to continue with assistance for improvement of the
Larnaca-Nicosia road under the proposed project.
B. The Vehicle Fleet and Traffic
2.02     The motor vehicle fleet, excluding motorcycles, has been increasing
sat the rate of about 8% per annum over the past five years, and now amounts to
about 160,000 vehicles (211,000 including motor cycles and other types). There
is thus a high density of vehicles on the road network and, at about 4.8 per-
sons per car, the present level of vehicle ownership is significantly higher
than in other countries in the region, and is comparable to many countries in
western Europe. Details of the fleet are given in the table in Annex 3.



- 8 -
2.03     Overall, traffic flow is increasing at about the same rate as the
increase in the vehicle fleet. After allowing for the trend towards more ruel
efficient vehicles this rate is similar to the rate of increase in petrol and
diesel consumption (para. 2.17). On the northern section of the new Nicosia-
Limassol road, present traffic flows are almost twice those forecast in 1978
and traffic increases of 20 percent per annum or more are being recorded in
the Paphos area. Traffic congestion has become a serious problem in and
around the major towns. Traffic studies, completed under previous Bank high-
way projects, have permitted the design of some remedial measures which, in-
cluding the completion of the Limassol By-Pass, will ease the situation.
Studies on road safety and regional traffic control included in this project
(para. 3.02 (d)) will also lead to corrective measures being taken.
C. PWD Administration and Staff
2.04     Responsibility for the highway network is vested in the PWD for main
through routes, the District Administration (DA) in the Ministry of the
Interior for minor, district and village roads, the Forestry Department of the
Ministry of Agriculture for forest development and timber extraction roads,
a-d municipalities for local streets and roads entirely within municipal
areas. The lengths of the network administered by these authorities are shown
in Annex 2. As roads are widened and improved within the DA part of the net-
work, they are usually handed over to PWD for maintenance.
2.05     PWD headquarters (Annex 15) operates under a Director of Public Works
controlling a Roads and Airports Branch under a Chief Engineer, and a Build-
ings Branch under a Chief Architect. The Chief Engineer is responsible for
planning, design, construction and maintenance of roads, and has a number of
technical sections to assist in this task. Administratively, Cyprus is divid-
ed into the five Districts of Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos with head-
quarters at these towns, and Famagusta which has its headquarters at Larnaca.
Each District has a DistricL Engineer who controls all PWD operations within
the district. The District Engineer reports to the Director, although having
technical responsibility to the Chief Engineer for airport and highway work,
and to the Chief Architect for buildings.
2.06     Salaries and conditions for PWD supervisory and management staff
compare well with those in the private sector for s.milar posts, and for some
years there has been a very strict control on recruitment of extra staff into
the civil service.
D. Construction Industry
2.07     The Cyprus construction industry is large and well organized with
over 400 companies. These range from small companies, primarily concerned
with small structures and capable of undertaking contracts of up to CE50,000,
to large international companies capable of undertaking multi-million pound



- 9 -
complex civil works contracts. All companies are classified by the PWD
according to their capacity, experience and skills. The performance of local
contractors on Bank financed projects has generally been good. Rates and con-
tract prices are competitive and during appraisal considerable interest from
all sizes of firms was expressed in the proposed highway maintenance contracts.
E. Axle Loading
2.08     Vehicle overloading is common in Cyprus.  The problem was studied as
part of the First Highway Project and resulted in legislation on vehicle di-
mensions and axle load limits which was passed in 1982 and revised in 1984
(Annex 1). The legislation sets the maximum legal single axle load at 11
tonnes (equivalent to about 3.8 standard axles) and 18 tonnes for tandem axles
(equivalent to about 2.5 standard axles)I'.  In practice, it is not uncommon
to find axle loadings which produce about 14 standard axles per truck, and ex-
ceptional cases of between 20 and 30 standard axles per truck have been ob-
served. Government is now operating a permanent weighing station on the
Nicosia-Limassol Road in an effort to control overloading, and the first cases
for infringement of axle load regulations have been brouvht before the Courts.
Works are now being undertaken to permit operation of this weighing station 24
hours a day and 365 days a year to prevent truckers waiting until it is not
operating. Random axle load surveys of all types of truck suggest that the
average number of standard axles per truck may be in the region of four,
rather than about 2.5 as measured at the weighing station. The effect of this
overloading is such that the Nicosia-Dhali Junction section of the Nicosia-
Limassol Road, which was designed for 11 million standard axles over an eight
year period, may now be carrying up to 5 or 6 million standard axles annually
on parts of the slow lane, and signs of failure are starting to show.
2.09     All pavement design carried o-ut during the project will take accoxnt
of the actual axle load spectrum. At negotiations Government agreement was
obtained to institute and maintain an effective axle load control system
ii±cluding two permanent weighbridges serving the Nicosia-Limassol Highway and
the use of portable electronic weighbridges by December 31, 19872' and .
permanent weighbridge on the new Larnaca-Nicosia road by December 31, 1989 as
part of the civil works contract (para. 5.02 (a)).
1/  A "standard axle" is a common unit of weight of 8.2 tons that was used in
pioneering experiments to assess, inter alia, the damaging effect of
vehicles on highway pavements and, subsequently, has been used in highway
pavement design calculations: a highway pavement is designed to withstand
a certain number of repetitions of a "standard axle".  Increases in weight
beyond 8.2 tons have a damaging effect to the feurth power thus an 11 ton
single axle is equivalent 3.8 standard axles and a 20 ton single axle is
equivalent to about 35 standard axles.
2/ To be financed under the Third Highway Project.

F. Engineering
2.10     Within the PWD the Design Office under the Chief Executive Engineer
carries out survey and design work for small and medium sized road construc-
tion or improvement projects. Consultants are employed for large construction
projects such as the Nicosia-Limassol road and the Limassol By-Pass. The
Design Office staff appears competent. Some survey equipment is held in
District Engineers' offices, and minor design is done by District staff. The
central PWD materials laboratory has a reasonable range of equipment in gen-
erally good condition, but the premises of the laboratory are cramped and in-
convenient for the movement of samples. Furthermore, being situated within
the PWD headquarters buildings, the noise and dust pollution of a major test-
ing program adversely affects surrounding activities. There are plans for the
eventual resiting of the laboratory, District engineers have small materials
testing laboratories for quality control on works, and both these and the
headquarters laboratory appear to be adequately staffed and competently
operated within their limitations. Details of existing survey, design and
materials testing equipment are held in the Project File (Annex 1).
G. Construction
2.11     Small improvements and construction works are carried out by District
engineers by force account. Major road construction work is done by contrac-
tors, supervised either by District engineers' staff or by PND headquarters
through a special supervision team. Bituminous material for about 30 kms of
road overlays per annum is supplied and transported to site by contractors,
but laid by FWD. The proposed project seeks to investigate the advantages of
the increased use of contractors in all these activities.
2.12     With the exception of those who have been engaged on supervision of
major contract construction, PWD staff have little experience in the super-
vision and control of contractors, and are not always familiar with the use of
contract documents and specifications. This lack of experience needs to be
taken into account in the planning for greater use of contractors, and full
advantage must be taken of the experience gained by those PWD staff who have
worked on contract supervision. The employment of consultants to provide
technical assistance to PWD in supervising highway works especially the
Tarnaca-Nicosia road, was discussed and agreement obtained with Government at
negotiations (para. 5.02 (b)).
H. Maintenance
2.13     The project will provide for a special three man headquarters
maintenance unit and the appointment of a senior highway maintenance techni-
cian to each District in accordance with the consultants' recommendations
received during the Third Highway Project. These appointements (with job
descriptions) are considered vital if the proposed pavement management system,
increased maintenance funding and quality of operations are to be combined



- 11 -
into an effective system. The allocation for road maintenance in the annual
budget increased from CE387,000 (US$677,000) in 1979 to CE839,000 (US$1.46
million) in 1980 and the allocation has grown by about 100l in real terms
between 1980 and 1985. In 1980 and 1981. a pavement survey was carried out
and based partly on this a draft Five-Year (1982-1986) Road Maintenance Plan
was produced (Annex 1). The Plan aimed to tackle the routine and periodic
maintenance and backlog of deferred road maintenance. The proposed increase
in road maintenance funding was ambitious at the time and allocations have
fallen behind Plan estimates, as shown by the following table, and it has not
been possible to achieve the Plan objectives. Furthermore, there are a number
of weaknesses in technical capability of specifying and carrying out mainte-
nance works which has led to less than effective use of funds. Although some
of this may be due to inadequate equipment for force account works, the level
of equipment maintenance and management is good. Correction of these defi-
ciencies is a major objective of the ongoing Phase II Maintenance Management
System (para. 3.07).

2.14     The Government has taken steps to ensure adequate budget allocations.
With improved road maintenance as its principal institutional objective, the
proposed Fourth Project will assist with the long term planning and technical
improvement of road maintenance. During negotiations Government agreement was
obtained, that upon completion of Phase II of the Highway Maintenance
Management System, by March 31, 1988, the recommendations therin shall be
agreed with the Bank and be used to form the basis of annual physical and
financial maintenance programs (para. 5.02 (c)).
I. Planning
2.15     Cyprus has a small area and population, and most engineers and
planning officials have an intimate personal knowledge of problems and needs.
However, planning in the Cyprus transport sector has, been characterized by
project selection rather than medium-term integrated planning. The proposed
project is comprehensive, covering most highway needs for 1986-90, and thus
provides a framework for a highway plan which will be progressively developed



- 12 -
and extended during project implementation through the preparation of the
transport sector master plan (para. 3.08) and the joint Government Bank annual
review process (para. 3.04). About 75Z of the proposed highway construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance components during the project period has been
subjected to economic evaluation and found to be economically justified. The
remaining 25Z consists of roads in refugee housing areas, self-financing hous-
ing estates, industrial estates and small municipalities for which municipal
authorities and improvement boards contributed funds. These works will pro-
bably tail off during the next few years as the demographic situation stabi-
lizes but the introduction of simplified evaluation techniques will be
addressed during the proposed project. The proposed Transport Sector Master
Plan will provide a rational framework for the evaluation of future proposals.
J. Financing
2.16     Funds for highway.construction and major improvements are allocated
annually from the Capital Development Budget and those for highway maintenance
and minor improvements are allocated annually from the Recurrent Budget.
Highway expenditures which are given in greater detail in the Project File
(Annex 1) are set out in the following table:

The Bank's assistance in the highway sector in Cyprus has aimed at reaching a
compromise between Government's needs for budgeting adjustments to match over-
all economic policy and undertaking construction projects in the most effi-
cient way (i.e. not spreading them over too long a period) and not using road
maintenance allocations as a budget adjusting mechanism. This policy thrust
will be continued in the proposed project.
2.17     Revenue from road user charges is not specifically earmarked for
highway purposes but goes into the general revenue. However, these revenues
are more than adequate to cover highway maintenance expenditures and, indeed,
also fully cover capital investment.  Nevertheless, the Government has decided
to take steps to ensure a more equitable distribution of road user charges and
under the proposed project the Transport Master Plan Study would include a



- 13 -
review of road user charges. Government agreement was obtained at
negotiations to furnish to the Bank for review and comment its proposed
measures for the restructuring of its road user charges system by March 31,
1988, and put these measures into effect not later than December 31, 1988
(para. 5.02 (d)).

Although diesel is no longer subsidized neither is it taxed and the entire
burden of fuel tax falls upon petrol engined vehicles. However, it is unlike-
ly that this has led, except in the case of taxis, to an exceptional trend
towards diesel trucks and buses, if only because it has been rather difficult
for many years now to obtain petrol engined buses and trucks. An examination
of vehicle licensing fees (Annex 4) shows that for equivalent sized vehicles
the annual license fee for the diesel version is nearly 43S greater. The com-
plex licensing system is reasonably equitable in terms of damaging effect of



- 14 -
vehicles but when petrol tax is taken into account a large diesel truck will
pay CE50G (US$875) p.a. and CE850 (US$1.487) for the initial registration fee
compared with the average private cars annual licence fee plus petrol tax of
CE143 (US$250) and a registration fee of CE140 (US$245).
K. Road SafetY
2.18                The fatal accident rate (comparing vehicle ownership rates
with accidents) in Cyprus is nearly three times that of the United Kingdom.
The injury rate is also high - even so research indicates that up to 30X of
accidents involving children and young cyclists are not reported. Damage only
accidents do not have to be reported to the police, but studies in selected
areas have been used to establish coefficients, relating injury accidents to
damage only accidents and these coefficients are then used in accident
estimation. Hence, official accident statistics are likely to under-report
the road accident situation. The following table gives official statistics
for injury accidents in Cyprus.

The figures show that road accidents are increasing at a similar rate to
vehicle traffic and research indicates that this trend will continue in the
absence of major road improvements. Studies which formed part of the Larnaca-
Nicosia road feasibility study examined the problem and have evaluated its
very significant cost to the economy (Annex 1, Bl). The proposed project in-
cludes a component to further study road safety and to make and implement
recomnendations to tackle the more serious problems (paras. 3.01(d), 3.02(d),
3.03(d) and Annex 9).
L. Training
2.19     The Government has indicated that it is in a position to conduct most
of its own training activities and will not require special Bank assistance in
doing this. Nonetheless, some specialist skills especially concerning civil
works supervision, operation of pavement management systems, and road mainte-
nance techniques are still lacking and during the course of implementation of
the proposed project, it may be necessary to emp'oy some of the technical
assistance funds for on the job training or for local training courses in
these areas.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives
3.01     The overall objective of the proposed project is the continued
development of a highway system integrated with the total transport sector
which will support the achievement of Government's economic objectives. In
doing this there are four sub-objectives:
(a)    the establishment of a planning and policy framework and
methodology for the transport sector;
(b)    the introduction of a sustainable and cost effective pavement
management and highway maintenance system;
(c)    the upgrading of priority low strength and low capacity high-
ways; and
(d)    undertaking a highway safety program.
B. Project Description
3.02     In order to achieve these objectives the proposed project comprises:
(a)    rehabilitation and strengthening of a four year time slice of
substandard pavements;
(b)    highway improvement schemes including the Larnaca-Nicosia road
the Larnaca-Kophinou road and the Rural Road program;
(c)    a four year time slice of an improved routine and periodic
maintenance program including procurement of some paving equip-
ment and materials; and
(d)    provision of consultancy services, to undertake highway and
transport sector planning studies, including preparation of a
transport master plan a review of road user charges, a study of
regional traffic control, studying and implementing road safety
measures, and providing assistance for carrying out special
studies and providing advice during implementation of highway
construction and maintenance work.
This work is planned to be completed by June 30, 1992. Government agreed
these objectives at negotiations (para. 5.02 (e)).
3.03     The proposed Bank loan would finance all the foreign exchange content
during 1986-90 of:



- 16 -
(a)    rehabilitation and strengthening of substandard pavements;
(b)    rural road improvements;
(c)    periodic maintenance;
(d)    highway maintenance equipment;
(e)    highway safety and traffic equipment and materials; and
(f)    studies and technical assistance, including preparation of a
transport sector master plan, highway safety, regional traffic
control, assistance in pavement management implementation and
general technical assistance.
Road Rehabilitation and Strengthening
3.04     Recent studies1' of the PWD administered road network indicated
that over 40% of the system requires either rehabilitation or strengthening in
order to correct failures or to be brought to a maintainable standard. The
first year of this time slice rehabilitation program (1986-87) has been iden-
tified and prepared according to a methodology acceptable to the Bank and is
given at Annex 5 together with the results of economic Analysis. This and
subsequent year's programs (1987-90) included in the proposed project will be
prepared annually and submitted to the Bank for review by June 30, of each
year (para. 3.23). Agreement on this arrangement was obtained at negotia-
tions (para. 5.02 (f)).
Highway Improvement Schemes and Rural Road Improvements
3.0'5    The proposed improvement to the main road linking Nicosia with
Larnaca, is based on a major feasibility study completed under the Third
Highway Project. The new Nicosia-Larnaca road will be built to a four-lane
standard. The design of this road has taken account of the lessons learned on
the Nicosia-Limassol road concerning traffic volumes and axle loadings
(para. 2.08).
3.06     The ongoing Third Highway Project has, as its main thrust, the
improvement of priority rural roads. The project is proceeding satisfactorily
but it is clear that the original target figure of 200 km will be insufficient
to match the potential development of the rural economy. As a result it is
proposed that when the current program is completed towards the end of 1987
additional areas should be given improved access amounting to about 100 km of
rural roads and these latter improvements are included under the proposed
project. Annual programs will be prepared and evaluated according to methods
and criteria acceptable to the Bank and will be agreed by the Bank (para.
5.02 (f)).

Routine and Periodic Road Maintenance
3.07     Annex 6 shows the estimated annual total road maintenance costs and
actions required for a ten year program designed to restore the PWD network in
Cyprus to good condition. Although this table must be revised in the light of
road condition surveys and the Phase II maintenance management system to be
completed in March 1988, it is nevertheless sufficient to give order of magni-
tude estimates for the work required. A first year's program of periodic
maintenance has been identified and prepared and is given at Annex 7.
Consultants Services
3.08     The project seeks to address a range of needs.  Whilst the PWD has an
adequate competency in most day to day engineering skills it presently lacks
the numbers and specialities of personnel capable of providing a modern self-
sustaining highway planning and maintenance management system. Adequate sup-
port given at this critical time, will increase the capacity in highway plann-
ing and implementation so that it will be sufficient to undertake the range of
planning and management duties required. Thus about 130 man-months of con-
sultant services are proposed under the project to provide the necessary sup-
port, particularly in the following areas:
(a)    the provision of specialist services to advise on matters
including supervision of construction, the use of local
materials in pavement design, the design of pavement strengthen-
ing overlays, highway maintenance by contract and techniques of
h highway maintenance;
(b)    preparation of a Transport Sector Master Plan which will also
include a review of road user charges and sector financing;
(c)    the study and implementation of highway safety measures; and
(d)    the study of regional traffic control and data collection.
Supporting highway safety and traffic control equipment to be provided under
the proposed project will include:
(a)    portable electronic weigh bridges;
(b)    permanent weigh stations;
(c)    experimental crash barriers;
(d)    sign making equipment; and
(e)    traffic engineering survey equipment.
The terms of reference governing consultancy services, are given in Annex 9
and were discussed and agreed at negotiations (para. 5.02 (b)).



- 18 -
C. Engineering
3.09     The highway maintenance and rehabilitation program has been developed
by PWD with the assistance of the consultants MVA Consultancy, U.K, employed
under the Third Highway Project and is satisfactory (see Project File).
3.10     The road connection between Larnaca and the new Nicosia-Limassol
highway has been studied and designed by consultants (Hughes Economic Planning
and Upton and McGougan, U.K.) employed under the Third Highway Project accord-
ing to internationally accepted engineering standards and evaluation methodol-
ogies and using sound design criteria (see para. 3.05 and Annex 9). Rehabili-
tation and strengthening works have been designed by PWD staff using methodol-
ogies established and used under the Second and Third Highway Projects.
Detailed engineering and contract documents will have been completed for all
major engineering components by March 1986 and the first year's programs
(1986-87) for rehabilitation, strengthening and periodic maintenance have been
prepared with the resources of PWD.
D. Cost Estimates and Financing
Project Cost Estimates
3.11     The project base cost, excluding routine maintenance, has been
estimated at US$52.02 million of which US$25.18 million is foreign exchange;
physical and price contingencies raise these estimates to US$68.90 million and
US$33.35 million respectively giving an average foreign exchange component of
48g.
3.12     Projert cost estimates are based on October 1985 price levels and are
shown in Table 3.1 and details are in Annex 10. Construction cost estimates
are based on quantities from the final engineering design, and on unit rates
derived from current construction contracts and from cost factor inputs as far
as maintenance works are concerned.
3.13     The foreign exchange component of road construction, improvement and
rehabilitation is estimated to be about 45Z if executed by a local or locally
based contractor and 45X has been adopted for estimating the foreign exchange
component considering on past experience that contracts are likely to be won
by local or locally-mobilized contractors. The foreign exchange component for
the periodic maintenance works is estimated to be 552 since imported bitumen
accounts for a proportionally higher share of the construction cost. Con-
tracts for small stretches of road spread all over the country are most likely
to be awarded to local contractors.
3.14     Government confirmation of cost estimates was obtained at negoti-
ations (para. 5.01 (a)).

Financing
3.15     The Borrower would be the Republic of Cyprus. The proposed Bank loan
of US$20.0 million would finance about 60X of the foreign exchange component,
or about 29S of the total cost. The balance of about US$14 million or 41S of
the foreign exchange component would be financed by the Government and co-
financing. The KFAED has indicated that it would provide finance for sepa-
rate, economically justified project components. The signature of the KFAED
loan is as a condition of the effectiveness of the Bank loan (para. 5.03 (a)).
The consultancy services will be financed jointly by the Government and the
Bank. Routine maintenance will be financed 100% by the Government. Govern-
ment confirmed at negotiations that it would provide all local currency needs
and all remaining foreign exchange financing necessary to complete the project
(para. 5.01 (b)). The proposed financing program is shown in the following

E. Procurement
Bank Financed Components
3.16     Works contracts for road improvement, rehabilitation and strengthening
would be awarded after International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. The works would be geographically grouped in lots
to make the contracts attractive to larger contractors, and contractors would
be prequalified to undertake either single or several lots.
3.17     The periodic maintenance civil works and bituminous material supply
contracts, are small, scattered throughout the country, and would be most
efficiently procured by local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank.
3.18     Highway maintenance equipment and highway safety and traffic equipment
and materials will be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. However, smaller items of specialist
equipment, up to a maximum of US$500,000 in total, may be procured through
procedures acceptable to the Bank on the basis of evaluation and comparison of
quotations from at least three qualified suppliers eligible under the
Guidelines.
3.19     Technical assistance for the various project items would be provided
by qualified consulting firms or individuals as appropriate, engaged in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.
3.20     All procurement documentation will be reviewed by the Bank before
being issued. However. for periodic maintenance works, this will be confined
to a review of standard bidding documents and of the procurement programs.
Prior to contract award, and with the exception of those for periodic mainte-
nance works, all proposed contracts together with the bidding analysis will be
subject to Bank review. Periodic maintenance works contracts will be subject
to post review. Prior review of contracts will cover about 757 of the total
value of works financed under the project. During negotiations Government
agreed to these procurement arrangements (para. 5.02 (g)). The following
table gives a breakdown of the proposed project by procurement method.

Non Bank-Financed Components
3.21     Civil works contracts for improvement of the Larnaca-Nicosia Road
would be procured under procedures utilizing ICB in accordance with the
co-financing agency's regulations. Routine maintenance totalling US$4 million
will be carried out by force accoun: initially but gradually may be taken over
by local contracting firms. At negotiations Government confirmed that
adequate funds would be budgeted for routine maintenance needs.
E. Project Implementation
3.22     The special project coordinating unit set up in PWD headquarters to
manage the Third Highway Project implementation will be continued under the
proposed project and will submit quarterly progress reports starting with
December 31, 1986, and containing the information described at Annex 14.
Designation of the senior coordinator is a condition of loan effectiveness.
Agreement on this was obtained at negotiations (para. 5.03 (b)). The project
is expected to be effective in September 1986 and execution of the Bank's



- 23 -
financed components would be completed by mid-1992, a total of about 6 years.
The loan closing date is scheduled for March 31, 1993, seven years from Board
presentation.
3.23     The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 10.  In the
case of the Larnaca-Nicosia Road construction, final engineering, preparation
of tender documents, and acquisition of right-of-way are well advanced, and
contracts could be awarded somewhat ahead of the schedule shown, but a start
in March 1987 is used for planning purposes. A total construction time of 63
months has be-n allowed for completion by mid 1992, which is a conservative
estimate, compared with the contractual time usually allowed for this volume
of road works. PWD will be responsible for construction supervision assisted
by consultants.
3.24     The highway maintenance and rehabilitation program annual plans of
operations will be submitted to the Bank by June 30 each year. The Bank's
comments will then be taken into account by the Government in determining both
capital and recurrent budgets to be allocated to various items for the sub-
sequent year. This was agreed at negotiations (para. 5.02 (b)). Once the
budget provisions have been decided by the Government, the detailed program of
periodic maintenance and strengthening rehabilitation works can be imple-
mented. The project covers four such annual cycles for periodic maintenance
comiencing in 1986, and three annual cycles for strengthening-rehabilitation
cofmhencing in 1987. It is proposed eventually to carry out most of the peri-
odic maintenance and rehabilitation by contract, with PWD continuing to be
responsible for routine maintenance and pavement repairs in preparation for
resealing and overlays done by contract. There is a well developed construc-
tion industry in Cyprus which has spare capacity at present, and their prices
are competitive. The workload left with PWD approximates to their present
capacity after allowing for the additional planning and supervision they will
be required to undertake for the contract maintenance proposed (Annex 6 paras.
3.04 - 3.06 & 3.13). However, PWD should retain a capability to undertake
some works and it is recommended to permit this through the procurement of
some equipment and bituminous materials. Confirmation of this list of
equipment (Annex 6) was obtained at negotiations (para. 5.01 (c)).
3.25     The two maifi studies, consisting of a transport master plan and a
regional traffic control study, are expected to be completed within the first
two years of the project. Technical assistance for construction supervision
and special studies (Annex 9) are spread over the whole implementation period
of the project.
3.26     During negotiations, the project implementation, organization,
schedule and action plan (Annex 11) were discussed and confirmed by Government
(para. 5.01 (c)).
G. Disbursements
3.27     Disbursements will be made on the basis of:  the estimated foreign
exchange component for the 1987-1989 road rehabilitation and strengthening



- 24 -
programs (451 of total expenditures), the periodic maintenance program (55X of
total expenditures), the estimated foreign exchange component of highway
maintenance equipment and highway safety and traffic equipment and materials
(95% of total expenditure) and the consultants services (75X of total expendi-
tures).
3.28     The disbursement schedule (Annex 12) has been developed from the
general implementation schedule (Annex 10). In addition to the undertaking
provided in connection with the project, the high priority accorded by the
Government to the construction of the new Larnaca-Nicosia road and to the
implementation of an improved maintenance programme, as well as a better
understanding of Bank's procurement guidelines by MCW staff, should ensure
that the project will be implemented according to the agreed schedule. Other
favorable factors, include: (i) the realistic estimates of construction time
of the Larnaca-Nicosia road; (ii) the time slice nature of the maintenance
programe (four one-year cycles), including monitoring by means of the submis-
sion and execution of annual programs; and (iii) the fact that a minimum time
of nine months has been allowed from physical completion to total disbursement.
3.29     The forecast schedule of complete disbursement within seven years has
been compared with historic experience. An examination of other Bank financed
highway projects in Cyprus confirms that these projects have disbursed gen-
erally more quickly than indicated by the regional profile with 902 disburse-
ment after seven years. The First and Second Highway Projects were fully dis-
bursed in seven years, including the 1974 events for the former, and a change
in the project design and the bankruptcy of the main contractor for the latter.
The ongoing Third Highway Project, although of a different nature (three
tranches of rural road improvements), has experienced a slow start-up but is
now likely to catch up with the initial estimates and may be fully disbursed
in less than seven years. The estimated disbursement schedule of seven years
for the proposed project is, therefore, considered to be a realistic forecast
(see table in Annex 12).
3.30     The proceeds of the Bank loan will be channelled through a special
account to be established by the Government at the Central Bank of Cyprus on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The initial sum deposited into
the special account by the Bank will be US$1,200,000, approximating to an
estimated four months disbursements. Government agreement on this was obtained
at negotiations (para. 5.02 (j)). Statements of expenditure would be used for
contracts valued at US$100,000 or less.
H. Accounting and Audit
3.31     The system of accounting, financial control and audit is well
established and competently operated in Cyprus (Annex 13). The Accountant
General is responsible for the management and supervision of all accounting
operations in Government, and for the receipt and disbursement of revenues,
and he has appropriate powers to delegate his powers and duties. The Auditor
General is entirely independent of Government and outside the civil service,
reporting only to the President. The accounting and audit procedures have
been reviewed and they are acceptable to the Bank for the purposes of keeping



- 25 -
and auditing project accounts. Assurances were obtained from Government
during negotiations that separate accounts will be kept for all project com-
ponents, and the form of statements for accounts and audit requirements there-
on were discussed and agreed. In addition an annual statement of project ex-
penditures, duly audited, will be furnished to the Bank not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 5.02 (k)).
I. Environmental Impact
3.32     The project should lead to environmental improvements, especially in
diverting traffic away from the villages between Larnaca and Nicosia and to
some extent away from the crowded and congested center of Larnaca. However,
Cyprus has a sensitive ecological system and this is under considerable pres-
sure from the permanent population and the large tourist industry. The Bank,
therefore, has suggested that all project and subcomponen. preparation pays
careful attention to the environmental impact of road construction and
improvement and environmental impact analysis will be included as appropriate
in terms of reference related to Bank financed components.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Economic Background
4.01     Cyprus' adjustment to the events of 1974 has been impressive with an
average growth in GDP of about 4.5% and unemployment limited to 3.3S but this
has been associated in recent years with a deterioration in some economic in-
dicators. Among these are a 9.1S increase in the annual budget deficit during
the past three years and the growth in total long term public debt which in
1984 reached 41.9% of GDP. Total foreign debt amounts to about US$911 million
and the foreign debt service ratio is about 10.8Z of the exports of goods and
services.
4.02     The Government recognizes that efforts must be made to address the
critical areas of the large budget deficit and the high level of imports if
the overall economic health of the country is to be improved. During prepara-
tion and appraisal this need has been considered in the design of the proposed
project. Road user revenues are adequate but may be rationalized, and a
tightening of the road development program to eliminate non-economic expendi-
tures and projects which are essentially generators of benefits only in the
long term has been a primary concern. Nonetheless, in the absence of a com-
prehensive transport sector master plan, coordinated with the country's
economic condition and needs, there are limitations on overall ability to
design a well balanced sector strategy. The project gives priority to devel-
oping such a strategy through the preparation of a Transport Sector .Flaster
Plan.



- 26 -
4.03     The average annual development expenditure in the highway sector
proposed under the four-year project is more than 20X less than actual expen-
diture during the previous four years despite rising prices. For example, the
program of improvements on the Larnaca-Kophinou road is proposed in such a way
as to permit works to be delayed if macro economic conditions require this.
The only area where the project proposes an increase in expenditure with Bank
funding (supported by an increase in efficiency) is in road rehabilitation,
strengthening, periodic and routine maintenance and clearly this is due to the
need to carry out these works if private sector transport costs and Government
expenditure on highway reconstruction are to be kept within acceptable bounds.
The program of works as described in the prceosed project is both well
balanced and addresses three most important objectives, the development of a
coherent sectorial planning framework, the improvement of a high priority road
link which is directly associated with the foreign currency earning tourism
industry, and the reversal of the deterioration of the highway network which
otherwise would lead to major transport cost increases and transport
bottlenecks.
B. Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.04     Major benefits lie in the institutional developments that will lead
to a balanced and self sustaining system of pavement management and a medium
term planning framework for the sector that will relate sectorial expenditures
to the country's resources and economic and social needs. The major benefici-
aries will be:
(a)    the Government due to:
(i)    greater control over the need for major highway rehabilita-
tion and reconstruction as a result of pavement strengthen-
ing and more cost effective routine and periodic
maintenance;
(ii)    reduced highway pavement damage due to controlling over-
loaded vehicles on weak pavements; and
(iii)    the provision of an integrated transport sector planning
framework tailored to meeting priority economic and social
needs within resource constraints and macro-economic
objectives;
(b)    the agricultural sector following improved access to agricul-
tural areas served by the rural roads program; and
(c)    the population at large owing to lower travel costs and enhanced
road safety.



- 27 -
The overall economic rate of return from the project's construction and
periodic maintenance components is estimated at 44%, excluding road accident
savings. The rate of return on the routine maintenance component has not been
calculated but probably exceeds 100 based on experience derived from other
studies.
C. The Proposed Civil Works Construction Program
4.05     The detailed economic and engineering feasibility studies relating to
the proposed major civil engineering works on the Larnaca-Nicosia road, com-
prising about 442 of the project cost, are provided in the Project File
(Annex 1, Bl). In summary the construction program's evaluation is as follows:
(a)    Larnaca-Nicosia Road.  The existing 28.3 km road is a
seven-meter wide highway with only fair vertical and horizontal
geometry. It passes through several villages and several kilo-
meters run through built-up areas of Larnaca. The road provides
a link with the capital and the country's third largest town, a
major agricultiural and tourist area, the country's second port
and Larnaca International Airport. From the points of view of
structural adequacy, traffic congestion, safety and the environ-
ment, the road is inadequate. Consequently, following the study
of several alternatives, it has been proposed to construct a
24.5 km four-lane road with limited access at an estimated cost
of about US$23.85 million. Present traffic flows range from
10,900 vpd at the Nicosia end of the road to 13,900 vpd at the
Larnaca end of the road. Through traffic is about 8,000 vpd,
and heavy vehicles comprise about 20S of the total traffic. The
estimated rate of return, assuming construction starting in late
1986 and lasting about 3-1/2 years, is nearly 50Z including
savings from reducea road accidents, and 41% excluding road
accident savings.
(b)    Larnaca-Kophinou Road.  Preliminary calculations indicate the
localized improvements on the Larnaca-Kophinou road yield rates
of return in excess of 402. However, the improvements will be
spread over four years (1986-90) and each year's proposed pro-
gram will be reviewed by the Bank and the PWD during the project
annual review (paras. 3.28, 5.02(f)).
(c)    Rural Road Improvement.  It is expected that development of
agriculture in Cyprus will continue to assume priority as a
major thrust of the economy. Therefore, the proposed project
will include the development and improvement of about 100 km of
the rural road network and, similarly to the ongoing Third High-
way Project, the investment program will be prepared on an
annual basis according to criteria agreed under the Third High-
way Project and agreed by the Bank and be expected to yield a
rate of return of at least 122.



- 28 -
D. Rehabilitation and Maintenance
Rehabilitation. Strengthening and Periodic Maintenance
4.06     These activities will be planned on an annual basis.  The first
year's program has been identified and all subcomponents meet the minimum
requirement of a rate of return in excess of 102. In fact the first year's
rehabilitation and strengthening program yields rates of return ranging be-
tween 16S and 70S with a mean of 26% (Annexes 6 and 8). The average rate of
return on the first year periodic maintenance programme exceeds 702 (see
Annex 1). Government confirmation was obtained at negotiations that subse-
quent years' programs will be evaluated and planned according to criteria and
methodology agreed with the Bank under the Third Highway Project (para.
5.01 (e)).
E. Project Risk
4.07     The proposed project should not be prone to any unusual risks.  A
large part of the project is in the form of time slice financing of a program
of highway rehabilitation, strengthening and periodic and routine maintenance.
Technically none of the components are difficult and adequate supervision will
be available. All reasonable problems have been taken into account in the
risk analysis (Annex 1, No.Bl). The proposed project remains economically
viable, tested against:
(a)    a 20X increase in costs; and
(b)    a 33S time delay in project completion.
The cost increase would lead to about a 13X reduction in the ER for the major
components. The delay in project completion (apart from benefits being fore-
gone) would lead to increased benefits in the opening year, due to continued
traffic growth, which would more than compensate for the small rise in con-
struction cost.
V. RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During loan negotiations the Government confirmed:
(a)    the four year project cost estimates (para. 3.1L);
(b)    the Financing Program and the Government's commitment to provide

the Bank: the Bank's comments will be taken into account by the
Government in determining both capital and recurrent budgets to
be allocated to various items for the subsequent year (para.
3.04, 3.06, 3.24, 4.05, and 4.06);
(g)    methods of procurement (paras. 3.16 to 3.21);
(h)    the special project coordinating unit set up under the Third
Highway Project in the PWD headquarters will submit quarterly
progress reports starting with December 31, 1986, in a format
agreed with the Bank (para. 3.22 and Annex 14);



- 30 -
(i)    to establish a special account of US$1,200,000 in the Central
Bank of Cyprus on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank
(para. 3.30); and
(j)    to provide an annual statement of project expenditures, duly
audited according to Bank Guidelines for Financial Reporting and
Auditing, not later than six months after the end of each fiscal
year starting with the year ending December 31, 1986
(para. 3.31).
(k)    that subsequent years' rehabilitation, strengthening and
periodic maintenance programs will be evaluated and planned
according to criteria and methodology agreed with the Bank under
the Third Highway Project (para. 4.06).
5.03     The proposed Bank loan would only become effective upon both:
(a)    signature of the KFAED loan agreement (para. 3.15); and
(b)    appointment of the senior project coordinator (para. 3.22).
5.04     Subject to agreement on the above, the project would be suitable for
a Bank loan of US$20.00 million equivalent to the Republic of Cyprus for a 15
year term including a three year grace period.

ANNEX 6
CYPRUS
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Maintenance of the Highway Network
1.       Cyprus has been fortunate in having an adequate road network
established for many years so that conditions under the pavement have
stabilized as regards consolidation and subgrade moisture contents. This
process has been aided by generally sound subgrade soils and a climate
which is kind to road pavements: there is little severe freezing and thaw-
ing, and rains are confined to about four months of the year. There is
thus little possibility of prolonged saturation of soils. Having said
this, there are area with problem soils, subsoil drainage difficulties or
highly unstable sections liable to landslides and slippage, but these are
the exception rather than a general condition. Much of the present system
was first opened up during the last century as unsurfaced roads and tracks,
which were gradually provided with improved surfaces, leading to eventual
bituminous surfacing by either penetration macadam or surface dressing.
2.       Until 1974, adequate supplies of good road building stone were to
be had from areas now closed to Government. The stone that now, perforce,
is used is less good and very variable in quality, requiring careful and
expert selection at the quarry to avoid weathered, substandard material.
Subbase material that easily meets minimum specifications is usually avail-
able within some ten kilometers of the work site, and over much of Cyprus,
subgrade CBR's well in excess of 10 are easily achieved. Apart from small
quantities imported for special purposes, bitumen comes from the refinery
at Larnaca. Quality is said to be unreliable, although this is difficult
to check, since PWD do not have equipment for full testing of bitumen.
3.       Road maintenance, along with most road improvement work, is
carried out by District Engineers on a Force Account (direct labor) basis.
The principal exception to this is that bituminous overlays, although laid
throughout Cyprus by the District Engineer, Nicosia, use material supplied
and transported by private contractors. Before 1974, PWD ran their own
store quarries in the North of the island, and had modern asphalt mixing
plant which was lost when the area was overrun, and the temporary arrange-
ment then set up for contractors to supply premix material has continued.
Contractors' mixing plan visited by the mission was modern and efficiently
run. With present demand of about 15,000 tons a year from PWD, this system
seems to work quite well, since there is at present an overall surplus of
mixing plant in Cyprus. An analysis of input costs shows that premix sold
to PWD at an average cost delivered to site of CE 14.50 per ton in 1985,
would cost about CE 12.50 per ton to produce and transport. This repre-
sents a profit margin of 16X, which cannot be considered excessive.  The
situation may change, however, if the demand for premix material r:ses
sufficiently to take up most of the capacity of the established mixing



- 41 -
plants. An oligopoly is then liable to develop, and it would be desirable
for PWD to have at least the opportunity to acquire an asphalt mixing capa-
city of its own in order to keep some control on prices. So far as laying
is concerned, PWD has three pavers, the newest of which is sixteen years
old. PWD should retain its capacity to lay premix material, and at least
one new paver is necessary, with supporting equipment, for them to do this.
However, an increase in the annual amount of premix overlays would warrant
using contractors for both supply of material and laying, and this prin-
ciple should be agreed with Government.
4.       There is a well developed contracting industry in Cyprus, with
several firms fully up to international contracting standards. The Federa-
tion of Cyprus Building and Civil Engineering Contractors has about 300
members in Nicosia, and branches in Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos have per-
haps a hundred members each. About 60Z of members are builders only, with
a work capacity of less than US$500,000 a year, and at the other end of the
scale, there are 15 companies qualified to bid for contracts in excess of
US$25 million value. A legal classification system amounting in effect to
prequalification, was introduced in 1983-84, but is not yet fully opera-
tional. Firms undertaking engineering works are required to have qualified
professional staff, and most companies, apart from the smallest, have these
or have easy access to them. The larger firms have a significant design
capability, and run their own workshops to maintain the equipment fleet.
Contractors' unit prices for road works are comparable to, and sometimes
below, those of PWD, even though the latter do not include the wages of
permanent staff, nor any allowance for retirement pensions and gratuities,
which amount to perhaps an extra 25X to 30X on basic salaries. Equipment
hire rates charget by EMS to PWD are also at comparable levels to those
charged by contractors. A move to greater use of contractors in road main-
tenance and improvement would, therefore, probably not involve any great
changes in apparent work costs, although real costs would decrease if PWD
staff now engaged in maintenance would be dispensed with or usefully
employed in other works not immediately suitable for contractors.
5.       Contractors show an interest in the possibility of bidding for
road maintenance work, seeing the possibility of a steady source of income.
PWD agree with the idea of using contractors for such works as bituminous
overlays and resealing in principle, but staff have their reservations,
saying that contract maintenance is difficult to specify. supervise and
measure for payment. Such arguments largely arise from the fact that the
staff is unused to having to plan road maintenance in detail and well in
advance, and that proper specifications for road maintenance activities,
where they exist, are largely unknown amongst supervisory staff. The
introduction of planned maintenance as envisaged under the Third Highway
project would make planning for contract maintenance no more difficult than
for Force Account, which should be routine, but is now generally not done.
Specifications for maintenance operations are to be prepared for the main-
tenance management system, and again, should apply just as rigidly to Force
Account work as to contracts, if good work standards are to be assured. In
the matter of measurement, there is some truth in saying that a range of
routine maintenance work is difficult to measure and to specify, but both
can be done, and are done effectively in other countries. In principle
this is now accepted by PWD management.



- 42 -
6.       Since in practice it would be neither practicable not socially or
politically desirable to make drastic reductions in the present PWD work-
force, a sound approach would be to continue to use Force Account opera-
tions under the control of District Engineers for an enhanced routine main-
tenance program on roads, and to introduce contract operations for most
periodic road maintenance and all but minor improvements. As already
explained, PWD should retain at least a minimal capability for periodic
maintenance in order to control contract prices, and the changeover must be
introduced at a rate which would not produce any capacity shortages amongst
contractors. As a second stage, task work on petty contracts should be
considered for routine maintenance activities once supervisory staff have
become used to working with specifications and supervising contract type
operations. The following analysis assumes that routine maintenance will
continue to be carried out by PWD for the present, and that the extra load
of periodic maintenance and rehabilitation will be done by contract.
7.       The situation is constantly changing, but an analysis of the
present position plus a review cf the consultants' report on implementation
of improved road maintenance in Cyprus, indicates that the main road net-
work of about 1500 km is made up as follows:
Class A Condition Road: 780 km 52X
This part of the network is in acceptable condition and requires
continuation of routine maintenance at the correct level. With
routine maintenance continuing, one sixth of this Class (130 km)
can be expected to deteriorate to Class B Conditions each year.
Class B Condition Road: 195 km (131)
This portion is in fair condition, and requires either a surface
seal or a thin premix carpet to bring it to Class condition. With
only routine maintenance, one twelfth of this portion (16 km) can
be expected to deteriorate to Class C each year. A single seal is
suitable for lightly trafficked roads which are now surface dres-
sed only (about 60S of the total), and a thin carpet is estimated
for the remaining 40Z, since reduction in surface roughness will
make the extra cost worthwhile in the shape of reduced vehicle
operating costs.
Class C Condition Road: 195 km (13S)
These lengths require structural strengthening by an asphaltic
overlay to prevent complete failure. With only routine mainte-
nance, Four per cent of these roads, or eight kilometers a year,
can be expected to deteriorate to Class D condition. Provision of
an 8 cms overlay (3 cms of regulation) is assumed to bring these
roads back into Class A condition.



- 43 -
Class D Condition Road: 330 km (22S)
This portion of the network has failed and requires reconstruction
to bring it back into Class A condition. With routine maintenance
- probably at an enhanced level - plus emergency repairs from time
to time, such roads can be kept open for traffic, although at
rising levels of vehicle operating costs.
This is a simple model but sufficient for making project estimates of
resource requirements. Deterioration vill not be straight line over time,
as assumed, but is likely to increase as time goes on. The assessment of
road condition is based on visual inspections plus consultants' reports,
and the proposed pavement condition survey (Loan 2128-CY) will give a
better analysis of the present state of pavements in Cyprus. Estimates of
the routine maintenance requirements assume a reasonable road condition
although at present sound roads are starved of funds which are concentrated
on deteriorated sections in an effort to keep them in operation. Hence
sound sections are likely to deteriorate more quickly than they should and
maintenance funds are exhatsted before the end of each financial year in an
ineffective attempt to correct serious underlying pavement deficiencies.
8.       Within the caveats of the previous paragraph, it is possible to
develop a scenario to bring the road network back into good condition
within a reasonable Deriod, and to estimate the associated cost stream.
This must be seen 2-; only a preliminary indication, which will be revised
in the light of su'jsequent pavement condition surveys. Given the con-
straints of finan_e and other resources in Cyprus, a ten year program to
put the network into good condition appears reasonable. This would require
the following to be done:
Resealing or thin Premix Carpet: 150 kms per year. This will
cope with the annual deterioration of 130 km, and place an extra
20 km a year into Class A condition from Class B. After year 7,
the rate of resealing or carpeting has to increase to 170 km a
year to allow for the extra 20 kms a year moved up to Class A at
the start of the program.
Overalys: 36 km a year, allowing for the 16 km a year which
deteriorates from Class B to Class C, and moving an extra 20 km a
year from Class C to Class A.
Reconstruction: 42 km a year need to be reconstructed, which
handles the 8 km a year deteriorating from Class C to Class D,
plus an extra 34 km a year moved from Class D to Class A.
Details of cost estimates for these operations are attached, and the Tables
at the end of this Annex show the lengths of road in the different condi-
tion classes year by year, plus total road maintenance and rehabilitation
costs at 1985 prices. Total expenditures for all maintenance and rehabili-
tation of the network is estimated at CE4.0 million a year, rising to CE4.9
million a year when a reseal or carpet becomes necessary on the first roads



- 44 -
upgraded under the program. This figure compares with the sum of CE1.9
million allocated Eor road maintenance in 1985 (Table 1), and the CE5.9
million requested by PWD for the 1986 financial year. It should also be
compared with the 1985 expenditure for new construction CE14.7 million),
which is largely financed by foreign aid at present. There are good
reasons why a substantial program of new construction has been necessary
(para. 2.01), but as the principal needs are met, a greater proportion of
roads expenditure should be switched into road maintenance from new works.
9.       Once the road rehabilitation program has been completed, so that
all the network is in good or fair condition, subsequent requirements for
routine and periodic maintenance, plus a small amount of reconstruction, is
estimated at about CE3.5 cillion a year. This includes the sum of about
CEO.6 million for wages which may in fact, be paid partly from the Personal
Emoluments Vote. Government's total roads expenditure in 1985 from its own
resources (i.e., excLuding foreign aide contributions) is of the order of
CE11 million, and an annual expenditure of CE3.5 million for road mainte-
nance would therefore be a reasonable proportion of the total, and should
be sustainable from Government's own resources in the future.
10.      Of the materials required for the proposed program, the most
critical is likely to be premixed bituminous macadam for carpets, overlays
and patching. The requirement will be some 55,000 cubic meters (120,000
tons) per annum during the ten year rehabilitation program, and 80,000 tons
a year thereafter. In addition, there will be a need for 30-35,000 tons a
year of bituminous material for patching, but this is likely to be in the
form of penetration macadam or premix produced on site by small mobile
mixers, so no allowance is made to produce this by large static plant. At
present, there are several modern asphalt mixers installed in Cyprus with
nominal outputs of 100 tons per hour each. A practical output from one
such plant would be about 70,000 tons a year, so that the road rehabilita-
tion requirement would take the output from two such plants virtually com-
pletely, dropping to one 100 ton per hour plant once the ten year program
is completed. Over the next four or five years, there will be a demand for
large amounts of bituminous materials on account of the Limassol by-pass
(87,000 tons), the Nicosia-Larnaca Road (290,000 tons) and possibly for
overlays on the Nicosia-Limassol highway (150,000 tons). Hence capacity
shortage may develop, with consequent price increases, and PWD needs to be
prepared for this possibility (para. 3).
11.      Equipment for road maintenance operations is provided to PWD by
the Electrical and Mechanical Services (EMS) branch of MCW, which procures,
commissions, operates and maintains electrical and mechanical equipment for
all parts of Government. Apart from a main workshops in Nicosia, there are
smaller workshops in each District where, although the premises are some-
time inadequate, work up to and including major overhauls is carried out.
EMS staff are generally well trained and experienced in their work, and the
workshops give the impression of being competently operated. The large
range of makes and models held for road maintenance, plus the high average
age, makes it difficult to hold the correct spares inventory, which lowers
the availability of equipment, reported to be about 80S overall, although



- 45 -
probably lower for the older items. The situation arises from the fact
that equipment procurement is by lowest price, with little weight given to
any other factor. Standardization would undoubtedly be an advantage, and
the possibility of adequate weighting in bid evaluation of standardization,
spares holdings by agents, performance and operating costs should be dis-
cussed with Government.
12       EMS equipment hire charges to PWD and other gover.ment users are
calculated in the correct manner to allow for depreciation, interest re-
pairs and other costs, but since EMS does not have control of the revenue
collected, they are unable to operate an effective renewal policy for their
equipment. Procedures for writing off old items and procuring new appear
to work reasonably well, but procurement of new items is always subject to
availability of funds in the budget. In practice, some items are always in
short supply, so that users will not release them when they are idle in
case they cannot get them back again later, which simply compounds the
shortage. PWD can, and do, hire from contractors when items are not avail-
able from EMS. Private sector hire rates are sometimes very competitive
with those of EMS, and in some cases seem barely to cover the marginal
costs of equipment operation.
13.      Given that there is a PWD organization in situ which it is not
desirable, or even possible, to dismantle in a short period, plus the
doubts that some staff have about general use of contractors for mainte-
nance, a reasonable compromise would be to use PWD Fource Account operation
for the enhanced routine maintenance plus preparation of roads for reseal-
ing, carpeting or overlay by contractors. The workload on PWD would then
be:
Routine Maintenance:                    C£900,000 p.a.
Road repair and preparation for
contract maintenance                     350.000 p.a.
Total                              1,250,000 p.a.
The present (1985) road maintenance workload on PWD amounts to CE1,888,000
(Table 1), of which about CE230,000 is accounted for by purchase of bitumi-
nous premix from contractors. The balance is thus about CE1,650,100.
Allowing for the requirement there would be to supervise and plan contract
maintenance work, this reduction should not cause redundancies amongst PWD
staff immediately. Contract work on resealing, thin carpets, overlays and
reconstruction would amount in value to about Cf3.0 to CE3.5 million a year
during the rehabilitation period, although as PWD staff gain confidence in
the organization and supervision of contract maintenance work, more of the
work initially proposed for PWD could and should be transferred to con-
tractors.
District Roads
14.     The road system maintained by the District Administration within
the Ministry of the Interior is more extensive than that under the control
of PWD, but most of it is unsurfaced and carries little traffic. Planned



- 46 -
maintenance is difficult with the level of funds available, commonly under
CE200 per km per annum, so that only urgent works on the more heavily
trafficked roads can be sure of attention. In each District, there is a
senior technician in charge of district roads, with up to 200 permanent and
temporary laborers and foremen under his control. Mechanical equipment,
when required, is hired from EMS on the same terms as for PWD.
15.      Apart from road maintenance funds, the Ministry of Interior makes
allocations for widening and improvement of district roads to a level
similar to road maintenance allocations, and other Ministries and depart-
ments provide funds for the improvement of district roads where they have a
particular interest. District road funding is also augmented by money from
the Loans Commission, which makes advances at low interest rates to rural
communities for local development projects, which often include roads.
16.      Once a district road starts to carry heavy traffic flows and has
been widened and surfaced, by agreement between the Ministry of the
Interior and MCW, it may be handed over to PWD for further maintenance.
District Officers say, however, that the majority of the district network
carries only local traffic and serves only the local communities, to whom
it is of very great importance. Since these minor roads play principally
an administrative and social role, their upkeep to serve local communities
in the best way is best handled by the District Administration, rather than
by a more remote PWD. These views are valid, and it is doubtful whether
PWD has the capacity to carry out the detailed administration of minor
roads in any case. The present arrangement whereby the more heavily
trafficked roads become the responsibility of PWD is sound and should con-
tinue. Logical criteria should be agreed with the Ministry of the Interior
and MCW to decide when district roads should be handed over to PWD for
future maintenance. The road inventory and road maintenance management
system being introduced into PWD, should be designed so that it can handle
also the District roads network, whether maintained by PWD or not.
Highway Maintenance Equipment
17.      Whilst a thrust of the project is to promote maintenance by
contract it is believed that the PWD should retain a capability to
undertake maintenance should the need arise and, consequently, the
following equipment is recommended.

- 47 -
The asphalt mixing plant is included as a precaution against private sector
suppliers raising prices. It may not be necessary from the strict view-
point of capacity in the island, as there are already some six 100 tph
plants there. If the mixer is not acquired, it may be advantageously re-
placed by one mechanical broom and suction cleaner for surface dressing
work at about $80,000, and there may be a need for bitumen heaters to feed
the bitumen distributors. The heaters PWD have at present are small and
control may not be at all accurate. This - and the equipment list - were

Terms of Reference and Action Plan for a Study
and Preparation of a Highway Safety Program
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       The Government of the Republic of Cyprus is concerned about the level
of accidents on the highway network and intends to carry out a study to
investigate traffic safety and arising out of this study to implement a safety
program, aimed at alleviating the number and severity of traffic accidents.
The Public Works Department with the participation of other concerned
organizations will carry o- the study, and will arrange for a program of
safety measures to be implemented or further investigation as may be necessary.
II. OBJECTIVES
2.       The main objectives of the study are as follows:
-i) to establish a system for the regular collection of reliable
data describing accidents on Cyprus' highway network: these
data will include inter alia: (a) the exact location;
(b) description and classification of accident; (c) road and
traffic conditions of time of accident; and (d) weather
conditions at the site and time of accident;
(ii)    to review the extent and standard of road markings and signs on
Cyprus' highway system together with related highway geometry
characteristics and coefficients of friction of the pavement;
(iii)    to prepare a national analysis and categorization of highway
accidents; a computer program for doing this should be developed;
Uiv)    to make proposals for and implement remedial measures of
identified "black-spots" and arrange to monitor the effects of
these measures; monitoring should take place on a regular basis
to ensure no worsening in the situation takes place;
'v)    to prepare reports relating, on a quantified basis, the highway
safety situation in Cyprus with other countries and comparing
respective highway safety policies; and



- 55 -
(vi)    to make recommendations for further actions in the field of
highway safety in Cyprus.
The program for traffic safety is likely to include proposals for civil works
required to improve safety at specific priority places or sections, a program
for road signs, a road marking pogram, and recommendations for medical and
other accident emergency services, and suggestions for other related aspects
intended to improve traffic safety on the highway network.
III. SCOPE OF STUDY
3.       The study is concerned initially with traffic safety on the main
highway network, but should be extended eventually to the entire highway
network. The study shall include the following phases:
Phase I
(i)    collecton of data on road accidents by exact location, time and
date, participants, severity, availability of medical help,
weather conditions, detailed road characteristics: these data
should be processed into a form suitable as input for a selected
accident analysis program;
(ii)    quality of data should be carefully evaluated and where
necessary improvements are identified these should be described
and the data collection system redesigned and implemented;
(iii)    when data are lacking an inventory should be carried out of the
main highway network giving, inter alia, precise details of road
furniture, markings, surface type and safety barriers; and
iv)    the road safety situation in different regions of Cyprus should
be evaluated and compared, identifying "black-spots" and overall
road safety situation should be compared with that in other
representative countries.
Phase II
(i)    general review of road safety and analysis of accident
characteristics with estimation of the incidence of difference
causes;
(ii)    detailed review and analysis of important "black-spots";
(iii)    definition of proposed remedial measures at a national level
including matters such as road signs and markings, speed limits,
vehicle testing and, especially, education;
(iv)    definition of specific remedial measures to be introduced at
individual "black-spots"; and



- 56 -
(v)    development of monitoring systems to evaluate the effects of
remedial measures of national and "black-spot" level.
Note: Where legal changes are necessary the Ministry of Communications and
Works associated agencies should take the initiative in stimulating the
relevant legislation.
Phase III - This should include the production of several important
reports which would be:
(i)    Inventory of present highway safety situation including relevant
road inventory data;
(ii)    Proposals for improved data collection and monitoring of highway
safety measures;
(iii)    Detailed "Black-spot" analysis and proposals;
(iv)    Safety education;
Cv)    Proposals for national road signs and marking policy and traffic
control revisions;
(vi)    Program costing and implementation schedule; and
(vii)    A summary report and proposals for future work.
Monitoring of highway safety and the results of physical, control and
educational policies will continue.
4.       The benefits of the traffic safety proposals which the Ministry of
Communications may recommend, will be qualitatively described and their
distribution amongst different types of road users will be identified.
However, no formal benefit-cost analysis is required for determining the
details of the treatments proposed to improve traffic safety.
5.       The Public Works Department of the Ministry of Communicatons and Work
will coordinate the task force responsible for carrying out this study.
IV. TIME SCHEDULE AND REPORTS
6.       The study is expected to be complete within 24 months.  The following
reports will be prepared in English of which 3 copies to the World Bank;
(a)  within 8 months of the starting date an Accident Data Report
covering the analysis of accident data and the identification of
"black-spots" on Cyprus' highways, an attempt should also be
made to provide estimates of fatalities and injuries per 100,000
veh-km;



- 57 -
(b) within 12 months of the starting date an Interim Report on
Accident Causes, "black-spots", Road Marking. Signs and Safety
Devices, and Emergency Services for the main road network,
proposing (i) a list of priority "black-spots" for improvement
with general details of the treatment proposed, and preliminary
estimated cost, (ii) specific medical and other accident
emergency services; and (iii) the type and extent of programs
for road marking and road signs and safety devices;
(c) within 12 months a Draft Report on Traffic Control Procedures
and Recommendations for Improvements related to traffic safety
on Cyprus' highways;
(d)  within 18 months of the starting date a Draft of the
"Black-Spot" Final Design Report giving the design treatment at
the selected "black-spots" on the road network together with
estimated prices and quantities. The report will also estimate
the type and number of accidents that are expected at each site,
and a program of work for proposed treatment of these sites,
together with proposals for implementing a highway accident
monitoring system;
(e) within 18 months of the starting date a Draft Final Road Marking
and Road Signs Report giving recommendations for roads markings,
road signing and guard-railing on Cyprus' highways together with
programs of work for implementing these recommendations; and
(f) Final Reports on the following within two months of receiving
the conments of the Government and the World Bank and
incorporating all revisions instructed by the Public Works
Department.

V. STAFFING AND FACILITIES TO BE PROVIDED FOR THE STUDY
7.       The Government will provide to its consultants all information that
is available to them and as may be reasonably required to carry out the
study. Where cooperation is required from other Government Departments and
Agencies, the PWD will provide liaison. The PWD or its consultants will
provide all staff necessary to carry out the study (supplemented by such staff
as necesary from other concerned ministries).

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Transport Sector Master Plan
Draft Outline Terms of Reference
A. Introduction
1.       The Government of the Republic of Cyprus' Ministry of Communications
and Works (MCU) has identified a need to undertake a comprehensive study of
the Country's transport resources and future neads. On the basis of this
study, five year detailed and ten year indicative plans covering investment,
maintenance and institutional matters are to be prepared.
2.       To undertake these studies and to prepare the plans the MCW proposes
to employ a firm of consultants. These consultants will be employed under
conditions complying with the World Bank's guidelines on the employment and
use of consultants. The consultants should perform all of the studies and
Analyses noted in these Terms of Reference in addition to others included by
mutual agreement with the MCW, to internationally acceptable standards.
3.       Planning personnel in relevant Ministries and Agencies shall play an
active role in carrying out the study and MCW will designate a planning team
to work closely with the consultants. However, the consultants shall be
solely responsible for the analysis and interpretation of all data received
end for the findings, conclusions and recommendation-s in their reports. (The
study will be completed within a period of approximately fifteen months,
although, the consultant vill have the right to determine time needs according
to the amount of work to be done.)L'
B. Obiectives
4.       The overall objectives of the proposed study (MPT) aze:
(a)    to help the relevant Government agencies. including those
directly concerned with road, sea and air transport and the
Planning Bureau, as well as the private sector, to formulate
transport policies which are designed to foster the achievement
of overall development goals in keeping with national resources;
11 To be deleted in final tor and included in the letter of invitation.



- 61 -
(b)    based on these transport policies, together with the
participation of relevant Government quasi-Government and
private agencies, to prepare a detailed physical, financial
and institutional Master Plan for a period of five years for
the country's transport sector and an indicative plan for a
subsequent five years making a transport sector Master Plan
of ten years in total; and
(c)    to assist the Government in developing the technical and
organizational capacity to undertake and to monitor
comprehensive transport planning activities on a continuous
basis.
C. ScoPe of Work
5.       The study and Transport Sector Master Plan (MPT) shall be
comprehensive in that it will cover that part of Cyprus that is controlled
by the Government and include at lease one scenario that would permit the
effects of a political reconciliation on the transport sector to be
evaluated, at least in global terms. Furthermore, the study shall:
(a)    examine all aspects of economic, social and commercial
activities of the country that have a bearing on the demands
made on the transport system and on the supply of transport
services;
(b)    examine all modes of transport, highways and road transport,
ports, coastal shipping, airports and civil aviation;
(C)    take account of existing urban transport studies but only
undertake additional field studies in-so-far as they are
deemed to be necessary to derelop an overall transport
strategy;
(d)    analyse past and proposed capital and recurrent expenditures
and the benefits derived from these expenditures; and
(e)    examine the revenues generated by the sector, paying special
attention to the appropriateness of charging and tariff
policies of revenue earning entities and to the adequacy and
equity of road user charges.
6.       The consultants shall perform all the studies, field-work and
analyses to achieve the broad objectives listed above according to
internationally accepted standards. In carrying out the study the
consultants shall work in cooperation with the staff of the MCW and the
staff of other ministries, agencies and private organizations that are
agreed to or designated by the MCW. The MCW shall assist the consultants
in obtaining the relevant data and iniformation. The staff of the MCW, and
other agencies as appropriate, shall actively participate in all aspects of
the study and plan preparation. However, the consultant alone shall be
reponsible for all aspects of the studies, analysis and methodology used in
formulating the MPT.



- 62 -
7.       The Public Works Department (PWD) of the MCW shall be the primary
Government counterpart organization to the consultants and they will form a
steering committee including representatives from other interested
agencies. The steering committee shall meet on a regular basis with the

ANNEX 9
Appendix 3
CYPRUS
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Regional Traffic Control Study
Draft Outline Terms of Reference
A. Background
1.       The relatively small size of Cyprus and the limited highway
network makes the automation of much of the collection and processing of
traffic and road use data attractive. At the same time the development and
implementation of, for example, area traffic control systems in each of
Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol and eventually Paphos would probably not be cost
effective. Similarly, there may be economies of scale in centralized
control of, for example, traffic on major interurban highways.
2.       The Government of Cyprus' Ministry of Communications and Works
(MCW) has, therefore, decided to undertake a study of establishing a
central computer based system that will permit traffic and road data
collection, processing, and the implementation and monitoring of actions.
This would address, inter alia, traffic control in major cities, road
hazards and accidents and emergency services. In addition, the system
would be used to coordinate collection and storage of road use data.
3.       The Government of Cyprus proposes to employ a consultant under
these terms of reference to undertake a study of the feasibility of a
centralized regional traffic control and data collection system. The MCW
Public Works Department (PWD) would be directly responsible for the
management of the study and its staff, and those of other agencies
including the Cyprus Police, would participate closely with the appointed
consultant. The study would be in two phases. Phase I would be concerned
wi'.h the feasibility study and Phase II would cover the design of an agreed
system. Whilst the consultants' proposals should include both phases the
Government of Cyprus reserves the right to proceed with or to cancel
Phase II after a review of the Phase I.
B. Objectives
4.       The proposed study will review the urban and interurban highway
system, motorized traffic, non-motorized traffic (including pedestrians),
highway data collection and storage procedures, highway safety and
emergency services. Based on this review it will seek to assess the needs



- 66 -
for improved traffic control, traffic management and highway safety and
examine the economic and financial feasibility of introducing centralized
computer based control and data processing systems to meet these needs.
Should such a system or part of a system be found viable the consultant
should proceed with preliminary design and preparation of an implementation
schedule.
5.       Although the study shall be limited to that part of Cyprus
controlled by the Government it should, as far as conditions permit, give
due consideration to the appropriateness of recommended systems in the case
of resolution of the existing division of the country.
C. Scope of Work
6.       As far as possible making use of existing highway and traffic data
and following an assessment of highway planning methodology needs, the
consultant shall determine:
(a)    the nature of urban traffic problems in the main towns of
Nicosia, Larnaca and Limassol;
(b)    the type of problem arising on major interurban highways such
as road works, accidents and hazardous conditions; and
(c)    the type of highway data needed for day to day operations and
for longer term planning paying special attention to: Ci)
the traffic flows; (ii) traffic speed; (iii) highway
accidents; and (iv) axle weighing program.
7.       In parallel with the tasks in paragraph 6, the consultant shall
determine the relevant response agencies including:
(a)    road authorities;
(b)    police services;
(c)    traffic control systems (traffic lights);
(d)    fire and rescue services; and
(e)    municipal authorities.
and examine their modes of operation, communications facilities, personnel
and equipment and history of response to typical situations ranging from
traffic congestion to accidents and emergency road works.
8.       The consultant shall identify and evaluate priority needs and
assess the efficiency with which these needs are currently met. This
evaluation shall, as far as possible, be expressed in financial and
economic terms.



- 67 -
9.       The consultant shall proceed to outline and to suggest sets at
actions, policies and institutioaal changes which may lead to an
improvement in these information flows and permit rapid remedial actions to
be instituted. Such proposals, however, should be designed in such a way
as to allow a smooth transition from existing systems and be compatible
with personnel, administrative and financial resources. Each set of
actions should be subjected to a cost/benefit analysis including both
financial and economic criteria and as a result priority policies should be
put forward.
10.      Should the Government decide to proceed with one of the sets of
actions the consultant may be instructed to proceed with:
(a)    detailed design and costing;
(b)    implementation scheduling;
(c)    training needs; and
(d)    recommendations and costings for supporting services.
This would form the basis of Phase II of the proposed consultancy.
D. Reports and Scheduling
11.      The following reports shall be submitted in English, 20 copies of
each:
Inception Report - This will be submitted within one month
of the contract becoming effective and will include:
(a)    an updated implementation schedule and study methodology
description;
(b)    a listing of services consulted and proposed to be
consulted; and
(c)    a description of supplementary data required, proposed
method of collection ard estimated cost of collection.
Interim Report - This shall be submitted four months after
contract effectiveness and will cover, inter alia, the work
included in paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 above. This report will be
reviewed by Government, for which a six week period is suggested,
and following this review and taking note of its outcome, the
consultant will proceed to the final stage of Phase I.
Draft Final Report - This will be submitted three months
after the review of the Interim Report is completed and, in
addition to including the basic studies recorded in the Interim
Report, will concentrate on describing, analysing and recommending
the actions set out in paragraph 9 above. The report will be
reviewed by the Government during a period estimated at six weeks.



- 68 -
Final Report of Phase I will be submitted one month after
completion of the Phase I review.
12.      The Phase II of the study, is estimated to take about 6 months and
for the purposes of this study, the MCW will designate a steering comnittee
which shall meet at least once a month to cooperate closely with the
consultant especially in order that the proposals made for implementation
are directed towards priority matters and are also practicable.
E. Government and Consultant's Responsibilities etc.

ANNEX 13
CYPRUS
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Accounting Systems and Auditing
A. General
1.       Recurrent and Capital Development Budgets are prepared in April of
each year for the ensuing fiscal year (January 1 to December 31) for
consideration, review and revision by a Budget Committee composed of all
the interested parties. The budgets are thereafter submitted to the
Council o-f Ministers for approval and finally for adoption by the House of
Representatives. Once adopted, no amendments can be made.
2.       In the event that Budgets are not approved and adopted by January
1, in any year, up to one-twelfth of the proposed expenditures under the
various heads and sub-heads of account can be made through the issue of a
general warrant by the Ministry of Finance to the Accountant General.
There can, hovever, be no expenditure on new projects.
3.       Departmental Heads have overall responsibility for all financial
matters connected with their departments. An efficient system for
controlling receipts and expenditures, and for the safe custody of cash and
stores is in operation.
B. Accounting ir the Public Works Department
4.       Overall responsibility for accounting and financial control in MCW
is vested in the Accountant, who is a professionally qualified and well
experienced member of the Accountant General's staff.
5.       The accounting function within PWD is carried out by the
accounting section in heradquarters and District offices, which is staffed
by members of the Accountant General's office, attached to PWD. It is the
duty of Accounting Officers to:
(a)    ensure that all financial and accounting instructions are
duly observed;
(b)    make themselves acquainted with the provisions of laws,
regulations, orders or instructions that are relevant to
their duties;
(c)    see that proper safeguards exist for the safekeeping of
public monies, stamps securities, receipt forms and other
assets;



- 78 -
(d)    produce any documents, books of account, and registers
required for inspection by the Treasury and the
Auditor-General;
(e)    ensure that revenue is duly and punctually collected, and
properly brought to account under proper heads and sub-heads;
(f)    see that all payments effected "re authorized in accordance
with existing regulations or instructions and are charged to
the appropriate heads and sub-heads; and
(g)    ensure that no excess is incurred over and above the approved
provision and to refer any improper or irregular payment to
the Accountant-General with a copy to the Auditor-General.
6.       The Accounting Officer and his staff in PWD are competent and
fullv aware of their duties and responsibilities. The computing system is
computerized, but manual records are kept to allow approved expenditures to
be traced and verified, and the manual record includes committed
expenditures. Monthly expenditures on the computer print-out are checked
with the manual records and any discrepancies agreed with the Ministry of
Finance. Payment certificates for work done by contract requires five
signatures before payment is made, including those of the Chief Engineer,
the Director of Public Works and the head of the PWD Control Section.
7.       The PWD Control SectiLn has a professionally qualified staff of
engineers, who check the technical viability and standards of PWD
operations from the initial design stage through to completion. The head
of the Control Section reports to the Director General, MCW, but maintains
a close liaison with the Director and staff of PWD and witi the Accounting
Officer.
C. Auditing Procedures
8.       The constitutional provisions regarding the functions of the
Auditor-General envisage that he has to examine the activities and
transactions of the Ministries, Departments or bodies concerned in order to
satisfy himself that all:
(a)    reasonable precautions are taken to safeguard the collection
of public moneys;
(b)    revenues are collected in accordance with the laws,
regulations or other directives; and directions or
instructions relating thereto are observed;
(c)    expenditures are properly incurred;
(d)    sums appropriated are spent for the service and purposes for
which they have been approved; and



- 79 -
(e)    asaiets are being properly maintained, and their existence
verified.
9.       The change in the economic development of Cyprus and the growth in
the size and complexity of Government and statutory bodies activities have
necessitated a change in the scope of audit. Whereas the primary tast of
the Auditor-General has been to carry out regularity audits, it is now
extended to the operational or administrative sector. This change conforms
with the national and international demands of applying modern audit
techniques.
10.      As a consequence of the changes and growth referred to in para. 9
above, the Auditor-General carries out well programmed sample auditing with
greater emphasis on the examination of the scope and efficiency of internal
cortrol procedures.  Test audit techniques have been developed and applied
satisfactorily.
11.      The audit of Cpaital Projects on a test check basis is carried out
by technically qualified and experienced staff. This audit verifies that
projects have been planned, designed and executed satisfactorily through
the examination, inter alia, of feasibility studies, technical
specifications and drawings, the budgeted expenditures and final cost
estimates and procedures for inviting the awarding tenders. The Auditor
General -its as an observer at meetings of the Ministerial Tender Committee
and of the Main Tender Board.
12.      A new organization structure was introduced on January 1, 1980, to
increase audit efficiency and to direct the orientation of audit office
tasks towards the administrative and economic fields. This objective is in
line with the requirements of the House of Representatives, the
recommendations of the International Organization of Supreme Audit
Institutions and the Commonwealth Auditors-General Conferences. The new
organization includes two professionally qualified civil engineers, and the
audit team for technical projects now routinely includes both an accountant
and an engineer.
13.      The Auditor-General has a total staff of 80.  The quality and
caliber of the staff presages well for the achievement of the targets and
foals of the reorganization. There is also a training scheme covering the
needs of Junior and Senior staff with lecturers drawn from within the audit
office and from other sources.
14.      Auditing of all transactions in the PWD is carried out by a
Section of the Auditor-General's staff located permanently in the
department and consists of four audit clerks under the direction of an
accountant technician. It was at the instigation of the Auditor General
that the Control Section was set up within MCW (para. 7), to provide a
continuous internal technical audit on PWD operations.
15.      The internal audit function is carried out by the Internal Audit
Division in the Treasury which carries out on the sopt checks in every
department and on every project, and checks clerical work, vouchers and
controls and verifies stock.
