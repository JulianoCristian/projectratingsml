(BRE). It will protect of about 270,000 ac of cultivated\n            land from annual flood inundation and will also improve\n            agricultural services by providing for the implementation of\n            the \"Training and Visit\" (T&V) system in the\n            project areas. It will provide buildings for agricultural\n            extension classes and staff quarters for extension agents.\n            In addition, the project provides access roads, godowns,\n            workshops, equipment and vehicles in all sub-project areas\n            and training for the project staff. About 36 man-months of\n            consultants' time will be included for engineering and\n            agriculture. It is estimated that the project will increase\n            net farm incomes by 40-100% in the 3 project areas."}, "docdt": "1978-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
