"BABIN KUK" HOTELSKO TURISTICKI CENTAR, DUBROVNIK
AND THE
HOTEL "BERNARDIN", PIRAN
1.   I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed loans
for tourism projects, both to be guaranteed by the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia.  They are: US $20 million equivalent 71½ percent loan for
22 years including 5 years of grace to the "Babin Kuk" Hotelsko Turisticki
Centar, Dubrovnik; US $10 million equivalent 71½ percent loan for 25 years
including 5 years of grace to th e Hotel "Bernardin" Piran.  The Federal
Government and the project sponsors, "Minceta" Export-Import Inozoma
Zastupstva, Dubrovnik, and "Emona", Proizvodnja, Trgovina, Turizem,
Inzeniring, Ljubljana, independent enterprises under Yugoslav law, have
requested these loans to help finance respectively, the construction and
organization of a 5,000 bed integrated tourist complex near Dubrovnik, and
a similar 2,500 bed complex near Piran. Local financial arrangements have
been made respectively with Privredna Banka, Zagreb, and Ljubljanska Banka,
Ljubljana. The proposed loans would be the Bank's first for tourism. Since
the projects share many features, they are discussed together in this report.
2.   An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Yugoslavia" (EMA-33a) dated May 14, 1971, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 24, 1971. Reference should also be made to the Report of
the President on the Ibar Multipurpose Project (P-944), which was circulated
for ccnsideration by the Executive Directors on June 10, 1971, for a
discussion of the econony of Yugoslavia and the role of the Bank in assisting
Yugoslav economic development. A list of past loans to Yugoslavia is found
in Annex I and a basic eccnomic data sheet in Annex II.
PART I - THE TOLRIQM SECTCR
3.   Yugoslavia, with over 2,000 km of mountainous coastline of great scenic
beauty, warm dry summers, and picturesque old coastal towns and villages,
possesses tourist attractions which compare favorably with any in the
Mediterranean. The country's relative proximity to the major tourist generaI-iing
centers of Europe is also important. The principal destinations of holiday
visitors to Yugoslavia are resorts on the Adriatic coast where about 80 percc-4,
of foreign visitor nights are spent and almost two-thirds of all hotel capaci y
is located. As in other Mediterranean countries, Yugoslavia's foreign tourist
traffic is seasonal with peaks in July and August.
4.   The fast growth of foreign tourism to Yugoslavia has occurred mainly in
the past decade. It has resulted from growing prosperity in Europe, liberal
entry policies to Yugoslavia, the implementation of certain key investments,
particularly the construction of the Adriatic highway (partly financed by



-2-
Loan 3h4-YU of 1963) and the rapid expansion of hotel capacity.   Foreign
visitor-nights spent in Yugoslavia increased more than five-fold over the
decade to reach 22.4 million in 1969, while estimated excursion traffic
(those not staying overnight) increased from 1 million visitors in 1960
to 30 million in 1969.
5.   Gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism, including those arising
from tourist transportation, are estimated to have risen from US $22 million
in 1960 to US $310 million in 1969, an average annual growth rate of 35 percerlt.
As a proportion of total receipts from exports of goods and services, tourism
receipts rose from 3 percent to 13 percent over this period. Between 1960
and 1969, 50,000 new jobs were created in tourism and catering in the socializ-d
sector, which at present absorbs about 130,000 wqorkers (3.5 percent of total
employment).  In addition many small private ventures have developed (restau-
rants, pensions, etc.), particularly along the Adriatic coast, but statistics
on these are not available.
6.   Recognizing the important contribution that tourism could make to forei,nm
exchange earnings, particularly in convertible currencies, the Federal and
Republican Governments have taken a series of measures to assist the growth
of the sector. The most important of these are: tourism oriented infrastruct§o;ce
projects, liberalization of regulations on entry of foreign visitors, the
introduction of financial incentives such as interest subsidies for developfle±t1
of tourist facilities, and the promotion of comprehensive regional plans with
particular emphasis on tourism. The most ambitious of these is the Physical
Development Planfor the South Adriatic Region, a joint Government-UNDP under-
taking.  This plan provides for orderly development of the whole South Adriat+c,
coast and is oriented towards the development of tourism and the identificatiorin
of investment projects related thereto. The Babin Kuk project is an importanft
element in the plan. A similar plan is now being implemented for the North
Adriatic region with UNDP assistance.
7.   The various incentives to development have helped to bring about a major
expansion of hotel capacity. From 1960 to 1969 it rose from 33,000 to 130,0CO
beds, and investment is continuing. The 1971-75 Draft Plan for the industry
envisages a total investment exceeding $500 million, and additions to capacit,rT
of 100,000 to 120,000 hotel beds. It also forecasts foreign exchange earnings
of US $900 million in 1975. These targets are ambitious but Yugoslavia's
present share of Mediterranean tourism is still modest; hotel capacity is less
than 6 percent of the total in M4editerranean countries. Hotel and other
tariffs in Yugoslavia are 20-25 percent lower than in competing countries of
the region, and Yugoslavia should be able to increase its share of Mediterrar.e>_
tourism.
8.   The Bank's objectives in assisting tourism in Yugoslavia are threefold:
to implement economically feasible projects in regions with few other econormr;
possibilities, to assist in developing new techniques of tourism organization
and construction which will demonstrate the possibility of improving the



- 3 -
earnings potential of this sector, and to stimulate the infrastructure
improvements needed for the earnings potential to be realized. The Babin
Kuk and Bernardin projects serve these objectives. The three road projects
financed by the Bank between FY 1969 and 1971 have also each included roads
which are important for iDurist traffic.
PART II -rhE BABIN KUK PROJECT
9.   A report entitled "Appraisal of the Babin Kuk Tourism Project,
Yugoslavia' (PT-I), dated June 2, 1971 is attached (No. 1). A loan and
project summary, including map, is given in Annex III to this
Report.
Description
10. The Babin Kuk Project will establish a large integrated tourism complex
on the South Adriatic Coast of Yugoslavia in the Republic of Croatia. The s4b'G
for the project is a smali peninsula, about 4 km to the north of the old
walled city of Dubrovnik. Partly pine-covered, the area slopes gently from
a high point (altitude 100 m) to the sea. It has about 1.5 km of indented
rocky coastline and about 0.5 km to the northeast is the small island of
Daksa which has sandy beaches and dense woods. Because of its topography
the site offers panoramic views of the sea and surrounding islands, and it
has a slightLy more favorable cLimate than the old city.   Besides the great
scenic beauty of the mountainous coatline, the palaces, churches and monastefieq-i
of the old city are tourism assets in themselves and provide a unique setting
for a summer festival offering music, drama, opera and dance which is a major
attraction for tourisms.
11. The project is one of the largest so far developed in Yugoslavia or elseahere.
It will include nine hotels with a total of about 5,000 beds; one hotel will
be in the luxury class with 300 beds, four will be A class with 1,700 beds,
and the remainder B class with 3,000 beds. The four B class hotels will
operate seasonally (April-October).
Size and Management of the Project
12. The scale of the project offers considerable potential economies in
construction and operation. The hotels will operate individually but parti-
cipate in certain conmon services and be under the general direction of the
management of the complex. This will leave most day-to-day operations in
units of easi'ly manageable size. It will at the same time provide substantic'2.
operating economies from joint advertising and promotion, training and the
purchase of supplies, and from the provision of services such as heating and
laundry, which will be operated for the complex as a whole. There will also
be a common computerized reservations system which will ease the handling of
large groups, increasingly characteristic of modern tourism.



- 4 -
13. However, the realization of this potential will require the developmenit
of new management systerm- to identify and provide solutions to problems which
have not yet been met in the industry.   It will also require the selection arc.o
training of a management team. The creation of a successful management
structure for the complex may be divided into two distinct but inter-dependernL
phases. The pre-opening phase would be concerned with developing and
coordinating the systems and procedures and wibh recruiting and training the
key personnel required to achieve the operating standards set for the projec.L
The post-opening phase would be concerned with operating the complex using
the systems, procedures and staff developed in the pre-opening phase and
introducing changes indicated by actual operating experience.
14. The project sponsor, "Minceta" Export-Import Inozemna Zastupstva,
Dubrovnik, is an enterprise established under Yugoslav law in 1962 by the
merger of several small enterprises. It is principally engaged in the :Lmport,
export, wJholesale and retail trades.  Minceta has a record of successful sal^s
and profit growth, but like many Yugoslav firms, has potential liquidity
problems. Minceta's top management is dynamic, although the management
structure lacks depth and has little experience in hotel operations. More-
over, the company is small relative to the project. Consideration was given
to obtaining a foreign or domestic partner, but few traditional hotel firms
have had experience with a complex project of this size. It was therefore
agreed with the sponsor to separate the operation of the project from the
sponsor's other and unrelated activities by establishing a new unit with its
own management, and to engage consultants to provide substantial management
support.
15. Because of the size and uniqueness of the project, no organization or
consultant has had actual experience of the problems that will be posed by
Babin Kuk. The solution chosen is to blend the knowledge and experience of
management consultants, the expertise available in the international hotel
industry, ancd Yugoslav resources to create a team which is capable of
developing theneicessary management systems prior to opening the complex and
has the ability to apply and adapt them during the operation of the project
after the corsultants have departed.
Infrastructure
16. The project will place substantial demands on infrastructure in the
Dubrovnik area and improvements are required in transportation, water supply,
sewage disposal, and the airport. The competent authorities have given
assurances through the Guarantor that the essential minimum requirements
will be met by the opening date. In addition, certain other improvements
in transportation and sewage facilities would be desirable to support the
projected hotel investment. The proposed loan includes $300,C00 for
consultantst services in preparing plans for these facilities and the Bank
has been asked to consider a further loan to help finance their construction.



-5-
Ecology
17. The preservation and improvement of the environment has been a considera-
tion in several of the provisions of the project. On the site, the buildings
will be located to preserve a green zone containing rare tree specimens. The
new sewerage system,which will replace an old Roman system,is the object of
the joint engineering/marine ecology study to be partly financed by the
proposed loan. The outfall will be designed to keep the pollution of the
swimming beaches of the Dubrovnik urban area within acceptable esthetic
and health standards. A broad study of transportation possibilities within
the urban area will be undertaken to provide for the increased traffic while
preserving the special atmosphere that is one of the main attractions of
Dubrovnik.
Organization of the Borrower
18. The Borrower, "Babin Kuk" Hotelsko Turisticki Centar, Dubrovnik, has been
newly established by the sponsor, Minceta, as a financially independent unit
with its own legal personality within the parent enterprise. Such a unit is
a unique creation of Yugoslav law, not so far encountered by the Bank in any
of its othex member countries, or hitherto, in Yugoslavia. An admittedly
imperfect classification in the usual corporate terminology might place it
somewhere between a division and a subsidiary, although in some respects it
seems to enjoy a position of equality not unlike an independent third party.
It is interesting to note, for example, that the unit cannot be liquidated
by the enterprise without the unit's agreement.
19. The Borrower was originally created by a decision of Minceta1s workers'
council. The Borrower's splhere of activity and the basic relations between
the Borrower and Minceta were subsequently laid down in a Statutory Agreemenlt
entered into by the two parties. In addition, the Borrower and Minceta signed
a Joint Venture Agreement in which they agreed to jointly carry out the present
project. The Joint Venture Agreement provides for the necessary financing,
the management structure of the project (major decisions are taken by a
Business Committee composed of representatives of both parties, with a
majority being representatives of Minceta), for the sharing of profit and
loss and liability for debts between the parties.
20. The project will be constructed and operated under the supervision of a
Director whose appointment will be subject to Bank and Privredna Banka (the
co-lender) concurrence during the period of construction and the first three
years of operation. The Director will report to the Business Committee. He
will be assisted by architectural, engineering and management consultants
selected with the concurrence of the Bank and Privredna Banka, and during the
construction period by a construction office with the required technical staff,
Financial Arrangements
21. The financial structure of the project is given in Annex III. Under the
Joint Venture Agreement, Minceta will provide about 20 percent of -the project
cost as "equityt" from which it will gain certain rights to management and



-6-
income. By international standards, this equity share is low for a hotel
project. However, in Yugoslavia, equity in the usual sense does not exist.
Rather, rights usually associated with equity may be obtained through contrac-Ps
such as the Joint Venture Agreement in the present case. Debt financing,
formerly by the government, now by banks, is the more usual form of new venture
capital. This explains both the low "equity" portion and the fact that much
of this "equity" is in turn borrowed by Minceta from the Privredna Banka,
Zagreb. Privredna Banka thus plays a very important role in the project. It
rill lend the equivalent of $21.3 million to Minceta: of this amount, $13.3
million will be on-lent to Babin Kuk, subordinated to the Bank Loan, and the
other $8 million will be provided by Minceta to the Borrower as "equity". In
addition, f4inceta has agreed to provide for cost overruns.  Privredna Banka hD.s
also (a) undertaken a cost overrun commnitment, (b) agreed so subordinate its
rights to the Bank's Loan and (c) waived its right to claim repayment of the
$8 million "equity" investment from the Borrower. The Borrower has undertaken
not to carry out major new projects or incur debts beyond a certain limit
without the Bank's ard Privredna Banka's agreement.
Subsidies
22. As noted above, Yugoslavia provides interest rate subsidies to tourism
projects.  The net effect of the subsidies, paid by the Republic of Croatia,
is to reduce the interest rate on the dinar loan to Babin Kuk to 3 percent.
The effects of such subsidies are often questionable on general economic
grounds because the artificially low cost of capital tends to encourage
excessive capital intensive projects.  However, capital/labor ratios are less
flexible in t;ourism than in many other industries.  This limits the tendency
to substitute subsidized capital for labor.  Moreover, in the present projecl,
any tendency to make extravagant use of capital will be prevented by careful
control of design and costs.   In this the Bank will play a role through its
review of architects' terms of reference, designs, bidding documents and
supervision. Furthermore, subsidies to tourism projects reflect the fact
that much of the benefits from tourism are diffused throughout the economy and
are difficult to capture by the sponsors.
Procurement and Local Cost Financing
23. Contracts for construction and equipment would be grouped to form
eccnomic bid packages and bids would be awarded after international competiticMiu
In bid evaluation for goods, local manufactures would be given a 15 percent
margin of preference or the applicable customs tariff, whichever is lower.
Depending on whether local or foreign contractors would carry out the project
and the extent to which foreign equipment would be used, the foreign exchange
component in the total project costs could range frcm 24 to 38 percent. On ti':!
assumption that Yugoslav bidders would win the construction contracts and th-T;
the bulk of equipment would be imported, the foreign exchange component would
be about 30 percent, or ULS $13.8 million (see Annex III). An additional
$2.8 million of foreign exchange would cover interest during construction on
the Bank loan. The proposed loan of $20 million is thus expected to finance



-7 -
about $3.4 million of local currency expenditure.   The case for financing
local expernditure in Yugoslavia was made in my Report and Recommenidation on
the Ibar Multipurpose Water Project (P-944) dated May 18, 1971.
Economic Justification
24. A holiday in Dubrovnik is within the reach of a small but rapidly growing
section of the European tourism market, as well as a significant portion of
the domestic market. Because of the unusual attractiveness of the town, the
competitive prices and the present limited hotel capacity, occupancy rates
are exceptionally high as compared with other competitive Mediterranean resorts.
The growth of touriat traffic is mainly limited by the growth of capacity.
W^,ith adequate promotion and service at competitive prices, the project is
expected to achieve satisfactory occupancy rates with 1 ittle difficulty.
25.  The economic benefits, as calculated by the expenditures of the guests
staying at the project, who will largely be foreign, would be about 17 perrent.
This estimate does not take account of expenditures outside the project, nor
the real economic costs of certain of the factors of production, both of
which would increase the rate of return. 1Then in full operation, the project
is expected to bring to the economy annual net foreign exchange earnings of
$14.7 million equivalent.
PIART III - THE BERNARDTh PROJWECT
26.  A report entitled "Appraisal of the Bernardin Tourism Project,
Yugoslavia" (PT-2), dated June 2, 1971, is attached (No. 2). A loan and
project summary, including map, iE given in Annex IV to this Report.
27.  Like Babin Kuk, the Bernardin Project provides for the construction and
organization of a large integrated tourism complex. Bernardin would have
2,500 beds and because of its location in Slovenia near Trieste would serve
a more competitive market. The organizational and financial arrange:ments
are very similar to those for the Babin Kuk Project.
28.  The Bernardin Project comprises a first-class hotel of 00 beds and annex
hotels of slightly lower standard with altogether 2,100 beds. Only the first-
class hotel will be open year-round. The site for the propect is the small
coastal promontory of Bernardin located to the west of the city of Portoroz
and 1.5 km from the ancient walled city of Piran.   Piran, an attraction in
itself, offers a summer festival of traditional music and is within easy accesu
by road and hovercraft from the major tourist centers of Trieste and Venice.
As in Babin Kuk, the project concept of a nucleus hotel with annexes permits
operational flexibility and offers potential economies. Management systems
will be developed with the assistance of management consultants.



-.8-
,ronsor and Borrower
29.  The project sponsor, "Emona", Proizvodnja, Trgovina, Turizem, Inzenirirg,
Ljubljana, was created by the merger in April 1970 of the enterprise "Prehrarna'"
an export and wholesale company, and "Agrokombinat Emlona", a large meat produccl.
It is the tenth largest Yugoslav trading firm. Emona's principal business is
the production, processing, distribution and sale of foodstuffs, but the
enterprise is widely diversified and also operates tour agencies, hotels and an
engineering firm. The management structure has depth and the top management
is experienced and dynamic.
30. The Borrower, Hotel "Bernardin", Piran, is, like Babin Kuk, a newly
established unit within the sponsor "Emona" with its own legal personality arid
an independent financial structure. The debts of the Borrower, including the
proposed Bank loan, will be guarantteed by the sponsor, but the Borrower will
have only limited liability for the obligations of Emona. A Statutory Agree-
ment and a Joint Venture Agreement set out in detail the relationship between
Emona and thes Borrower as required by Yugoslav law.
Financial Arrangements
31. The financial arructure of the project is shown in Annex IV. Ljubljanska
Banka, the cc-lender for this project, will lend the equivalent of $14.8 million
plus interest during construction to Emona. Of this, $5.5 million will be
invested in Hotel Bernardin as Emona's equity contribution to the joint venture.
The remaining $9.3 million will be re-lent to Hotel Bernardin under the same
terms and conditions as the loan to Emona. Cost overruns will be covered ei'l-er
by Emona or by Ljubljanska Banka, and the Ljubljanska Banka's rights will be
subordinated to the Bank's loan. The Borrower has undertaken no-t to carry oUJ
major new projects or incur debts beyond a certain limit without the Bank's
and Ljubljanska Banka's agreement. Hotel Bernardin will also qualify for
interest rate subsidies from the Republic of Slovenia. These subsidies will
reduce the effective interest rate paid by the project to 2.5 percent for the
dinar loan and to about 4.75 percent on the Bank loan.
Local Currency Financing and Procurement
32. The proposed loan of $10 million will cover $9.1 million or 38 percent of
the project cost plus $0.9 million of interest during construction. The foreign
exchange component is expected to lie between 24 and 38 percent of the project
cost, depending on the success of Yugoslav manufacturing and construction firms
in the bidding. Based on past experience, the most likely foreign exchange
component will be $6.9 million, or 29 percent, of the project cost. Thus it
is likely, as in the Babin Kuk project, that the Bank will finance some local
costs, estimated in this case at about $2.2 million.  The procurement arrange-
ments wculd be the same as for the Babin Kuk project (see para. 23 above).



-9-
Infrastructure and Ecology
33. The Bernardin project will require improvements in the road system
serving the Piran area and an expansion of the sewerage system. rhe realign-
ment of the road crossing the project site is part of the project and the
government has undertaken to see that the other necessary road improvements
will be carried out. The plan for the expansion of the sewerage system has
been based on pollution studies and assurances have been obtained that the
expansion will be completed in time for the opening of the project. The
government will also undertake a study for the relief of traffic congestion
and parking problems in Piran.
Economic Justification
34. The Slovenian coast attracts both stopover visitors and day visitors,
the latter mainly fran Italy.  This traffic is highly seasonal with most of
the visitors arriving by road. The proximity to the population centers of
Europe and the lower cost of accommodation offered, as compared with compe-
titive destinations in Italy, Austria and Germany, account for the rapid
growth of tourism in the region over the last few years. Because the potenbial
market is quite broad, this growth is expected to continue over the next
several years. Hotel Bernardin will have a number of competitive features in
attracting a share of this market, and with sound management is expected to
have a financial return of 8 percent. The economic rate of return, calculater7
in the same manner as Babin Kuk, would be about 13 percent.
FART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32. The draft Loan Agreements between the Bank and "Babin KukI' Hotelsko-
Turisticki Centar, Dubrovnik, and the Bank and Hoteli'Eernardin't, Piran, the
draft Guarantee Agreements between the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
and the Bank, and the draft Administration and Financing Agreements between
the Bank, "114inceta"i, Export-Import Inozemna Zastupstva, Dubrovnik, and Privredrna
Banka Zagreb, and between the Bank, "Emona", Proizvodnja, Trgovina, Turizem,
Inzeniring, Ljubljana and Ljubljanska Banka, Ljubljana, the Reports of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section h(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement, and the texts of resolutions approving the proposed loans are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
33. The draft Loan Agreements, in addition to covenants reflecting the
undertakings referred to in paragraphs 19, 20, 21, 30 and 31, contain
appropriate provisions concerning the maintenance of the Borrowers' status
as independent units. In the case of the Babin Kuk project, the Loan Agreemenit
also provides for the relending by the Borrower of a portion of the Loan, unde:r
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, to authorities of the City of
Dubrovnik for the purpose of carrying out a sewerage study anda traffic study.
34. Additional conditions of effectiveness of both Loan and Guarantee Agreemenits
include in respect of each project: (i) the employment of the Borrowerts Director,
of management consultants, and architectural and engineering consultants;
(ii) the establishment of the construction office; (iii) the acquisition of no3t



- 10 -
of the land required for the project; (iv) the execution of the loan
agreement for the financing from the co-lender; and (v) the completion of
all legal instruments relating to the establishment of the Borrower and its
financing by the sponsor.
35. Both Acldnistration and Financing Agreements provide for (i) the spoflsor?s
guarantee of' the Bank loan; (ii) the sponsor's and co-lender's overrun commit-
ment; (iii) subordination to the Bank loan of the debt financing made available
to the Borrower by the co-lender through the sponsor; (iv) the co-l'enders
waiver of any right it might have to claim repayment by the Borrower of the
sponsor's "equity" contribution to the Borrower; and (v) close cooperation
among the parties.
36. The Guarantee Agreements include the Guarantor's obligation to complete
or arrange to have completed the studies and infrastructure works essential
for the operation of the p ojects in time for the beginning of such operatioi.
37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMNT4DATION
38. I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loans.
