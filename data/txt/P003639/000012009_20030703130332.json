Regardless of success, and positive\n            lessons such as the strong Government support, and a good\n            synergy bringing in a great variety of poverty reduction\n            activities down to the township and village levels, some\n            negative lessons suggest the following. False expectations,\n            and funding mechanisms lead to design and implementation\n            distortions, i.e., funding and repayment arrangements should\n            be designed so that (a) the project beneficiaries receive\n            what they themselves say they want, and, (b) the scale of\n            the most cost-effective poverty reduction measures is not\n            reduced or eliminated solely because it is difficult to\n            determine who, or what level of government should repay.\n            Although participatory project design, and preparation was\n            excellent, and path breaking for its time, unfortunately,\n            the focus on community empowerment, and the participatory\n            approach was allowed to subside during implementation, and\n            in some cases was overruled by county technical bureaus used\n            to top-down planning. Furthermore, ethnic minorities\n            comprise an ever greater share of China's remaining\n            absolute poverty, and their needs, aspirations, and\n            background are often quite distinct from majority culture,\n            thus, it is essential that better mechanisms be developed to\n            ensure that ethnic minorities have full access to the entire\n            range of project benefits and, in particular, that ethnic\n            minority villages be in charge of their own project design,\n            preparation and implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
