The project will comprise the following\n            six components: 1) social services, including increasing the\n            access and quality of primary education and enhancing the\n            availability and delivery of primary and curative health\n            care; 2) labor mobility, through a voluntary system of\n            enhanced rural labor mobility for the upland absolute poor;\n            3) rural infrastructure, including the labor-intensive\n            construction of rural roads, safe drinking water supply\n            systems, small-scale irrigation, agricultural drainage\n            works, biogas digesters, and rural electrification; 4) land\n            and farmer development, using menus of crop and livestock\n            activities to increase upland agricultural productivity and\n            reverse the trend of environmental degradation; 5) Township\n            and Village Enterprise (TVE) development, through support\n            for TVEs consisting of investment credit for\n            labor-intensive, mineral, service and handicraft industries;\n            and 6) institution building and poverty monitoring."}, "docdt": "1995-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
