Section 3.02. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making
loans to, or with the guarantee of, its members not to seek, in
normal circumstances, special security from the member concerned
but to ensure that no other external debt shall have priority over
its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of for-
eign exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such
member. To that end, if any lien shall be created on any public
assets (as hereinafter defined), as security for any external
debt, which will or might result in a priority for the benefit of
the creditor of such external debt in the allocation, realization
or distribution of foreign exchange, such lien shall, unless the
Bank shall otherwise agree, ipso facto and at no cost to the Bank,
equally and ratably secure the principal of, and interest and
other charges on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in creating or per-
mitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision
to that effect; provided, however, that, if for any constitutional
or other legal reason such provision cannot be made with respect
to any lien created on assets of any of its political or admini-
strative subdivisions, the Borrower shall promptly and at no cost
to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other charges
on, the Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfac-
tory to the Bank.
(b) The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any
lien created on property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely
as security for payment of the purchase price of such property;
(ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course of banking transactions
and securing a debt maturing not more than one year after its date;
and (iii) any charges on the General Fund of the East African Com-
munity (hereinafter called the Community) securing a debt of the


﻿-9-
Community where the amount of the debt service on such debt in any
financing year together with other debt service on other debt of
the Community payable from such General Fund in such financial year
does not exceed 2% of the average of customs duties and excise
duties collected by the East African Customs and Excise Department
in the three financial years preceding such incurrence. For the
purposes of this paragraph, "debt service" shall include payments
of the principal of, and interest and other charges on, debt; and
any reference to incurring of debt shall include the assumption
and guarantee of debt and any renewal, extension or modification
of the terms of the debt or of the assumption or guarantee thereof.
