The key\n            objectives of the government program supported through a\n            series of proposed DPOs follow directly from a government\n            the program and the country assistance strategy (CAS) and\n            are: improving the investment climate for private sector-led\n            growth; improving fiscal sustainability of public service\n            delivery; and improving government effectiveness, following\n            the governance principles enumerated in the CAS. The\n            operation is likely to contribute to higher order\n            indicators, such as increased exports and private sector\n            investment, sustainable growth, and reduced corruption (over\n            a much longer time frame)."}, "docdt": "2007-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
