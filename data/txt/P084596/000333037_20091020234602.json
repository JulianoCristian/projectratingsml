follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: job creation\n            and employment projects must be opportunistic and flexible\n            in their selection of target groups and approach to job\n            brokerage services in order to be able to take advantage of\n            the changing realities of a country's labor market\n            context. Assistance and advice in connecting employees to\n            employers and matching skills to opportunities is often more\n            effective than providing a grant. Partnerships between\n            public sector employment services and private sector job\n            brokerage firms can be cost effective. Monitoring and\n            following up with employees and employers who have been\n            matched contributes to sustainability of employment and job\n            placements. Proactive and intensive supervision by the\n            Bank's team is crucial for the project success. Through\n            the provision of timely technical assistance during\n            implementation, the Bank's team can constructively and\n            substantively engages with the Government in policy reform\n            dialogue. Investment lending operations provide an\n            opportunity to understand sector policy issues and forge a\n            close relationship with the Government if supervision during\n            implementation is frequent and if project design reflects\n            Government ownership."}, "docdt": "2009-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
