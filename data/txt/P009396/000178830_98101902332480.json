 more effective pricing system for fertilizer. The credit\n            would be administered by the Bangladesh Agricultural\n            Development Corporation. A ministerial level fertilizer\n            coordinating committee has been established to improve the\n            planning for fertilizer procurement and distribution. Should\n            fertilizer consumption be reduced below expected levels\n            import arrivals would be rephased to assist in meeting FY81\n            requirements. The total amount would be utilized for\n            imported fertilizer (in bag or bulk), mostly for area and\n            TSP, but some DAP and MP may also be financed."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
