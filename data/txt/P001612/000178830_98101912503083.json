Malawi\n            in developing the economic potential of the Northern Region\n            by constructing and improving the major unpaved sections of\n            the principal North-South road. In addition to linking the\n            Northern with the more developed Central and Southern\n            Regions, the project would promote the maintenance of the\n            main, secondary and district road networks. Specifically,\n            the five-year project would finance the: (i) construction of\n            a two-land bituminous paved road between Jenda and Luwawa\n            Turnoff (32 km), and Mbowe and Ekwendeni (37 km) and\n            improvement of the existing road between Luwawa Turnoff and\n            Mbowe (100 km) to a low gravel standard; (ii) the second\n            phase of the District Road Improvement and Maintenance\n            Program (DRIMP); (iii) consulting services and training;\n            (iv) provision of road maintenance equipment; and (v)\n            facilities in Lilongwe for training semi-skilled MWS\n            personnel. With the project, direct road users would benefit\n            from cost savings in transport costs, which also would be\n            expected to benefit farmers, shippers and consumers in the\n            form of lower freight and passenger rates. The proposed\n            project also would strengthen and expand the\n            Government's road maintenance capacity as well as\n            improve the EPD's transport planning."}, "docdt": "1981-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
