FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Republic of Malawi
Beneficiary:           Ministry of Works and Supplies (MWS) and Economic
Planning Division (EPD)
Amount:                SDR 25.9 million
(US$33.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                 Standard
Project Description:  The proposed project would assist Malawi in developing
the economic potential of the Northern Region by con-
structing and improving the major unpaved sections
of the principal North-South road. In addition to
linking the Northern with the more developed Central
and Southern Regions, the project would promote the
maintenance of the main, secondary and district road
networks. Specifically, the five-year project would
finance the: (i) construction of a two-lane bituminous
paved road between Jenda and Luwawa Turnoff (32 km),
and Mbowe and Ekwendeni (37 km) and improvement of the
existing road between Luwawa Turnoff and Mbowe (100 km)
to a low gravel standard; (ii) the second phase of the
District Road Improvement and Maintenance Program
(DRIMP); (iii) consulting services and training; (iv)
provision of road maintenance equipment; and (v)
facilities in Lilongwe for training semi-skilled MWS
personnel. With the project, direct road users would
benefit from cost savings in transport costs, which also
would be expected to benefit farmers, shippers and
consumers in the form of lower freight and passenger
rates. The proposed project also would strengthen and
expand the Government's road maintenance capacity as
well as improve the EPD's transport planning. There are
no major risks to the road construction and improvement
program, although Government delays in providing suffi-
cient budgetary support for improvement and maintenance
would adversely affect the timely implementation of the
road program.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit tc the Republic of Malawi of SDR 25.9 million (approximately US$33.0
million equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance a Fourth Highway
Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Memorandum on the Economy of Malawi" (Report
No. 1677a-MAI) dated September 30, 1977, was circulated to the Executive
Directors on October 10, 1977. A Basic Economic Mission visited Malawi from
May 11, 1979 to June 15, 1979 and the report is currently under preparation.
3.        With a population of 5.7 million (1978) and an area of about
118,500 sq km, Malawi is relatively densely populated. Its main assets
are moderately fertile soils, good water resources and a climate favorable
to crop production. Unlike its neighbors, Malawi has no known substantial
mineral resources. Being landlocked, it has to depend on other countries
for access to the sea.
4.        Although Malawi has a GNP per capita of only US$200 and has been
identified by the United Nations as one of the world's poorest countries, its
progress since independence, measured against its natural resources, has been
significant. GDP at constant prices grew at an average annual rate of 6
percent between 1964 and 1979. During the same period, real growth of estate
agriculture and manufacturing exceeded 10 percent per annum and export volume
grew at 4.5 percent per annum. A steadily increasing investment rate (rising
from 9 percent of GDP at independence to 22 percent in 1979) has been supported
by heavy inflows of foreign private and public capital as well as by a sig-
nificant increase in domestic savings (from virtually nil in 1964 to 14
percent of GDP in 1979).
5.        Malawi's success in its development efforts has been due in large
part to realistic and purposeful planning by the Government. The country-s
long-term development policies for the period 1971-80 were outlined in the
"Statement of Development Policies 1971-80" (DEVPOL) which set out the
basic priorities for economic development. The Government is now in the
process of replacing the DEVPOL with a five-year development plan beginning
in 1981/82.
6.        As stated in DEVPOL, public investment has been intended primarily
to support private efforts in the directly productive sectors through provision
of essential infrastructure, public utilities and supporting services. In



- 2 -
addition, the Government has attached high priority to investments which
assist smallholder agriculture, as 90 percent of the population lives in
the rural areas and depends on agriculture for its livelihood. To this end,
the Government has undertaken a number of integrated rural development projects
in the past, and recently embarked on the National Rural Development Program,
an ambitious 20 year program designed eventually to extend agricultural
services to smallholders countrywide. The Government's decision to emphasize
directly productive sectors and related economic infrastructure, coupled with
limited amounts of financial and human resources, has resulted in slower
development of the social services such as health and education.
7.        While details of the new five-year plan's investment program are
unknown at present, the Government has already informed us of the broad
priorities for the sectoral allocation of resources: 30 percent of total
public investment expenditure is earmarked for agriculture, 35 percent for
transport, 10 percent for education, 9 percent for water and health, and 16
percent for other miscellaneous investments. These sectoral allocations
reflect the Government's continued emphasis on smallholder development and
transport and the increased importance it now attaches to manpower development.
8.        In 1977, a population census revealed that the country's population
grew at 2.9 percent per annum during the past decade. Projecting the same
growth rate for the remainder of the century, Malawi's population would almost
double by the year 2000. This high population growth rate has important
implications for the labor-land ratio. Malawi's population density, about 140
per sq km of agricultural land, already is among the highest in Africa, and by
the year 2000, will rise to 265 people per sq km. Over 35 percent of total
land area is classified as suitable for cultivation and the available arable
land area is almost fully utilized. The implications of Malawi's rapid
population growth have been discussed with the Government which, at this time,
opposes active population control measures. The Basic Economic Report will
further analyze these implications particularly in terms of the cost of social
services for a rapidly growing population and the Government's land-use
policy. Only about 9 percent of the total population lives in urban areas.
However, with the diversification of the economy, urban population is increas-
ing by more than 7 percent per annum, in line with the expansion of wage
employment opportunities in the non-agricultural sectors.
9.        Notwithstanding Malawi's impressive economic performance over
the past 15 years, its economy, heavily dependent on two primary commodity
exports (tea and tobacco), has remained highly vulnerable to international
price fluctuations. Since 1974, the country has experienced periodic balance
of payments disequilibria of increasing severity due primarily to (a) rapid
escalation in import prices, particularly of fuel and intermediate and capital
goods; (b) cyclical swings in export prices of tobacco and tea; and (c) sig-
nificantly higher costs of transport for both exports and imports owing to
rising ocean freight charges, port congestion in Beira and Nacala, and disrup-
tions of overland transport.



- 3 -
10.       While the Government successfully steered the economy through
balance of payments crises in the past, the deterioration in the balance
of payments since 1978 has been less manageable, primarily due to a 20
percent fall in the terms of trade between 1977 and 1979 when export prices
fell 5 percent (due mainly to declines in tea and tobacco prices) and
import prices rose about 15 percent. The fuel import bill doubled from
MK25 million in 1977 to an estimated MK49 million in 1979.  The growing trade
deficit was exacerbated by a doubling of the negative balance for non-factor
services, due mainly to rising transport costs. In 1978 and 1979 Malawi-s
current account deficit reached 12 and 15 percent of GDP in contrast to the
7-8 percent average experienced since independence. Because capital inflows
have not been sufficient to cover the current account deficits, Malawi has
also experienced a sharp drop in foreign exchange reserves. Between end-1977
and end-1979, gross official reserves fell from MK76 million to MK51 million
(from the equivalent of four months to one and a half months of imports).
Over the same period, net official reserves fell from MK37 million to minus
MK29 million. In the first half of 1980, the country's external position
deteriorated further, owing to a shortfall in the 1979/80 season's maize crop,
which has led to emergency grain imports and a sharp drop in the average
auction price of flue-cured tobacco which constitutes a large part of Malawi's
tobacco crop.
11.       In the past, the Government has approached the energy problem
through its pricing and tax policies to restrain demand and through its invest-
ments aimed at identifying and developing energy resources. Oil imports have
been subject to tariffs at 30 to 60 percent rates and retail prices have been
set at levels which reflected the cost of fuel imports plus tax. In connection
with fuelwood which represents some 80 percent of the country's domestic
energy consumption, the Government has undertaken to increase wood prices
gradually to levels which reflected production costs. The Government has also
launched projects in wood energy and ethanol production. At the Government's
request, the Bank plans to conduct an energy sector study that would survey
the available resources, project future demand and supply, examine alternative
sources of energy and explore possibilities for intersectoral substitution.
12.       Malawi's fiscal position has also seriously deteriorated over the
past two years. From independence through FY78, government expenditures and
revenues expanded roughly in line with the increases in GDP; while deficits
grew larger, they still did not exceed 7-8 percent of GDP. In the past two
years, expenditure growth has outstripped the increase in revenues by more
than 40 percent. The share of government deficits in GDP averaged 10 percent
during 1978 and 1979. With the increased deficits came an increased reliance
on domestic borrowing mainly from the monetary system, and on foreign borrow-
ing, partly on commercial terms. At the same time, inflationary pressures
grew and the balance of payments position deteriorated. Prices rose at an
average rate of 10 percent per annum during 1978 and 1979.
13.       Faced with these problems, the Government in 1979 initiated a series
of short-term corrective measures which included a two and a half year stand-by
arrangement with the IMF amounting to US$32.9 million (SDR 26.3 million).
Malawi also obtained US$23.8 million (SDR 19.0 million) from the compensatory
financing facility and a US$7.1 million (SDR 5.7 million) loan from the Trust



- 4 -
Fund. Unfortunately, a drought and a complete stoppage of all overland
external transport owing to political unrest in Mozambique during November
and December 1979 forced termination of the stand-by arrangement since the
Government could not meet some of the performance criteria.
14.       A new two year arrangement, drawing on the second to fourth tranches
for US$64.8 million (SDR 49.9 million), was approved in May 1980. The two-
year program, which coincides with Malawi's fiscal years 1981 and 1982, aims
at constraining demand and limiting the balance of payments current account
deficit to US$195 million in FY81 and US$169 million in FY82. The performance
criteria involved phased ceilings on total domestic credit and on net bank
credit to Government and a limit on government (or government guaranteed)
external borrowing of 1 - 12 years maturity.
15.       After successfully negotiating the two-year IMF stand-by arrangement,
the Government in April 1980 formally requested Bank assistance for a Structural
Adjustment loan. A reconnaissance mission in May made a preliminary assessment
of the economy and reviewed the corrective measures which the Government had
taken already or was intending to take. An appraisal mission visited the
country during August-September, 198C.
16.       Because of the Governnment's limited abilicy to mobilize resources,
the sizeable expansion of Malawi's development program over the past decade
has been largely assisted by increased public capital inflows. The net
contribution from foreign official sources to the financing of public invest-
ment increased from US$17 million in FY68 to about US$103 million in FY79,
of which US$23 million were grants. However, in contrast with earlier expe-
riences, over 35 percent of the FY79 capital flows were on commercial terms.
Such commercial borrowing will have a pronounced effect on future debt ser-
vicing (see para 17). The sources have also been gradually diversified. At
independence, Britain was virtually the only source. By 1979 the British
contribution had declined to less than 15 percent; multilateral sources,
especially IDA, provided about 45 percent, and a variety of bilateral sources,
notably Canada, Federal Republic of Germany and the United States, accounted
for most of the remainder.
17.       By the end of 1979, Malawi's external public debt totalled US$606
million, of which US$423 million had been disbursed. Debt service in 1979
amounted to US$25 million, equivalent to about 10 percent of exports of goods
and services. At the end of 1978, the Bank's and the combined IDA/Bank shares
in Malawi's disbursed debt were 4 percent and 32 percent, respectively, and
service on the Bank Group debt accounted for 7.1 percent of total debt service.
In 1985, the IDA/Bank share in total disbursed debt is projected to be 30
percent and the service on Bank Group debt to be 10 percent of the total debt
service. There has been considerable hardening of the average terms of lending
in the past few years; the average grant element of official assistance fell
from the 80 percent level of 1971-1975 to 48 percent in 1978 and 23 percent in
1979. On the basis of loans committed by the end of 1979 and on additional
capital requirements for the period 1980-85, Malawi's debt service ratio is
projected to reach 23 percent in 1985 (as compared with 8 percent in 1978



and 10 percent in 1979). Despite being a poor country, Malawi has been making
reasonable efforts to mobilize domestic resources to fund both its private
and public investments. Domestic share of development expenditures amounted
to 22 percent in 1979. However, this share is unlikely to rise in the near
future, as the expansion of the Government's investment program required to
achieve a reasonable rate of economic growth and the consequent need for
recurrent expenditures for operations and maintenance will absorb the bulk of
additional tax revenues. Foreign exchange will remain a significant require-
ment in maintaining imports. Hence, external financing will be called upon to
cover a substantial portion of total project lost, including some local cost
financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAWI
18.       Over the past 15 years Malawi has received 21 IDA credits totalling
US$183.2 million and four Bank loans totalling US$29.2 million, of which
two were on Third Window terms. Of the total Bank Group assistance, US$98.2
million (46 percent) was for agriculture, US$37.8 million (18 percent) for
power development, US$32.4 million (15 percent) for education, US$32 million
(15 percent) for roads, US$3 million (1 percent) for a development finance
company (INDEBANK) and the balance of US$9 million (5 percent) for water
supply and for feasibility studies for a pulp mill. The first Bank loan to
Malawi was made on Third Window Terms in June 1976 and the first standard Bank
loan in April 1977. IFC's investments in Malawi consist of a loan of US$6
million made in 1976 for a textile mill, another of US$9 million for sugar
development in 1977, a US$6 million equity investment in INDEBANK in 1979 and
a US$2.0 million loan to Malawi Hotels Limited for tourism in 1979. A US$.26
million equity investment and a loan of US$1.7 million for production of
ethanol from molasses were approved in July 1980. A summary statement of Bank
Group operations and notes on the execution of ongoing projects are provided
in Annex II. Project implementation has been satisfactory.
19.       During the next five years, Bank Group assistance in Malawi will
continue to emphasize rural development and agriculture, education, water
supply and roads. The third phase of the National Rural Development Program
already has been appraised. Preparation of a second-phase water supply
project for Lilongwe and selected rural areas has begun. Structural Adjustment
lending also is expected to figure prominently over the next three years.
Preparation of the first Structural Adjustment credit is well advanced.
Possible investments in energy, health and development finance companies are
also being investigated.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
20.       Malawi's major transport arteries include a 11,300 km road network
which is fairly well developed south of the capital, Lilongwe, but undeveloped
in the northern half of the country; a 650 km rail system in the southern half
of the country which is used mainly for export-import and transit traffic; lake



-6-
transport which serves the north and compensates to some extent for the un-
developed land transport links; and air transport at four airports. The
main outlet to the sea for Malawi's external trade is by the railway through
Mozambique to the ports of Beira and Nacala. Frequent disruptions in service
because of insurgency problems in Mozambique as well as operational problems
(line and equipment) of the Mozambique railway and at the sea ports have led
to interruptions of traffic and problems with importing essential materials,
particularly fuel, in recent years. Malawi Railways, a parastatal, operates
not only the railways but also a road freight service and the freight and
passenger transport system on Lake Malawi. Another parastatal, Air Malawi,
provides international and domestic air services.
21.       Road transport dominates internal travel although the topography in
parts of the country makes provision and maintenance of transport facilities
difficult and costly. Approximately 3,000 km of main roads (about 1,600
bituminous paved) connect principal cities and towns, and about 2,500 km of
secondary roads (about 200 km bituminous paved) link smaller centers to main
roads. There are also around 5,000 km of district feeder roads and another
1,000 km of roads serving individual towns and agricultural estates. Over 85
percent of the paved and improved roads are located in the southern half of
the country reflecting the regional imbalances. In 1978, the vehicle fleet
totalled just under 27,000 or 4.8 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, which is
above average for Eastern Africa but less than half of Kenya's vehicle owner-
ship rate. The fleet consists of 13,500 passenger cars, 300 buses, 13,100
trucks and light commercial vehicles; in addition there are 4,230 motorcycles
and 7,000 other vehicles. Overall, the fleet has been growing at around 10
percent per annum since 1973. Road transport services are dominated by small
operators and are regulated by the Road Traffic Commissioner in the Ministry
of Transport and Communications (MTC) through the issuance of licenses for
specific roads. Vehicle dimension and weight regulations are adequate,
and enforcement of the regulations by the MTC and the national police has
improved considerably during the past few years, partly as a result of a
covenant agreed under the Second Highway Project.
Transport Policy and Coordination
22.       Malawi's transport policy has three broad objectives:  (a) to
improve the administrative and socioeconomic integration of the country by
linking the Northern, Central and Southern Regions with reliable all-weather
road connections; (b) to support rural development by improving access to rural
areas; and (c) to provide efficient links with external transport routes
leading to Indian Ocean ports. Substantial progress has been made on (a) and
(c), and the District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program is now
underway to address (b). In accordance with the high priority assigned to the
transport sector, the Government plans to allocate some 35 percent of its
total five-year capital investment program to continue to improve regional
road links and the lakeshore road, to extend the feeder road network to handle
a larger volume of agricultural output,and to improve external links through
continued investment in the railway.



23.       Responsibility for coordinating transport investments is vested
in the Economic Planning Division (EPD) in the Office of the President and
Cabinet which annually reviews the operational plans of the Ministry of
Works and Supplies (MWS) for roads and the MTC for all other transport modes.
In the past effective coordination of transport investment has been lacking
due to staffing constraints and limited intersectoral planning. Consequently,
the various transport modes have been developing independently although
primarily in a complementary rather than competitive fashion. Recent heavy
investments in railways and possible future competition between road and lake
transport make it essential that EPD's transport planning capability be
strengthened immediately. The Government has requested the Bank to provide
technical assistance in transport planning and in financing the overseas
training of local staff who will man the transport unit in the projects
section of the EPD (para. 34). At present, the unit is staffed by one pro-
fessional officer who requires further training and assistance in developing
an effective system for transport planning and evaluation.
Road Administration and Training
24.       The MWS, through its Roads Department, is responsible for the
construction and maintenance of all classified roads (main and secondary)
while the District Councils have primary responsibility for district roads.
In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources is responsible
for 1,600 km of forestry and national park roads and tracks. The organization
of the MWS and its Roads Department is satisfactory. MWS has three major
functional units at headquarters in Lilongwe: Administration (including
financing), Engineering, and Development (largely planning). The Roads
Department within the Engineering unit is staffed by 11 civil engineers
and 1 transport economist who plan and oversee the road work carried out by
divisional offices in the three regions. The divisional offices are headed
by a civil engineer and are responsible for road construction and other works.
The regional offices are supported by 4 branch offices, 14 district depots
and 48 subdistrict depots for road maintenance.
25.       Altogether MWS has around 60 professional staff and 100 supervisory
and sub-professional staff. Localization of MWS has proceeded slowly but
satisfactorily. At present 5 of the 8 most senior MWS posts and 8 of the
12 professional posts in the Road's Department are filled by Malawians.
Nevertheless, around 100 professional/sub-professional posts are staffed by
expatriates. The Government places high priority on educating/training its
nationals for professional positions but due to the shortage of qualified
candidates, the program has not fulfilled the high demand for Malawians.
Much of the professional training is provided abroad through externally
funded programs (ODA, EEC, etc.,) which to date have provided sufficient
training opportunities for suitably qualified candidates. In the meantime,
the Malawi Polytechnic has been developing its technical training capabilities.
Substantial progress has been achieved in training of lower levels
of personnel (foremen, road supervisors, mechanics) whose skills are essential
in implementing road maintenance and construction programs. The MWS-s train-
ing program has been carried out in the Zomba Training Center. While the



- 8 -
availability of lower level technical and administrative Malawi staff to be
trained and quality of training in the Zambia center are adequate, expanded
facilities are needed to keep pace with increasing demand for trained staff.
The proposed project would assist the Government in relocating and building
new training facilities in Lilongwe for the training of Road Department staff
(para. 36).
Maintenance
26.       Responsibility for maintaining the main and secondary roads system
rests at the headquarters level with the Roads Department and at the regional
level with three regional divisions of the MWS. The divisions have a well-
trained staff of maintenance personnel which utilizes mechanized technology
for periodic maintenance while routine maintenance is basically labor intensive.
Equipment is rented by the Roads Department from the Plant and Vehicle Hire
organization (also under MWS), which procures and maintains all Government-
owned equipment and vehicles. Equipment availability and utilization rates
are satisfactory, and rental rates are reasonable.
27.       Road users contribute to government revenue through taxes and
duties on fuel, lubricants, vehicles and spare parts, and through license and
registration fees. 1/ In FY78, total revenue from road users amounted to
US$15.0 million equivalent, whereas during the same period total expenditures
for administering and maintaining the road network totalled US$3.5 million
equivalent. Road usage taxation, therefore, contributes greatly to the
Government budget. In the past, Malawi has adequately maintained its roads
system while allocating around 10 percent of its annual highway budget for
mainte-^""e. More recently, however, maintenance provisions have not kept
pace with inflation and the growth and wear of the road network.
28.       The revenues for the District Councils for maintenance are aldo
inadequate. To provide a basis for establishing adequate roads maintenance
organizations in all of the country's 24 Districts, a pilot District Roads
Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP) was begun in the Kasungu District
in 1974 under the IDA-financed Second Highway Project. The scheme led to the
successful establishment of an improvement and maintenance unit responsible
for all maintenance operations in the district and the training of road staff
and foremen; the pilot program was subsequently extended to three additional
districts. Altogether 1,100 km of district roads are being improved to
a minimum all-weather standard. The proposed project would finance the second
phase extension of the DRIMP to 10 additional districts (para. 33).
1/   The pump price of gasoline is US$0.88 per liter and US$0.80 per liter for
diesel; equivalent import prices are US$0.48 and US$0.45 respectively.
There is a 24 percent surtax on all fuel. The normal duty on gasoline is
US$0.06 per liter and on diesel, US$0.03 per liter; however in 1979
during a period of fuel shortage in Malawi, an additional fuel levy of
US$0.18 per liter was imposed on gasoline and diesel, and this levy is
still in force although the supply of fuel is back to normal.

Previous Bank Group Involvement
29.       The Bank Group's involvement in Malawi-s highway subsector dates
back to 1966 when Credit S-2-MAI was made to help finance detailed engineering
design of the Zomba-Lilongwe road (290 km). The First Highway Project (IDA
Credit 112-MAI: US$11.5 million) was approved in 1968, and provided for the
construction of the Zomba-Lilongwe road and the financing of studies on road
transport licensing and road-rail coordination. The Performance Audit Report
on the project indicated that the objectives of the project were achieved.
Although implementation of road construction fell one year behind schedule,
the internal rate of return was re-evaluated at 13 percent, against 12 percent
at appraisal, and traffic generation was 50 percent greater than projected.
The Second Highway Project (Credit 523-MAI: US$10.0 million) of 1974 assisted
construction of the Lilongwe-Kasungu road (113 km) and initiated the DRIMP
pilot scheme. Both components have been completed and substantial cost
savings realized on the construction component are being used to finance the
first phase extension of DRIMP into three other districts. The Third Highway
Project financed by Credit 758-MAI of 1977 (US$10.5 million) covered construc-
tion of the Kasungu-Jenda road (85 km) and a feasibility study and detailed
engineering design of the Jenda-Mzuzu road. The road construction was
completed in October 1980, a few months behind schedule.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The proposed project was prepared by the Malawi Government with
the assistance of consultants and the Association. The project was identified
in February 1977 and appraised in February 1980. A report entitled "Fourth
Highway Project-Staff Appraisal Report," No. 3019a-MAI, dated December 22,
1980 is being distributed separately. The negotiations were held in Washington,
D.C. from December 1 to 3, 1980. The Malawi delegation was led by Mr. J. R.
Phiri, Under Secretary in the Ministry of Finance. Annex III provides supple-
mentary project data.
Project Objectives and Description
31.       The proposed project would assist the Government in:  extending
the benefits of development to the relatively less developed Northern Region;
achieving a more balanced distribution of resources between rural and urban
areas by improving and maintaining the largely neglected district roads;
starting to redress the country's deteriorating road maintenance performance
by ensuring that adequate local resources are provided by the Government to
maintain the road network; and strengthening the transport planning capacity
of EPD. The project would assist the Government over a five-year period
(FY8l-85) to reach these objectives by:
(a) constructing a two-lane bituminous paved road between Jenda
and Luwawa Turnoff (32 km) and Mbowe and Ekwendeni (37 km),
and improving the existing Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe section
(100 km) to a low gravel standard;



- 10 -
(b) financing the second phase of DRIMP;
(c) providing consulting services and training;
(d) providing road maintenance equipment to the Roads Department;
and
(e) financing facilities in Lilongwe for training of semi-skilled
MWS personnel.
Detailed Features
32.       Construction and Improvement of the Main North-South Road.  Con-
struction to a paved standard of the Jenda-Luwawa Turnoff and Mbowe-Ekwendeni
sections and upgrading of the Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe section to all weather-low
gravel standard would substantially complete the development of the 1,100 km
North-Sownh roJ i.unning trom Bangula in the deep south to Karonga in the far
north; only the 100 km upgraded Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe road section would
remain unpaved. The linking of the Northern Region with the more developed
Central and Southern Regions would helD to redress the regicnal imbalances
by ensuring the timely availability of agricultural inputs and the regular
collection of crops. At present construction of the Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe
section to a paved standard is not justified because of low traffic levels
and high construction costs due to the hilly terrain. However, the Government
is in the process of reviewing the alternative uses of the wood resources of
the Viphya forests which adjoin the unpaved road section. Some 24,000 hectares
of pine have been planted for an eventual pulp and/or timber industry.
Prompted by the growing burden of maintaining the now unutilized Viphya forest
and the importance of securing financial backing for developing the Viphya
forestry resources, the Government (through ODA) is carrying out a study of
the entire forestry sector, looking at possible uses, particularly saw-milling
and manufacturing particle board. In addition, the German Government is
financing a feasibility study of a pulp mill to meet domestic and possibly
regional demand. Results of the studies, which are expected to be made
available in late FY81, should enable the Government to identify the most
economic uses of the country's forest resources. Depending on the outcome of
the studies and the Government's decisions on Viphya, construction to a paved
standard of the remaining 100 km of road section may become economically
justified at a later time. In the meantime, upgrading the Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe
section to a low gravel standard to permit regular maintenance would be needed
for it to withstand the effects of forecast traffic until full reconstruction
becomes viable.
33.       Second Phase of DRIMP.  The proposed project would extend the
first phase of DRIMP to ten additional districts. Selection of the roads to
be improved and planning for maintenance units in these districts is being
carried out by consultants. The project would provide for establishing
and equipping maintenance units in each district, including a depot, housing
for key staff and staff training, and the improvement of some 2,600 km



- 11 -
of district roads. The work program for establishing the maintenance units
and the roads to be improved for the first year was agreed during negotiations.
It was further agreed that for subsequent years, the Government, not later
than four months before the beginning of each fiscal year, would furnish to
the Association for its concurrence, the proposed work program for that fiscal
year until completion of this project component (Section 3.07 of the draft
Credit Agreement). The second phase of DRIMP also would assist the Government
in meeting the maintenance needs of the District Councils by financing on a
declining basis the incremental costs for district road maintenance (para.
39). Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government would make
available to the District Councils, on a grant basis, the funds necessary
to maintain the roads in the districts covered under DRIMP, to the extent the
resources available to the Councils for this purpose from their own resources
are not sufficient. The Government would review with the Association, not
later than four months before the beginning of each fiscal year, the amounts
to be made available to the District Councils for this purpose during such
year (Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Credit Agreement). The system of Govern-
ment assistance and the allocations needed during the project period have been
agreed with Government. In order for the second phase of DRIMP to start
immediately following completion of the first phase and because of the long
lead time to construct the depots and housing in the first three districts of
DRIMP's second phase, retroactive financing is needed from July 1, 980 (para.
39). The preparation for the third phase of DRIMP is being carried out by
Government selected consultants.
34.       Consulting Services and Training.  The proposed project includes
consulting services to: (a) supervise the road construction and improvement
program on the North-South road; (b) assist MWS in carrying out the second
phase of DRIMP and in preparing the third phase of DRIMP; (c) strengthen EPD's
transport planning capacity; and (d) undertake a study of road maintenance
needs. For the purposes of transport planning, agreement was reached with
the Government during negotiations that a transport economist, with qualifica-
tions and experience satisfactory to the Association, would be appointed by
the Government by December 31, 1981 (Section 3.02 of the draft Credit Agreement).
The transport economist would work with the head of the Transport Unit of EPD
in developing a transport planning system. It was also agreed that the
Government would select about three staff members of EPD whose qualifications
and proposed training program were satisfactory to the Association; the first
such candidate would be selected by June 1, 1981 and the remaining candidates
by December 31, 1981 (Section 3.09 of the draft Credit Agreement). These
candidates would return to the Transport Section after two years of overseas
training under a five-year bonding arrangement. The comprehensive maintenance
study would provide the basis for identifying the road maintenance needs in
Malawi over a five-year period and the technical, financial and manpower
resources required to meet those needs. The terms of reference have been
agreed with Government. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Government would carry out the study by May 31, 1982 (Section 3.08 draft
Credit Agreement) and exchange views with the Association on its findings and
recommendations. On the basis of the study, the Government would establish a
rolling five-year maintenance program satisfactory to the Association.
Thereafter, the Government would, not later than four months before the
beginning of each fiscal year, until five years after the project is completed,



- 12 -
enchange views with the Association on the maintenance program and budgetary
allocations to it (Section 4.02 (b) of the draft Credit Agreement). In the
interim, prior to the completion of the study, to ensure that the existing
road network is properly maintained, agreement was reached during negotiations
on the level of funding to be allocated in FY82 and FY83 for maintenance of
tne main and secondary road network and roads improved under DRIMP.
35.       Road Maintenance Equipment.  Although any substantial strengthening
of MWS-s maintenance capacity must await the results of the maintenance study,
the project provides financing for a few key items of maintenance equipment,
mainly for repair of bituminous pavements.
36.       Training Center Facilities.  The first phase of the relocation of
the MWS training branch from Zomba is to provide for the construction and
equipping of new MWS training facilities in Lilongwe including staff houses,
classrooms and dormitories with a capacity for about 25 trainees; altogether
50 Roads Department staff will be trained annually. Relocation near MWS head-
quarters would facilitate continuous supervision of training activities and
use of existing MWS facilities and of professionals as part-time instructors.
Project Cost and Financing
37.       The total project cost inclusive of taxes and duties is estimated
at US$42.2 million equivalent, of which about US$26.7 million, or 63 percent,
would be foreign costs. Details of project costs are included in the Credit
and Project Summary. The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 25.9 million (around
US$33.0 million equivalent) would finance about 84 percent of total costs
net of taxes or duties - 100 percent (US$26.7 million) of the foreign exchange
costs and US$6.3 million of local costs. The Government would provide the
remaining 16 percent (US$6.2 million) of project costs. The justification for
local cost financing is found in para. 17 above. Total project costs include
10 percent physical contingencies, and price contingencies on foreign
components of 10.7 percent in 1980, declining to 7 percent in 1983, and, on
the local component 12 percent in 1980 and 1981 and 10 percent in subsequent
years.
Procurement and Disbursements
38.       MWS would be responsible for project implementation apart from the
technical assistance for transport planning for which EPD will be responsible..
Civil works contracts for road construction and improvements (US$21.0 million)
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Contracts for civil works consisting
of depots and housing for DRIMP and new MWS training center facilities (US$2.5
million), which, due to their small sizes and widely dispersed locations,
would not attract ICB, would be awarded after local competitive bidding or, if
unsuccessful, the works would be constructed by force account. In order to
train local staff in the districts, improvement and maintenance works under
DRIMP-s second phase (US$4.5 million) would be by force account. Consultants
employed by the Government to supervise road construction (about 130 person-
months), assist in the implementation of the second phase of DRlMP (about 90
person-months) and the preparation of DRIMP-s third phase (about 15 person-
months), carry out the maintenance study (around 55 person-months) and provide



- 13 -
technical support to EPD's transport planning unit (about 30 person-months),
would be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association
(Section 3.02 of the Draft Development Credit Agreement). Approximately 320
person-months of consulting services estimated to cost US$3.7 million are
required, at an average of about US$8,850 per month for direct costs. Local
transport, otfice and supporting services raise this figure to US$11,560.
These costs are based on recent consultants' contracts with Government. The
equipment for maintenance of bituminous pavements (US$140,000) would be
procured through local shopping. To maintain standardization and interchange-
ability between districts as well as with MWS, equipment for the second phase
of DRIMP (US$940,000) would be purchased through local shopping.
39.       Proceeds from the proposed credit would be disbursed on the follow-
ing basis: (i) 80 percent of total expenditures for construction and improve-
ments on the Jenda-Ekwendeni road; (ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures
and 90 percent of local expenditures for vehicles, equipment and spare parts;
(iii) 70 percent of expenditures on civil works (depots and housing) for
DRIMP's second phase and on civil works for MWS's new training center; (iv) 60
percent of expenditures on civil works for district roads' improvements under
DRIMP's second phase; (v) 85 percent of total expenditures for consultants'
services; (vi) for incremental maintenance expenditures on district roads;
for each district being brought into the maintenance program, subsequent to
completion of road improvements: 75 percent of incremental expenditures
during the first year of maintenance; 50 percent during the second year of
maintenance; and 25 percent during the third year of maintenance; and (vii)
100 percent of foreign expenditures for overseas training. Retroactive
financing is recommended for up to US$350,000 to meet 70 percent of the costs
of depots and housing for the first three districts of DRIMP's second phase
and up to US$230,000 to meet the foreign exchange component of consultants'
fees for the preparation of DRIMP's second phase. A schedule of estimated
disbursements is provided in the Credit and Project Summary.
Project Accounts and Reports
40.       Separate project accounts would be maintained by MWS for each
component. It was agreed during negotiations that these accounts would be
audited by the Auditor General or other independent auditors acceptable to the
Association and the audit report furnished to the Association not later than
six months after the end of the fiscal year (Section 4.01 (c) of the draft
Credit Agreement). Agreement was also reached that the Government would
monitor the progress of the project and that after completion, the Government
would prepare and submit to the Association a full report on the execution of
the project (Section 3.04 (d) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
41.       The proposed project would yield an overall economic rate of return
of 18 percent; 19 percent for the road construction and improvement component.
The three road sections to be paved show individual rates of return of 13 percEnt
(Jenda-Luwawa Turnoff, 32 km), 16 percent (Mbowe-Mzuzu, 17 km) and 30 percent
(Mzuzu-Ekwendeni, 20 km). The sections to be improved to gravel standard, Luwawa



- 14 -
Turnoff-Kalungulu (42.5 km) and Champhoya-Mbowe (47 km), would yield rates of
return of 11 percent and 18 percent, respectively, and the section to be
gravelled, Kalungulu-Champhoya (10.5 km) shows a rate of return of 55 percent.
These rates were derived by comparing the cost of construction, improvement
and maintenance with quantifiable benefits resulting from lower vehicle
operating and road maintenance costs.  Traffic on the above road sections is
assumed to grow at 7 percent per annum in accordance with recent traffic
counts. By 1983, when construction of the road is expected to be completed,
traffic would vary from 83 vpd on the Luwawa Turnoff-Kalungulu section to 395
vpd on the Mzuzu-Ekwendeni section. This includes normal and diverted traffic,
plus generated traffic on the paved road sections equivalent to 10 percent of
the expected traffic level in 1983 without the improvements, as well as
traffic generated from agricultural projects at the northern and southern ends
of the road. In the first instance the project benefits would accrue primarily
to road users; however, in view of the competitive nature of the road trans-
port industry, the benefits are expected to be passed on through lower freight
rates to the population areas adjoining the road. Within the zones of influ-
ence of the project road are several development projects, including two
projects financed by the Association, the Second Karonga Rural Development
Project, and the National Rural Development Projects in the districts of
Karonga, Chitipa, Mzimba and Rumphi. Tobacco, rice and tea cultivation
schemes would also be indirectly served by the road.
42.       The project would also assist in extending DRIMP to ten additional
districts for the improvement and subsequent maintenance of about 2,600 km
of district roads. These roads would be selected according to socioeconomic
criteria and would have a rate of return of at least 12 percent. Benefits
from the works are expected to be in the form of savings in vehicle operating
costs and increases in agricultural production made possible by easier access
to farms and markets. Benefits from the reduced transport costs would accrue
initially to road transporters; there is adequate competition to ensure that
these lower costs would be passed on to the farmers in the roads- zone of
influence who would also benefit from the increased agricultural production
made possible by improved roads. The only major risk to the expansion of
DRIMP is the availability of Government's financial resources for maintenance.
To minimize the risk, agreement was reached during negotiations on Government
financing of maintenance costs; the Association would help to cushion the
burden by financing, on a declining basis, the incremental maintenance costs
for DRIMP.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided

C. BANK PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. S-17-MAI      Transport Engineering and Services Project; US$2.0
Million Credit of June 13, 1974; Date of Effective-
ness: August 28, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project helps determine the infrastructural requirements
and provides technical assistance for the exploitation of the Viphya forest
resources. Necessary transportation studies and the design of the required
transport facilities have been completed. Part of the credit proceeds that
remained were used to assist in putting together a financial package for
the proposed mill. The package is still incomplete, however, and the pro-
posed project is still being analyzed by the Government. The Closing Date
was extended to June 30, 1981.
Credit No. 523-MAI       Second Highway Project; US$10.0 Million Credit
of December 19, 1974; Date of Effectiveness;
February 21, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project consists of reconstructing to two-lane bituminous
paved standard the Lilongwe-Kasungu road (about 70 miles), including a
bypass around the Lilongwe industrial area and reconstructing the Ligadzi
bridge; and a pilot program in one district for improving development and
maintenance of district roads. Construction works for the main road are
complete and savings of approximately US$3.5 million were realized for this
component. Results from the pilot program for district roads improvement
and maintenance indicate clearly that the program has been successful and
that it is feasible to extend it to other districts. The savings from the
reconstruction component are being used to extend the pilot program to three
additional districts; accordingly the Credit Agreement was amended by letter
of June 9, 1978 and the Closing Date was extended to June 30, 1982.
Credit No. 590-MAI       Second Education Project; US$11.6 Million Credit
of November 24, 1975; Date of Effectiveness;
February 24, 1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The project provides for constructing 22 model primary schools
as examples for replication by communities and facilities at the schools
for a rural education program; it establishes a new primary teacher college;
adds practical subjects in selected secondary schools with emphasis on
facilities to increase female enrollment. As costs permitted, the project
scope was enlarged to include computer facilities for the Malawi Certificate
Examination and Testing Board and additional staff housing. All contracts
have been awarded and, except for additional housing and minor additional
construction, the project has been substantially completed. The Bank is
reviewing a government request to extend the Closing Date by six months to
permit completion of all contracts.

ANNEX II
Loan No. 1286-MAI         Second Karonga Rural Development Project;
US$9.2 Million Loan of June 24, 1976; Date of
Effectiveness: August 18, 1976; Closing Date
March 31, 1981
The project, financed on Third Window terms, consists of seasonal-
and medium-term credit to farmers, extension service, market complexes,
health facilities, boreholes and other infrastructural facilities, agri-
cultural and hydrological research, preparatory investments for the National
Rural Development Programme, and rehabilitation of berthing facilities at
Chipoka lake terminal. Improvement of Chipoka harbor has been completed.
Although understaffing hampers implementation efficiency in some parts of
Chitipa district and there have been small cost increases, the project's
progress is satisfactory.
Credit No. 711-MAI       Blantyre Water Supply Project; US$7.0 Million
Credit of June 3, 1977; Date of Effectiveness;
April 18, 1978; Closing Date: March 31, 1982
Initial delays in project implementation occurred mainly to avoid
interference with an ongoing UK-financed water supply project and also be-
cause of the Government's decision to revise the scope of the project, with
the approval of IDA. Project implementation is now proceeding reasonably
well; detailed engineering is substantially complete; bid documents have
been issued and awards made on three of the four contracts being financed
by the Association with the award of the fourth contract expected shortly.
However, due to the initial delay, commissioning of the works is now scheduled
for late 1982, rather than December 1980 estimated at appraisal.
Credit No. 758-MAI       Third Highway Project; US$10.5 Million Credit of
January 18, 1978; Date of Effectiveness: June 29,
1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project consists of constructing the 52-mile Kasungu-Jenda
road to two-lane bituminous surfaced standard; strengthening three short
sections of the Zomba-Lilongwe road; and providing consultant services
for the supervision of the roads, and for the feasibility and engineering
studies of the Jenda-Mzuzu road. Construction works on the Kasungu-Jenda
road are almost completed, and strengthening works on the Zomba-Lilongwe
road are well underway. Studies for the Jenda-Mzuzu road are nearing
completion, and consultants are preparing tender documents.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 823-MAI       Shire Valley Agricultural Development Project;
US$10.7 Million Credit of July 7, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: September 6, 1978; Closing Date
December 31, 1982
The project is the consolidation phase of the Shire Valley Agri-
cultural Development Programme and includes extension services to support
increased cotton and foodcrop production, seed multiplication and afforesta-
tion programs, production credit, livestock and fisheries development, health
and potable water supply facilities, a smallholder irrigation development
study and some rural roads. It will provide social and infrastructure
services to about 70,000 families. The Valley attained self-sufficiency
in food crops for the first time in its history in 1977/78. Cotton produc-
tion also regained the levels attained in the early 1970s. Guar bean pro-
duction is rising rapidly, but groundnut production is declining. The
project had a slow start because of staffing shortages and procurement
delays. Although steps have been taken to improve staffing, it remains
a problem, with inadequate middle level staff and delays in replacement of
senior staff. Civil works and road construction although behind schedule,
are proceeding well, despite shortages of vehicles and materials. Production
estimates for 1978/79 show a decrease in tonnage for cotton and maize below
their 1977/78 levels and an increase for the drought resistant sorghum,
millets, guar beans and irrigated rice.
Loan No. 1610-MAI        Investment and Development Bank of Malawi Limited;
US$3.0 Million Loan of July 7, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: November 1, 1978; Closing Date:
July 1, 1983
The project provides foreign exchange for financing medium- to
large-scale industrial and agro-industrial investments, and will help
INDEBANK consolidate its policies and procedures and develop project
promotion. To date, US$1.3 million has been committed for three sub-
projects and more commitments are expected shortly.
Credit No. 857-MAI       National Rural Development Programme Project
Phase-I; US$22.0 Million Credit of December 21,
1978; Date of Effectiveness: April 5, 1979;
Closind Date: September 30, 1983
The project is assisting the Government in implementing the first
phase of Malawi's National Rural Development Programme. Over a five-year
period it aims to increase output of maize, groundnuts, fire-cured tobacco
and rice, and expand milk and meat production. It will strengthen the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources Central Service, four existing
Management Units and establish eight new development areas. It will also
complete the consolidation phase of the Lilongwe Land Development Programme.
The project is cofinanced by CIDA, DEG, EDF, and ODM. It is proceeding
satisfactorily except for staffing and recurrent financing problems.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 910-MAI        Third Education Project; US$14.5 Million Credit
EEC Credit No. 12-MAI   June 19, 1979; Date of Effectiveness:  September 4,
1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project is assisting the Government in improving and expanding
primary and secondary education and improving curriculum development, in-
service training and management of education. Its major components include
const..ucting, furnishing and equipping primary schools; improving and
expanding primary teacher training, secondary teacher training, secondary
and technical schools; providing primary school textbooks; establishing an
Institute of Education responsible for curriculum development, in-service
training, and materials preparation; and assisting school inspectorates,
architec'iral and engineering services, educational studies and project
adminis. ation. An EEC Special Action Credit of US$7.5 million was made
available to the project. Implementation is proceeding well and on time.
Credit No. 992-MAI       National Rural Development Programme (NRDP) Project
Phase II (Wood Energy); US$13.8 Million Credit of
April 25, 1980; Date of Effectiveness: June 9, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1985
The project is assisting the Government in its long-term energy
development program aimed at increasing forest resources. It will establish
a national network of 88 nurseries to produce seedlings for sale to small-
holders, who will be encouraged to establish their own woodlots; fuelwood and
pole plantations to help meet increasing demands from the commercial and
industrial sectors, as well as from urban dwellers; and an energy unit in the
Forestry Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. It
will finance preinvestment activities for launching NRDP phase III. Imple-
mentation is proceeding satisfactorily.
