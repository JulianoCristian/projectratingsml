The Project has taught some valuable lessons\n            which concern demand forecasts, tariff and regulatory\n            policies, competition with gas, evaluation of DH systems as\n            whole, and the need to resolve pending liabilities of the\n            beneficiary before the commencement of implementation. 1)\n            Future DH projects should scrutinize demand projections and\n            the factors which affect demand very carefully. Greater\n            efforts to identify new DH consumers should also be\n            undertaken. Demand forecast analysis should also consider\n            the results of social assessments. 2) Appropriate tariff\n            policies play an important role in maintaining DH consumers\n            and thus preserving the viability of DH systems. Maintaining\n            competitiveness with other heat providers should be a prime\n            goal of regulators and incorporated in a DH tariff policy, a\n            clear and consistent regulatory policy based on long-term\n            least-cost provision of heat should be adopted at the\n            beginning of the Project. 3) When designing a DH project, it\n            is important to properly assess risks associated with the\n            potential for competition from gas or other alternatives to\n            DH. 4) The design of DH projects should consider how to\n            optimize the whole DH system within a city, and not just the\n            DH assets owned by a given DH company. 5) The issue of the\n            gas debt should have been more clearly addressed at the\n            project appraisal stage."}, "docdt": "2000-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
