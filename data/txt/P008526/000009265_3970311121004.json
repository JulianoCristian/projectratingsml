The project consists of two\n            components: a) rehabilitation of DH system, through a\n            program to upgrade the system to a variable flow regime;\n            increase boiler efficiency; abate leakages; install heat\n            meters; eliminate environmentally unsound, low-stack\n            coal-fired boilers; and strengthen the maintenance function;\n            and b) institutional support for policy reform, project\n            implementation and enterprise restructuring for project agencies."}, "docdt": "1995-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
