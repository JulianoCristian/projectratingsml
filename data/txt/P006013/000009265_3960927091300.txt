MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA
FOR A TAX ADMINISTRATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$6.5 MILLION
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Argentina fo, the equivalent of US$6.5 million to strength-
en the collection activities of the Directorate of Tax Administration
(DGI), Treasury Secretariat, Ministry of Economy, is submitted for
approval. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including 5 years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  The significant deterioration of Argentina's public
sector revenues is at the root of much of the recent instability in the
fiscal accounts which, in turn, has contributed to the worsening of macro-
economic performance. Current tax revenues fell from a peak of more than
23 percent of GDP in 1980 to a projected 21 percent in 1988. This disap-
pointing trend is the result of several factors, ranging from the effects
of the combination of high rates of inflation and the lags in tax collec-
tions (the so-called Tanzi-Olivera effect), to industrial promotion incen-
tives that undermine the tax base and noncompliance with tax laws.
3.       An important factor contributing to noncompliance--a traditional
problem in Argentina--has been the inability of the DGI to develop into a
modern tax agency. Its task has been made more difficult by changes in tax
legislation that increased substantially the number of taxpayers; and the
inflationary environment, which has hindered effective tax assessments.
Simultaneously, the development of computerized techniques of accounting by
large corporate taxpayers has vastly outstripped the DGI's auditing abili-
ties. Failure to introduce modern methods of computing and information
control has led to progressively more inefficient operation of the tax
agency; and its inability to enforce tax legislation, in turn, has fueled
increased noncompliance.
4.       The macroeconomic program underlying the Letter of Development
Policy addressed by the Argentine authorities to the Bank on September 22,
1988, envisages a substantial reduction in the deficit of the nonfinancial
public sector in 1989. Accomplishment of this goal is a necessary precon-
dition for a restoration of more orerly macroeconomic conditions and for
an eventual resumption of adequate ustained growth. The deficit target
for the nonfinancial public sector of 1 percent of GDP not only anticipates
considerable improvements on the expenditure side, but is also predicated
on a substantial reversal of past revenue performance. The Government has
presented to Congress a program of tax reform that is expected to increase
revenues and limit tax elusion through the improper use of industrial
promotion benefits. In addition, it has recognized the need to accelerate
DGI reforms to increase tax collection efficiency, encourage voluntary
compliance with legislation, and repress fraud and evasion. To this end,
the Government has produced a plan of short-term measures that will serve
as a bridge to the longer-term DGI restructuring program.



5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Under the Public Sector Manage-
ment Technical Assistance Loan, 2712-AR (TAPSM), approved in September 1986,
the Bank providing initial support for restructuring DGI, with a small
program of US$2.2 million encompassing change in the organizational
structure, modernization of operations, and the development of advanced
techniques of tax control and auditing. The medium-term restructuring
program has also benefitted on several occasions from technical assistance
provided by the IMF. The implementation of the program has produced some
important advances, including: a review and rationalization of the list of
registered taxpayers; the development and implementation of a uniform
taxpayer identification code--a measure that has the potential of
substantially reducing administrative complexities; a revision of tax forms
for the main taxes, which has reduced paperwork and promoted a more
efficient information gathering; the completion of two of the large systems
of information processing and cross-check, which are now providing support
to direct tax auditing; and upgrading the computer mainframe. But more
difficulties than expected were encountered in some critical areas,
particularly in the development of the taxpayers' current account system.
Furthermore, some important organizational ana systemic issues--such as the
amount and effective use of DGI's resources, internal control procedures,
adequacy of tax auditing techniques--had not been adequately addressed
until recently. The proposed loan would thus provide the necessary
financing for the execution of a program intended to bridge the gap between
full realization of the benefits of basic DGI structural reform and the
need to counter the recent fall in tax revenues. Given the tight budgetary
constraints faced by the Argentine Government, it would be virtually
impossible for DGI to carry out the restructuring program on its own within
the necessary timeframe. At the same time, while the program aims at a
substantial increase of efficiency in the short term, its implementation
would contribute to lasting improvements. The Bank would finance
approximately 60 percent of the project costs, a higher proportion than
similar technical assistance loans. Its justification rests in the
importance of the project to Argentina's overall macroeconomic program;
moreover, it is similar to the type of assistance given in the recently-
approved Social Sector Technical Assistance Loan (2984-AR).
6.       ProJect ObJectives.  The main objective of the program, apart from
the envisaged contribution to improved Government finances, is the increased
efficiency of DGI. The present program also would address some problems
not envisaged in the longer-term program (e.g., the re-evaluation and
development of internal and external auditing techniques, and restructuring
of DGI's training unit) but whose solution is vital to address the future
needs of the DGI. As a byproduct, the proposed project would generate
valuable data critical to budgetary and economic management.
7.       Project Description.  The project is composed of six components.
The first consists of the development of a computerized system of "surveil-
lance" of the 2,000 largest taxpayers (US$85,000 of project cost). This
will permit a closer follow-up of this significant group's compliance with
VAT, income, and property taxes. The second component aims at a substan-
tial improvement in the tax inspection ability of DGI, to be achieved
through an increase in the number of tax inspectors of DGI (up to 50
percent, or 600 inspectors), as well as the recruitment of a number of
computer analysts and programmers (US$365,000). A third component will
provide the necessary training for the newly hired inspectors and computer



- 3 -
specialists, and will review the structure of the training unit within DGI
(US$2 million). Under the fourth component, the procedures and systems for
internal auditing and control will be reviewed and, on the basis of a
preliminary evaluation, an in-depth auditing of DGI operations will be
conducted (US$1.2 million). The fifth component will, in turn, involve a
revision of current techniques for the inspection of taxp-yers, with parti-
cular attention devoted to the analysis of accounting systems supported by
mainframe computers (US$2.3 million). Finally, personal and multiuser
computer equipment will be provided, with particular emphasis on the needs
of a more decentralized operation of the DGI, and of the system of monitor-
ing the 2.000 largest taxpayers (US$3.2 million). In addition, the
project preparation facility advance of US$732,000 will be repaid out of
the Loan. Up to US$300,000 of retroactive financing for expenditures after
November 1, 1988, would help avoid interruption of start-up activities if
unforeseen delays prevented a timely signing of the Loan. This is consi-
dered essential since most components of the project are to be completed
before the end of the third quarter of 1989. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A detailed description of these components is provided in
Annex I. Annex 2 presents a matrix detailing objectives, components,
expected outputs and impacts, and timing of the project.
8.       To enhance the project's institution-building effects, DGI's
organization structure for carrying out these activities will emphasize the
Darticipation of the Bureau's career staff, to the extent possible, in
contrast with the Tax Bureau's normally heavy reliance on outside consult-
ants. The latter will only be utilized to provide specialized expertise
not available within the DGI, or for directing those components whose
objective is a "once-and-for-all' action (such as the database for the
2,000 largest taxpayers and the computing equipment).
9.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has completed a number of prepara-
tory actions, supported by a project preparation facility (PPF) advance,
and has taken a number of other steps. The actions already taken include
(i) the appointment of a commission within DGI responsible for carrying out
the project; (ii) the issuance of a decree authorizing an exception to the
general public sector hiring freeze and for the recruitment of the new
inspectors and analysts; (iii) the identification of the 2,000 largest
taxpayers to be monitored through the database of large contributors; (iv)
the appointment of an executive director in the project, as well as the
directors of the components; and (v) the contracting with the firm charged
with hiring the new inspectors and the analysts/programmers. The Govern-
ment has also agreed to proceed to contract with consultants and the
consulting firms necessary for the implementation of the preliminary
diagnostic for internal aditing, as well as to signing the Management
Service Contract for equipment purchase before loan effectiveness; to agree
with the Bank on a satisfactory list of indicators of DGI efficiency that
will be used to monitor the targetted improvements in its future perform-
ance, and on the course of action to be taken following the completion of
the preliminary studies in the third and fourth components.



10.      Benefits.  The project is expected to bring about major improve-
ments in the efficiency of tax collection, to reduce tax evasion, and
discourage fraudulent practices. While, by its own nature, the extent of
the tax revenue enhancement that might result from these actions is
difficult to estimate precisely, the authorities expect that the efficiency
gains might lead to an improvement in collection of VAT, income and capital
taxes perhaps as high as a half of one percent of GDP in the course of
1989. Only slightly over one third of this amount would contribute to a
reduction in the budget deficit, as the remainder is distributed to the
Provirces under the provisions of the revenue-sharing law. However, a
program that contributes to the perception of a stronger enforcement if tax
laws would also be helpful to counter the traditional increase in tax
evasion during an election year, when expectations of a tax amnestrf become
stronger. Besides the direct revenue effects, other benefits are expected
to accrue from the increased capacity to handle the reform envisaged for
the VAT, as well as from the reduction of fraudulent tax expenditures by
obtaining a better control of firms benefitting from fiscal incentives
granted under the industrial promotion law.
11.      Risks.  The program is designed for maximum short-term impact and,
as such, it poses a strong challenge to DGI's management. Furthermore, the
presidential elections scheduled for May 1989 might weaken the resolve to
carry out the proposed actions. More fundamentally, the possibility of
change in the top management of the DGI at the end of the present Adminis-
tration's term in November 1989 might disrupt the implementation of the
proposed measures. To minimize these risks, great care has been exercised
to design project components that would enjoy bipart.san support. Ultima-
tely, however, the overriding importance of the project objectives is
considered great enough to justify these and other implicit risks.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

ARGENTINA
TECHNICAL ANNEX TO THEl MD0RANDUK OF TEE PRESIDENT
FOR A
TAX ADHINISTRATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCZ LOAN
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Deteriorating Fiscal Deficits and Inadequate
Revenue Generation
1.       After a sustained increase during the second half of the 1970s,
Argentina's overall tax revenues, collected both by the national Government
and by the provinces, have shown a disturbing downward trend during the
1980s, despite the adoption of several revenue-enhancing measures after
1985. In 1987, national tax revenues stood at slightly less than
18 percent of GDP, and provincial revenues yielded about 4 percent. Thus,
total collections stood some two percentage points lower than the 1980 peak
of 23.5 percent of GDP; moreover, they are expected to decline even further
during 1988. Lack of revenue buoyancy has been a major reason for the
consistently unsatisfactory fiscal performance, which has required repeated
efforts to contain expenditures that have caused, among other things,
historically low levels of public investment. The resulting fiscal and
quasi-fiscal deficits have been major determinants of Argentina's unsatis-
factory macroeconomic performance, since the financing requirements of the
public sector have strained domestic-currency financial markets and led to
very high real interest rates and high and variable inflation rates.
Recent stabilization attempts have registered some success in slowing the
rate of growth of expenditures, and even in reducing them in real terms;
even so, the revenue performance has remained disappointing. Reversing the
downward trend in revenues is one of the most important priorities for
regaining effective control of the macroeconomic environment and promoting
growth.
2.       There are multiple explanations for this unsatisfactory revenue
performance. When the rate of inflation increases, the real value of tax
revenues tends to be reduced, as there is a lag between the formation of
tax obligation and the actual collection by the tax agency. This is the
so-called Tanzi-Olivera effect. This factor cannot be underestimated,
given the high rates of inflation registered in Argentina. However, its
importance has been somewhat reduced since the authorities have recently
taken several measures to reduce collection lags. It is estimated that the
average collection lag in 1974 was between three and four months, whereas
in 1988 it is probably less than one month.
3.       A second important explanation for insufficient growth of revenues
is the industrial promotion law. By granting incentives in the form of
exemption from the VAT, as well as from income and capital taxes to firms
willing to locate in selected areas of the country or belonging to
"priority* sectors, this law has caused a steady and difficult-to-reverse



- 13 -
erosion of the main sources of national tax revenue. Furthermore, insuffi-
cient control mechanisms have encouraged fraudulent practices, without
setting clear limits on tax expenditures. Estimates of fiscal costs of the
industrial promotion regime run as high as 3.5 percent of GDP. While the
recently approved revision to the industrial promotion law represents an
improvement--it limits the maximum amount of subsidies and, through the
establishment of tax credit bonds, does not undermine the base of indivi-
dual taxes--the impact on revenues of the previously granted subsidies will
be felt for many years to come, as the Argentine law makes it difficult to
r erse 'acquired rights.' Very recently, the Government submitted to
Congress legislation that will limit the open-endedness of industrial
promotion benefits; this is expected to contribute to increasing fiscal
revenues.
4.       Moreover, a high and increasintg rate of noncompliance with the
existing tax legislation has gone hand-in-glove with what is widely
perceived as loss of effectiveness of the National Tax Agency (DGI). While
tax evasion is, by its nature, difficult to estimate, many observers of the
Argentine system agree that for taxes that rely on a certain degree of
voluntary compliance by the taxpayers, actual collections may be only a
fraction of potential revenues. Furthermore, tax amnesties have been
granted repeatedly in the past to boost revenues. This has contributed to
the expectation of future amnesties, and strengthened the perceived inabi-
lity of the DGI to prosecute effectively and enforce the law. The combina-
tion of these factors provides a further incentive to evasion, in a vicious
cycle that is detrimental to government revenue generation and to
Argentina's economic development.
B. The Tax System: Revenues and Administration
5.       General Constraints on Revenue Generation.  Revenue collection
problems result from the interaction of the structure of the tax system,
the weaknesses of its administration and legal constraints. In the first
instance, the structure of national taxes is somewhat atypical compared to
countries with similar levels of economic development. The tax system is
greatly fragmented, with over 20 nationally administered taxes, the
majority of which yield little revenue. The two most important revenue
sources in recent years have been indirect taxes: the excise tax cn oil
products, and the VAT, each yielding approximately 3 percent of GDP (before
refunds to exporters). It is notable that the tax on oil products and the
VAT on imported goods require very little collection effort, as they do not
hinge on the taxpayers' voluntary compliance. Even though a tax reform in
1985-86 was designed to give direct taxes a greater role in overall
taxation, the income tax still does not yield more than about 1.5 percent
of GDP, or less than 10 percent of overall revenues. By comparison, the
average income tax to GDP ratio for middle-income developing countries was
around 8 percent of GDP during the early 1980s. At the same time, social
security contributions, at about 5 peLcent of GDP, are at levels similar to
that of OECD countries. The constitutional structure of Argentina also
limits the possibility of reducing the public sector deficit through
increased national taxation. Following a recent reform in the revenue
sharing law (the so-called coparticipation law), provinces are entitled to
receive roughly 60 percent of eligible national taxes--i.e., taxes that do
not have a specific earmarking by law.



- 14 -
6.       Institutional Constraints.  Several agencies administer and
collect national taxes: the DGI, the Social Security Administration, the
Customs Service, and other minor bodies. The DGI is, by far, the most
important of the agencies, both with regard to the amount of revenue
collected and its auditing and prosecuting powers. Operating over the
entire national territory, its main functions are the assessment of tax
liabilities and the collection of revenues. It collects approximately 60
percent of total national revenues, corresponding in recent years to rough-
ly 10 percent of GDP. It administers the income and capital taxes, the VAT
on domestic products, the national excise taxes, and other minor taxes.
Tax revenues are distributed to the national treasury, the provinces,
several special funds and, more recently, to the social security system.
7.       The external environment in which DGI operates is generally
unfavorable--which is a major reason why DGI has not been able to increase
collection substantially despite the numerous revenue enhancement measures
approved over the years. The tax system itself, besides its excessive
fragmentation, has been confounded by great variability in legislation,
confusing or contradictory application of tax laws and regulations, and
frequent disregard for the administrative viability of proposed tax changes.
Tax amnesties, granted repeatedly in the attempt to raise revenues, have
inhibited DGI's pursuit of evaders, and created expectations of further
immunity from prosecution. An additional constraint is the way in which
DGI must interact with other public bodies in its operations. The tax
tribunal and the accounts tribunal deal with DGI's institutional products,
the former acting on taxpayers' appeals on DGI decisions, and the latter
verifying DGI's performance and behavior. However, the legal powers of DGI
vis-&-vis taxpayers are limited, and extremely lengthy procedures can
follow an unfavorable audit before a final injunction is issued. This also
has contributed to the impression of DGI's reluctance to combat tax evasion.
8.       The effects of this unfavorable external environment were
compounded by increasing strains on DGI's resources and the absence of
forward-looking planning. During the 1970s, the number of registered tax-
payers increased dramatically as a result of the introduction and generali-
zation of the VAT and of other legislative modifications, as have the
complex features of incentive schemes such as the industrial promotion law,
that would require increased auditing ability. Resources available for
these purposes, however, have failed to match the increasing demands posed
by the evolution of the tax system and the increase in the number of
taxpayers. DGI's staff has remained relatively stable at less than 11.000
for the past several years (about 6,000 personnel assigned to operations in
Buenos Aires, and the rest distributed among the provinces). Of the total,
only 1,300 are tax inspectors, handling 1.6 million registered taxpayers.
The ability of the agency to retain and motivate qualified personnel is
also hampered by many problems. The DGI is organized as an autarkic agency,
i.e., with a certain degree of independence from general public sector
rules. This allows the agency to offer somewhat more attractive working
conditions than other government bodies. However, the managerial scope in
these matters is severely limited by union contracts that mandate an
extremely flat compensation curve and extensive union participation in
management decisions, e.g., hiring and other personnel matters. As a
result, private-sector auditing firms have routinely used DGI's staff as a
resource pool for recruiting qualified manpower.



- 15 -
9.       The internal ability of the agency to process and utilize informa-
tion has also been hampered by the long-range planning and the failure to
introduce more modern information gathering and processing systems. DGI
entered the 19809 without a clearly defined strategy to cope with increa-
sing demands on its resources, and with obsolete internal operating and
processing systems. Compounding these problems was a long-standing tradi-
tion of politicization of key managerial positions, and a very high turn-
over in the Director-General position: the current administration appoint-
ed four directors in the first two years in office, although by the end of
his term, the current Director will have the longest tenure on record,
three-and-a-half years.
10.      Bottlenecks to Current Restructuring Efforts.  In 1986, a medium-
term restructuring plan was developed to address these problems and ineffi-
ciencies, with the help of IMF and Bank's technical assistance, under the
Technical Assistance for Public Sector Management Project, Loan 2712-AR
(TAPSM). The legal powers of the DGI were increased, by granting the
agency access to banking and financial data previously covered by secrecy
or anonymity rules. Draft legislation was submitted to the Argentine
Congress to change the powers of the DGI and to speed up the judicial
process when tax evasion is ascertained (the project has not yet completed
the legislative process). Internally, the organization was restructured,
along the recommendations of an IMF technical assistance report, with
measurable efficiency gains. An ambitious program of computerization of
the processing of information was also implemented, with the multiple
objective of allowing cross-checks between financial and sales data of
enterprises and individual taxpayers, and setting up a current account
system, with the ability to handle the information requirements of large
numbers of taxpayers.
11.      The restructuring plan has yielded some important advances.
Thanks to the internal reorganization, it was possible to review and purge
the list of registered taxpayers. A uniform taxpayer identification code
has been developed and implemented, consolidating several previous codes.
This measure has the potential of substantially reducing administrative
complexities. A revision of tax forms for main taxes has reduced paperwork
and produced a more efficient gathering of relevant information. Two large
systems of information processing and cross-checking have been completed
and already are providing support to direct tax auditing, and the existing
computing equipment has been upgraded. However, more difficulties than
expected were encountered in some critical areas. The design and implemen-
tation of the various systems has proven a more complex exercise than
envisaged, particularly in the development of the taxpayers' current
account system; moreover, bureaucratic difficulties have also slowed the
pace of transformation. Additionally, the initial plan did not fully
address some organizational and systemic issues--such as the amount and
effective use of DGI's resources, the internal control procedures, the
adequacy of tax auditing techniques--and the slow pace of implementation of
the new system increased the difficulties caused by the progressive discon-
tinuation of the old, manual procedures.

C. The Project
12.      General Objectives.  In formulating its macroeconomic program for
the second half of 1988 and for 1989 (reviewed and supported by the Bank).
the Government realized that slippage in the performance of DGI should be
reversed and given high priority, and that it would not be wise to wait for
the completion of the medium-term restructuring plan. Consequently, with
Bank assistance, it elaborated a short-term program designed to boost the
efficiency of the DGI, and to serve as a bridge towards the time of full
effectiveness of the already-initiated process of reform. The project
addresses critical areas of DGI operations: (i) the control of tax
compliance of large taxpayers, (ii) the availability of additional human
resources to carry out tax inspections; (iii) the internal training
function; (iv) the adequacy of internal control; (v) the adequacy of tax
auditing techniques; and (vi) the lack of microcomputing equipment. The
proposed loan would help provide the necessary financing for the execution
of the program. The Bank would finance approximately 60 percent of the
project costs, a higher proportion than similar technical assistance loans,
but one that is justified in view of the importance of the project for
Argentina's macroeconomic program. It is also similar to the approach
adopted in the recently-approved Social Sector Technical Assistance Loan
(2984-AR). The Government has committed itself to provide local counter-
part funds.
13.      Program Components.  The six components of the program described
below are expected to enhance overall revenue performance through several
channels. The increased control of large taxpayers and the sharply
increased auditing activity that the new personnel and material available
to the DGI would permit, are expected to result in a higher number of
revenue actions. Internal efficiency would be boosted by the strengthening
of internal control mechanisms, thus raising the efficiency of tax collec-
tion. But perhaps more importantly, positive externalities are likely to
be generated if an image of a more dynamic and aggressive tax administra-
tion can be successfully projected. Government officials believe that the
increased efficiency could boost revenue collection by as much as one half
of one percent of GDP. While the contribution to the reduction of the
public sector deficit would be modest--since only a little over one third
of DGI revenues accrue to the national treasury--the reversal of the trend
would be critical, with far-reaching implications for the future revenue
generation. In addition, a strong DGI presence would also contribute to
counteracting the tendency for tax evasion to increase during an election
year, in the expectation of the granting of a tax amnesty by the new
government.
14.      Part A:  Database for 2,000 Largest Taxpayers.  The highly concen-
trated structure of tax payments in Argentina (a result of a concentrated
industrial sector, and of the low reliance on the personal income tax as a
revenue instrument) has necessitated over the years devoting particular
attention to the so-called "large taxpayers," that provide the bulk of
revenues for VAT, income and capital taxes. The operations of the National
Directorate for Large Taxpayers of the DGI, which has existed since 1974,
have been hampered by lack of computerization and an outdated and limited
roster of large taxpayers, thus reducing the control and analysis of this
important group. Under the proposed loan, a computerized database would be
developed, to be jointly used by DGI and the Secretary of the Treasury,



- 17 -
increasing the size of the group to 2,000 taxable entities from the 800
currently tracked by the National Directorate. Besides facilitating the
analysis of information on compliance for the major taxpayers, the database
will also permit the retrieval of information relevant for economic and tax
management, since it would include data on company purchases and financial
transactions. The system is expected significantly to increase the ability
to monitor this group of taxpayers. Although development of a computerized
taxpayers' current account will eventually replace the need for a separate
system for large taxpayers, delays in the implementation of this component
of the medium-term restructuring program have been substantial. The
expected payoffs from prompt action, as envisaged under this project,
justify the component as proposed. The estimated cost to complete the
computerized database system is approximately US$85,000.
i5.      Part B:  Recruiting New Personnel.  A major reason for the loss of
efficiency of the DGI over the years has been the stagnation of auditing
ability in the face of a progressively larger number of taxpayers. Under
this component, a major effort would be made to increase the number of tax
inspections during 1989, through the hiring of new inspectors, and to
provide a substantial number of computer analysts and programmers. The
target is to hire up to 600 new tax inspectors (which would represent an
increase of about 50 percent over the existing workforce), and about 50
analysts/programmers. The increased auditing force will permit the comple-
tion of tasks, essential for success of the Government's macroeconomic
program. The number of on-site inspections of corporate taxpayers would be
increased by almost 30 percent during 1989 (at an annual rate). The addi-
tional programmers and systems analysts would help alleviate bottlenecks in
the computing center that, in the past, have hampered the timely processing
of information.
16.      In order to permit the recruitment, on November 2, 1988, the
Government issued a decree lifting the existing public sector hiring
"freeze" for DGI. In an effort to break away from an entrenched tradition
of political influence in the recruitment of new staff by public sector
agencies, DGI has decided to rely on external professional support for the
search, evaluation, and selection of the new inspectors and analysts to be
hired. This departure from past practices should also enhance the public
image of DGI and assure an unbiased recruiting process. A recruiting agent
(financed through Bank resources) will be solicited among well-established,
specialized recruitment agencies. DGI intends to have the staff available
before the end of the second quarter of 1989, with the training of new
employees completed a month thereafter. Total costs for the completion of
the selection and recruitment process would be approximately US$365,000.
17.      Part C:  Training of New Personnel.  Although the new inspectors
would have to demonstrate technical expertise during the hiring process,
they will also be required to attend specific induction and technical
training courses. The contract for the required training to the new work-
force will also cover the provision for: (i) course design; (ii) teaching
materials; (iii) training for 30 in-house middle managers or instructors;
and (iv) the required training facilities and equipment. The training
programs would begin by April 15, 1989.



- 18 -
18.      The DGI intends to continue to improve its operational capacity in
the future. Retraining efforts will, thus, be expanded to cover those
present staff members in need of special skills or additional training.
The diagnosis and design of these activities would require the expertise of
a consultant to be financed under the proposed loan. who would outline a
plan for the restructuring and the future activities of the traisiing unit.
The Government has agreed to make its best efforts in following up on the
recommendation of this study.
19.      The expected result of the tasks to be undertaken should substan-
tially increase the existing number of professionals, trained in state-of-
the-art techniques. In addition, the project would provide an enhanced in-
house training capability for future action. The total cost of this
component would be about US$2 million.
20.      Part D:  Improvement of Internal Auditing.  The process of intern-
al auditing (i.e., the verification of whether the procedures established
to perform the functions of the agency are being followed correctly by the
ex_cuting agents) is of extreme importance within a tax administration.
Incorrect application of existing rules decreases efficiency in the detec-
tion and repression of tax evasion; lack of effective control may encourage
corruption among tax officials. Within DGI, however, the internal auditing
function was not given sufficiently high priority in the past, with a
resulting ineffectiveness of the internal auditing unit and a lack of
development of satisfactory auditing procedures. Any substantive effort to
increase the efficiency of tax collection in the short run must reverse
this situation. This component of the project will provide for the
development of procedures for internal auditing, a program of training of
the established internal auditing force, and the performance of auditing,
for 1989, through the use of personnel contracted externally.
21.      The project will involve a first diagnostic phase, during which
the existing auditing procedures will be reviewed, as well as the ability
of the organizational structure to allow thorough auditing. On the basis
of this diagnostic, a program will be defined for each functional area.
Subsequently, auditing procedures will be developed through the use of
consulting firms, and the existing personnel will be trained in these
procedures. A six-month internal auditing program will then be defined,
and carried out with the help of external auditors--which will have the
responsibility for product quality--in conjunction with established
officials. An auditing program for 1990 will also be prepared, to be
carried out during that year utilizing internal resources. Finally, the
Government has agreed to develop, in consultation with the Bank, a set of
indicators of internal efficiency similar to those used by other tax
administrations. This would allow both the Bank and DGI's management to
monitor the evolution of the agency's internal efficiency during project
execution and beyond. through semi-annual reports based on these indicators
that would be submitted to the Bank. The estimated cost of this component
is US$1.2 million.
22.      Part E:  Tax Inspection Techniques.  This component aims at
developing methods of tax inspection that will allow an increased efficien-
cy in DGI operations. The project is articulated into two modules. In the
first, specialized software will be developed and purchased in order to
allow auditing of accounting systems supported by mainframe computers.



- 19 -
This is an essential technical requirement for an effective auditing of
Large corporate taxpayers, where computerized systems of accounting are by
now the norm. Training of DGI officials in the use of the software will
also be provided. The second module envisages an assessment and improve-
ment, where necessary, of the tax inspection techniques currently used by
DGI, in particular for: (i) general tax inspection techniques for
industry and commerce; (ii) specialized tax inspection for enterprises in
the area of exports, agricultural, refrigeration, banks and finance, oil;
and (iii) tax inspection techniques applicable to firms under industrial
incentives schemes. DGI personnel will subsequently be trained in the
applications of the techniques thus developed. The total cost of this
component (including the extraordinary expenses of DGI for carrying out the
accelerated inspections of firms in the industrial promotion scheme) is
estimated at US$2.3 million.
23.      Part F:  Provision of Computing Equipment.  DGI activities rely
intensively on the processing of large volumes of information; however, the
level of automation of information gathering and processing is extremely
limited. As a consequence of the attempt to centralize the collection of
information, as discussed in part B, priority was given in recent years to
the development of the central processing system, which has very recently
been upgraded. In contrast, the number of personal and mini-computers
within DGI has remained low: the entire organization is endowed with only
24 PCs, and the equipment for data processing at a decentralized level is
largely outdated.
24.      The equipment that would be provided under this component would
respond to a series of basic needs of the organization: (i) decentralized
gathering and checking of information; (ii) decentralized processing needs;
(iii) adoption of standard software for the execution of some basic tasks
(word processing, spreadsheets); and (iv) provision of portable equipment
for tax inspectors. In addition, the equipment needs for the first
component of this project would also be satisfied. In order to address
these multiple needs, the project specifies three types of equipment:
multiuser, single-user, and portable; the selection of the equipment would
be predicated on its being serviced in Argentina if needed. A total number
of 200 machines would be provided and distributed throughout the national
structure of DGI. The component further envisages a program for training
approximately 1,000 DGI personnel in computer applications. The total cost
for equipment acquisition and installation would be US$3.2 million.
II. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IDPLEMENTATION
A. Organization
25.      The project will be executed within the Tax Administration;
responsibility for its implementation will rest with the director of DGI
Directorate. A coordinating commission within the agency has been created,
headed by the deputy director of DGI. DGI has appointed an executive
director, who will coordinate the administrative aspects of the project and
of each component; and directors for the individual components. A major
aim of the Argentine authorities is the maximization of the institution-
building benefits of the project. Thus, component directors have been
chosen from within line personnel, especially detached for the execution of
the task. The only exception to this rule will be projects with a once-



- 20 -
and-for-all nature (such as the provision of equipment and setting up the
database for the 2,000 largest taxpayers).
26.      A limited number of consultants will be hired. who must provide
full-time services. Government officials, even on leave of absence. would
not be employed as consultants.
B. Procurement, Disbursement, Accounts, Audit
27.      Procurement.  Procurement for the proposed project would be in
accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines (May 1985). Goods (which
correspond to office and computing equipment) costing US$25,000 equivalent
or less would be procured through local shopping involving at least three
price quotations. Local shopping would also be used for short-term leasing
of computer equipment under procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Procure-
ment of the large order of computer equipment would be through Internation-
al Competitive Bidding (ICB) in agreement with Bank Guidelines for Procure-
ment. All ICB procurement will be submitted for prior review by the Bank.
Consultant services (incluaing auditing) with an equivalent cost of US$2.2
million (some 20 percent of total project costs) would be procured in
accordance with Bank guidelines. It is expected that the majority of
individual consultants would be hired locally. The procurement method
would be as follows:

28.      Disbursements.  The disbursement projections of the US$6.5 million
loan would reflect the quick-implementation nature of the project. They
would be made for (i) 100 percent of foreign and local expenditures for
technical assistance (including consulting services and contract hiring);
(ii) 100 percent of foreign and 35 percent of local expenditures for train-
ing: (iii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 15 percent of local
costs for procurement and installation of imported equipment and locally
procured equipment, and 100 percent of foreign and local costs for software;
and (iv) 100 percent repayment of the PPF advance. Loan funds would be
disbursed over a period of about three years. The date for completion of
the project would be December 31, 1991, and the Closing Date would be June
30. 1992. Disbursements would be made on the basis of full contractual
documentation in the case of studies and technical assistance and for all
local currency contracts valued at US$500,000 or more, and for foreign
currency expenditures contracts valued at US$50,000 or more. All other
disbursements would be made on the basis of certified statements of expendi-
ture (SOE). The documentation for the SOE expeAditures would not be sent to
the Bank, but would be retained by DGI and made available to the Bank upon
request. A Special Account in US dollars would be set up at the Central
Bank of Argentina in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. The
initial deposit to the Special Account would be for US$2.3 million. This
relatively large proportion of the Loan is justified by the short-run nature
of the program and by the front-loading of expenditures of many components;
it represents an estimated three months of expenditure under the loan.
Retroactive financing for up to US$300,000 equivalent would be available so
that unexpected delays in signing the Loan do not lead to suspension of
ongoing activities.
29.      Accounts and Audit.  The Borrower would establish and maintain
separate project accounts for all expenditures financed under this loan.
Accounts and supporting records pertaining to the services and goods
financed under the loan, as well as the Special Account, would be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
