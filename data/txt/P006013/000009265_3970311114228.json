Sustainability is rated as\n            likely, and institutional development impact as substantial.\n            The Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory because\n            project restructuring and intensified supervision succeeded\n            in correcting initial weaknesses in design. After a shaky\n            start, the Borrower executed the project satisfactorily.\n            Continuing changes in senior management delayed project\n            execution, and resulted in two distinct implementation\n            phases. Very little progress was achieved during the first\n            phase from November 1988 to November 1990. During the second\n            phase, from November 1990 until the end of the project in\n            March 1994, implementation proceeded swiftly under the\n            direction of a new and committed management team and project\n            implementation unit. The Large Taxpayer Collection System\n            was successfully introduced under the General Tax\n            Directorate and expanded to other agencies. Other\n            successfully implemented components include studies of\n            evasion trends in specific economic sectors, training of\n            staff, recruitment of personnel, and acquisition of computer\n            equipment. Lessons learned from this project fall into three\n            categories: (i) difficulties in the implementation of tax\n            administration projects; (ii) critical issues for\n            sustainability; and (iii) best practices in tax\n            administration. The two most important lessons are that: (a)\n            political stability is particularly important for\n            implementation of technical assistance operations; and (b)\n            improved civil service incentives, including adequate pay\n            and career development, are a must to achieve improved tax administration."}, "docdt": "1996-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
