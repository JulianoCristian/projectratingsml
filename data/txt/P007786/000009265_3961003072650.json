period of economic\n            adjustment until line ministries strengthen their\n            institutional capacities and complete policy reform\n            programs.  To the extent feasible, the methods of operation,\n            procedures, and experiences of the Social Investment Fund\n            (FISE) will be transferred gradually to social ministries to\n            help them improve their efficiency and equity of service\n            delivery.  The project has four components: (i) the\n            financing, through FISE, of a range of small-scale\n            subprojects in social and economic infrastructure and social\n            services; (ii) technical assistance to the National\n            Institute of Statistics and Census to implement a Living\n            Standards Measurement Survey program; (iii) technical\n            assistance to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of\n            Health and the Ministry of Education to prepare subprojects;\n            and (iv) technical assistance to help the government,\n            through the Ministry of Finance, to improve budgeting and\n            financial management capacity in the social ministries."}, "docdt": "1992-10-26T00:00:00Z"}
