RURAL ROADS IHPROVEMENT PROJtCT (LOAN 1860-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
,Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Philippine Rural Roads
Improvement Project, for which Loan 1860-PH in the amount of US$62 million was
approved on May 29, 1980. The loan was closed on June 30, 1988, three years
later than scheduled, when about 80% of the loan had been disbursed.   US$4
million was cancelled in 1988 and about US$7.8 million was cancelled on January
6, 1989, the date of the final disbursement under the loan.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The
borrower's review of the project is documented in a draft Project Completion
Report, which is on Bank files.
Preparation of the PCR was started during the Bank's project supervision
mission in September 1988.  The report is based, inter alia, on a draft Project
Completion Report prepared by the Borrower, the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan
Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Government, and the Bank's internal memoranda. This PCR has been read by the
Operations Evaluation Department.

RURAL ROADS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (LOAN 1860-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
i.          Obiectives. In the late 1970s, with a shift in government policy
toward rural development and decentralization of development responsibilities,
the Government planned to strengthen local government capabilities to plan,
construct and maintain rural roads and to significantly increase its investments
in farm-to-market and feeder roads. To implement this plan, the Government
Tequested World Bank assijtance in financing a rural roads project. The long-
term objectives of the project were to provide improved transport services to the
rural population in order to stimulate agricultural production and increase rural
incomes. Its immediate objectives were: (a) to reconstruct, rehabilitate and
maintain priority rural roads and (b) to strengthen the capacity of provincial
highway authorities to plan, design, administer, and execute rural road programs
and to maintain their rural road network under the overall direction of the
Department  of  Local  Government  (DLG).1'    The  project  also  included
reconstruction and improvement of a national road in Occidental Mindoro to
provide all-year road access to the island's western coastal area where
substantial agricultural investments were planned.
ii.         The project had three components: construr.ion and maintenance of
rural roads, construction and improvement of a nat. anal road, and technical
assistance for transport planning. The rural roads co-nonent was carried out by
DLG and the provincial governments and included: (a) c.nstruction and improvement
of about 730 km of proviicial and barangay roads in the provinces of Iloilo,
Cebu, Aklan, Quezon, Camarines Norte and Ilocos Sur; (b) a maintenance program
for the six provinces, with support for workshops, laboratories equipment, spare
parts, tools, and machinery; and (c) technical assistance to DLG and the six
provinces for improved transport planning, engineering, quality control,
construction supervision, and maintenance, and for technical and on-the-job
training in road maintenance.   The Department of Public Works and Highways
(DPWH)ZV was responsible for the national road component which mainly involved
reconstruction and improvement of about 150 km of road linking San Jose and
Mamburao along the western coast of the island of Mindoro. The project roaI
would serve fertile agricultural areas which were accessible only by sea during
part of the year. Under the third component, technical assistance was provided
to the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC)VI and the National
3d    Then called the Ministry of Local Government and Community Development
(MLGCD).

Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) for continuation of transport planning
advisory services financed by the Bank under previous projects and for the
implementation of a study for the preparation of the national transport
investment program. To ensure that critical organizational and management
improvements were made in DLG and the provincial governments, the project
included an extensive Action Program, which the Government agreed to under a
rather general covenant in the Loan Agreement.
iii.        Implementation Experience. Project works were completed by December
1988, four years later than expected. In general, the project suffered from (a)
the economic recession of 1983-84, which significantly constrained the
availability of counterpart funds and delayed government payments to contractors;
(b) the devaluation of the peso against the U.S. dollar from P 7.4 in 1980 to P
21.4 in 1988, which resulted in a sharp increase in the cost o. some project
Inputs; (c) diffictlties in obtaining inflation adjustments for civil works
carried out by contractors, who slowed down or stopped their work when the
contract prices were not increased; and (d) the political disruption throughout
the mid-1980s and the change in government in 1986, which resulted in widespread
staff changes and the need to retrain the newly-appointed staff.
iv.         At project completion only about 63% of the rural road program had
been completed wlile another 24% was still in progress.   In retrospect, the
objectives of the component, i.e., to strengthen DLG to assume major
administrative responsibility for the rural road network and to upgrade
provincial capabilities so that they could develop and maintain the rural road
network independently, were overly ambitious. Too many institutional changes
were introduced in too short a time. While substantial technical assistance was
provided to both DLG and the provinces (about 400 person-months of advisory
services and 120 person-months for training), most of this was concentrated in
about a two-year period ending in late-1982/early 1983, although the project was
not slated for completion until end-1984. The design of the component was also
overoptimistic regarding the availability of local funds and qualified staff. The
scope and scale of the component were therefore too large, given the pilot nature
of the project and its complexities.
v.          Aside from the design of the component and the generally poor fiscal
and political environment prevailing during implementation, the pace of works was
affected by: political insurgency in some project areas which forced contractors
to slow down or abandon work; the failure to transfer overall responsibilities
for rural roads to DLG, so that at least five government agencies and the local
governments retained overlapping responsibilities for the roads, causing long
delays in decision-making and inefficient operations; delays throughout
implementation due to the confused administrative structure and the Government's
financial constraints; and poor maintenance of rural roads due, among other
things, to a lack of funds. A high proportion of the roads improved under the
project are now believed to be in poor corndition.
vi.         Improvement of the San Jose-Mamburao road was originally to be
completed by end-1983 but most works were not finished until end-1987. Bridge
and spillway works, including one important bridge, were not completed until May
1990, about a year after loan closing. Implementation delays were largely due
to: inadequate detailed designs which required redesig.a of structures and road



- {v -
realignrent to fit actual. field conditions; typhoons, which damageed the road
during construction and several times after completion, necessitatl.ig redesign
or repair of some structuves and road sections; delayed payments to contractors;
the inaccessibilizy of some roa4 areas during the rainy season; the scarcity of
construction materials; and the weakness of one contractor.
vii.        The transport planning component was completed in August 1982, four
months earlier than scheduled at appraisal.
viii.       The project cost totaled P 1,346.6 million, or about 73% higher than
the P 776.4 million estimated at appraisal. The increase mainly resulted from
several devaluations of the peso and consequent sharp increases in the cost of
construction materials. In U.S. dollar terms, the project cost US$82.3 million
or 21% less than the US$104.9 million estimated at appraisal. The decrease was
largely due to the revaluation of the U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the peso as well as
overestimated equipment costs at appraisal.
ix.         Results.  The project showed very mixed results with respect to its
immediate objectives to: (a) reconstruct, rehabilitate and maintain priority
rural reads, and (b) strengthen provincial government capacity to develop and
maintain the rural road network under the overall direction of DLG. Many rural
roads improved under the project deteriorated rapidly due to the poor quality of
improvement work and lack of maintenance. Transport services, therefore, were
improved but not to the extent expected. The institutional goals were also only
partly achieved.   Both DLG and the six provincial highway authorities began
building up their respective capacities, but the scope of changes expected could
not take place as rapidly as originally planned, even with the help of technical
assistance.
X.          The project also fell short of its long-term goal of improving rural
transport services to stimulate agricultural production and increase rural
incomes.   DLG carried out project impact surveys for ten sample rural roads
constructed under the project with a total length of about 125 km, or 27% of the
total road length (463 km) completed under the project. The surveys showed that
(a) contrary to expectations, there had been no significant changes in farm
technology, (b) there had, however, been increases in the production of certain
crops and in the prices received by the farmer at the farmgate, (c) work
opportunities were still very limited, and (d) average annual daily traffic had
increased significantly. However, all ten sample roads showed major signs of
deterioration, characterized by excessive surface wearing, potholes and run-off
canals within the roadway. The main causes of deterioration were increased axle
loads, insufficient drainagc, typhoons, and the absence of maintenance. It is
therefore unlikely that ro'ads in such poor condition could reduce transport costs
and have an appreciable social or economic impact.  Nevertheless, DLG's re-
estimated economic rates of return (ERR) for the sample road sections ranged from
about 14% to 41%, compared to the 17% to 55% estimated at appraisal. The re-
estimated overall ERR for the component was 25% compared to 31% at appraisal.
xi.         Construction of the San Jose-Mamburao road was originally expected
to have a weighted average ERR of 23%, with quantifiable benefits arising from
increased agricultural production and savings in vehicle operating costs.
Calculation of the actual ERR could not be carried out due to a lack of data on



agricultural output in the area of the project road. However, it is unlikely
that the estimated ERR was realized since the road was not fully In service until
very recently, when an important bridge was completed. Without this bridge,
traffic on the road has been in the range of 65 to 213 vehicles per day.
xii.        Sustainabilit .  To maintain an acceptable level of net benefits
throughout its economic life, the rural roads and bridges improved or built under
the project must be maintained properly and adequately. So far, this has not
been done.
xiii.       Findings and Lessons Learned.  The project experienced many problems
and delays. Some of the problems were undoubtedly due to the very difficult
fiscal situation and political climate prevailing in the Philippines during most
of the 1980s.  Some of the problems were due to the project's expectations,
first, that well-established line agencies and politically motivated local
governments would relinquish their authority over the rural roads subsector to
DLG and, second, that the provincial governments, with largely inexperienced and
inadequately trained staff. would become capable of assuming major responsibility
for the rural. roads subsector in a relatively brief time. Finally, some of the
problems were due to the Bank's inadequate supervision of the project, which
seems to have received only about 70 days of field supervision during its eight-
year life and little attention to the crucial institutional improvements to be
made under the project Action Program.   The lessons to be learned from the
project are therefore as follows: (a) major institutional changes should be
assessed for their viability and, if found feasible, should be expected to take
a fairly long time to carry out; (b) major institutional changes should
preferably be completed as a condition for further processing of a proposed
project, e.g., prior to appraisal, rather than after a loan has been approved;
and (c) projects carried out by inexperienced entities in remote areas of the
country require intensive, conscientious supervision.

Background
1.          During the 1970s, the Government of the Philippines concentrated most
of its transport sector investments on developing an adequate all-weather road
network to serve Luzon and Mindanao, the country's most 1eveloped regions which
comprise about 70% of the land area and have about three quarters of the
population. In the late 1970s, however, with a shift in government policy t;oward
rural development and decentralization of development responsibilities, the
Government planned co strengthen local government capabilities to plan, construct
and maintain rural roads ani to significantly increase its investments in farm-
to-market and feeder road!s. To implement this plan, the Government requested
World Bank assistance in financing a rural roads project.
2.          The Bank had previously financed rural roads in the Philippines but
always as road components of irrigation, multipurpose and rural development
projects. Central government agencies, mainly the Department of Public Works and
Highways (DPWH),AI had been responsible for the execution of these road
components. While this approach helped meet the immediate need for improved
physical facilities and better transport in the rural areas, it did not directly
address  the  problem  of  strengthening  local  institutions  to  support  the
Government's decentralization policy. The Bank therefore broadaned its lending
strategy for highways to include (a) expanded participation in the improvement
of farm-to-market and feeder roads to support food production and (b) assistance
to the Goverrment in building up the operational and financial management
capabilities in the 73 provinces, under the overall guidance of the Department
of Local Government (DLG).P'
3.          Development of the rural road system was also being supported at this
time by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the TJnited States Agency for
International Development (USAID), with the former assisting DPWH and the latter
providing direct help to local governments in planning and executing rural roads
projects.

Project Objoctives and Descripticn
4.          The long-term objective of the project was to provide improved
transport services to the rural population in order to stimulate agricultural
production and increase rural incomes. Its im-.diate objectives were: (a) to
reconstruct, rehabilitate and maintain priority rural roads and (b) to strengthen
the capacity of provincial highway authorities to plan, design, administer, and
execute rural road programs and to maintain their rural road network under the
overall  direction of DLG.   The project also  included reconstruction and
improvement of a national road in Occidental Mindoro to provide all-year r:
access to the island's western coastal area where substantial agricultural
investments were planned.
5.          The project had three components:  (a) construction and maintenance
of rural roads, (b) construction and improvement of a national road, and (c'
technical assistance to the Department of Transportation and Communications
(DOTC)6I and to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) for
transport planning.
6.          The rural roads <.mponent was carried out by DLG and the provincial
governments and included:
(a)   construction and improvement of about 730 km of provincial and
barangay roads in the provinces of Iloilo, Cebu, Aklan, Quezon,
Camarines Norte and Ilocos Sur;
(b)   a maintenance program for the six provinces consisting of (i)
construction and improvement of provincial workshops and qu. .ity
control laboratories, and (ii) procurement of road maintenance
equipment, spare parts, tools, and machinery for provincial
workshops and for quality control laboratories;
(c)   procurement of engineering tools and equipment, training apparatus
and supplies for DLG and the six provinces;
(d)   technical assistance (i) to DLG and the six provinces for improved
transport planning, engineering, quality control, construction
supervision, and maintenance, and for technical and on-the-job
training in road maintenance, and (ii) to DLG and DPH's Planning and
Project Development Office (PPDO) for services provided to prepare
the project, including traffic surveys and analyses (under
retroactive financing); and
(e)   consulting  services  for  detailed  engineering  and  construction
supervision of (a) and (b) above, and for feasibility studies to
prepare a future rural roads improvement project.
7.          DPWH was responsible for the national road component which included:
(a)   reconstruction and improvement of about 150 km of road linking San
Jose and Mamburao along the western coast of the island of Mindoro,
Then called the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).

to serve fertile agricultural areas which were accessible only by
sea during part of thus year;
(b)   construction of new facilities for the DPWH Soils and Materials
Qualit.r Control Service (SMQCS); and
(c)   consulting services for construction supervision of (a) above and
for detailed engineering and construction supervision of (b) above.
8.          Thb DOTC and NEDA were responsible for the transport planning
component which included continuation of transport adviso y services financed by
the sank under previous projects to help improve transport planning and the
implementation of a study for the preparation of the national transport
investment program.
Project Design and Organization
9.          The design and organization of the national road 'tnd transport
planning components were straightforward and appropriate. The former dealt with
the construction of one road and was the responsibility of only one government
agency, DPWH.   The latter dealt with technical assistance and was also the
responsibility of one government agency, DOTC.
10.         However, the rural roads component, accounting for about 62% of the
estimated project cost, was, in retrospect, overambitious. The component was
designed to support the Government's priority objectives of rural development and
decentralization, and was a continuation of a long-term effort, initiated by the
Government with USAID assistance, to upgrade provincial capabilities to the point
where they could develop and maintain the rural road network independently, with
only general guidance from DLG.
11.         The  ix pilot provinces -- Iloilo, Cebu, Aklan, Quezon, Camarines
Norte and Ilocos bar -- were selected for inclusion in the project to achieve
adequate impact with the resources available. With greatly different fiscal and
implementation capabilities, the six provinces represented a cress-section of the
country's 73 provinces. Ii Alo and Cebu were relatively better off and further
advanced than Quezon and Aklan, while Ilocos Sur and Camarines Norte were among
the poorest and least-developed provinces. DLG expected to use the experience
gained during implementation of this component to develop the road planning,
construction and maintenance capacities of all provinces countrywide, replicating
the approaches where applicable and modifying them where necessary.
12.         Prior to project implementation neither DLG nor the provincial
governments had sufficient resources and capabilities to carry out the activities
envisioned under the project. Furthermore, responsibilities for rural roads were
still ill-defined and overlapping.  The project addressed these deficiencies
through covenants in the Loan Agreement (see Part III, Section 6) as well as an
Action Program for Project Implementation (see Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) pages
37-42), the main remedies of which were as follows:



(a)   the National Government, through DLG, and the provincial governments
were to provide sufficient funds for the construction and
maintenance of rural roads;
(b)   DLG, DPWH, the Department of Finance (DOF), the Department of Budget
and Management (DOBM) and the project provinces were to agree on a
division of responsibilities for constructing and improving local
roads, including budgetary authority and funding allocations, with
DLC( responsible for overall administration of the roads regardless
of the source of funding;
(c)   DLG and the project provinces were required to improve their
management and organization and to recruit experienced staff to fill
key positions in road planning, design, construction and
maintenance; and
(d)   local and expatriate consultants were to be hired to assist DLG and
the provincial governments to implement the component and to train
staff. The project included: six technical advisors to DLG for a
two-year period (totalling 144 person-months); nine advisors to each
of the six provinces for two years (totalling 216 person-months); 48
person-months of consultant assistance to help develop a training
program; and 72 person-months of technical assistance to institute
an on-the-job training program in road maintenance in the six
provinces.
13.         The conceptual  foundation  for  the  rural  roads  component was
appropriate and clear: rural development and decentralization. The design was
also clear. However, it was based on too many institutional changes intxi-duced
in too short a time. Technical assistance to aid DLG and the provinces to assume
their new responsibilities was provided for only about two years up to December
1982, although the project was not slated for completion until end-1984. In
addition to the overly-ambitious implementation schedule and targets to be
achieved, the design of the component was overoptimistic regarding the
availability of local funds and qualified staff. The scope and scale of the
component were therefore too large, given the pilot nature of the project and its
complexities. It would have been better to start the project only if and when
the Government had accomplished most of the institutional improvements and
chianges included in the Action Program.
14.         The Staff Appraisal Report for the project correctly identified one
of the major project risks as DLG's and the provinces' implementatiou capacity
in view of their lack of trained staff and the broad new responsibilities being
given them. However, the measures taken to minimize the risks -- the provision
of massive technical assistance, organizational changes and an Action Program to
be carried out by the Government -- were not implemented as envisioned -- the
organizational changes did not take place as planned, the technical assistance
did not perform as well as expected and the Government did not implement the
agreed action program as planned.
15.         It is revealing that during project preparaticn USAID expressed
reservations about the Bank's approach and design of the project.   USAID's



objectives in rural road development in the Philippines had been more to develop
decentralized institutional capacity at the provincial level and to reach the
rural poor, laying a sound bpsis for more equitable long-run economic growth,
rather than to maximize short-run economic potential. USAID felt that the level
of sophistication and control sought by the Bank in project design and
implementation necessitated heavy use of foreign consultants and precluded full
local-level involvement.   It also objected to the project's focus on six
provinces, which under-utilized established institutional capacity in many other
provinces.
Proiect Implementation
16.         Project works were completed by December 1988, four years later than
expected. In general, the project suffered from (a) the economic recession of
1983-84, which significantly constrained the availatility of counterpart funds
and delayed government payments to contractors; (b) the devaluation of the peso
against the U.S. dollar from P 7.4 in 1980 to P 21.4 in 1988, which resulted in
a sharp increase in the cost of some project inputs; (c) difficulties in
obtaining inflation adjustments for civil works carried out by contractors, who
slowed down or stopped their work; and (d) the political disruption throughout
the mid-1980s and the change in government in 1986, which resulted in widespread
staff changes and the need to retrain the newly-appointed staff.
17.         Rural Roads ComRonent.  A detailed draft Project Completion Report
for this component, prepared by DLG, is on Bank files. At project completion in
1988 only about 63% of the rural road program had been completed and another 24%
was still in progress. Among the major problems affecting implementation were
the 1983-84 recession and the political unrest in the country, both of which
could not have oeen foreseen at the time of project preparation and were beyond
the conttol of the Government. The recession brought on a series of problems,
including the peso devaluations and the consequent sharp increases in the costs
of construction materials, fuel, equipment, spare parts and labor, which, in
turn,  increased the Government's contribution to project  financing.   The
Government was unable to provide the hi,her than estimated amount of funds and
delayed payments to contractors, a number of whom were forced to abandon wo.k.
To help, the Bank agreed to include the project in the Special Action Program in
1984 and to increase its contribution to financing project civil works from 55%
to 72%.   Political insurgency also forced some contractors to slow down or
abandon work.
18.         Three other problems affecting implementation also stand out: the
failure to transfer responsibilities for rural roads to DLG, the delays that
affected every phase of the project, and poor maintenance of rural roads:
(a)   Although DLG had been expected to become the main agency responsible
for rural roads, existing laws provided DPWH with authority for
rural road supervision and financial matters until 1988. DOF, DOBM,
NEDA, and the local governments also continued to be involved to
some extent. The overlapping responsibilities and long delays in
decision making resulting from this situation contributed to slow
implementation.



(b)   Partly due to the confused administrative responsibilities for the
rural roads and partly due to the Government's financial
constraints, the component was plagued by numerous delays to almost
every phase of its implementation including: the hiring of technical
assistance and qualified staff, the preparation of detailed
engineering and bidding documents, the preparation of annual
programs for construction and maintenance of rural roads, approval
of DLG budgets, the acquisition of road rights-of-way, the approval
of contract awards and payments, the release of funds, and the
execution of contracts.
(c)   Although  it  was  recognized  at  project  appraisal  that  road
maintenance was the greatest weakness in the Philippine highway
sector,  the project's maintenance  program  for provincial  and
barangay roads was not carried out properly, mainly due to lack of
funds and diversion of funds and equipment from maintenance to other
purposes, often for political reasons. As a result of inadequate
maintenance, all roads in the project provinces, including those
improved under the project, deteriorated very rapidly. In its PCR
for this component, DLG estimates that from 15% to 25% of the gravel
roads and about 25% of the paved roads were in poor condition in
1989 because of the poor quality of improvement work and
maintenance.   Since both DLG's PCR and Bank supervision reports
indicate that these problems were wide-spread in all six project
provinces, the actual percentages of roads in poor condition might
be much higher.
19.         Mechanical workshops financed under the Bank-assisted Third and
Fourth Highway Projects (Lns. 1353 and 1661-PH) were considered adequate for
maintaining and repairing the equipment of both DPWH and DLG. Therefore, only
one workshop in Ilocos Sur Province was actually built under the project, rather
than the six originally envisioned. A contract for the construction of this
workshop was signed in June 1983, but the contractor abandoned the site because
of delays in adjusting the contract prices to reflect price increases.
Construction was eventually completed in September 1986.
20.         National Road CogWonent. A detailed draft Project Completion Report
for this component, prepared by DPWH, is on Bank files. Improvement of the San
Jose-Mamburao road (171 km at completion) was originally to be completed by end-
1983 but most works were not finished until end-1987. Bridge and spillway works,
including a newly designed bridge over the Bugsanga River, were not completed
until May 1990, about one year after loan closing. Completion of works therefore
took about eight years as compared to the three years estimated at appraisal.
21.         Implementation delays were largely due to:  (a) typhoons, which
damaged the road during construction and several times after completion,
necessitating redesign/repair of some structures and road sections; (b) redesigns
required due to faulty detailed designs; (c) delayed payments to contractors; (d)
the inaccessibility of some road areas during the rainy season; (e) the scarcity
of construction materials; and (f) weakness of one contractor. The quality of
works was average, and the quality of maintenance was poor because of lack of
funds.



22.         Construction of DPWH's Central Soils and Materials Laboratory was
expected to be completed in two years by mid-1984. However, the contract for
construction was not signed until February 1983, and construction did not start
until January 1987 because the site was occupied by squatters. Construction was
completed in September 1987.
23.         TransRort  Planning  Component.    This  component,  consisting of
technical assistance to DOTC and NEDA for transport planning and a study for the
preparation of the national transport investment program, was completed in August
1982, four months earlier than estimated at appraisal.
Project Cost
24.         The actual total project cost was about P 1,346.6 million, or about
73% higher than the P 776.4 million estimated at appraisal. This increase was
mainly brought about by several devaluatioais of the peso and consequent sharp
increases in the cost of construction materials. The actual total project cost
in U.S. dollars was about US$82.3 million or 21% less than the US$104.9 million
estimated at appraisal. The decrease was largely due to tne revaluation of the
U.S. dollar vis-a-vis the peso as well as overestimated equipment costs at
appraisal.
Project Results
25.         The project showed very mixed results with respect to its immediate
objectives to: (a) reconstruct, rehabilitate and maintain priority rural roads,
and (b) strengthen the capacity of provincial highway authorities to plan,
design, administer, and execute rural road programs and to maintain their rural
road network under the overall direction of DLG. Many rural roads improved under
the project showed evident signs of deterioration caused by the poor quality of
improvement work and lack of maintenance. Transport services, therefore, were
improved but not to the extent expected. The institutional goals were also only
partly achieved.   Both DLG and the six provincial highway authorities began
building up their respective capacities, but the scope of changes expected could
not take place as rapidly as originally planned, even with the help of technical
assistance.
26.         Similarly, the project seems to have fallen short of its long-term
goal of improving transport services to the rural population to stimulate
agricultural production and to increase rural incomes. DLG carried out project
impact surveys for ten sample rural roads constructed under the project with a
total length of about 125 km, or 27% of the total road length (463 km) improved
under the project. The 3urveys, conducted in May 1986 and in January 1989 (see
Part III, section 7), showed that (a) contrary to expectations, there had been
no significant changes in farm technology, (b) there had, however, been increases
in the production of certain crops and in the prices received by the farmer at
the farmgate, (c) work opportunities were still very limited, and (d) average
annual daily traffic had increased significantly.
27.         According to the surveys, all ten sample rural roads showed major
signs of deterioration, characterized by excessive surface wearing, potholes and
run-off canals within the roadway.   The main causes of deterioration were



* 8 -
identified as follows: increased axle loads, insufficient drainage, typhoons,
and the absence of maintenance. It is therefore unlikely that roads in such poor
condition could reduce transport costs and have an appreciable social or economic
impact. Nevertheless, DLC's re-estimated economic rates of return (ERR) for the
sample road sections ranged from about 14% to 41%, compared to the 17% to 55%
estimated at appraisal. The re-estimated overall ERR for the component was 25%
compared to 31% at appraisal.
28.         Construction of the San Jose-Mamburao road was originally expected
to have a weighted average ERR of 23%, based on quantifiable benefits in the form
of increased agricultural production and savings in vehicle operating costs.
Calculation of the road's actual ERR was not carried out by DPWH in its PCR for
this component and could not be carried out by Bank staff due to a lack of data
on agricultural output in the area of the project road. However, lt is unlikely
that the estimated ERR was realized since the road was not fully in service until
very recently, when the Bugsanga River bridge was completed.   Without this
bridge, traffic on the road has been in the range of 65 to 213 vehicles per day.
Project Sustainability
29.         To maintain an acceptable level of net benefits throughout its
economic life, the rural roads and bridges improved or built under the project
must be maintained properly and adequately. So far, this has not been done.
Bank PerfQrmance
30.         The Bank performed relatively well from project preparation to
project effectiveness.   However, if more weight had been given to USAID's
reservations about the Bank's approach and design for the project, some problems
during project implementation might have been avoided.
31.         The Bank did not perform well during project implementation.  It sent
18 supervision missions to the Philippines from October 1980 to September 1988,
i.e., about two missions per year, with a total of 270 days in the field over the
life of the project or an annual average of 34 days. However, each mission
supervised an average of four projects, suggesting that about one quarter of the
total time, or about 68 days, was actually spent in field supervision of the
Rural Roads Improvement Project. This was not sufficient for a project spread
over a number of provinces and implementing agencies and requiring 3ignificant
organizational changes. During project preparation and appraisal, the Bank showed
great concern about DLG's and the provincial governments' deficiencies that could
adversely affect project implementation and therefore required a lengthy action
Program and numerous covenants in the Loan Agreement to facilitate
implementation. However, once the project was approved, these provisions were
not assiduously enforced.
Borrower Performance
32.         The borrower did not perform well.  The loan covenants and Action
Program were not fully implemented, and steps to overcome problems in
implementation were taken very slowly.   It is not possible  to attribute
responsibilities among the various agencies involved in the project. However,



- 9 -
DLG should not be considered fully responsible for the numerous problems that
affected the rural roads component since it was not given the authority for rural
roads as planned.   Furthermore, this was the first large road project to be
implemented by DLG.
Project Relationship
33.         The Bank and the borrower maintained a steady dialogue throughout the
course of the project in an attempt to overcome the internal and external
constraints on projec implementation. The borrower requested, and the Bank
agreed to, various measures to facilitate project completion, including several
extensions of the loan closing date, the implementation of jointly-prepared
action programs to speed the course of works, the establishment of a Special
Account and an increase in the disbursement rate for civil works from 55% to 72%
in 1984 to ease local financing constraints, the reallocation of loan proceeds,
and the adjustment of contract prices.
Consulting Services
34.         All consultants hired under the project seem to have performed
relatively well. The Bank's files contain little information about the quality
of the consultants' work, but DLG's PCR on the rural roads component indicates
that the consultants involved possessed the required technical competence, but
were lacking in management skills and were initially rather lax about quality
control. These deficiencies, however, were rectified over time.
Proiect Documentation and Data
35.         The quality of project documentation was uneven. The appraisal report
was carefully prepared, clear and provided a useful framework for the Bank and
the Borrower during project implementation. While it might have been technically
preferable if the Loan Agreement had included specific covenants reflecting the
Action Plan, it is unlikely that this would have influenced compliance with the
Action Plan, considering the generally difficult circumstances prevailing during
project implementation. Supervision reports were often inadequate, however.
Findings and Lessons Learned
36.         The project experienced many problems and delays.   Some of the
problems were undoubtedly due to the very difficult fiscal situation and
political climate prevailing in the Philippines during most of the 1980s. Some
of the problems were due to the project's expectations, first, that well-
established line agencies and politically motivated local governments would
relinquish their authority over the rural roads subsector to DLG and, second,
that the provincial governments, with largely inexperienced and inadequately
trained staff, would become capable of assuming major responsibility for the
rural roads subsector in a relatively brief time. Finally, some of the problems
were due to the Bank's inadequate supervision of the project, which seems to have
received only about 70 days of field supervision during its eight-year life and
little attention to the crucial institutional improvements to be made under the
project Action Program. The lessons to be learned from the project are therefore
as follows: (a) major institutional changes should be expected to take a fairly



- 10 -
long time to carry out, particularly if legislative changes are necessary for
their implementation; (b) major institutional changes should preferably be
completed as a condition for further processing of a proposed project, e.g.,
prior to appraisal, rather than after a loan has been approved; and (c) projects
carried out by inexperienced entities in remote areas of the country require
intensive, conscientious supervision.

7. Project Rewtlts
A. Economic Imoact
The project roads, including the San Jose-Mamburao road, served
predominantly agricultural areas. At appraisal, major quantifiable benefits
were expected to result from the provision of more economical transportation
in those areas where an existing or potential transport demand had been
identified. Because the project would provide remote barrios with low-cost
transport and easy access to agricultural extension workers, farmers were
expected to be able to introduce hybrid varieties, to adopt diversified
production and multicropping and to cultivate idle land. Ultimately,
agricultural production was expected to increase. In addition, a number of
case studies undertaken in the Philippines had shown a close correlation
between improved roads and higher farmgate prices for agricultural commodities
as well as increased transfer of modern farming techniques through
agricultural extension services.
Benefits from traffic were expected to be generated as a result of reduced
transport costs of non-agricultural commodities, such as consumer goods,
minerals, and passengers. The average annual daily traffic on the project
roads ranged from 10 to 933 vpd. Traffic was expected to grow at about 5-6%
per year. At appraisal, the returns on the rural roads ranged from 17% to 55%
with an overall ERR of 31%. The return on the San Jose-Mamburao road was a
weighted average of 23%. The overall ERR of all roads was 28%.
At project completion, DLG carried out impact surveys on ten rural roads
and one bridge totalling about 124 km, or 27% of the total road length (463
km) completed under the project. These surveys showed that (i) contrary to
expectations, there had been no significant changes in farm technology, (ii)
there had been increases in the production of certain crops and in the prices
received by the farmer at the farmgate, (iii) work opportunities were still
very limited, and (iv) average annual daily traf'ic ranged from 44 to 1,034.
Also, according to those surveys, all ten sample rural roads showed major
signs of deterioration, characterized by excessive surface wearing, potholes
and run-off canals within the roadway. The main causes of deterioration were
increased axle loads, insufficient drainage, typhoons, and the absence of
maintenance. It is unlikely that roads in such poor condition could allow
significantly reduced transport costs or have a substantial social or economic
impact.
The re-estimated rates of return (ERR) of the ten rural roads and one
bridge included in the impact surieys ranged from 14.5% to 41.5% as compared
to 17% to 55% estimated at appraisal. The re-estimated overall ERR was 25% as
compared to 31% estimated at appraisal. The ERR for the San Jose-Mamburao
road (171 km) was originally estimated at 23%, with benefits in the form of
increased'agricultural production stimulated by the road and savings in
vehicle operating costs. Calculation of the actual ERR was not carried out by
DPWH in its PCR for the component and could not be carried out by the Bank due
to the lack of data on agricultural output in the area of the project road.
B. Studies
Under the project, consultants carried out feaiibility studies for rural
road improvements in 22 additional provinces as preparation of a second rural
roads project. They started in September 1980 and finished in August 1982.
