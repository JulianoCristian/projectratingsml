BURUNDI
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Burundi has requested IDA assistance with
development of Burundi's telecommunications and posts over 1987-91.
Government's objectives are to improve the quality of telecommunications
and postal services and to make the services more widely available, For
telecommunications, the five-year investment program Government has
approved through 1991 amounts to $26.4 million equivalent, including $22.6
million in foreign exchange. The program comprises ongoing works
($1.3 million), the proposed project ($24.1 million) and preparation for
subsequent investments ($1.0 million). To finance the project, the
Government has secured $10.5 million equivalent from the Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE), $3.9 million equivalent from the Government
of the Netherlands and $3.9 million equivalent from a Dutch commercial
bank. The balance of $5.8 million equivalent will be financed with $2.3
million equivalent by the Office National des Telecommunications (ONATEL)
and $3.5 million from the proposed $4.8 million IDA credit. The remaining
$1.3 million of the proposed IDA credit would be used to provide pilot
assistance to the postal sector. The project was appraised in May 1984.
Delays in processing since then have been the result of Jifficulties in
securing sufficient cofinancing (para 2.16). The delay has stalled
ONATEL's investments and slowed new telephone connections. Institutional
improvements initiated under the First Project have been sustained through
the delay, but not progressed.
1.02      The components of Government's program identified for IDA
financing focus on institutional strengthening of ONATEL and on securing
basic efficiency improvements in the Department des Postes (DP). The main
components of the project are technical assistance and training in
telecommunications and posts, equipment for telecommunications maintenance
and for basic rehabilitation in the DP.
II. TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN THE ECONOMY
General
2.01      Burundi is the second most densely populated country in Africa
with 4.7 million inhabitants in 27,865 km2, or 169 people per km2. It is
also one of the poorest countries with a per capita GNP in 1985 of only
$242 equivalent. Most of the population lives in rural areas. Bujumbura,
the capital and only major town, has a population of about 150,000. It is
the center of Government and the main trading outlet: Burundi's main



- 2 -
transport arteries are shipping across Lake Tanganyika and the railway
through Tanzania.
2.02      Agriculture is the principal economic activity for about 95% of
the population. Within its rural development strategy, the Government has
identified areas for new business and commercial centers. However, without
effective communications these development efforts may be frustrated. Well
functioning communications are essential to stimulate development of
business and agriculture; to help Government's plans to decentralize
economic activity; and to reduce transport and communications costs.
2.03      Before 1980, telecommunications in Burundi were the
responsibility of the Telecommunications Department (TD) of the Ministere
des Postes et Telecommunications (MPT). In January 1980, the Government
established the Office National des Telecommunications (ONATEL) as a
separate publicly-owned parastatal entity. ONI"EL provides all public
domestic and international telecommunications qervices in Burundi. The new
ministry, the Ministere des Transports, Poste.-. e  Telecommunications (MTPT)
is the licensing authority for the telecommuni.ations sector and continues
to provide postal services. No telecommunications equipment is
imanufactured in Burundi.
ixvsting Facilities
2.04      At the end of 1985, ONATEL operated 20 automatic telephone
exchanges with an installed capacity of 8,130 lines. Average exchange fill
was 73% and 5,926 direct exchange lines (DELs) were connected. Most of the
exchanges are of an obsolete step-by-step electromechanical type. There is
only one new crossbar exchange and one new electronic exchange, both
installed under the first project (Credit 1058-BU, para 2.18). Telex
service is automatic and is available in 15 towns. In Bujumbura, telex
subscribers are connected to an electronic 300 outlet exchange provided
under the first project. International telecommunications are provided
through a Standard B satellite earth station and via Kigali, Rwanda,
through a very high frequency (VHF) radio link. International telephone
service is semiautomatic to Paris and Brussels and manual to Nairobi and
Kigali. The quality of international services is generally satisfactory.
Existing telecommunications facilities are indicated in Annex 1 and Maps
IBRD 18507-18508 Burundi.
2.05      At the end of 1985, the average telephone density was about 0.13
telephones per 100 population, one of the lowest in the world. The average
density in Sub-Saharan Africa is about 0.4 telephones per 100 population.
The telephone density in Bujumbura, about 3.6 per 100 population, is
similarly very low for a capital city. Public telephones and telegraph
services are available at post offices, and Public Call Offices (PcOs) were
installed in some rural areas under the first project.



-3-
Usage of Services
2.06      In Bujumbura, about 32% of telephone lines are connected to
businessei, 17% to government subscribers and 51% to residential
subscribers. Other towns have a lover share of residential subscribers and
a higher share of business and administratios subscribers. An analysis of
residential subscribers in Bujumbura shows that 16% are connected to
residences of government officials and 30% to professionals and business
people, many of whom use their telephones for business purposes.
Consequently, business users account for well over 50% of all telephone
lines.
Qualitv of Service
2.07      Local telephone service in Bujumbura is only fair.  Congestion i¢,
common and subscriber lines frequently are out of service hecause of cable
faults, particularly during the rainy beason. Repairs are often
unacceptably slow. Communications between provincial towns are difficult
because of bottlenecks in the long distance network. However, these will
be eased following completion of the first telecommunications project
(expected in December 1987). The proposed project aims at improving both
the reliability and capacity of the urban cable networks, which are the
weakest links of the present telecommunications network.
Demand for Service
2.08      At the end of 1985, DEL's in service met 63% of the expressed
demands/ for telephone connections. This does not take account of
unexpressed demand from potential customers discouraged ,rom registering
for service by long waiting times. Given the low telephone density in
Burundi (para 2.05) unex ressed demand probably is high. New and
replacement facilities installed under the proposed project would increase
the number of DELs by about 11.8% p.a. over the project period (Annex 2).
Considering the dearth of present facilities, total demand for
telecommunications services is expected to grow by at least this rate over
the project period. There is little risk of over-providing facilities.
Organization and Management
2.09      ONATEL was established in 1980 as a public parastatal entity.
Its organization (Annex 3) is considered satisfactory. ONATEL's Board of
Directors is appointed by the Minister of MTPT. The Board consists of
representatives from the Ministries of Finance (MOF), Commerce (MOC),
Transport, Posts and Telecommunications (MTPT), the Association of Traders
and Industrialists and ONATEL staff. ONATEL's Director General is also
appointed by the Minister of MTPT. ONATEL's management styles to an extent
still reflect its heritage as a Government department. Thus despite
improvements secured under the first project, most information continues to
1/ Working lines plus registered applicants.



- 4 -
flow vertically and managers do not always receive relevant or timely
information.
Telecommunications Staff
2.10      At the end of 1985, ONATEL employed 429 staff, or 72 per 1,000
DELs. This ratio is reasonable for the size of Burundi's network and
considering that ONATEL's staff also construct local networks. ONATEL
intends to reduce the ratio to 60 staff per 1,000 DELs by 1990. However,
ONATEL has insufficient qualified engineering, technical and financial
staff. Available resources are thus spread too thinly and the efficiency
of operations suffers as a result. This is particularly true for ONATEL's
maintenance function.
Telecommunications Training
2.11      MTPT's Ecole ;es Telecommunications du Burundi (ETB) was
established in ;979. The school has facilities to train 25% of ONATEL's
work force each year but its courses are restricted to operating level
engineering staff. No courses are provided for higher level engineering
staff nor for financial or administrative staff. Moreover, the niumber of
instructors at ETB has increased 11% p.a. since 1979 while the number of
graduates has fallen by 4% p.a. In 1985/86 there were 10 permanent and 20
part-time instructors, one UNDP volunteer and one ITU expert, but only 28
graduates. The training component of the proposed project would provide
fellowships, instructor training and training equipment to re-focus and
broaden course curricula and improve course management.
Accounts & Audit
2.12      ONATEL maintains commercial accounts and has produced draft and
audited accounts reasonably promptly. External audit of ONATEL's 1985
accounts was completed in August 1986 and accounts were received by the
Bank in October 1986. To complement the further strengthening of
accounting systems under the proposed project, assurances were obtained
during negotiations that henceforth ONATEL will present draft and audited
financial statements and accounts to IDA within four and six months
respectively of the end of each fiscal year [para 6.01(a)].
Billing and Collection
2.13      ONATEL's billing is processed monthly through the
Government-owned national computer center, Centre National d'Informatique
(CNI). However, CNI accords priority to Government work and ONATEL's work
frequently is delayed. Through the project, ONATEL will install its own
computers to speed up billing and to assist with general accounting.
ONATEL has the qualified staff to implement this.
2.14      At the end of 1985, accounts receivable were FBu 405 million
($3.5 million) equivalent to about six months revenues. Between January



and June 1986 the Government was billed for FBu 51 million but paid only
FBu 13 million. Private subscribers were billed FBu 272 million and paid
FBu 255 million. Government has now arranged transfers to clear its
arrears to ONATEL through December 31, 1986. During negotiations
assurances were obtained that henceforth Government and its agencies will
settle accounts with ONATEL promptly upon receipt of billing (para
6.01(b)). Assurances were also obtained that ONATEL will: (i) by October
1, 1987 present and agree with IDA upon a plan to reduce arrears from other
subscribers to agreed levels (para 6.01(c)); (ii) by May 1, 1988 and
annually thereafter present to IDA a proposed accounts receivable aging
schedule, indicating which receivables are irrecoverable (para 6.01(d)).
Sector Goals
2.15      Telecommunications sector objectives complement goals embodied in
Government's economic development plans. The main objectives are to:
(a) increase operational efficiency and quality of service
through improved management, maintenance and staff
development;
(b) ensure that revenues cover operating costs and contribute
significantly to investments;
(c) generate tax revenues for Government;
(d) extend services to rural areas; and
(e) expand facilities to meet expressed demand.
Sector Constraints
2.16      The four main constraints to telecommunications development are:
(a) management inefficiency;
(b) shortages of skilled staff;
(c) inadequate maintenance facilities; and
(d) unmet demand.
Management is the cost serious constraint. Despite improvements under the
first project, ONATEL is not yet regarded as a competent steward of the
sector. A signal of this is that the project has been delayed by two years
because ONATEL was unable to attract sufficient cofinancing (para 1.01).
Management inefficiencies have contributed heavily to ONATEL's modest
financial performance and modest transfers to Government. The sector's
contribution to development consequently still is well below its potential.
2.17      Shortages of skilled staff exacerbate management inefficiencies.
Shortages of financial skills result in slack financial discipline and
shortages of technical skills result in inadequate maintenance and restrict



- 6 -
project implementation ability. Maintenance difficulties are compounded by
shortages of equipment and poor maintenance procedures. These factors
aggi :vate the existing poor quality of telecommunications services through
high fault rates and long repair times (para 2.07). High unmet demand
further restricts the potential contribution of the sector to Burundi's
economic development.
IDA's Role and Strategy
2.18      IDA has been associated with telecommunications in Burundi since
1979 and approved its first credit to the sector in 1980 (Credit 1058-BU).
That credit aimed at securing basic institutional improvements, including
the establishment of ONATEL as a viable parastatal entity. Investments in
the first project focussed on expanding existing networks and providing
some service extensions into rural areas. Despite slow initial
implementation due to cost overruns and the need to secure additional
cofinancing, the projoct has enjoyed a good measure of success:  ONATEL has
connected 2,160 new DELs, 280 new telex subscribers and 44 new trunk
circuits and while financial performance overall has been modest,
year-on-year performance has improved steadily.
2.19      IDA has three main roles in the telecommunications sector in
Burundi. First, IDA is perceived by Government as a unique sour2e of
advice on sector and management organization, financial management,
investment planning and staff training. Government wishes IDA to maintain
its presence alongside ONATEL to pursue institutional development, to
strengthen ONATEL's financial management and to support training and
upgrading of ONATEL's staff. IDA's second role is to help maintain the
right balance between technical and institutional development of the
sector. Without IDA assistance, the sector would probably receive
inadequate assistance for improving management and strengthening financial
systems compared with assistance to 'upport equipment installation.  IDA's
third role has been to promote bila.eral financing by other donors.
Although Government experienced early difficulties in securing cofinancing,
IDA's involvement, though financially modest, attracted participation by
the CCCE, the Netherlands Government and a Dutch commercial bank which will
finance the majority of the sector's investment program.
2.20      Under its first credit, IDA assisted in reorienting ONATEL's
management organization and its planning, management and financial systems
from those of a Government department to those of a commercial ents.ty.
Results have been encouraging, but remaining management weaknesses continue
to throttle sector efficiency (paras 2.16 and 2.17). The objectives of the
second credit are to strengthen ONATEL's ability to operate and maintain
facilities, to plan future developments and to implement priority
investments. These objectives, and the nature of the institutional support
included in the proposed project (paras 4.02 and 4.04), are consistent with
reform initiatives to be carried out for other parastatals under SAL I.



III. POSTS IN THE ECONOMY
General
3.01      Burundi has only 38 postal facilities:  seventeen post offices,
two suboffices and nineteen postal agencies. This is equivalent to one
facility for every 124,000 people; about one fifth the standard set for
developing countries by the Universal Postal Union (UPU). Each persor
sends or receives an average of only 0.4 postal items per year. Even the
few postal setvices that operate are irregular and unpredictable, except
for their slowr3ss. Sorting of mail in Aujumbura is poorly organized and
usually there are only two vehicles available to cover the provincial
delivery circuits extending to 2,100 km. Many items posted are lost or
missing. This insecurity and the very poor service have led to a complete
loss of public confidence and consequently the whole postal system is close
to collapse. Annex 4 shows the distribution of postal traffic between the
twenty post offices. DP also provides postal checking services, and
administers savings accounts on behalf of Caisse d'Epargne du Burundi.
Utilization of these services and e:tensions into unserved areas are being
frustrated by the poor quality of postal services: only 20% of accounts
are held outside Bujumbura. This is holding back the contribution these
services can make to development through promoting trade and mobilizing
resources.
3.02      Postal services are provided by the Departement des Postes (DP)
within MTPT (Annex 5). DP is operated as a Government department and has
no financial autonomy. Consequently, its management is unconcerned with
financial performance and maintains only rudimentary cash accounts. DP's
annual budget falls within the overall Government budget and most of its
assets and parts of its operations are controlled by ministries other than
MTPT.  While cash accounts show that DP on average has been breaking even
over the last few years, no complete financial assessment of the sector can
be made imtil comprehensive accounting systems are installed. Moreover,
even the existing cash accounts are known to be unreliable. What is clear,
however, is that the postal sector does face serious institutional
difficulties. The diagnostic review of postal services (Annex 6) financed
under the PPF identified four main problem areas:
(a)  management organization is poor and management is
ineffective: DP's internal activities consequently are
poorly coordinated and the result ie very poor service to
customers;
(b)  present accounting and information data bases are
completely inadequate for management needs;
(c)  there are serious shortages of qualified staff
particularly for management positions; and
(d)  existing facilities are inadequate and dilapidated.



- 8 -
The review concluded that the provision of reasonable postal services
requires a complete overhaul of the sector; both the structure of the
sector and its internal organization and management. T[e review also
identified basic investment needs amounting to $1.8 million (Annex 6,
para 8).
Postal Staff and Training
3.03      The total postal staff is 208:  40 employed in administration and
i68 providing postal services. Of the latter, over 100 are employed in
Bujumbura and the rest in the provinces. Operational and middle level
staff are trained at the Ecole des Postes du Burundi (EPB) run by MTPT. A
few high level staff have been trained at an International postal school in
Brazzaville, Congo.
IDA's Role and Strategy
3.04      The Government has requested IDA assistance in addressing the
constraints facing the postal sector. Government wishes to establish a
sector structure and a postal enterprise which are able to provida
reasonable postal services. It recognizes that this is likely to major
reforms. The proposed project will include technical assistance (para
4.05) to study alternative sector structures, internal sector organization
and management, and provide training for selected high level staff. Terms
of reference for this assistance and a short list of consultants have been
agreed with DP. A condition of credit effectiveness wou,d be that
Government will have appointed a full-time project coordinator within DP
with qualifications acceptable to IDA [para 6.02(a)].
3.05      By providing early assistance as requested by Government, IDA
would have the opportunity to establish a dialogue with Government on a
strategy for a comprehensive postal reform. Such a dialogue would cover
sector structure, organization of the postal entity, its financial
management and the range of postal services and any financial services the
entity should provide. Government has postponed its decision on
restructuring of the postal sector pending discussions with IDA under this
project and the SAL I operation. Government has confirmed that by March
31, 1988, it will provide to IDA a plan and timetable for sector reform
based on recommendations of the study included in the postal component
(para 6.01(e)).
IV. THE PROJECT
Telecommunications Project Objectives
4.01      The telecommunications project will continue the reforms
initiated under the first project to increase ONATEL's operating and
financial efficiency. The project's objectives are to address the three
main constraints facing the sector (para 2.16) through:



- 9 -
(a) strengthening accounting and financial systems;
(b) improving staff training, particularly for high level
staff and non-engineers; and
(c) improving the reliability and capacity of local, long
distance and international telephone facilities.
Description of Telecommunications Project
4.02      The proposed telecommunications project would cost $24.1 million
and would comprise $4.2 million of technical assistance and $19.9 million
of telecommunications equipment (Annex 7). The technical assistance
propoced covers:
(a) improvement of accounting procedures, including billing
and recovery procedures;
(b) review of management organization and installation of a
management information system;
(c) 15 fellowships for selected ONATEL senior level staff;
(d) training experts provided through ITU to improve
curricula at ETB to make training more job oriented; and
ge) improvement of planning and procedures for programmed
maintenance;
4.03      Equipment financing covers:
(a) replacement and expansion of switching and distribution
facilities in Bujumbura, (13,800 lines of capacity in
total);
(b) installation of a new transit exchange for international
telephone and telex traffic and of a satellite earth
station for sending and receiving international
telecommunications;
(c) rural VHF multi access radio links to provide 70 public
call offices in rural areas; and
(d) about 15 maintenance vehicles, maintenance equipment and
tools.
The telecommunications project was prepared by ONATEL in cooperation with
the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which provided assistance
in preparation of bidding documents. The size and composition of the
project are based on conservative demand assumptions (para 2.08) and on
ONATEL's project implementation ability.



- 10 -
4.04      The project's technical assistance amounting to $3.33 million
would be financed jointly by the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE), the Netherlands Government and IDA. The complete package of
assistance provides balanced technical and institutional strengthening with
good prospects of sustained benefits through extensive training of
counterpart staff. Technical assistance to be provided by CCCE and the
Netherlands Government (Annex 8) is expected to cost $2.38 million. This
assistance will focus on technical support for the implementation and
operation of new equipment to be installed under the project and on
improving accounting procedures. Technical assistance to be provided by
the IDA credit is expected to cost $0.95 million. This assistance would
focus on improving investment and maintenance planning and on improving
management organization and management information. Terms of reference
(Annex 9) have already been agreed in substance with ONATEL. Alcondition
of credit effectiveness is that ONATEL will have appointed consultants for
this technical assistance [para 6.02(b)]. The 15 fellowships for ONATEL
senior staff will be divided approximatively equally between financial
training, management and engineering training. Each of the fellowships
will last three months. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
ONATEL would: (i) by January 1, 1988 provide for IDA's review proposed
fellowship curricula and training locations and a workplan for the complete
package of technical assistance (para 6.01(f)); and (ii) annually from
March 31, 1988, review with IDA implementation of fellowships and the
package of technical assistance and agree upon measures to improve
implementation where necessary (para 6.01(g)).
Objective and Description of Pilot Postal Component
4.05      The objective of this component is to help Government develop a
strategy for reform of the postal sector. Specifically, the Dostal
component would comprise:
(a) a study of sector structure alternatives and policy
objectives;
(b) installation of basic accounting and information
procedures;
(c) 8 fellowships for selected DP senior staff;
(d) training equipment at EPB;
(e) about 10 vehicles for mail transport, postal equipment,
maintenance equipment and tools; and
(f) construction of a parcel sorting center and a vehicle
shed.
The postal component was prepared by MTPT and IDA uider the PPF and is
expected to cost $1.3 million. Technical assistance to be financed by IDA



- 11 -
is expected to cost $300,000. Terms of reference (Annex 10) and a short
list of consultants have been agread with DP. A condition of credit
effectiveness is that Government will have appointed consultants for this
assistance [para 6.02(c)J. The eight f1llowhips for DP will be divided
approximatively equally between financial and anagement training. Each of
the fellowships will last three months. During negotiations assurances
were obtained that Government would: (i) by July 1, 1988 provide for IDA's
review proposed fellowship curricula and training locations and a workplan
for the technical assistance (para 6.01(h)); and (li) annually from March
31, 1989 review with IDA implementation of fellowships and technical
assistance and agree upon measures to improve implementation where
necessary (para 6.01(i)).
Total Project Cost
4.06      The total cost of the project is estimated at FBu 3,020 million
($25.4 million) with a foreign exchange component of about FBu 2,590
million ($21.8 million). Project costs are summarized in Table 4.1.

a/  Project expenditures are exempt from custom duties and taxes.
4.07      Foreign exchange costs of goods and services to be financed by
IDA are based on prices for similar goods obtained through international
competitive bidding in 1986 and adjusted for inflation to 1987 prices.



- 13 -
Foreign exchange costs of goods and services to be financed by CCCE and the
Netherlands Government reflect actual contracts or contracts presently
under preparation. These costs are reasonable and similar to recent costs
in other countries in the region. Local costs cover mainly civil works and
staff salaries. Estimates of these costs are based on 1985 prices adjusted
to 1987 levels taking into account inflation experienced in Burundi for
similar works procured through local competitive bidding.
Contingencies
4.08      Price contingencies for all goods and ser'lzes financed
externally represent about 3.7% of the total foreign cost of the project.
These are based on estimated foreign cost increases for equipment,
materials and services of 3% in 1987; 1% in 1988, 1989 and 1990; and 3.5%
in 1991. Price contingencies for local expenditures amount to about 19.4%
of the total local cost of the project. These are based on estimated local
cost increases of 6% in 1987, 5% in 1988, 5% in 1989, 5% in 1990 and 1991.
Physical contingencies of 5% have been included in both local and foreign
costs of the project.
Project Financing
4.09      The sources of project financing are summarized in Table 4.2.
The project's foreign cost of $21.8 million equivalent would be financed by
the CCCE, the Netherlands Government, a Dutch commercial bank and the
proposed IDA credit.2/ Local currency financing estimated at $3.6 million
equivalent would be provided by ONATEL through internally generated funds
($2.3 million equivalent) and by the CCCE ($1.3 million equivalent).
Financing provided by CCCE and the Netherlands Governmeiut is on
concessionary terms. On November 3, 1983, the Association approved a
request for an advance of $275,000 under the Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) to finance postal studies and preparation of bid documents.
2   In addition, the Italian Government has offered cofinancing of $1.5
million. This offer is for equipment which the CCCE has also offered
to finance. Government has not yet decided whether to accept the
Italian offer. If it does, cofinancing provided by the CCCE would be
reduced to $9.0 million. If Government proceeds with CCCE cofinancing,
equipment supplied probably would have to displace some equipment
financed by IDA under the first project for technical compatibility
reasons. Because this equipment is relatively new, it could be moved
and reused in another location.

From the IDA credit, $3.1 million equivalent would be onlent to ONATEL at
the IBRD rate for 17 years with a four year grace period. The balance of
$1.7 million equivilent would be provided to MTPT for the postal component
and expenditures relating to ETB. The loans from the Netherlands
Government and the commercial bank are already effective. The loan from
the CCCE is confirmed and will be onlent to ONATEL on the same
concessionary terms as to the Government. ONATEL will bear the foreign
exchange risks of these loans and of the IDA credit. During negotiations,
Government and ONATEL reconfirmed the size of ONATEL's 1987-91 investment
program. ONATEL also gave an assurance that it will consult with IDA
before making any changes to its investment program that would increase
investment costs by more than 5% in any year (para 6.01(j)). The signing
of a subsidiary loan agreement between Government and ONATEL acceptable to
IDA, and effectiveness of the loan agreement with the CCCE vould be
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit (paras 6.02(d) and
(e)).
Procurement
4.10      Procurement arrangements are sumarized in Table 4.3.
International competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines would be used to procure $2.1 million of telecommunications
equipment grouped in three packages. During negotiations, an assurance was
obtained that bids for the rural VHF component to be financed by IDA will
be issued by March 31, 1988 (pars 6.01(k)). Local competitive bidding
(LCB) acceptable to IDA would be used to procure $0.6 million of civil
works and vehicles. Limited international bidding (LIB), in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines and based on at least three price quotations,
would be used to procure $0.8 million of postal equipment, training
equipment, maintenance equipment and tools. LIB has been selected for
these packages because the amounts involved are small. Training and
consultancy services amounting to $1.3 million will be procured according



- 15 -
to the Bank's guidelines on the use of consultants.3/ Procurement of all
equipment and services to be financed by the CCCE, the Netherlands
Government, and the Dutch commercial bank loan is tied to those sources.
Prices under this tied procurement are reasonable, although somewhat higher
than could be obtained through ICB.

Contract Review
4.11       During negotiations it was agreed that documentation for all
contracts exceeding $100,000 will be reviewed by IDA prior to procurement
(para 6.01(1)). This implies that about eight contracts amounting to
$4.4 million (about 90% of the proposed credit) will be reviewed. Random
3/ Procurement will partly be under ITU procedures, which satisfy Bank
requirements.



- 16 -
post-award review of smaller contracts will be conducted during supervision
missions.
Disbursement
4.12      Disbursements for contracts procured through ICB would be made
against fully documented withdrawal applications. Disbursements for other
items would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOE)
detailing individual transactions in a given period, together with a
certification of payment of the amounts involved, and of their eligibility
under the proposed credit. Supporting documentation for SOEs would be
retained by ONATEL and MTPT and made available to Bank supervision missions
for review. To accelerate disbursements against foreign expenditures, two
Special Accounts would be established; one each for ONATEL and MTPT. The
account for ONATEL would have an initial deposit of US$200,000 and that for
MTPT an initial deposit of US$80,000. These amounts represent four months
of estimated peak disbursements. To provide local funds for the postal
component and expenditures relating to ETB, a Project Account with an
initial deposit of US$60,000 equivalent in local currency will be
established for MTPT by January 31, 1988, (para 6.01(m)).
4.13      The estimated disbursement schedule for the project is shown in
Annex 11. This profile is the standard IDA profile for Burundi. The
credit would be closed by December 31, 1993. Proposed disbursement by
category is shown below (Table 4.4).

Accounts and Audit
4.14      ONATEL and MTPT would maintain records of all transactions under
the credit. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government
and ONATEL that:



- 18 -
(a) no later than six months after the end of each fiscal
year the Special Account and P  tject Accounts would be
audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA (para
6.01(n)); and
(b) Government will also engage independent auditors
acceptable to IDA to audit DP accounts and will present
draft and audited financial statements and accounts to
IDA within four and six months of the end of each fiscal
year (para 6.01(o)).
Audit reports forwarded to IDA would include a separate opinion of the
claims submitted to IDA on the basis of SOEs stating whether such claims
are in accordance with the Credit Agreement.
Implementation
4.15      The project would be implemented by ONATEL and MTPT.  Switching
and transmission equipment will be installed and supervised by the
contracted suppliers. Laying and jointing of cables, installation of
distribution cabinets, poles, aerial cables and terminal cabinets would be
carried out by ONATEL's own staff under consultants' supervision. Annex 12
summarizes the implementation schedule, which is acceptable.
Implementation of the first project is proceeding satisfactorily after a
slow start (para 2.18).
Performance Indicators
4.16      Performance indicators to help ONATEL and IDA monitor project
implementation and ONATEL's operational and financial performance are shown
in Annex 13. Targets for 1987 were agreed during negotiations. By
December 31, 1987, ONATEL will also agree with IDA upon maintenance
indicators and targets for 1988 (para 6.01(p)). Operational, financial and
maintenance targets for all following years together with any corrective
action necessary will be agreed with IDA during the preceding year (para
6.01(p)). All targets agreed upon will be consistent with targets to be
determined for selected parastatals under the SAL I and Public Enterprise
Management projects. IDA and Government also will review the possibility
that ONATEL's investment program, its performance and financial policies
would be the object of a "contrat-programme" (similar to those to be drawn
up between the Government and selected public enterprises under SAL I).
4.17      Annex 14 summarizes ONATEL's performance against main covenants
included in the first project. Overall, ONATEL's performance has been
adequate. However, financial reporting has been consistently behind
schedule. This will be corrected through the technical assistance included
in the second project (para 4.02(a)) and the new audit covenant
(para 6.01(a)).

V. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Financial Analysis
ONATEL's Past Financial Performance
5.01      since it was established in 1980, ONATEL's financial performance
has overall reuaineA satisfactory. Accounts for FY80 to FY85 are given in
Annex 15. Table 5.1 summarizes ONATEL's financial performance during
1980-85 and expected performance during 1986. Table 5.2 summarizes
ONATEL's 1985 balance sheet. Between 1980 and 1986 revenues are expected
to show growth averaging 11% p.a. and operating costs to show increases
averaging 16% p.a. The higher rates of cost increase reduced ONATEL's rate
of return on net assets at historic cost from 26% in 1980 to 20% in 1985
and to an expected 18% in 1986. Accounts receivable grew by 19% p.a. over
1980-84. However, substantial improvements have been made since, due to
improved billing, prompt payments by private subscribers and due to
arrangements with Government to clear Its arrears to ONATEL through
December 31, 1986 (para 2.14).

ONATEL's Future Financial Performance
5.02      Forecast financial statements for FY1986-92 with supporting
assumptions are given in Annex 16. Table 5.3 summarizes ONATEL's expected
future financial performance. The projections assume that:
(a) new telephone and telex lines will be connected as shown
in Annex 2;
(b) traffic per telephone line will increase at 6% p.a.;
(c)  traffic per telex line will increase at 10% p.a.; and
(d)  the monthly subscription charge of FBu 420 is reinstated
effective October 1, 1987.
The projections suggest that ONATEL's financial performance is likely to
remain satisfactory over the project period: ONATEL's return on net
revalued assets after tax would remain above 12% and debt service coverage
would remain above 1.5 times.

To ensure that ONATEL's financial position remains satisfactory throughout
the project period, assurances were obtained during negotiations that:
(a) ONATEL's net cash generation in any year shall not be
less than the local funds required for ONATRL's approved
investment program in the following fiscal year or 25% of
total investment funds required, whichever Is the greater
(para 6.01(q)); and
(b) ONATEL's rate of return on average net revalued fixed
assets in operation would not be less than 12S
(para 6.01(r)).
DP's Financial Performance
5.04      DP's financial condition is unknown.  Cash accounts and estimated
balance sheets for 1978-85 are shown in Annex 17 and su_marited in Table
5.5. Although the figures show that DP has been roughly breaking even over
the last few years, these estimates are unreliable. Since there are
currently no reliable accounting data (para 3.02) meaningful projections of
DP's future financial performance cannot be made. ikwever, postal
consultants financed under the PPP suggest, from their experience in
similar countries, that DP has the potential to be profitable (see
Annex 6).

B. Economic Analysis
Tariffs
5.05      Existing telecommunications tariffs are sho.wn in Annex 18.  The
connection charge for a telephone is relatively low at about $15. Rental
charges were abolished by the Government in 1983. To offset the loss in
revenues, the call rate was increased from FBu 9 to FBu 11 per pulse.
However, Government has now decided to reinstate the rental charge of
FBu 420 for each connected line effective October 1, 1987. This will
improve the economic efficiency of the tariff and reduce applications for
service, which presently are inflated by low access costs. Also, the
rental charge will increase tax remittances to Government without
significantly affecting the efficiency with which the network is utilized.
Average annual revenue per DEL now is about $675 equivalent, relatively
high compared with other countries in the region. The Government and
ONATEL have agreed to review the structure and level of telecommunications
tariffs under the project and consultants appointed by ONATEL for this have
now submitted their final report. The consultants recommendations were
discussed at negotiations and an assurance obtained that Government will
enable ONATEL to adjust the structure and level of its tariffs as necessary
to earn a 122 rate of return in the following year (paras 5.03(b) and
6.01(r)).



- 24 -
5.06      Existing postal tariffs are shown in Annex 19.  Most charges were
increased substantially in 1986 and charges now are relatively high
compared with other countries in the region.
Benefits
5.07      Benefits from the telecommunications component of the proposed
project will reach most sectors of Burundi's economy and will be felt
throughout Government and business. Improved telecommunications will
improve management efficiency and improve coordination of economic
activities and so increase business productivity. Benefits will be felt by
rural communities as increased access to service improves their marketing
of surplus produce. A further benefit will be substantial tax revenues for
Government: Annex 16 indicates that ONATEL is expected to contribute about
FBu 2,350 million (about $20 million) equivalent4/ to Government's budget
over 1987-92.
5.08      Benefits from the postal component also would be distributed
widely and to a large extent would complement improved telecommunications.
For example, in urban areas, prompt delivery of business documents with
less mail loss would improve business efficiency and facilitate Government
administration. In rural areas a postal service is an alternative to
personal travel for exchanging contracts and payments. Improved postal
services therefore would help promote rural trade. To an extent improved
services would also foster resource mobilization through more widespread
use of the postal system. Improved postal accounting would enable the
Government to plan and monitor DP's budget more effectively.
Return on Investment
5.09      The estimated internal financial rate of return of ONATEL's
proposed 1987-91 investment program is 15% (Annex 20). Excluding taxes and
customs duties from project costs, shadow-pricing local costs and making a
conservative estimate of consumer surplus, the estimated economic rate of
return is 28%. Sensitivity analysis shows that a 20% increase in capital
and operating costs combined with a 20% reduction in benefits would reduce
the estimated economic rate of return to 15%. Furthermore, a two-year
delay in benefits but with no postponement of costs would reduce the
estimated economic rate of return to 15%. Both of these assumptions are
extreme and unlikely. On balance, there is a good prospect that the
project will earn a high economic return.
Risks
5.10      The project has been adequately planned and the inputs required
to various project elements properly determined and timed. Important
assumptions have been cross-checked with cofinanciers. Staff required for
implementation and operation are expected to be available as required.
4/ Interest payments to Government and corporate income tax.,



- 25 -
Bidding documents for procurement of equipment and services are close to
finalization. The availability of local counterpart funds is assured
(para 4.09). Residual risks facing the project are that project financial
benefits would be delayed through slow implementation and that
institutional improvements expected would not be realized fully. To
address physical implementation risks, IDA has agreed project
implementation targets with ONATEL and a mechanism to review (and where
necessary to improve) implementation of physical project components (paras
4.16 and 6.01(p)). To ensure that institutional benefits are realized two
precautions have been taken. First, the package of technical assistance
has been designed to include extensive training of counterpart staff and
with the appropriate balance between technical and institutional
strengthening. Second, Government anci ONATEL will agree with IDA upon
annual implementation targets for the package of technical assistance and
on any measures needed to improve implementation (paras 4.04 and 6.01(f),
(g), (h), and (i)).
Environment and Health Aspects
5.11      The project would have positive environmental and health
impacts. Improved telecommunications services improve emergency health
services; substitution of telecommunications for transportation reduces
environmental pollution.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a)  ONATEL will present draft and audited accounts to IDA
within four and six months respectively of the end of
each fiscal year (para 2.12).
(b) Government and its agencies will settle accounts with
ONATEL promptly upon receipt of billing (para 2.14).
(c) By October 1, 1987 ONATEL will present and agree with IDA
upon a plan to reduce outstanding arrears due to ONATEL
from private sulscribers to agreed levels (para 2.14).
(d) Annually from May 1, 1988, ONATEL will present to IDA an
accounts receivable aging schedule in January and July
each year indicating which receivables are irrecoverable
(para 2.14).
(e) By March 31, 1988, Government will presenit to IDA a plan
and timetable for reform of the postal sector based on
recommendations from the consulting study to be
undertaken under the postal component (para 3.05).



- 26 -
(f) By January 1, 1988, ONATEL will provide for IDA's review
proposed fellowship curricula and training locations and
a workplan for the complete package of telecommunications
technical assistance (para 4.04).
(g) Annually from March 31, 1988, ONATEL will review with IDA
implemenitation of fellowships and the package of
technical assistance and agree upon measures to improve
implementation where necessary (para 4.04).
(h) By July 1, 1988, Government will provide for IDA's review
proposed fellowship curricula and training locations and
a workplan for the pestal technical assistance (para
4.05).
(i) Annually from March 31, 1989, Government will review with
IDA implementation of fellowships and postal technical
assistance and agree upon measures to improve
implementation where necessary (para 4.05).
(j) ONATEL will consult with IDA before making any changes to
its 1987-91 investment program which would increase
investment costs by more than 5X in any year (para 4.09).
(k) By March 31, 1988, ONATEL will have issued bids for the
rural VHF project component to be financed by IDA
(para 4.10).
(1) ONATEL and Government will provide for IDA's prior review
procurement documentation relating to all contracts
exceeding $100,000 (para 4.11).
(i) By January 31, 1988, Government will establish a Project
Account for MTPT with an initial deposit of US$60,000
equivalent in local currency (para 4.12).
(n) No later than six months after the end of each fiscal
year the Special Accounts and Project Account, would be
audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA (para
4.14(a)).
(o) Government will engage independent auditors acceptable to
IDA to audit DP accounts and will present draft and
audited accounts to IDA within four and six months
respectively of the end of each fiscal year
(para 4.14(b)).
(p)  ONATEL will:  (i) by December 31, 1987, and annually from
October 1,1988, provide maintenance targets to be
achieved during the following year and review with IDA
performance against targets in the previous year; and



- 27 -
(ii) annually from October 1, 1988, provide operational
and financial targets to be achieved during the following
year and annually from May 1, 1989, review with IDA
performance against targets during the previous year
(para 4.16).
(q) ONATEL's net cash generation in any year shall not be
less than the local funds required for ONATEL's approved
investment program in the following fiscal year or 25% of
total investment funds required, whichever is the greater
(para 5.03(a)).
(r) Government will enable ONATEL to take all necessary
measures, including adjustments to the structure and
levels of its tariffs, as required for ONATEL to earn a
12% rate of return on net revalved assets in the
following year (para 5.03(b) and 5.05).
6.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness would be that:
(a) Government will have appointed a full-time project
coordinator within DP with qualifications acceptable to
IDA (para 3.04);
(b) ONATEL will have appointed consultants to provide the
telecommunications technical assistance (para 4.04);
5c) Government will have appointed consultants to provide the
postal technical assistance (para 4.05);
(d) ONATEL and the Government would have signed a subsidiary
loan agreement acceptable to IDA, whereby not more than
$3.5 million of the proceeds of the IDA credit would be
onlent to ONATEL at the IBRD interest rate for 17 years
including four years of grace (para 4.09); and
(e) conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the loan
from the CCCE are fulfilled (para 4.09);
6.03      Provided the above conditions are met, the proposed project is a
suitable basis for an IDA credit to the Government of the Republic of
Burundi, of SDR 3.8 million (equivalent to $4.8 million using the rate of
SDM 1.00 - $1x263).

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Postal Diagnostic Study
Summary Findings and Recommendations
Background
1.         This study of the postal sector in Burundi was conducted by
M. Pierre Le Saux, Honorary Inspector General of Posts and
Telecommunications, Climart, France at the request of the Minister of
Transport, Posts and Telecommunications. The study is part of the
preparatory work for the proposed Second Communications Project. The main
recommendations and conclusions of the study were discussed with the
Minister upon completion of the study. A full report of the work is held in
the project file (Annex 22, A3).
Main Findings
(Parentheses refer to paragraphs in main report)
2.         The quality of service overall is very poor and the coverage of
the network patchy. The volume of mail handled is minimal (paras 1.02 and
4.01).
3.         Postal services are administered like any other Government
department (para 1.03). The postal budget is part of Government's general
budget. Execution of the postal budget depends upon the economic
situation--budget cuts have been frequent in the past (paras 1.03 and 2.03).
4.         The management of the posts are inattentive to financial
performance (para 1.03). Accounting systems are only poorly developed.
Only cash accounts are kept and no provisions are made for depreciation.
There is no register of fixed assets (para 2.03). Cashier losses are
substantiAl (para 5.10). Because of the limitations to accounts, no full
financial assessment can be made of the sector at present (para 5.01).
5.         Only far-reaching sectoral reform is likely to produce reasonable
postal services with reasonable financial results (paras 1.04 and 4.03). A
prerequisite of financial viability is proper accounting systems
(para 1.07). Even so, financial self-sufficiency is unlikely in the short
term (paras 1.05 and 1.06). But with autonomous management, financial
prospects over the long term are good (para 5.11).



- 34 -                             ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 2
6.         Postal services are very short of qualified staff (paras 1.05 and
4.03). Management is poorly organized and ineffective (para 4.03) and staff
morale is low (paras 1.04 and 4.03). Vehicles and other postal equipment
are ia short supply and generally poor condition (paras 2.03 and 3.08).
Main Retommendations
7.         Investments aimed at rehabilitating faedlities will by themselves
be inadequate to reverse ~he fortunes of the postal sector. Reorganization
of the sector is required to establish a new postal agency with more
autonomy and responsibility for its financial performance (paras 6.12 and
7.02).
8.         Urgent investments amount to about $1.8 million over three
years.  The highest priority is for vehicles and facilities to maintain
them. Buildings also are badly in need of repair. The seotor also needs
considerable technical assistance (paras 6.05, 6.06, 7.03 and 7.10).
9.         The internal organization of the postal service needs improving
to facilitate operations (para 7.04). Improved management is needed most of
all (paras 4.03, 4.04 and 7.06). New training facilities at the postal
school should provide the management skills required (para 7.11).
10.        Accounting systems need to be improved and some aecourting
equipment is needed (paras 4.03, 6.08 and 6.09). Government should agree to
pay for postal services (para 7.07). Accouats receivable from foreign
postal entities should be pursued more vigorously (para 5.08 and 7.09).

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for Consultants
To be Financed by IDA
Introduction
1.         Public telecommunications services in Bu4rundi are provided by the
Office National des Postes et Telecommunications (ONATEL). ONATEL was
established in 1980 as a commercial public eAterprise. ONATEL's Board of
Directors is appointed by the Ministere des Transports et des Postes et
Telecommunications (MTPT). At the end of 1985, ONATEL operated 20 automatic
telephone exchanges with an installed capacity of 8,130 lines, but with only
5,926 DELs connected. This level of access is equivalent to about 0.13
telephones per 100 population; one of the lowest telephone densities in the
world. Moreover, the quality of Burundi's telecommunications servites
generally is poor: congestion is common and subseriber lines frequently are
out of service because of cable faults and long repair times.  At the end of
1985, ONATEL employed 429 staff for a ratio of 72 per 1,000 DELs.
2.         ONATEL's objectives under its 1987-91 development program aim to:
(a)  increase operational efficiency and quality of service;
(b)  ensure that revenues tontribute signifioantly to
investments;
(c)  generate tax revenues for Government;
(d)  extend services to rural areas; and
(e) expand facilities to meet expressed demand.
Government has identified management inefficiency as the most serious
constraint the sector faces. While ONATEL has made many improvements in the
last few years, remaining inefficienties threaten to constrain sector
development and hence the contribution which telecommunications can make to
development of the national economy. Government has applied to the
International Development Association (IDA) for support of ONATEL's 1987-91
investment program and ONATEL intends to use part of the proposed credit to
finance technical assistance to address remaining efficiency constraints.
The three studies proposed will review:



-39 -                          ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 5
(a) investment plans;
(b) maintenance plans; aad
(c) management organization and information.
In addition, the consultant will provide an engineering technical adviser to
work under contract to ONATEL for two years.
3.         ONATEL expects the six studies to require about 36 manmonths of
consulting effort over a nine month period. To ensure that the linkages
between the studies are treated consistently, ONATEL intends to award one
contract for all three studies. The consultant's team will have substantial
recent experience of telecommunications consulting in countries similar to
Burundi and will comprise engineers, accountants, financial analyste and
business specialists. ONATEL intends to invite bids by June 30, 1987 to
award a contract for the studies by September 1, 1987 and requires the
consultant's Final Report to be submitted to IDA and ONATEL by July 31,
1988. Terms of reference for each of the three studies and for the
engineering technical advisor are given below.
Review of Investment Plans
4.         The investment planning review will assist ONATEL in choosing
priority projects for the development program commencing 1991 and in
scheduling their implementation. The four main tasks of the consultant will
be to:
(a) assess the extent to which proposed telecommunications
investments will facilitate Government's targets for
economic growth;
(b) appraise and rank projects on engineering, economic and
linancial grounds;
(c) determine feasible implementation plans for selected
projects.
It is estimated that the review will require 12 manmonths of consulting
effort. The consultant's team will include an engineer, an economist and a
financial analyst.
5.         The consultant will review Government's economic and social
development plans to determine what telecommunications facilities are
required in order to meet the sector's objectives. Particular attention
will be paid to the rehabilitation of services in urban areas and the
extension of service into ;ural areas. Economic and financial appraisals
will rank projects according to their expected net present value and assess
the robustness of returns to changes in key input assumpzions.
Implementation plans will take into account the variability of projects'
returns with different implementation periods, the likelihood of securing
the foreign investment required and the ability of ONATEL to implement
proposed projects.



- 40 -                            ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 5
6.         Throughout the review the consultant will provide training to
ONATEL counterpart staff in the techniques of project appraisal and
implementation planning.  The consultant's final report will provide a
summary specification of each selected project to include:
(a) expected total local and foreign project cost;
(b) timing of expenditures;
(c) main material and equipment purchases; and
(d) main project risks.
Review of Maintenance Plans
7.         The review will update ONATEL's maintenance procedures for all
telecommuaications facilities and produce plans for programmed annual
maintenance. The consultant's two main tasks will be to:
(a) estimate the financial, management and manpower resources
needed to undertake programmed annual maintenance; and
(b) plan the deployment of these resources.
It is estimated that the review will require 12 manmonths of consulting
effort. The consultant's team may be totally comprised of engineers, but at
least one team member should have experience of Government and World Bank
procurement procedures.
8.         The consultant will devise financial and physical screening
criteria to select priority maintenance tasks and provide evidence that
benefits could in fact be realized. Financial criteria will ensure that
rates of return from maintenance projects are at least equal to the returns
from replacing unserviceable equipment. Physical criteria will scrutinize
the availability of spare parts and ONATEL's ability to perform the work
satisfactorily. Projects meeting both criteria will be included in an
annual maintenance program. Throughout the review, training will be given
to ONATEL counterpart staff in the appraisal techniques used.
Review of Management Organization and Information
9.         The review will:
(a)  review management systems and their information needs;
(b) review the compilation and distribution of management
information; and
(c)  plan the implementation of desirable changes.



- 41 -                         ANNEX 9
Page 4 of 5
It is estimated that the study will require 12 manmonths of consultiag
effort. The consultant's team will comprise business specialists,
preferably with experience of the telecommunications sector.
10.        The review of ONATEL's management organization will assess the
extent to which this reflects ONATEL's corporate objectives, is arranged
along commercial lines and gives adequate weight to financial planning. The
review will also assess whether decision making responsibility is a logical
over-lay of management organization, or whether responsibility is too
concentrated for efficient management. Where desirable changes in
organization and responsibilities are feasibJe, the consultant will
recommend how these changes should be implemented.
11.        The review of management information will assess whether the
information reaching different management levels enables managers to perform
their duties efficiently; whether sufficient relevant information is
reaching the right type of audience and whether information is clear and
timely. Where information flows can be improved, the consultant will
recommend how changes should be made.
12.        The Final Report will identify main weaknesses in ONATEL's
organization and information systems, recommend improvements and describe
how changes should be implemented.
13.        The principal task of the engineering technical advisor would be
to assist ONATEL with project implementation. A secondary task would be to
plan and implement the ohanges in planning methods recommended by the
consultants and to implement the system for programmed annual maintenante.
The engineering technical advisor would report directly to the Director of
Telecommunications.
14.        To undertake his priacipal task, the engineering technical
advisor will be able to:
(a) prepare technical bid documents and evaluate supply
effers;
(b)  ho:-d technical negotiations with potential and contracted
suppliers;
(c) monitor implementation of ONATEL's investment program and
initiate timely remedial action when this is needed;
(d)  monitor and control investment expenditures and prepare
project expenditure reports for IDA; and
(e) coordinate the works between different suppliers.
15.        To undertake his secondary task, the engineering technical
advisor will be able to:

Page 5 of 5
(a) define quality of service indicators and implement
necessary measurement and reporting systems;
(b)  define the traffic measures neaessary for efficient
operation of the network and to facilitate investment
planning and recommend how required data should be
collected and reported.
16.        In undertaking his duties, the engineering technical advisor will
assess the training and retraining requirements of ONATEL's technical
staff, He would also review the structure of ONATEL's technical management,
to complement the consultaats review of management organization, and
recommend aad implement improvements.

DEPARTEMENT DES POSTES (DP)
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance
To be Financed by IDA
Introduction
1.         Public postal services in Burundi are provided by the Department
des Postes (DP) within the Ministere des Transports et des Postes et
Telecommunications (MTPT).  DP's annual budget falls under the overall
Government budget and most of its assets and parts of its operations are
controlled by ministries other than MTPT.  DP provides postal services,
postal checking and money order services at 20 post offices throughout the
country. The total postal staff is 2087 \') employed in administration and
168 providing postal services.
2.         The Government of Burundi has applied to the International
Development Association (IDA) for a credit to assist the postal sector.
Part of this has financed a diagnostic review of the sector with the mWAn
findings that:
(a) management is extremely weak;
(b) accounting systems are Inadequate;
(c) there is a serious shortage of skilled staff; and
(d) existing facilities and equipment are dilapidated.
The Government recognizes the important role played by postal services in
economic development and now wishes to employ consultants to assist in
securing basic institutional strengthening in the sector.
Consulting Assistance Required
3.         The Government wishes to employ consultants to undertake five
studies. The object of the studies is to propose sectcr structure
alternatives and policies to improve DP's efficiency. The five studies will
review:
(a) accounting systems and financial planning;
(b) charging and account recovery procedures;



44 -                        ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 5
(c) postal charges;
(d) management organization and information systems; and
(e)  financial relations between DP and the Government.
Together MTPT expects the four studies will require about 24 manmonths of
consulting effort over a nine month period. To ensure that the linkages
between the studies are treated consistently, MTPT intends to award one
contract for all five studies. The consultant's team will have substantial
recent experience of postal consulting in countries similar to Burundi and
will comprise engineers, economists, accountants, financial analysts and
management and structual specialists. In their work, the consultants will
take account of the study on financial management of the posts 1981-83
undertaken by the Bureau T.C.M. MTPT intends to invite bids by June 30,
1987, and to award a contract for the studies by September 1, 1987. MTPT
wishes the consultant's Final Report to be submitted by March 31, 1988.
Terms of reference for each of the five studies are given below.
Accounting Systems and Financial Planning
4.         The two main objectives of the review will be to:
(a) recommend improvements in accounting systems and in
financial reporting to facilitate the preparation of
annual accounts; and
(b) prepare and analyse five-year financial projections for
the postal sector.
5.         It is envisaged that the study will require about 10 manmonths of
consulting effort. The consultant's team should comprise qualified
accountants and financial analysts. Particular attention will be paid in
the study to:
(a) the preparation of capital and recurrent budgets;
(b) the reliability and adequacy of base data;
(c) the adequacy of fixed asset records; and
(d) depreciation policies.
6.         The Final Report will include:
(a) draft accounts for 1986;
(b) an opening balance for 1987;
(c) provisional operating accounts and financing plans for
the next five years; and



- 45 -                             ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 5
(d) recommendations on how to install adequate accounting
systems and improve financial planning.
Charging and Account Recovery Procedures
7.         The object of the study is to recommead ways DP can improve its
collection of postal charges and accounts. The two main components of the
study will be to:
(a)  identify the main causes of cashier losses, improper
charging and charge avoidance; and
(b)  plan the administrative and equipment changes needed to
correct the main problems.
8.         It is expected that the study will require three manmonths of
consulting effort.  The consultant's team will include an engineer and a
financial analyst. Particular attention will be paid to the billing of
international postal traffic including DP's procedures for billing foreign
postal authorities and for paying accounts presented to DP. The consultant
will also review the age distribution of postal accounts receivable. The
Final Report will include plans to improve charging and account recovery,
including plans to deny service to delinquent postal users.
Postal Charges
9.         The review of postal charges will assess the extent to which DP's
present charges meet the costs of providing service. It is expected that
the review will require about three manmonths of consulting effort. The
consultant's team will include an economist, a financial analyst and a
postal engineer. The five main phases of the review will be to:
(a)  select the pricing methodology most appropriate for
postal services in Burundi;
(b)  determine tariffs for domestic and international postal
services using existing data;
(c)  compare the level and structure of DP's existing tariffs
with those estimated in (b) and recommend changes;
(d) assist DP in setting up tariff review procedures (and to
allocate responsibility for this within DP); and
(e) specify and initiate the collection of important missing
data.
Particular attention will be paid to practical ways of adjusting economic
tariffs to meet financial, fiscal and social objectives.
10.        The Final Report will include recommendations on the level and
structure of domestic and international postal tariffs for the next five



- 46 -                            ANNEX 10
Page 4 of 5
years, a plan for implementing desirable changes and plans for regularly
reviewing tariffs.
Management Organization and Information Review
11.        The consultants will define a commercial management organization
appropriate for the postal sector. The two objectives will be to:
(a) review management organization and management information
at different levels of responsibility; and
(b)  recomme-d and implement a simple end practical management
information system that would facilitate decentralized
management.
It is estimated that the study will require five manmonths of consulting
effort. The consultant's team will comprise business specialists,
preferably with experience of the postal sector.
12.        The review of DP's management organization will assess the extent
to which this reflects DP's service objectives, is arranged along tommercial
lines and gives adequate weight to financial planning.  The review will also
assess whether decision making responsibility is a logical over-lay of
management organization, or whether responsibility is too conceAtrated for
efficient managemeat.  Where desirable changes in organization and
responsibilities are feasible, the consultant will recommend how these
changes should be implemented.
13.        The review of management information will assess whether the
information reaching different management levels permits efficient
management, whether the right type of information is available and whether
this is clear and timely.  Where information flows can be improved, the
consultant will recommend how changes should be made.
14.        The Final Report will identify weaknesses in DP's management
which cannot be corrected within the existing management organization and
recommend how improvements should be made. The consultants will also
provide a plan for implementing desirable changes.
Financial Relations With Government
15.        The study will review financial relations between DP and
Government and other parties, particularly in relation to postal checking
and money orders. In addition, the study will make recommendations on:
(a) the renumeration of postal checking deposits;
(b) relations between postal checking and other banking
institutions; and

Notes and Assumptions on the Financial Forecasts 1986-92
Income Statements
1.         Annual increases in number of working DELs are as shown in
Annex 2.
2.         Average revenue per DEL to increase 6% p.a. and average revenue
per telex line to grow by 10% p.a.
3.         Telegraph revenues have been assumed to remain constant at PBu 21
million per annum.
4.         Other revenues have been assumed to grow at an average of 10% per
annum, from a total of about FBu 20 million in 1985 to a total of FBu 39
million in 1992.
5.         Wages and salaries have been assumed to remain at the 1985
average wage per employee.
6.         The number of staff per average 1,000 DEL in operation to decline
from 72 in 1985 to 60 in 1990. This implies the total number of staff will
increase from 429 in 1985 to 599 in 1990.
7.         Operating costs have been inflated at 5% p. a. (similar to the
projected inflation rate in Burundi).
8.         Depreciation has been calculated at 5% per annum of the average
gross plant in service in the year.
9.         Interest on new foreign loans has been assumed at the rates being
charged to Government.
10.        Corporate (income) tax has been assumed to remain constant at 45%
of operating income.
11.        The level of doubtful accounts as a proportion of gross revenues
would decline from 6% in 1986, to 5% in 1987, 4% in 1988, 3% in 1989 and
would remain at 2% thereafter.

Balance Sheets
12.        Increase in gross fixed assets is related to transfer from works
in progress as assets become revenue-producing. Work in progress on average
is transferred to fixed assets equally over the two succeeding years.
13.        Accounts receivable as a percentage of gross revenues would be
55% in 1986, 40% in 1987, 30% in 1988 and remain constant at 20%
thereafter.
14.        Inventory as a percentage of gross fixed assets to increase from
10% in 1985 to 12% in 1986, and to remain constant at 12% thereafter.
15.        Advances, prepayments and other current assets to remain at about
45% of cash operating costs.
16.        Accounts payable as a portion of work in progress and cash
operating costs would be about 35%.
17.        Long term debt represents existing commitments and proposed
borrowings from the Netherlands Government, BNP, CCCE and IDA. Withdrawals
are based on che disbursement profile.
18.        For determining the rate of return on revalued average net fixed
assets in operation, assets were revalued at 30% in 1986 and at aggregate
price contingency rates.

OFFICE NATIONAL DES TELECOMMUNICATIONS (ONATEL)
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Return on Investments
1.        ONATEL's investment program for the period 1987-91, of which the
Bank-financed project is an integral part, also includes ongoing and other
works. The close relationship between project and non-project investments
makes any attempt at separation arbitrary. Therefore, the rate of return
calculation is made on the basis of ONATEL's entire telecommunications
investment program.
2.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1988-2007, when on
average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
completed its useful life. The rate of return calculation assumes that
without the program: (i) traffic related operating costs per line would
increase 10% p.a. through 1993; (ii) telephone traffic per line would
increase at only 2% p.a. through 1993 instead of 6% p.a. with the program;
and (iii) telex traffic per line would increase at only 3.3% p.a. through
1993 instead of 10% p.a. with the program. Operating costs attributed to
the program are the incremental costs of the new telephone and telex lines
that would be connected less the operating cost savings realized on
existing lines. Benefits attributed to the program are the telephone and
telex traffic on the new lines that would be connected and the higher
growth in traffic on existing lines. From 1993 on, operating costs and
benefits relating to the program are assumed to remain constant. Annual
maintenance costs at 3% of program capital costs have been included
annually for the period 1993-2007. No residual values of fixed assets have
been taken into account as the present value of these in real terms would
be minimal. A summary of the program's incremental cost and benefit
streams is given below. Program costs are included net of price
contingencies and operating costs and benefits through 1993 have been
deflated at 5% p.a. The internal financial rate of return of the net
benefit stream is 15%.

3.        The above calculation understates the benefits to be derived from
the telecommunications investment program. It does not take into account
consumer surplus and indirect and external benefits received by non users
of the telecommunications services. A portion of the consumer surplus was
estimated by assuming that: (a) new consumers are similar to the average
existing consumer; and (b) existing and new subscribers will be willing to
pay for telecommunications services the same prices in real terms as they
pay today. Based on these assumptions, adjusting for taxes and duties, and
on applying standard conversion factors of 0.75 to local labor and 0.90 to
local costs and revenues, a minimum estimate of the economic rate of return
for the program is 28%.
4.        A sensitivity analysis was made on the economic rate of return
with the following results:
