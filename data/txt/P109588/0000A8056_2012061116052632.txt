                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project would be to: Improve the management of and the accountability for environmental and social issues related to large
                         infrastructure investments, with an initial focus on the energy sector.
                          The Project would initially focus capacity building efforts towards the energy sector, in support of the Energy Sector Development Project. The mobilization of
                         supplemental resources to more explicitly address issues in the mining and transport sectors would be explored during the project's mid-term review.
                          The expected long-term benefits of the project are to: (i) reduce the negative externalities of large infrastructure projects, and (ii) develop a transparent, stable and fair
                         framework for managing environmental and social risks that should comfort large infrastructure investments, and (iii) institutionalizes information flows between the
                         populations affected by large infrastructure projects and other stakeholders, and political decision-makers.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government of Cameroon sent a request for an early closing of the project in February 2012 which had a negative impact on the entities involved in project implementation.
                         Following this decision, only few activities of the annual work plan were undertaken with a focus on field visit and impregnating workshops.

                          Some positive results were however produced: The Environmental and Social Unit of the Ministry of Energy and Water completed however the preparation of the Terms of
                         Reference for the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment of the Energy Sector, following a participatory consultative approach. This Unit is also being gradually recognized
                         by most of the structures under the Ministry of Energy and Water, as well as some Energy project proponents. The Energy Sector Civil Society Network also continues to be very
                         active and engaged in raising the environmental and social concerns of the population affected by major energy projects in Cameroon.
