                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project would be to: Improve the management of and the accountability for environmental and social issues related to large
                         infrastructure investments, with an initial focus on the energy sector.
                          The Project would initially focus capacity building efforts towards the energy sector, in support of the Energy Sector Development Project. The mobilization of
                         supplemental resources to more explicitly address issues in the mining and transport sectors would be explored during the project's mid-term review.
                          The expected long-term benefits of the project are to: (i) reduce the negative externalities of large infrastructure projects, and (ii) develop a transparent, stable
                         and fair framework for managing environmental and social risks that should comfort large infrastructure investments, and (iii) institutionalizes information flows
                         between the populations affected by large infrastructure projects and other stakeholders, and political decision-makers.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Environment and Protection of Nature (MINEP) is progressing and was enhanced by the recruitment of 50 environmental specialists.
                         All of the recruited staff have strong relevant educational background and adequatetechnical skills and competencies; and once fully deployed should enhance the overall
                         performance of MINEP in reviewing and approving Environmental Impact Assessments.

                         The Environmental Unit at the Ministry of Energy and Water is finally staffed with competent young professionals actively engaged in advising energy project promoters and reviewing
                         energy projects to ensure compliance with environmental and social regulations and requirements.

                         The civil society organization Network remains very active and engaged with concerned entities; and they are also proving to be able to successfully raise to the environmental and
                         social concerns related to infrastructure projects, particularly in the energy sector.
