                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objective of the project would be to: Improve the management of and the accountability for environmental and social issues related to large
                         infrastructure investments, with an initial focus on the energy sector.
                          The Project would initially focus capacity building efforts towards the energy sector, in support of the Energy Sector Development Project. The mobilization of
                         supplemental resources to more explicitly address issues in the mining and transport sectors would be explored during the project's mid-term review.
                          The expected long-term benefits of the project are to: (i) reduce the negative externalities of large infrastructure projects, and (ii) develop a transparent, stable
                         and fair framework for managing environmental and social risks that should comfort large infrastructure investments, and (iii) institutionalizes information flows
                         between the populations affected by large infrastructure projects and other stakeholders, and political decision-makers.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         The institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Environment and Protection of Nature is underway, and should be further enhanced by the recruitment of 50 environmental
                         specialists. The Environmental Unit at the Ministry of Energy and Water has just been recently created, and adequate staffing is needed.

                         The project facilitated the creation of network of civil society organizations. This network is quite active and engaged with concerned entities and raising the environmental and social
                         concerns of the general public with respect to infrastructures projects in the energy sector.
