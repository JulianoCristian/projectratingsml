Environmental and Social\n            Capacity Building for the Energy Sector Project for Cameroon\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in the case of early project closure, the\n            Bank should give due attention to the sustainability of\n            activities. An exit strategy prepared jointly with all\n            stakeholders, discussing options for maintenance and\n            securing future funding sources, should be a priority\n            activity before project closing. A multiagency capacity\n            building initiative, especially with respect to safeguards,\n            may be more effective if embedded in an investment project\n            rather than as a stand-alone project. To overcome the\n            complexity of multiagency projects, strong leadership and\n            simple project design can play critical roles. A balance\n            needs to be established to strengthen, on the one hand,\n            multi-agency coordination inherent for the management of\n            social and environmental safeguard issues and promote\n            country ownership, while ensuring, on the other hand, a\n            limited complex institutional arrangement to allow adequate\n            support and monitoring by the Project Implementation Unit,\n            or PIU and the WB task team. To start initially with fewer\n            implementing agencies can be more effective in particular in\n            countries with limited capacity and a weak implementation\n            record. Multi-sectoral projects also suggest to be better\n            placed under the Prime Minister's Office to manage\n            various stakeholders instead of one sectoral Ministry, such\n            as the Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection, or\n            MinEP. Additionally, the success of a multi-stakeholder\n            approach depends on the strong leadership needed to ensure\n            guidance, oversight, and capitalizing on experiences."}, "docdt": "2014-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
