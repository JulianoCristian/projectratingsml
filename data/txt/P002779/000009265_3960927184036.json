The project will provide financing and technical\n            assistance in support of: (i) expanded cashew and coconut\n            research breeding and selection to develop higher yielding,\n            more disease and drought tolerant varieties/hybrids; (ii)\n            the development and operation of seven cashew development\n            centers and three coconut seed farms for the propagation and\n            dissemination of quality planting materials; (iii)\n            production development through the training of extension and\n            research staff and the dissemination of cashew and coconut\n            production packages; (iv) the management and coordination of\n            the cashew improvement and coconut development programs; (v)\n            cashew input supply and local marketing support; and (vi)\n            strengthening credit facilities in the southern cashewnut\n            production areas in the form of a pilot credit scheme."}, "docdt": "1989-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
