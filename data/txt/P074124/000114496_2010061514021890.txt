–
Grant No. TF050567 and

Dear Mr. Minister: 
 
We refer to the Letter Agreement for the Canadian Grant for Co-financing of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia Social Protection Economic Assistance Grant, dated May 9, 2002 
(the Letter Agreement), between Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia and 
Montenegro) (the Recipient) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (the Bank) and the International Development Association (the 
Association), and our earlier discussions regarding certain amendments to the Letter 
Agreement, in particular the agreement of Canada to provide additional funding of 
CND$500,000 for the above grant. 
 
We are pleased to inform you that IDA has agreed to your request and the Letter 
Agreement is amended as follows:  
 
The first paragraph 
of the Letter Agreement is amended to read: “I am writing on behalf 
of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the 
International Development Association (IDA) (IBRD and IDA being hereinafter 
collectively referred to as the Bank) to indicate the Bank's agreement, as administrator of 
grant funds provided by Canada, to make a grant in an amount not exceeding one million 
Canadian dollars (CND$1,000,000) (the Grant) to Serbia and Montenegro (the 
Recipient).” 
 
The table in paragraph 4.2 of the Annex to the Letter Agreement is replaced with the 
following table:
