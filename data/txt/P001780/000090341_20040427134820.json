The lessons learned\n            indicate that exclusive rights should be awarded\n            competitively - this applies to virtually all commercial\n            activities including exploration and production,\n            transportation, and distribution. As this Project very well\n            illustrates, without the benefit of tendering, agreements\n            have to be negotiated in detail, a lengthy and costly\n            process, without reference points or benchmarks. One should\n            have recognized at appraisal that developing a national oil\n            company required considerable capital, skills and experience\n            that for all practical purposes, are unaffordable for\n            Mozambique. Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos de\n            Mozambique (Mozambique Electricity Company) (ENH) hired very\n            qualified advisers, at a considerable expense, to strengthen\n            its capabilities, but whether this was sufficient to best\n            defend the national interest is a matter of debate. ENH\n            totally depended on its external advisers to appraise and\n            negotiate the transactions. Irrespective of their\n            performance, it does not appear that there was a substantial\n            transfer of skills particularly in the business aspects of\n            petroleum Joint Ventures. Had Mozambique given exclusive\n            rights to a private party in a concession in which the State\n            intends to invest prior to the submission of the Project to\n            the Board, the advisability of such a proposition would have\n            been heavily questioned within the Bank."}, "docdt": "2004-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
