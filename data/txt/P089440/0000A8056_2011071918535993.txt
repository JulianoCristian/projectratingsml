                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's Development Objective is to reduce regional inequalities and ensure quality water resources to meet the growing needs of the Federal District and
                         the Brasilia Metropolitan Region, through environmental planning and management activities, integrated with poverty reduction interventions and environmental
                         rehabilitation in the most critical river basins. Specifically, the expected outcomes of the project are: (a) improved water quality of the Vicente Pires and
                         Descoberto Rivers; (b) improved living conditions in targeted low-income settlements by providing integrated urban environmental services; and (c)
                         strengthened technical and institutional capacity, contributing to development of the Brasilia metropolitan region.

                         but some key activities are still to be concluded. Works for the Vicente Pires sewerage system -financed under counterpart funds- are also well underway, although the development
                         objective of improving water quality in the adjoining river would be expected to be achieved by December 2012 upon the conclusion of the entire system.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project restructuring and amendment to the loan agreement approved on January 14, 2011, encompassed the following modifications (i) transfer of Project implementation

                         responsibility to a new agency-ADASA; (ii) redefinition of the Project description to reflect adjustments to some activities; (iii) modification of the results indicators to reflect changed
                         activities; (iv) reallocation of loan proceeds between categories and change in the percentage of eligible expenditures to be financed; (v) addition of "Preg Eletrico" to applicable
                         procurement methods; and (vi) reflection of the extended implementation schedule for selected counterpart-funded activities such as Vicente Pires sewerage system, which calls for
                         an extension of the preparation schedule of the Project Implementation Completion Report (ICR).

                         A second restructuring was approved and the Project closing date was subsequently extended from March 31, 2011 to December 31, 2011 to enable the achievement of project's
                         resettlement activities as well as remaining key activities under the Project, whose progress has stalled during the period of suspension of disbursements and which are necessary to
                         achieve the PDO.
