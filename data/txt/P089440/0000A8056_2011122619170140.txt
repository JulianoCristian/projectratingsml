                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project's Development Objective is to reduce regional inequalities and ensure quality water resources to meet the growing needs of the Federal District and
                         the Brasilia Metropolitan Region, through environmental planning and management activities, integrated with poverty reduction interventions and environmental
                         rehabilitation in the most critical river basins. Specifically, the expected outcomes of the project are: (a) improved water quality of the Vicente Pires and
                         Descoberto Rivers; (b) improved living conditions in targeted low-income settlements by providing integrated urban environmental services; and (c)
                         strengthened technical and institutional capacity, contributing to development of the Brasilia metropolitan region.

                         concerning the completion and delivery of resettlement houses in Vila Estrutural. As the Project approaches its closing date, a small number of households remain located in sites
                         earmarked for infrastructure improvements in Estrutural; these families have not yet been resettled and, as agreed with the Government of the Federal District (GDF), would not be
                         resettled until their resettlement houses – under construction or in procurement, using counterpart funds – have been completed.

                         The implementation of the other Project activities continued although at a variable pace. By the closing date of December 31, 2011, there will be several ongoing activities under the
                         Project (including counterpart-funded ones). The GDF has committed to continue the implementation of these remaining activities and to assume the financial responsibility for
                         payment for any activity carried out after the closing date. With several activities not concluded and/or still under implementation, it is unlikely that the Project development objectives
                         and expected results, as indicated in the Loan Agreement, would be fully achieved by the closing date, nor will the Loan have fully disbursed.
