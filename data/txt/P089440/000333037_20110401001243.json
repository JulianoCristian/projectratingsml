The extension is necessary to allow\n            the Federal District Government (GDF) to finalize the main\n            project activities, especially resettlement activities to\n            ensure safeguards compliance, and achieve the expected\n            project development objective (PDO) results. The nine-month\n            extension will allow the GDF to: (a) complete and deliver to\n            the affected families the houses of second phase in Monjolo,\n            as well as the water supply system and the rehabilitation of\n            a small access bridge; (b) complete the construction of\n            remaining resettlement houses in Vila Estrutural, in\n            accordance with the resettlement action plan, and\n            subsequently conclude remaining infrastructure improvement\n            activities in Vila Estrutural, including paving, drainage,\n            water and sewage systems, and public facilities; (c) improve\n            living conditions for scavengers in the Joquei landfill,\n            including the design of a recycling program for public\n            buildings, construction of a recycling facility with\n            equipment purchase and capacity building; (d) continue\n            preparation of key technical studies in support of\n            policymaking; (e) purchase lake cleaning equipment to\n            improve water quality, which is key to achieve the PDO; and\n            (f) conclude the sewage system for Vicente Pires, another\n            key activity to reach the PDO. The extension of the closing\n            date will also facilitate for the Bank team to continue\n            carrying out project supervision and implementation support\n            to the GDF for the remaining activities."}, "docdt": "2011-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
