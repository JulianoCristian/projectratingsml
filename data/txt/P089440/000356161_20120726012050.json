Brasilia Environmentally\n            Sustainable Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes\n            were unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            substantial; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory\n            and borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: as part of project preparation, more\n            emphasis should be put on assessing institutional capacity\n            and designing arrangements and mitigation measures to carry\n            out resettlement. Urban upgrading projects are best managed\n            by one agency with delegated authority for all activities\n            within the target area. The presence of an effective\n            grievance redress mechanism is critical to improve\n            development impact by minimizing potential impact on\n            beneficiaries especially in cases of resettlement. The\n            construction of resettlement housing should be prioritized\n            in the chronogram of major works and under the control of\n            the implementing agency. Resettlement options should enable\n            choice differentiated resettlement solutions, and open and\n            frequent consultation with affected families is essential.\n            Resettlement activities must be closely linked to the\n            control of new irregular settlements. The Bank's\n            safeguards policy is not always easy to implement in middle\n            income countries that have their own policies which do not\n            necessarily coincide with the Bank's. Although an\n            integrated approach to environmental sanitation is\n            considered good practice, it may be too complex for some\n            clients. The assessment of political economy issues should\n            be a key part of the preparation in complex/integrated\n            development projects."}, "docdt": "2012-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
