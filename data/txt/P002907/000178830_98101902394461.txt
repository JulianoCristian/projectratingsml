SECOND RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower                Government of Uganda
Credit Amount           SDR 62.9 million (US$70 million equivalent)
Terms                   Standard
Project Description:.  The proposed credit would, over a nine-month period,
finance the importation of agricultural inputs,
spare parts and raw materials for industry and
transport and other largely non-capital needs of
high economic priority. It would supp~ort the
Government's recovery program, in particular by:
(a) increasing agricultural exports and domestic
production in high priority areas, and (b)
strengthening the Government's capacity to formulate
and implement policies and programs in the following
critical areas: (i) the planning and budgeting of
foreign exchange; (ii) the pricing and marketing of
export crops; (iii) the parastatal organizations;
and (iv) external debt management.
The principal risks are that security conditions in
Uganda could again deteriorate, that the Government
would be unable to implement its recovery program,
and that shortfalls in financing could further
reduce import levels and delay recovery. These
risks have, however, been reduced by the Govern-
ment's clear commitment to improving law and order
and to its financial program, and its willingness to
respond positively to the concerns of the principal
donors. The Bank Group intends to assist the
Government in addressing the problem of foreign
*                                     exchange shortfalls in the context of the forth-
coming Consultative Group meeting.
Estimated Period of
Disbursements:   July 1982 - September 1983

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A SECOND RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
second reconstruction credit to the Republic of Uganda for the equivalent
of SDR 62.9 (US$70) million on standard IDA terms, to help finance the
Government's economic recovery program.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Uganda in August 1981 and its report
(3773-UG) dated 'March 31, 1982 has been distributed to the Executive
Directors.  A summary of social and economic data is given in Annex I.
Background
3.        Uganda achiev(ed independence in 1962 with a number of important
advantages: a favorabla climate (with two rainy seasons in most parts of
the country); fertile soils; a well-established indigenous smallholder sec-
tor producing a widening range of export crops (coffee, cotton, tea, and
tobacco) and an ample domestic food supply; a small industrial sector con-
tributing exports of textiles and copper; a well-developed transport infra-
structure; an exportable surplus of hydroelectricity; and one of the most
advanced education systems in East Africa.  Uganda's complement of skilled
and trained manpower was greater than that of either Kenya or Tanzania.
With those two countries it shared well-developed services: the railways,
ports, an airline, posts and telecommunications. These favorable initial
conditions, combined with competent economic management, resulted in a
steady 2% per year growth in per capita GDP (1963-70), and an average sav-
ings rate of 13%, which in turn permitted a high level of investment with-
out inflationary pressure. A balance of payments current account surplus
was maintained in most years, while central government revenue increased
faster than recurrent expenditure, contributing a significant proportion of
development outlays.
4.        Uganda's political situation was less felicitous.  Long-standing
conflicts between the largest single kingdom (Buganda), the other kingdoms
and the rest of the country continued during the 1960s, and became further
complicated by ideological and social rivalries. This led to increasing
dependence on the military, and in 1971, an army coup brought a military
regime to power.



- 2 -
The Economy Urder the Military Government 1971-79
5.         From 1971 to 1979 (the year when the military government fell),
the economy declined drastically:
•  GDP stagnated and per capita incomes fell.
Domestic savings fell to less than 8% of GDP and foreign economic
assistance effectively ceased. As a result, investment was cur-
tailed. Few development projects were started, plant and
equipment became obsolete, and infrastructure was not
maintained.
• Production of export crops declined to 40% of their 1970 level in
1978, while coffee rose from 54% of merchandise exports in 1970
to over 90%. Despite the accumulation of more than US$90 million
in payment arrears, imports in 1978 were less than half their
1971 level.
Government revenue declined from 14% of GDP in 1971/72 to 9% in
1975/76; expenditure was concentrated on internal affairs, pol-
ice, prisons, defense and finance rather than on the productive
sectors and budget deficits exceeded 60% of recurrent revenue
every year except 1977/78 (the coffee boom year).
Black marketeering and corruption flourished -- to such an extent
that no account of Uganda's economy can avoid the term that des-
cribes it:  "magendo".  This took many forms:  the smuggling and
under-invoicing of exports, over-invoicing of imports, preferen-
tial allocati'on of foreign exchange, resale of imports and domes-
tically-produced goods purchased at official prices, the exploit-
ation of "choke points" in the transport and distribution sys-
tems, bribery and theft.
6.        Only subsistence agriculture continued growing during this period
in response to both food security needs and the curtailment of earning
opportunities in the monetized sectors. The coffee boom in 1977 provided
temporary respite and for a time imports recovered. But, by the time of the
Liberation (April 1979), the combined impact of the previous years' depre-
dations and the damsage and looting during and after the Liberation War it-
self, had reduced the economy of Uganda to ruins. Crops were damaged,
livestock killed, many buildings and factories gutted and portable goods of
all kinds ranging from school books and office records to tools, equipment
and vehicles were stolen (frequently to be smuggled into neighboring coun-
tries).
7.        Several factors contributed to this deterioration:
Many of the country's skilled and trained personnel were either
expelled, left voluntarily or, if they remained in Uganda, were
harassed, imprisoned or killed.



- 3 -
A succession of nationalizations and expropriations, which start-
ed in 1970 but was intensified during the "economic war" in 1972,
resulted in a rapid growth of ill-managed parastatal and private
organizations, without proper legal or financial status.
The administrative system became increasingly geared to fear and
favoritism with many positions filled by political appointees.
Fiscal responsibility was systematically undermined.
*  The steady emergence of a highly over-valued exchange rate coupl-
ed with price control and falling real agricultural producer pri-
ces obliterated the incentive for export cash crops and other
modern sector production, demolished the government revenue base
and encouraged "magendo".
*  In common with other oil-importing countries, Uganda experienced
a sharp loss of export purchasing power at the time of the 1973-
74 oil price shock.
Liberation to Mid 1981
8.        As the Commonwealth team of experts that reviewed the Ugandan
economy in May 1979 observed: "the war simply provided the coup de grace
to this already sinking 'magendo economy"'. L/  Indeed, if it had only been
the damage of war and looting with which the post-1979 government had had
to contend, the task of rehabilitation might not have been so daunting.
However, as the Commonwealth team continued "... the problem is not to make
good the war damage oi the past few months by repair and replacement ...
The really important need is to reform the institutions and policies the
government inherited. More fundamentally still, successful rehabilitation
depends on political leadership to bridge the rifts in Ugandan society --
some longstanding, somne of more recent origin -- and to create law, order
and political stability." Their report consequently recommended a rehabi-
litation program of administrative and policy reform supported by the in-
fusion of foreign exchange to improve the supply of basic consumer goods,
inputs and vehicles and to support rehabilitation of the productive sec-
tors.  The reforms proposed included:  the raising of agricultural producer
prices and the relief of bottlenecks in the transport and marketing sys-
tems;  the strengthening of foreign exchange budgeting and import licens-
ing; a moratorium on parastatal and cooperative indebtedness to enable
banks to advance import credit while this indebtedness was being studied;
and the relaxation of price controls coupled with either devaluation or a
combination of foreign exchange auctions and higher taxes.
9.         No action was taken on any of these proposals, except the raising
of agricultural producer prices, the value of which was soon wiped out by
inflation. This failure to undertake policy and administrative reform,
coupled with continuing political instability, drought, the 1979 oil shock
and world recession 'Led to even more rapid declines in output and incomes
from 1979 to 1981 than had occurred previously. GDP fell by some 11% in
1979 and 8% in 1980. Taking the deteriorating terms of trade into account,

of Uganda, a report by a Commonwealth Team of Experts, June 1979.

per capita income in 1980 was some 27% below its 1978 level. Although
there has probably been some recovery in 1981, especially in the agricul-
tural sector, average incomes are still depressed. Domestic savings have
continued to fall. Despite some increases in external assistance, the
investment ratio has continued falling -- possibly to as little as 3% in
1979 and 1980. Perhaps more seriously, capital productivity is severely
constrained by inadequate maintenance, a drying-up of raw material and
spare parts supplies and the looting of workshops and tools during and
after Liberation.
10.        By 1981, the estimated volume of merchandise imports was 30%
below the 1978 level, nearly 60% below the 1970 level and somewhat less
than one-third of the level the Commonwealth team suggested was required
for recovery. This was despite an increase in official grant and loan dis-
bursements from US$63 million per year in 1977-78 to more than US$200
million per year in 1979-81, an increase in payment arrears of US$140
million during 1979 and 1980 and a US$100 million drawdown of foreign
exchange reserves. (Arrears were reduced, however, by US$90 million during
1981.) The main factor responsible for this was a 55% deterioration in the
terms of trade over the past three years. Export volume fell in 1980 but
recovered in 1981, especially in the latter half of the year; export
prices, however, declined more than one third in 1981. Capital flight,
though unquantifiable, was probably substantial and imports may also have
been underrecorded.
11.        Of the US$400 million of merchandise imports in 1981, about
US$120 million was for petroleum and about US$60 million was imported dir-
ectly by the Government for security and administration. In effect, 82% of
Uganda's merchandise export earnings (US$220 million in 1981) were absorbed
by petroleum and government imports. For most other imports and invisible
payments, including essential consumer goods, drugs and rehabilitation
needs, Uganda depends on official grants and loans, IMF drawings and
commercial credits.  This highlights both the difficulty and the critical
importance of foreign exchange management, in particular the need to
scrutinize carefully the Government's own import requirements. The
Government is taking steps to improve its procedures for foreign exchange
allocation (see paragraphs 55-57 below).
12.        Commitments of external assistance rose from US$113 million in
1978 to an average of US$250 million per year in 1979-81. Some 40% of
these new commitments were in the form of balance of payments support
(Table 1). In addition, much project aid was in the form of raw materials
and transport equipment which would normally have been quick-disbursing.
Disbursements were delayed, however, by security problems, inadequate aid
coordination and utilization procedures and, up to June 1981, the failure
to deal efficiently with pricing and exchange rate distortions.
13.        Uganda's external debt was inadequately monitored and controlled
during the 1970s, and it is therefore difficult to present clear data. The
World Bank's estimates, based on data from the Uganda Treasury and the Bank
of Uganda, show total external debt outstanding of US$970 million at the

end of 1981, of which US$650 million was disbursed.2/ (IBRD's share of
this was 3.8%  while 8.9% was due to IDA.)  Official development loans
account for less than two-thirds of outstanding debt. The balance is from
private sources or Liberation War-related commitments to Tanzania and
Zambia. A large part of the debt is in arrears: some US$84 million of
debt outstanding at the end of 1981 was principal arrears. (Total arrears,
including those on short-term debt and current payments are estimated at
US$144 million at the end of 1981).  The debt service ratio was moderately
hiah for a low-income country, at 17.7% iLn 1980, but this situation has
deteriorated seriously during 1981, since more than one-quarter of debt
outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1.980 fell due during the year. As
a result, the debt service ratio rose to 50% in 1981. Furthermore, more
than one-third of debt outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1981 will
fall due over the next two years. A meeting of the Paris Club in November
1981 agreed to reschedule obligations falling due in 1981/82.3/ These
however only covered about US$12 million, leaving more than US$130 million
of principal repayments still to be paid during 1982. The rest is owed to
non-participants, with whom the Government is endeavoring to arrange
rescheduling on terms comparable to those being concluded with Paris Club
participants.
i4.        Developments from 1978 to 1981 in public finance also reflect the
general decline in the economy as well as weakening financial management.
Declining monetary production, pervasive "magendo" transactions, reduced
levels of foreign trade, declining coffee prices and price controls con-
tributed to a fall in central government current revenue to less than half
the 1977/78 level by 1980/81.  In 1979/80, government revenues were prob-
ably less than 3% of GDP. Government expenditure remained around 5% of
GDP, however, while public administration and defence accounted for more
than half of total government expenditure in 1980/81. Fuelled by these
large central government deficits, financed primarily by the Central Bank,
money supply almost doubled over the two years 1979 and 1980. The
Government's share of domestic credit reached a peak of 83% in May 1981
(51% at the end of 1971). Although no accurate cost-of-living indices are
available for recent years, independent estimates of the general rate of
inflation suggest that it has been averagjing close to 100% per year since
1978.
PART II - GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Government Objectives
15.        The Government's primary goal is to restore law and order, a
basic prerequisite for future economic progress. Second only to this, how-
ever is the goal of rehabilitating the directly productive sectors, without
2/ Including Uganda's share of former EAC debt and principal arrears, but
excluding use of IMIF credit and short-term debt.
3/ Ninety percent to be repayable in 10 years, including 5 years grace,
and 10% repayable over the next four years. The participants also
agreed to reschedule about US$15 million of debt arrears.

which, the Government recognizes, there can be no economic development, nor
expanded social services,, The first step towards rehabilitation was the
introduction of a financial program for 1981/82. The second is a Recovery
Program of priority expenditures and actions, which the Government adopted
in April 1982.
The Financial Program
16.       In early June 1981, the Government introduced a comprehensive
financial program to stabilize the deteriorating economy and revive produc-
tion by restoring confidence in the currency, eliminating price distortions
and improving fiscal and monetary discipline. In particular:
* It "floated" the Uganda shilling, effectively devaluing it
approximately 90% from USh7.8 to around USh80 to the US dollar
(by early 1982, the rate had fallen further to around USh 85);
* It removed administered price controls, except for major export
crops, petroleum products and public utility tariffs. it raised
official producer prices for export crops by between 200% and
400% and retail petroleum prices by 650% to 1,000% during 1981
and, in January 1982, it increased tariffs on electricity, water,
posts and telecommunications;
It reformed tie taxation structure, changing import duties from a
specific to an ad valorem basis and reducing the number of
different rates of duty; merged the Public Sector Investment
Contribution (formerly a separate tax on sales) with sales tax or
import duty; equalized sales tax on imports and domestic
production and raised effective sales and excise taxes on a
number of revenue-producing items, while converting some excise
duties to an ad valorem basis;
It placed ceilings on government borrowing and domestic credit
expansion, whlile increasing interest rates.
The Government also confirmed its intention of encouraging a "mixed eco-
nomy", by allowing former owners to reclaim their property or claim compen-
sation and by inviting private investment in a number of areas. The pro-
gram was supported by a 13-month IMF stand-by arrangement for US$135 mil-
lion and by the releases of US$70 million of the First IDA Reconstruction
Credit, disbursements of which had been limited to US$25 million following
the change of government in May 1980 (see paragraph 41 below). In
addition, a number of bilateral donors announced increased levels of
assistance to Uganda before and during a special meeting of donors in Paris
in November 1981.
17.       The system which is now evolving in the wake of these measures is
more market-oriented than before, but still retains important areas of
government control. Foreign exchange allocation, for example, is handled
administratively and the exchange rate is certainly above market-clearing



- 8 -
levels. The Government has, however, continued adjusting both the exchange
rate and other "strategic" prices since June with the aim, in each case, of
reinforcing producers' incentives while maintaining fiscal equilibrium.
18.        These measures, combined with improvements in security and addi-
tional external resources, have started an economic revival. From June to
December 1981, coffee shipments were 75% higher than the previous year.
Preliminary indications are that the new coffee prices have provoked a sub-
stantial increase in supplies to processors, but that export supply is now
constrained by processing capacity in the cooperatives. More use will have
to be made of private processors (see paragraph 53 below). The increase in
supplies may also result from a movement of producers' stocks rather than
increased production. For industrial products, the removal of price
controls, combined with the tax changes, has diverted previous "magendo"
profits to the Government and to producers. Prices have stabilized since
August. Food prices indeed fell some 25% initially, probably reflecting
better weather, expanded acreage and more secure transport routes.
Petroleum sales have fallen, probably reflecting less smuggling and lower
domestic consumption.  The government deficit is a smaller percentage of
expenditure than in 1980/81, through tighter administrative control,
including stricter monitoring of spending by government ministries and
closer attention to revenue collection, especially the procedures for
collecting coffee export duties. Some private owners had already responded
to the more favorable government policy towards private investment and
returned to Uganda, especially in the crucial sugar and tea industries,
usually on a joint venture basis with the Government.
19.       Wages and salaries have increased since June 1981, but are still
low in real terms. The Government raised the minimum wage more than 100%
in August, but even at its new level, it still only buys the equivalent of
about six kilograms of sugar or three bars of soap per month at prevailing
market prices.  Civil service salaries are so low that, despite subsidized
housing and other benefits, officials are forced to pursue other occupa-
tions. The removal of price controls and privileged access to limited
supplies of goods has probably resulted in hardship for certain groups,
possibly including some poorer ones. While wage and salary restraint are
surely necessary, the success of the program will also depend on its main-
taining a minimum standard of living and adequate work incentives.
20.        The financial program and the new policies introduced since mid-
1981 directly confront the currency over-valuation and domestic price dis-
tortions that caused Uganda's decline during the 1970s. They will help
create the conditions for Uganda to attract some of the skilled and trained
manpower it then lost and to relieve some of the burden on the over-
extended public sector. The measures required considerable courage and
continue to involve substantial political risks. While there are important
areas in which further steps are needed (and which are described below), a
decisive start to recovery has now been made. With the exception of some
export crop prices, which will require adjustment, the major policy changes
needed have been made. Now, the main areas of action are largely institu-
tional and will necessarily take time to implement. Moreover, the Govern-
rnent has responded promptly to the evolving situation by continuing the
process of price adjustment and by initiating a number of institutional
changes in the key areas of foreign exchange management, budgeting and



planning (also described below). The program itself and the Government's
evolving policies echo precisely the emphasis and directions suggested by
the World Bank's report on development in Sub-Saharan Africa. They merit
strong support and encouragement.
The Recovery Program
21.       On April 12, 1982, the Government issued its Recovery Program.
This program, which was prepared with the assistance of a team from the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation, comprises priority
rehabilitation investment and recurrent foreign exchange needs focussed on
those sectors and projects most likely to raise production and improve the
foreign exchange position rapidly during the fiscal years 19382/83 and
1983/84. The total cost of projects to be started over these two years is
expected to be US$557 million (in 1982 prices), of which about US$390
million would be foreign exchange. The sectoral priorities for economic
recovery are described below. The program is based on constrained
assumptions regarding t:he availability of foreign exchange, similar to
those presented below (paragraphs 32-37). Together with the efforts being
undertaken in conjunctlon with the proposed second reconstruction credit to
improve agricultural pricing and marketing (paragraphs 51-53), strengthen
planning and foreign exchange budgeting (paragraphs 54-57) and reform the
parastatal organisations (paragraphs 58-61), the Recovery Program is
expected to serve a nurnber of purposes: it will provide (a) a comprehensive
framework within which all resources, especially foreign exchange, can be
rationally allocated; (b) a basis for the next two government budgets; and
(c) a reference point for aid coordination. The program will constitute
the Government's basic document for the May Consultative Group meeting.
22.       Economic revival will depend on increasing production levels,
especially exports. This entails the highest priority initially being
given to export crop production, to the supporting transport and communica-
tions infrastructure, and to the production of basic consumer goods, build-
ing materials and agricultural requirements by the industrial sector.
Other sectors, especially the social sectors, also require urgent rehabili-
tation. Improvements in medical services, the repair of damaged classrooms
and the rehabilitation of hazardous urban water systems, for example, may
be expected to provide an important, if unquantifiable incentive to
producers. But in the near future, the rehabilitation of these sectors
must be limited to the extent of their potential contribution in the
shorter term to the recovery process.
23.       Agriculture dominates the Ugandan economy, providing livelihood
to 90% of the population and supplying almost all Uganda's exports in
recent years. Ugandan agriculture is largely dependent on small- and
medium-scale peasant farms; no attempt was ever made to encourage expatri-
ate settlements, and even today, large-scale estates are only significant
in tea and sugar production. With its favorable natural conditions, Uganda
produces an overall food surplus in most years, though areas like Karamoja
in the north-east, which are vulnerable to drought and which depended on a
traditional trade of cattle for grain, have suffered serious food shortages
in recent years as a result of low rainfall and security problems.



- 10 -
24        The capacity to produce a food surplus helped free family labor
to grow export <_rops. When the railway to the coast was opened in the
early 1920s, export production, initially cotton, later (in the 1950s)
robusta coffee, grew rapidly. By the end of the 1960s, smallholder tea and
tobacco were also being exported, while domestic production was also being
diversified through the advance of small-scale dairying, modern ranching
and pig farming. The 1970s have seen a substantial decline, especially in
exports, reflecting unremunerative prices and the general deterioration in
capital assets and infrastructure. Coffee exports fell more than 50%;
exports of other crops virtually ceased altogether. Farmers switched to
subsistence production and to supplying the more lucrative domestic food
market. For similar reasons, the tea and sugar estates were unable to
attract labor.
25.       The prospects for export crop recovery are good.  Coffee, cotton,
tea, and tobacco exports could all grow rapidly within the next three years
(although the previous peak levels are not likely to be reached until later
in the 1980s). In addition, food exports to neighboring countries are a
distinct possibility. The revival of cotton and other agricultural
production would also supply some domnestic industrial needs.  The central
constraint to recovery is the incentive system.  Prices for export crops
must be remunerative, the efficiency of the marketing system must be
improved, and payment for crops must be prompt. Closely related to this is
the supply of inputs, implements, spares for processing and transport, and
consumer goods to stimulate the production of surpluses. These will
require more foreign exchange.  Over the lcnger term, agricultural services
including research and extension will require more attention.
26.       The industrial sector accounted for only about 11% of GDP in the
1960s.  However, it supplied the domestic market with basic goods like
edible oil, soap, paper and cement and produced small exportable surpluses
of textiles and copper. By 1980, industrial value-added had fallen to
about one-third of its previous level, or some 5% of GDP. Many industries
have closed down while others are operating at low levels of capacity util-
ization. There has been little new investment over the past decade; in-
deed, in recent years, there is evidence of disinvestment in many areas.
27.       As a result, the structure of industry has changed little over
the last decade. Significant capacity (and hence recovery potential)
exists in the production of basic consumer goods, wood products, building
materials, simple engineering goods, textiles and chemicals. These
industries are characteristically inward-oriented, requiring relatively
little skilled labor (except for machine maintenance) and moderate capital
investment. There are few intermediate and capital goods industries and,
by contrast with many other African countries, virtually no assembly
industries. The main structural change in industry over the past decade
has been the shift of ownership from the private to the public sector.
28.       The industrial sector is an important potential contributor to
Uganda's recovery. Virtually all its products, especially basic consumer
goods and building materials will be in strong demand and in most cases can
be produced more cheaply than imports. Production of these could also
expand quite rapidly. The most obvious and generally binding constraint on



- 11 -
its recovery is foreign exchange:  for raw materials, spare parts and capi-
tal goods to replace outdated and damaged plant. Other constraints are,
however, apparent in several cases: the low level of agricultural produc-
tion, which limits the supply of raw materials, foreign exchange and domes-
tic demand for industrial products; the weakness of infrastructural ser-
vices, especially transport; over-expansion of, and politicai interterence
in the management of the parastatal sector; shortages of qualified managers
and technicians; financial constraints, resulting from ownership uncertain-
ties, financial indiscipline and, more recently, the impact of the June
1981 devaluation on costs. At the same time, there are industrial
enterprises, both private and public, which are adequately managed,
financially viable and capable of significant production increases even in
the short term.
29.       Uganda's transport system, formerly one of Africa's best, deteri-
orated rapidly during the 1970s for the same general reasons outlined ear-
lier: the departure of skilled personnel, political interference, and in-
adequate provision of resources for essential functions like maintenance.
In addition, the breakup of the East African Community (EAC) in 1977 had a
serious effect, especiaLly on Uganda's access to international trade
routes: as a result Uganda lost virtually all railway rolling stock and
aircraft and her part-ownership of railways and port facilities in Kenya
and Tanzania. This both necessitated heavy new investments by Uganda, and
seriously disrupted international traffic movements while increasing their
cost. Transport was moreover the sector possibly most seriously affected
by the Liberation War and the widespread looting which followed. The
vehicle fleet in particular was decimated.
30.       Rehabilitaticn of the transport system is a key requirement for
recovery. Progress since Liberation has, however, been slow and uneven.
High priority has been given to imports of road vehicles and railway rol-
ling stock and locomotives, while available resources have often not been
fully utilized, especially through over-emphasis on lake ferries, long-
haulage trucks (where rail would be cheaper), and larger aircraft for
international routes. Almost all Uganda's external trade passes through
Kenya, so that cooperac:ion between the two countries remains vital for
Uganda. This has improved of late; Kenya has made a loan to Uganda to help
clear goods at Mombasa port, has rented rolling stock to Uganda and has
increased the number of trains available to Uganda to five per week.
31.        A high priority would be to maximize the use of the railway for
international trade, and for some internal routes also. This involves fur-
ther improving the coordination of railway operations with Kenya, reducing
dependence on expensive truck transportation, improving track maintenance
and safety, and repairing locomotives and rolling stock. Road conditions
are, by and large, not a critical constraint, but some high-volume or high-
potential roads, especially those providing access to railheads and main
centers, require rehabilitation and there is a general need for improved
road maintenance. For road transport, including bicycles, which are widely
used for personal and small freight transport, the major need is spare
parts. Finally, better international communications will require improved
standards of navigational, meteorological and safety equipment at Entebbe
international airport. For most of these purposes, tools, equipment, spare
parts, signalling and communications equipment could make a major short-
term impact on remaining transport bottlenecks.

Assistance Needs
32.        If recovery is to continue in 1982, Uganda's merchandise imports
must rise at least one-third over 1981 levels, to about US$540 million in
current prices, with most of the increase in inputs and spare parts for
agriculture, industry and transport, and in basic consumer goods. This is
still less than half the 1971 level in real terms and far below the US$660
million which the Commonwealth team expected Uganda to require in the
second half of 1979 alone, a level well in excess of what could be effec-
tively used now, given the many administrative weaknesses and constraints.
From 1983-85, imports are expected to increase less rapidly, by about 6%
per year, since there appears to be ample scope for reestablishing domestic
supply sources and reducing the import content of production. If these
import levels can be financed and if progress continues on the economic
management and institutional issues discussed earlier, GDP could grow at
6-7% per year on average during 1982-85, with monetary agriculture and
industry as the leading sectors. Balance of payments data and projections
are presented in Table 2; economic performance indicators in Table 3.
33.        The other major claim on available foreign exchange is debt ser-
vice. After allowing for debt relief agreed at the November Paris Club
meeting, principal repayments will total US$135 million in 1982 and USS90
million in 1983.  Invisibles may be expected to be a net drain on foreign
exchange during the 1980s, even if there is some revival in tourism.
Uganda should also provide for a reduction in arrears by about US$40
million in 1982 and US$50 million in 1983 and 1984, and some buildup of
external reserves.  The total financing requirement -- for merchandise
imports, invisibles and reserve accumulation -- is expected to be US$0.8
billion in 1982, rising to US$1.1 billion by 1985.

34.       Exports can be expected to make an important contribution towards
meeting this requirement, depending on how much foreign exchange is
available to help relieve export constraints. For the next two to three
years at least, agricultural exports will be the key to recovery. Provided
prices are remunerative, marketing becomes more efficient and the supply of
agricultural inputs and consumer goods improves, merchandise exports could
grow by about 14% per year on average from 1982-85. Although high rates of
growth in the main agricultural exports (coffee, cotton, tea, and tobacco)
can be expected, coffee will remain dominant for some years. Uganda's
quota under the Int:ernational Coffee Agreement is 156,000 tons in 1981/82,
30% above 1980/81. In addition, the International Coffee Organization will
permit Uganda to carry forward the shortfall in its original 1980/81 quota
of 18,000 tons to 1.981/82. By 1985, however, the quota could become a con-
straint on coffee exports and would either have to be raised, or Uganda
would have to accept the lower prices available on non-quota markets. For
all the main agricultural exports, it will take time to improve marketing
and relieve processing constraints, so that faster export growth cannot be
depended on.  Beyond 1985, the prospects for other exports, including
maize, groundnuts, animal feed, hides and skins, copper, cobalt and cotton
textiles are promising, provided the exchange rate is maintained at an
appropriate level. During the next two years, the groundwork for
production of these exports, notably infrastructural rehabilitation and
preinvestment studies must be laid.
35.       This recovery in export production will itself require more for-
eign exchange, however. And it is clear that even if exports do increase,
they will be far from sufficient to meet the country's foreign exchange
needs. From 1982-84, some US$530-580 million per year over and above
export earnings will be needed. If official grant and loan commitments are
maintained in real terms, and disbursements and debt service follow an
average pattern, t:hese could provide some US$270 million per year on
average. A further US$100 million per year on average (net) could be
available from the IMF up to mid-1984, if Uganda becomes eligible for
further resources under future stand-by arrangements.4/ This leaves about
US$180 million per year over the next three years to be met from new
resources.
36.       Uganda will not be able to finance this gap on non-concessional
terms.  If the amount needed were borrowed at 11.6% for nine years, with
four years of graze (terms far better than those available on the market at
present), Uganda's debt service ratio would increase from 49% in 1982 to
61% in 1985, reac'hing 96% by 1990 (including IMF charges and repurchases).
Some short-term non-concessional borrowing may prove unavoidable, given the
bunching of principal repayments, but care must be taken to ensure that the
resulting debt burden is manageable. Without additional external
financing, virtually no per capita income growth would be possible. Uganda
will therefore need additional financing on concessional terms to achieve
its much-needed recovery. This financing will, moreover, have to be
fast-disbursing, in the form of balance of payments support or projects
which focus on immediate and urgent recurrent import requirements. New
investment for the next three years and possibly longer must be limited to
4/ The IMF expects to enter discussions of a further stand-by arrangement
for 1982-83 be!fore the beginning of the next fiscal year.



- 16 -
urgent rehabilitation needs. Given UJganda's comparatively low levels of
per capita income and savings, local cost financing should also be
considered.
37.       Finally, the importance of reviving the export sector and focus-
sing incremental foreign exchange supplies on its needs cannot be over-
stated. If export volumes grow at 4% per year (instead of 14%), the fin-
ancing gap would widen by about US$85 million per year through 1985.
PART III - BANK GROUP OPERATIONiS
38.       Bank Group operations in Uganda began with an IBRD loan of US$8.4
million for hydroelectric power development in 1961. Between 1967 and
1971, Uganda received seven IDA credits totalling US$48.0 million for pro-
jects in education, roads and agriculture (tea, tobacco and beef ranch-
ing). In addition, Uganda has benefitted from 10 loans totalling US$244.8
million for the development of the common services and the East African
Development Bank operated jointly by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda through
their association in the former East African Community (EAC). Annex II
contains summary statements and notes on the execution of ongoing pro-
jects. IFC's first investment in Uganda, in a textile company, was sold to
the Government in 1970. The second, to help finance two lodges in the
national parks was cancelled before construction began. IFC is actively
considering the role it can now play in rehabilitation as well as in
longer-term development.
39.       There was a hiatus in Bank Group operations in Uganda from 1971
until February 1980, when a Reconstruction Credit of US$72.5 million (in-
cluding a participation of US$17.5 mi:Llion by the Kingdom of the Nether-
lands) and an EEC Special Action Credit of US$20.0 million equivalent were
approved (Credit Nos. 983/983-1-UG and 54-UG). The Association is also
acting as administrator of a Can$3.0 million grant from the Government of
Canada and of a US$5.0 million program loan for reconstruction from the
OPEC Fund. In addition, the Bank Group has provided credits totalling
US$21.0 million (through a Technical Assistance Credit No. 1077-UG, a Water
Supply Engineering Credit, No. 1110-UG, and a Phosphate Engineering Credit,
No. 1228-UG, (approved on April 13, 1982 and still to be signed) to finance
studies needed to begin building a project pipeline. The Bank Group also
administers an IFAD-financed Agricultural Rehabilitation Program of US$20.0
million equivalent focussed on the food crop sector. Possible future Bank
assistance to Uganda is discussed in paragraph 48 below.
40.       Developments affecting the East African Community (EAC) were out-
lined to the Executive Directors in a memorandum, dated December 29, 1977,
(R77-312) and in a statement made on May 6, 1980 (SecM80-364). One of the
positive results of the ongoing mediation effort has been the Partner
States' decision, taken upon the mediator's recommendation, that the East
African Development Bank (EADB) -- one of the former Community's institu-
tions -- should continue, and a revised charter to this effect has been
enacted. The three governments also commented on the mediator's proposals
for allocation of EAC's other assets and liabilities; and the presidents of
the three Partner States, during their meeting in Nairobi in July 1981,



- 17 -
decided to commence negotiations based on the mediator's proposals.
Negotiations started December 14, 1981 in Arusha and continued in April in
Jinja.
The First Reconstruction Credit
41.       This Credit was approved by the Executive Directors in February
1980 and became effective in May 1980. However, following the change of
government in May 1980, the Bank Group and the Government agreed that dis-
bursements should be temporarily limited to US$25 million equivalent cover-
ing a specific list of items, including packing materials and agricultural
tools for coffee and tea, educational materials, and telecommunications
equipment. Disbursements continued to be slow, reaching only US$2.5
million by May 31, 1981. The Credit was tranched: the second tranche was
to be disbursed upon finding that satisfactory progress was being made in
carrying out needed policy reforms. Accordingly, in June 1981, after the
Government adopted its financial program (see paragraph 16), the Bank Group
made the balance of the Credit available. Subsequently, disbursements
accelerated; by end April 1982, US$37 million had been disbursed and
letters of credit opened for an additional US$47 million. Of the US$11
million remaining after exchange adjustments, all had been allocated by the
Government to prospective end-users. The Government will therefore need
further commitment autlhority if the support provided by the first Credit is
to be sustained.
42.       Of the US$100.0 million equivalent available under the IDA
Credit, the Canadian grant, the EEC Special Action Credit and an OPEC Fund
loan, US$10.5 million was applied to reimbursements of miscellaneous items
imported before June 1981. The remainder has been allocated to end-users
by an inter-ministerial committee following such criteria as the
beneficiary's foreign exchange earnings or savings potential, its
contribution to GDP and its impact on government revenue. Most of what
remained has been allocated to industries (US$77.0 million), while US$12.5
million went to ministries.
43.       There are areas where the Credit is already having a discernible
impact. Textile production in at least two factories has either started or
increased following the supply of spare parts, looms and sewing machines;
some 3,500 hectares of tea under the Uganda Tea Authority (UTA) have been
reclaimed following the arrival of packing materials and pruning knives;
some tea factories and a sugar estate have been recommissioned with machin-
ery and spares supplied under the Credit; and the supply of gunny bags to
primary cooperatives has enabled them to move coffee to Coffee Marketing
Board stores. In some cases, the amounts allocated were too small to pro-
vide all the inputs needed to increase production. Under the proposed
second reconstruction credit, stricter allocation criteria would be applied
(see paragraph 63).
44.       Apart from deliberate decisions taken to stop or delay disburse-
ment in 1980, disbursements have been slow for three main reasons. First,
the procedure described above for prior allocation of the credit proceeds
took time to establish and operate. To avoid delays under the second re-
construction credit, an understanding was reached at negotiations on the
allocation of credit proceeds. Secondly, Ugandan officials were not



- 18 -
familiar with tendering procedures generally and Bank Group procurement
procedures ir , rticular.  Many parastatals preferred to procure from
traditional suppliers. In practice, nearly all procurement, including
parastatal and private companies, was handled by the Central Tender Board
(CTB) whose publication, notification, advertisement and bid evaluation
procedures have contributed to delays. Foreign suppliers appear to have
been unwilling to quote c.i.f. Kampala because of the difficulty in
transporting goods to Uganda. Nearly all contracts under the First
Reconstruction Credit were below the US$2.0 million threshold for
international competitive bidding (ICB). In some cases, Uganda might have
benefitted from full ICB, bringing in a wider range of suppliers. The lack
of bid and performance bonds and guarantees has allowed suppliers to revise
quotations after tender award, with the result that procurement was delayed
or complicated. Tendering procedures have now become more familiar and are
causing fewer delays. The remaining problems are being dealt with either
through technical assistance or under procurement arrangements for the
second reconstruction credit (see paragraph 70).
45.       The third reason for slow disbursements has been the June 1981
devaluation, which necessitated renegotiation of several tenders and caused
some companies to face difficulties in raising local cover, since their
assets were undervalued in relation to their borrowing needs. Furthermore,
some of the parastatals which had been allocated portions of the credit
were not creditworthy. As a result, the counterpart account required under
the credit has not been adequately funded. By March 10, 1982 only US$18.5
million equivalent had been deposited with the counterpart account at the
Bank of Uganda, compared with disbursements of about US$35 million. In
part, this reflects delays in the notification of disbursement details, but
it also reflects difficulties in raising the local counterpart from
beneficiaries of the Credit. A procedure has now been agreed between the
Government and the IMF whereby the local cover required by the commercial
banks to open letters of credit is deposited in suspense accounts and paid
over to the Bank of Uganda for credit to the counterpart account when
disbursement details become available.
PART IV - THE SECOND RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
Background
46.       After adopting the new financial program in June 1981, with sup-
port from the IMF standby facility and the release of the remaining portion
of the First Reconstruction Credit, the Government requested further non-
project assistance. This request was appraised in conjunction with the
economic mission in August 1981. A post-appraisal mission visited Uganda
in January 1982. Negotiations were held in Washington in April 1982, with
a Government delegation led by Mr. E. R. Kamuntu, Ambassador in the Office
of the President. There is no separate staff appraisal report for this
credit. A credit and project summary is at the front of this report and
supplemental data are contained in Annex III.
47.       The Bank Group's assistance to Uganda is expected to respond to
the needs identified in Part II, i.e.: (a) financing of current import
needs to revive the weak economy, (b) technical assistance to strengthen
key institutions, (c) the preparation of detailed rehabilitation programs



- 19 -
for the key sectors and (d) the mobilization and coordination of aid.  In
addition to the support already provided (see paragraph 39 above), a number
of operations and other activities are planned in these areas.  Following
the introduction of the financial program in June 1981 and the economic
mission in August, the Bank Group, in collaboration with the IMF, the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation, UNDP and other donors is
providing increasing amounts of technical assistance to Uganda in
development policy and planning. The Bank Group is administering a
UNDP-financed Planning Assistance Project and is developing a program of
economic and sector work which emphasizes policy and planning questions.
On aid coordination, the Bank Group reconvened the Consultative Group for
Uganda in November 1979, participated in a meeting of donors in Paris in
November 1981 following the Paris Club meeting and will convene a further
meeting of the Consultative Group on May 18 and 19, 1982.
48.       The Bank Group is preparing an agricultural rehabilitation
program in collaboration with other donors which will focus on the policy
and institutional framework for the major export crops, as well as on
sectoral financing requiLrements. This program could form the basis for an
agricultural operation during the next fiscal year. An industrial
rehabilitation project of US$35 million is being proposed to the Executive
Directors at this time to provide capital investment, spare parts and raw
materials to rehabilitate selected industries. Rehabilitation projects are
under preparation in roads (emphasizing maintenance facilities) and
education (with emphasis on non-salary recurrent needs like textbooks),
while identification of rehabilitation needs in telecommunications and
railways is expected in the coming months.
Objectives and Description
49.       Despite the passage of almost three years since the fall of the
military government, the Ugandan economy and administration remain weak and
an exceptional need for current import financing remains. The proposed
second reconstruction credit would therefore support the Government's
Recovery Program, in particular by:
(a) Increasing agricultural exports and domestic production in high
priority areas; and
(b)  Strengthening the Government's capacity to formulate and imple-
ment policies and programs in those areas which are critical for
Uganda's economic recovery.  These areas are (i) the pricing and
marketing of export crops; (ii) administration, planning and
foreign exchange allocation; (iii) the parastatal organizations;
and (iv) external debt management. The agreed actions are
described in a Memorandum of Understanding (Annex V). A summary
of actions already taken and to be taken under the program is
shown in Table 4.
50.       The proposed credit would finance the importation of agricultural
inputs, spare parts and raw materials for industry and transport and other
largely non-capital ne!eds of high economic priority during the fiscal year
1982/83.  It would cover about 12% of the imports needed and about 40% of

the financing gap in that year (paragraphs 32-37), leaving the rest to be
covered by rescheduling debt held by non-participants in the Paris Club and
by additional balance of payments support from other possible donors.  The
Bank Group is helping Uganda raise these resources by convening a
Consultative Group meeting in May 1982. The proposed industrial rehabili-
tation project would be complementary to this credit: while this credit
would enable selected industries to increase capacity utilization, the
proposed industrial rehabilitation project would also provide capital
equipment to replace or rehabilitate plant and machinery, including
balancing investment.
Pricing and Marketing of Export Crops
51.       After the latest producer price increases for export crops (in
October 1981), farmers face positive returns in all cases except tea.
Price differentials with neighboring countries have narrowed and reduced
the incentive for smuggling. The returns from growing food crops are still
substantially higher, however, and without further adjustments, farmers may
not reinvest in export production. With the exception of cotton, the far-
mers' share in export earnings is 50% or less, so that scope already exists
for increasing farmers' prices at existing world prices with the present
exchange rate. The balance of the export price is absorbed by excessive
processing and marketing margins. In the case of coffee, export taxes
could provide as much as 45% of government revenue this year, and hence
limit the extent to which coffee producers can be paid more in the short
term.
52.       While scope exists for increasing the coffee producer price
further, the principal constraint in the short term is on cooperative
processing capacity, since the last price increase coupled with transport
improvements has provoked a build-up in supplies at processing plants.
This constraint is being addressed by an increased supply of spares to
processors under an EEC-financed project in the coffee sector. But there
are also disincentives to private sector processing and marketing of coffee
and other export crops, including difficulties in gaining access to foreign
exchange and credit on an equal footing with cooperatives and parastatals.
In the case of tea, the proposed second reconstruction credit would help
improve green leaf transport and factory capacity for the smallholder
crop. Then the main remaining constraint to increasing producer prices
would be their effect on the finances of the Uganda Tea Growers Corporation
(UTGC). This, however, is primarily a short-term difficulty, since an
increase in tea production would reduce UTGC's unit overheads and improve-
ment in tea quality would increase its returns. In the case of tobacco,
there is a flourishing informal market offering prices two-thirds higher
than the official price. An increase in the official price would therefore
bring tobacco sales back into official channels. The Government will
review export crop producer prices, especially for tea and tobacco, in the
context of the financial program and budget for the 1982/83 fiscal year.
53.       The effect of price increases on export supply will be enhanced
by improvements in the marketing of crops and the supply of inputs,
consumer goods and other items needed by farmers. The efficiency of
present arrangements is limited by the disincentives to private processing
and marketing referred to above as well as by the export monopoly positions



- 24 -
enjoyed by CMB (coffee), UTA (tea), LMB (cotton) and NTC (tobacco). Many
cooperatives are de facto monopsonies in certain areas or for certain
crops. The Government wishes to liberalize agricultural marketing and
plans to study the removal of statutory monopolies and alternative ways of
improving the organization and regulation of export crop marketing. The
Bank Group expects to assist in this review during preparation of the
agricultural rehabilitation program (paragraph 48). Part of the
Government's difficulty in taking early action in this area is attributable
to a lack of adequate information and analysis of these questions, as well
as poor coordination among the ministries responsible for the sector. The
Government will therefore establish a unit to analyze domestic and
international costs, prices and supply trends of the major agricultural
export crops and to make recommendations on agricultural producer prices.
It will also consult the Association on the terms of reference and staffing
required for this unit as a condition for clisbursing a second tranche of
US$30 million of the proposed credit. (Schedule 4.1 to the Development
Credit Agreement and Annex V).
Administration, Planning and Foreign Exchange Allocation
54.        Public administration, especially government budgeting, tax col-
lection, expenditure control, aid coordination, planning, and data collec-
tion, has suffered seriously from both the loss of personnel and the under-
mining of professional and moral standards during the 1970s. Rebuilding
Uganda's civil service to its former high standards is a long-term and
multi-faceted endeavor, a start to which has been made by recruiting
technical assistance in a number of key areas -- notably IMF assistance to
the Bank of Uganda and the Ministry of Finance, World Bank-executed,
UNDP-financed assistance to the Ministry of Planning and Economic
Development, and EEC and bilateral donor assistance to sector ministries
and parastatals. In due course, improved accountability will be needed to
reinforce these efforts.
55.        Given the critical foreign exchange situation, the paramount need
in the short term is to ensure that foreign exchange is rationally
allocated. In particular, this means allocating increasing shares of the
limited foreign exchange available to essential consumer items and to the
needs of the directly productive sectors. Efforts have already been made
to improve the foreign exchange allocation system. Since November 1981,
the Government has, with technical assistance from the IMF, introduced
procedures for monitoring foreign exchange receipts from exports and cash
assistance. A detailed allocation of expected receipts for the forthcoming
three months is proposed to the President's Economic Advisory Committee
(PEAC), by the Bank of Uganda. In practice (see paragraph 11 above), oil
imports, debt service, defense and administrative needs absorb nearly all
"free" foreign exchange.   At the same time, the Government, with IMF
assistance, is scrutinizing its own export and payment procedures more
closely, to ensure that all foreign exchange earnings due are surrendered,
and is now centralizing all external payments proposed by ministries with
the Ministry of Finance, which mrust approve the release of funds.
56.        A somewhat separate approach has been taken to the allocation of
foreign exchange in the context of longer term planning. This area has
traditionally been the responsibility of the Ministry of Planning and Eco-
nomic Development (MPED) under the general direction and coordination of
the NIational Planning Commission, a legally--established entity consisting



- 25 -
of ministers holding economic and social portfolios.  The Commission, how-
ever, has not been operating since June 1981. Instead, the Government has
established an External Resources Mobilization Committee consisting of min-
isters and senior officials from MPED, the Ministry of Finance, key sector
ministries, and the Bank of Uganda through which coordination of planning,
finance, and aid mobilization are being carried out. The main reason for
the earlier failure to address longer-term planning issues has been the
weakness of MPED itself. This is now improving as the result of some
senior appointments in that ministry and the UNDP planning assistance pro-
ject. The Ministry of Finance also needs strengthening in almost all areas
of operation. Its technical assistance needs have been identified by the
Government and presented to various donors, but there are practical
constraints in the way of mobilizing potential assistance, among them
housing and transportation. The Government would therefore prepare and
consult the Association on a program to strengthen the administrative,
managerial and planning capacities of these two ministries, including steps
to obtain priority teclnical assistance, as a condition of disbursing the
second tranche of the Credit. (Schedule 4.2 to the Development Credit
Agreement).
57.       Despite the improvements in the short-term monitoring of foreign
exchange receipts and expenditures, and in the coordination machinery for
external assistance, both the planning of foreign exchange allocation and
its execution require further improvement. First, inadequate attention has
been given to the recurrent import needs of the productive sectors.
Secondly, such planning as has been done has been unrealistic about the
amounts of foreign exchange likely to be available in practice and hence
little guide to detailed allocation. Thirdly, the technical capacity to
evaluate import requests and relate them to the broad priorities has been
lacking. The preparation of the Recovery Program has gone a long way to
help rectify these problems. Recurrent import requirements have been
included in the program ard their priority assessed. The program is based
on cautious assumptions regarding foreign exchange availability and the
proposals it includes have received adequate technical appraisal. The
Government has described the use it expects to make of the Recovery Program
in the Memorandum of Understanding for this Credit (Annex V) in the
following ways:
(a) as a reference point for the coordination of external assistance,
starting with the May 1982 Consultative Group meeting;
(b) for budget preparation, especially for the development
budget; and
(c) as its foreign exchange budget for 1982/83 and a guideline for
the 1983/84 foreign exchange budget. The Government would
periodically exchange views with the Association on the operation
of its foreign exchange budgets and on future budget guidelines
during the Recovery Program, (Section 4.03 of the Development
Credit Agreement). Furthermore, the Government would apply
strict criteria to the allocation of foreign exchange inder the
proposed second reconstruction credit (see paragraph 63 below).



- 26 -
Monitoring and adjusting the program will be the task of the MPED, which
will carry this out on a six-monthly basis; the first review will be
carried out by December 31, 1982.
The Parastatal Organizations
58.       The Government is introducing liegislation to return some of the
businesses, presently under parastatal organizations, to the private
sector. Meanwhile, many parastatals which are likely to remain in the
public sector suffer from acute operational and financial difficulties.
The first priority is to update parastata:L accounts so that a basis for
deciding policy on individual cases can be made.  For the agricultural
parastatals, which are almost exclusively engaged in marketing, the main
concern is their cost and efficiency. The technical staff of the Uganda
Development Corporation (UDC), the main holding company for industrial
parastatals, has proposed a reorganization, on which the Government expects
to decide by December 31, 1982, under which some of the subsidiaries it
lost in 1972 would be returned. For these, new financial structures must
be decided.  The public utilities face serious financial problems which
will require both tariff adjustments, improved administrative procedures,
and possibly government cash injections to achieve viability. Finally, the
Economic Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, which coordinates
parastatal operations and policies, monitors their budgetary and financial
impact, and ensures consistency and feasibility of their objectives, needs
to be strengthened. The first step in this direction will be taken by the
IMF's fiscal adviser, whose report will examine some of these issues in the
context of expenditure control. The Government's program to obtain
technical assistance for the Ministry of Finance and MPED would include
this area (see paragraph 56).
59.       The Government has requested Bank Group assistance in approaching
the accounting, auditing and policy questions outlined above. As a first
step, the Bank Group has completed, in April 1982, a preliminary
examination of 11 key parastatal organizations to determine the nature and
extent of accounting assistance required. These organizations have been
selected according to their importance in earning or saving foreign
exchange and their actual or potential budgetary cost to the Government
(having regard to guarantees given on their behalf to commercial banks).
They are:
(a)  Agriculture:        Coffee Marketing Board
Lint Marketing Board
Uganda Tea Authority
Uganda Tea Growers Corporation
(b)  Public utilities:  Uganda Electricity Board
Uganda Posts and Telecommunications
Uganda Railways Corporation
Uganda Airlines
(c)  Industry:           Uganda Development Corporation and its sub-
sidiaries as reorganized
(d)  Commerce:           Transocean
National Insurance Corporation



- 27 -
60.       The second step would be the appointment of consultants to
produce statements of aifairs, audits and financial analysis, as
appropriate, for these and eventually all the remaining parastatals,
according to a timetable agreed with the Government. The Government would
consult the Association on the terms of reference and timetable for
completion of this exercise before June 30, 1982, (Section 4.04 of the
Development Credit Agreement and Annex V), and expects to finance the
consultants required under the Technical Assistance Credit (No. 1077-UG).
61.       In the meantimle, the Government has required all parastatals
requesting transfers from the Government budget, or Government guarantees
for commercial bank loans, to submit income and expenditure statements and
unaudited balance sheets for the period July-December 31, 1981, by April 1,
1982, if the requests are to be included in the 1982/83 budget. In cases
where the Government dezides to guarantee a loan, that guarantee will not
exceed 75% of the total loan amount. In addition, one of the criteria for
allocating the proceeds of the second reconstruction credit is that the
entity concerned should be creditworthy (paragraph 63).
External Debt Management
62.       Attention has already been drawn to the poor management and
recording of Uganda's external debt in the past (paragraph 13). The
Government is carrying out a comprehensive verification of its external
debt, employing the services of the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell and
accountants Peat, Marwick, Mitchell. Technical assistance from the IMF is
helping to improve the monitoring and repayment of existing obligations.
In addition, the Government plans to strengthen the unit in the Ministry of
Finance responsible for processing and approving external debt transactions
and for determining future policy on external borrowing. The Government
will prepare and consult with the Association on a program to strengthen
its external debt monit:oring and management, as a condition of disbursing
the second tranche of the proposed credit (Schedule 4.3 to the Development
Credit Agreement and ArLnex V).
Administration and Allocation of the Second Reconstruction Credit
Foreign Exchange
63.       Priority end--users of foreign exchange have been identified by a
sub-committee of the External Resources Mobilization Committee (see para-
graph 59) on the basis of submissions by sectoral ministries, vetted by
MPED. In principle, the criterion to be used is the economic rate of
return. In present circumstances in Uganda, this is best approximated by
the following criteria, which the Government will apply to the allocation
of credit proceeds (Section 3.01(b)(iv) of the Development Credit Agreement
and Annex V):
(a) That the imports concerned would maximize net foreign exchange
earnings or savings in the near future;
(b) For imports that would contribute to domestic consumption
(principally industrial products), priority would be given to
basic consumer and incentive goods, building materials and
agricultural inputs, but only if a clear foreign exchange saving
can be demonstrated;



- 28 -
(c) Imports for infrastructural purposes, particularly transport
would go to relief of critical bottlenecks which prevent earning
or saving foreign exchange at minimum cost; and
(d)  That the agency or company undertaking the expenditure is finan-
cially viable and managerially sound.
In addition, the Government would provide for the future recurrent foreign
exchange needs of projects supported by the proposed second reconstruction
credit in its foreign exchange budget (Annex V). These criteria are
consistent with those to be applied by the Uganda Development Bank (UDB)
and the Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB) in the selection of sub-borrowers
under the proposed industrial rehabilitation project. The industrial
rehabilitation project would, however, apply more stringent economic rate
of return criteria to justify the investment proposed for each sub-project.
64.       In accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph 63 above,
credit proceeds have been allocated to the following end-users:
Agriculture and Livestock (including inputs for industries
producing agricultural materials, raw materials and inputs for
livestock and fisheries);
Manufacturing Industry (including raw materials and inputs for
construction, building materials, consumer goods and intermediate
products);
Transport (including spare parts, tires for vehicles, etc.);
Service contracts for forwarding, transportation, etc., of goods
procured under the proposed credit and invoiced c.i.f. Mombasa;
Other (including power, water, chemicals, educational materials,
telecommunications and broadcasting).
At negotiations of the proposed credit, an understanding was reached on the
allocation of the proposed credit among these categories. In addition,
credit proceeds would not be allocated to imports indicated in Annex IV
(Schedule 1.1 to the Development Credit Agreement).
65.       The proposed credit would be disbursed in two tranches.  A first
tranche of US$40 million would be available after the credit is declared
effective. On or before September 30, 1982, the Association would review
the progress of the proposed program and determine, in particular, whether
the conditions for disbursing a second tramche of US$30 million had been
met, (Section 4.02 of the Development Credit Agreement) namely:
(a) that the Government would establish the unit (described in
paragraph 53) for agricultural producer price analysis and
recommendations and consult the Association on its terms of
reference and staffing;



- 29 -
(b) that the Government had prepared and consulted with the
Association on. a program to strengthen the Ministry of Finance
and MPED (paragraph 56);
(c)  that a program to strengthen the monitoring and management of
external debt had been prepared and the Association consulted
with concerning it (paragraph 62).
Relationship of the Proposed Program to the IMF Stand-by Credit
66.       Progress under the IMF stand-by credit has been satisfactory.
The performance criteria were observed in September 1981, while the
increase in total net domestic credit and net credit to the Government was
below the amount allowed for in understandings negotiated in November
1981. The reductions in external arrears in September and December 1981
exceeded those agreed with the Fund.
67.       Preparation of the proposed program has been closely coordinated
with the assistance of the IMF and other agencies. An IMF mission reviewed
the stand-by facility at the same time as this program was post-appraised.
In particular, the efforts to improve foreign exchange allocation, tax
administration and expenditure controls, to develop a strategy for para-
statal reform and to determine appropriate short- and long-term agricul-
tural pricing and marketing policies have been the subject of complementary
approaches. The proposed second reconstruction program and the IMF
stand-by credit have been coordinated specifically in the following ways:
(a) Foreign exchange allocation
The IMF and the Government have agreed on measures to accelerate
the surrender of export proceeds, reconcile the recorded value of
export shipments with the proceeds surrendered to the Bank of
Uganda and improve the operation of the foreign exchange
allocation maLchinery. The proposed program would put this in a
longer-term framework, including aid receipts, and encourage the
allocation of foreign exchange to specific high priority
purposes.
(b) Public finance
The IMF and the Government have, in addition to taxation measures
and borrowing ceilings, agreed on measures aimed at improving the
monitoring and control of government expenditures and tax
revenues, including the reduction of monthly cash allocations for
recurrent expenditure and more timely collection of coffee export
revenues.  The proposed program would support the closer
coordination of the economic recovery program with development
budget preparation and help identify assistance in the Ministry
of Finance and MPED.
(c) Parastatal organizations
The IMF and the Government have agreed on a short-term program
for bringing parastatal requests for budgetary support under



- 30 -
tighier control (paragraph 61 above).  The proposed program would
support a clear plan of action for rehabilitation of the
parastatal sector over the longer term.
(d) Agricultural pricing and marketing
The IMF has endorsed successive adjustments in agricultural pro-
ducer prices. The proposed program would support agreed
principles for agricultural pricing and marketing, and strengthen
the capacity for putting them into practice.
(e) External Debt
The IMF program stipulated amounts by which debt arrears should
be reduced and established limits on external borrowing. The
proposed program would strengthen the machinery for external debt
management.
Counterpart Funds
68.       Local currency counterpart funds generated by the sale of foreign
exchange provided by the proposed second reconstruction credit would be
allocated to a special government account at the Bank of Uganda set up for
this purpose. The Bank of Uganda would credit the account with the
domestic counterpart funds as soon as the beneficiaries have been
identified. The Government would allocate the counterpart funds to the
recurrent or capital costs of projects in the Recovery Program (Section
3.02 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Accounts, Audit and Evaluation
69.       As under the First Reconstruction Credit, the accounts for the
proposed project would be audited by auditors acceptable to the Association
and certified copies of the relevant financial statements would be submit-
ted to the Association. (Section 4.06 of the Development Credit Agree-
ment). The Bank of Uganda would maintain records adequate to record and
monitor project implementation.  The MPED would monitor the use and
economic effects of the credit proceeds. In addition, not later than six
months after completion of the proposed program, the Government shall
prepare and furnish to the Association a completion report on the costs and
benefits resulting from the proposed project (Section 3.05 of the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
70.       Procurement for transactions expected to exceed US$1 million
would be done by International Competitive Bidding (ICB). In the First
Reconstruction Credit the ICB ceiling was US$2 million; this has been
lowered here to encourage more use of ICB. Procurement for transactions
less than US$1 million and more than US$20,000 would be accomplished on the
basis of the Central Tender Board's normal competitive bidding procedures
which have been reviewed in detail by the Association. This review sugges-
ted several procurement practices and procedures which can be improved. To



- 31 -
help implement these improvements like use of bid and performance securi-
ties, more adequate notification and advertisement and improved evaluation
procedures, the Government would arrange for technical assistance satis-
factory to the Association (Section 3.03 of the Development Credit Agree-
ment). Procurement below US$20,000 would be accomplished by the organiza-
tions which have access to the credit funds using competitive procedures
subject to review by the Uganda Advisory Board of Trade (UABT).
71.       Disbursements under the proposed credit would be made for the
foreign cost of eligible imports against full documentation, including
invoices paid by the Bank of Uganda or the relevant commercial bank under
existing regulations controlling the allocation of foreign exchange. The
Bank of Uganda would. be responsible for collection of the necessary docu-
mentation, the preparation and submission of withdrawal applications, and
maintenance of the full accounts and documentation evidencing the final
payments. Up to US$7.0 million of the credit would be made available to
finance retroactively items for which the Government had either provided
foreign exchange financing or had made financial commitments after April 1,
1982 (Schedule l(d) of the Development Credit Agreement). Eligible
invoices would have a minimum value of US$10,000 (Schedule l(g) of the
Development Credit Agreement). No reimbursements would be provided against
imports for which other financing has been secured.
Benefits and Risks
72.       The principal benefits expected from the proposed credit are that
credit resources would permit the importation of essential raw materials,
intermediate goods, and spare parts to finance the Government's Recovery
Program. The proposed credit would finance approximately 12% of the total
import requirements for 1982/83. In the case of inputs for the agricul-
tural and transport sectors, the proposed credit would contribute directly
to increased exports and hence improve the prospects of sustaining
recovery. Other imports would contribute to increasing domestic output,
especially of those basic goods most likely to improve producers' incen-
tives. If further financing can be secured, the result could be a turn-
around in Uganda's economic performance from falling GDP during 1979-81 to
6-7% growth over the period 1982-85. In conjunction with the Government's
financial program and possible further support from the IMF, the proposed
credit would support and strengthen the process of policy and institutional
reform in Uganda and lay the groundwork for longer-term growth and develop-
ment.



- 32 -
73.       The principal risks facing the proposed credit are that security
conditions in Uganda could again deteriorate, that Government would be
unable to implement its recovery program, and that shortfalls in financing
could further reduce import levels and delay recovery. These risks have,
however, been significantly reduced by the Government's clear commitment to
improving law and order and to its financial program and by its willingness
to respond positively to the concerns of the principal donors. The Bank
Group intends to assist the Government in addressing the problem of foreign
exchange shortfalls in the context of the forthcoming Consultative Group
meeting.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMlENTS AND AUTHORITY
74.       The Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Uganda
and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
75.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III to this report.
76.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
77.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

D. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF MARCH 31, 1982
There are currently four projects under execution:
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 258-UG - Second Educat-ion Project: US$7.3 million
Credit of June 23, 1971; Effective Date: October 26, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Delays in project implementation persisted due to, inter alia,
transportation difficulties and shortages of local construction materials.
Overall completion is about 80%. Since the remaining balance under the
credit is expected to be disbursed shortly, the project's closing date has
not been postponed.  Tork financed under the First Reconstruction Credit
(US$2.5 million), involving replacement of looted or destroyed materials
and equipment are expected to complement the project. When completed and
facilities provided under the project are in full operation, the
educational objectives of the project are expected to be realized.
RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
Credit No. 983-UG - Reconstruction Credit I: US$72.5 million
Credit of April 2, 1980; Effective Date: May 1, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Along with the IDA credit, which includes US$17.5 million
participation from the Government of the Netherlands, a US$20.0 million EEC
Special Action Credit, a Canadian Grant of Can$3.0 million and a grant of
US$5.0 million from the OPEC Fund have been made available to the
Government in support of its reconstruction program. The IDA credit was to
be released in two tranches. Changes in the Government and delays in
carrying out agreed financial and economic policy reforms caused delays in
the use of the credit. The closing date was therefore postponed by 18
months to June 30, 1982 to allow for full disbursement of the proceeds of
the credits and the grants. In June 1981, after the Government adopted
policy measures the Association required, it was agreed that the total
amount of the credit would be released. In the meantime about US$37.0
million have been disbursed and about anadditional US$47.0 million
committed. It is expected that disbursements will speed up in the next
months.

Credit No. 1077-UG - Technical Assistance Project: US$8.0
million Credit of January 21, 1981; Effective Date: March 26,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
Some progress has been achieved in implementing this line of
credit; the first subprojects have been approved and disbursements have
commenced. 11owever, implementation is still slow due to continued
technical and administrative problems within MPED.
Credit No. llOL-UG - Water Supply Engineering Project: US$9.0
million Credit of May 7, 1981; Effective Date: October 5, 1981;
Closing Date: January 31, 1985
Draft feasibility studies on expansion of water supply and
sanitation activities have been completed for four towns; the remainder are
expected to be ready in mid-April 1982. The contract for employment of
management consultants to prepare the manpower and training study was
signed in November 1981 and completion of the report is expected in May
1982. New tenders for the supply of vehicles will be invited because the
validity of all old bids had expired; the Bank is reviewing the amended
draft tender documents. The tender for water meters was advertised
internationally and bidding documents have been supplied to bidders. The
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been established and is adequately
staffed.
E. EAST AFRICAN COMMUNITY PROJECTS INVOLVING UGANDA
In addition to the projects described above, Uganda also benefits
from lending to the East African Community. Following the disintegration
of the East African Community, the allocation among the Partner States 1
of undisbursed balance of loans to the East African Community Corporations
at October 1, 1977 was approved by the Executive Directors on January 12,
1978 on the basis of recommendations made in a report dated December 29,
1977 (R77-312).  Agreements in line with those recommendations were
subsequently signed by each of the Partner States on January 25, 1978. A
portion of the undisbursed balances under two loans (Loan 674-EA - East
African Railways Corporation (now fully disbursed), and Loan 914-EA - East
African Posts and Telecommunications Corporation) was allocated to Uganda.
Industrial projects in Uganda are also eligible for financing under the
ongoing East African Development Bank Project (Loan 1204-EA). Progress on
implementation of these projects is summarized below. Although the closing
date for Loan 914-EA has expired, since the amount allocated to and
guaranteed by each Partner State is clearly defined under the terms of the
agreement of January 25, 1978, disbursements continued to be made.

Loan No. 914-EA - Third Telecommunications Project: US$32.5
million Loan of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: September 19,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project included provision for procurement of local telephone
exchange equipment, cables and subscriber apparatus, microwave and UHF/VHF
systems and multiplex equipment, interurban cables and wires, automatic
switching and signalling equipment, telegraph, telex and data equipment,
and training. All project items are substantially completed. About
US$32.2 million of the loan has been disbursed to date.
Loan No. 1204-EA - East African Development Bank: US$15.0
million Loan of March 1, 1976; Effective Date: June 7, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The environment within the Community has continued to have a
negative impact on EADB operations. Level of operations both for appraisal
and supervision has been depressed, but there has been some improvement in
the state of the portfolio. About US$11.7 million of the loan has been
disbursed to date. The closing date has been postponed a second time to
June 30, 1982 to allow for completion of the project.

Page 1 of 6
Memorandum of Understanding on the
IDA Second Reconstruction Credit
1.        The new Uganda Government inherited an economy in ruins.  The
economy has been in almost continual decline since 1971. The decade up to
mid-1981 has seen falling production of export crops, a fall in imports to
about one-third of their former level, a virtual stop in investment, a
steady decline in government revenue in relation to GDP, the concentration
of government expenditure on unproductive sectors, burgeoning budget
deficits, hyperinflation and rampant parallel market activities. In June
1981, however, the Government of Uganda embarked on a comprehensive
financial programme to stabilize and rehabilitate the declining economy.
Under this programme, which has been supported by an IMF stand-by credit
and by the release of the balance of the first IDA Reconstruction Credit,
the Government has: (a) allowed the Uganda shilling to float, resulting in
a depreciation of the IJganda shilling against the US$ from 7.8 to 85 shill-
ings per US$ (represent:ing a devaluation of over 90%); (b) dramatically
raised official producer prices for export crops while removing other
administered price controls except for petroleum products and public
utility tariffs; (c) reformed the taxation system; and (d) placed ceilings
on government borrowing and domestic credit expansion while increasing
interest rates.
2.        Since introducing that programme, the Government has, moreover,
taken further actions, in consultation with the IMF. The exchange rate of
the Uganda shilling has been further adjusted; electricity, water, posts
and telecommunications charges were raised in January 1982, and a number of
changes have been introduced to improve procedures and implementation of
these policies. In particular, efforts have been made to improve the
administration of foreign exchange and government budgetary procedures.
The measures have started to yield some results. Coffee deliveries to pro-
cessors have increased significantly, the supply of goods has improved and
prices have stabilized for the time being.
3.        Government recognizes that the establishment of law and order is
a prerequisite for effective economic recovery and has accordingly made
this its first prioril:y. Government has moreover, stated that it will
encourage a mixed economy in which the state, the private sector and the
cooperatives will compete in a free market economy.
4.        The Government recognizes, however, that it will have to take
further steps beyond the 1981/82 financial programme to sustain economic
recovery. Four areas of action have been identified as requiring priority
attention:
(a) the identification of investment and expenditure priorities,
which the Government has now completed in the form of the
Recovery Programme, and the allocation of resources,
especially foreign exchange, in accordance with these
priorities;



- 46 -                            Annex V
Page 2 of 6
(b) improving the incentive to produce and market export crops,
with the objective of increasing foreign exchange earnings
as rapidly as possible;
(c) improving the implementation capacity of modern sector
enterprises, most of which are parastatal organizations, by
resolving outstanding issues regarding their ownership,
organization and financing; and
(d) improving external debt management.
The remainder of this memorandum sets out present Government policy in
these areas, describes the actions to be undertaken to clarify and imple-
ment these policies and presents an indicative timetable for these actions.
The Recovery Programme
5.        The Government has completed an investment programme, with
Commonwealth Secretariat assistance. This is a comprehensive two-year
programme, covering the fiscal years 1982/83 and 1983/84, comprising
priority rehabilitation investment and recurrent foreign exchange needs,
focussed on those sectors and projects most likely to raise production and
improve the foreign exchange position rapidly. The costs of the projects
in the programme will not exceed US$557 million over those two years, of
which about US$390 million would be foreign exchange. The cost of the
recurrent imports during the same period is estimated at US$800 million.
These requirements have been based on:
(a) projections of export volumes and prices;
(b) a cautious view of the capacity of the Uganda economy to
grow and absorb imports productively; and
(c) expectations of a steady increase in the volume of external
assistance.
The Government believes the size and scope of the programme thus determined
is appropriate, but accepts that unexpected changes in these parameters may
require changes in the programme. Monitoring the programme and adjusting
it will be the task of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development,
which will carry this out on a six-monthly basis. The first such review
will be carried out by December 31, 1982. The Government expects to use
the programme in the following ways:



- 47 -                            Annex V
Page 3 of 6
(a)  As a comprehensive framework for resource allocation,
especially foreign exchange. It expects to use it as a
reference point for the coordination of external assistance
to Uganda, starting with the May 1982 Consultative Group
meetirLg. Specifically, the Government would, to the extent
possible, encourage external donors to direct their support
to the programme, and only accept support outside the
programme to the extent that present and future claims on
domestic resources (budgetary, credit, scarce manpower) were
minimal.
(b)  As an input into the 1982/83 and 1983/84 budgets.  The
development budget would be limited to projects included in
the investment programme. Its recurrent budget would make
adequate provision for the programme's recurrent needs. The
Government further expects that, in order to keep the budget
deficit and domestic bank borrowing within acceptable limits
and, in particular within the limits likely to be acceptable
to a higher tranche IMF programme, this could entail
additional measures, and will entail stricter expenditure
control, especially in non-commodity producing areas.
(c)  As the basis for a foreign exchange budget for 1982/83 and
guidelines for a 1983/84 foreign exchange budget. This
would go beyond the Government's present system of quarterly
foreign exchange budgeting, which is confined to 'free'
foreLgn exchange only, and would in particular provide for
foreign exchange earnings from exports to be allocated on an
increasing extent to the needs of the productive sectors.
In this context, the Government proposes to subject its own
imports and invisible payments, as well as foreign exchange
receipts, to increasingly strong scrutiny, in an effort to
conserve foreign exchange. The Government will continue to
utilize existing technical assistance from the IMF in the
preparation of this foreign exchange budget. The foreign
exchange budget would be administered, as at present, by the
Bank of Uganda, using the existing machinery. To make this
effective, the monitoring of aid receipts and projects by
the Ministry of Finance would be strengthened. Quarterly
monitoring of the budget would, as at present, be
undertaken, with all deviations from planned allocations

fully explained. The foreign exchange budget committee of
the Board of the Bank of Uganda has already coopted the
Chairman of the Uganda Advisory Board of Trade, the Chairman
of the Coffee Marketing Board, the Secretary, Central Tender
Board and a representative of the Ministry of Planning and
Economic Development.
Foreign Exchange Allocation Criteria
6.        In deciding the allocation of foreign exchange under the IDA
Second Reconstruction Credit, the Government will apply the following
criteria:
(a) That the imports concerned would maximize net foreign
exchange or savings in the near future;
(b) For imports that would contribute to domestic consumption
(principally industrial products), priority would be given
to basic consumer and incentive goods, building materials
and agricultural inputs, but only if a clear foreign
exchange saving can be demonstrated;
(c)  Imports for infrastructural purposes, particularly
transport, would go to relief of critical bottlenecks which
prevent earning or saving foreign exchange at minimum cost;
and
(d) That the agency undertaking the expenditure is financially
viable and managerially sound.
In addition, the Government would provide for the future recurrent foreign
exchange needs of projects supported by the Second Reconstruction Credit in
the foreign exchange budget. To the extent possible, the Government will
endeavor to apply these criteria to the allocation of all available foreign
exchange, not only the Second IDA Reconstruction Credit proceeds.
Pricing and Marketing of Export Crops
7.        The Government recognizes that improvements in the pricing and
marketing of export crops (principally coffee, tea, cotton, and tobacco)
are critical to increasing the volume of exports. In the short term, it
will review export crop producer prices, especially for tea and tobacco, in

year. The longer-term aims of the Government's agricultural and pricing
policies can be summarized as follows:
(a)  Export crop producers should receive larger shares of export
prices. Price interventions and distortions should be
reduced to a minimum; subject, most notably in the case of
coffee, lo Government revenue and equity considerations. A
study in this regard will be carried out during the program
period.
(b) Competition among buyers and sellers for the export crops
will be further encouraged so as to reduce marketing and
processing margins. The Government will therefore study on
a crop-by-crop basis the removal of statutory monopolies,
the alternative ways of organizing and regulating export
crop marketing and related needs in market information and
infrastructure.
For the longer term, the capacity of the three sector ministries (Agricul-
ture, Cooperatives and Animal Industry) to collect and analyze information
on production costs and. relative crop prices to develop plans will be
strengthened, if necessary by technical assistance.
The Parastatal Organizations
8.        By the end of June 1982, the Government expects to have submitted
legislation to Parliament that will permit former owners of enterprises
taken over under the previous military government to reclaim their business
or claim compensation. In addition, the Government expects to close down
or sell off a number of existing parastatal organizations. It expects to
reorganize some of those remaining in the public sector and to restructure
them financially by increasing their tariffs, revaluing their assets and
injecting new capital as appropriate. As a first step, the Government with
Bank Group assistance, is carrying out a preliminary examination of 11 key
parastatal organizations to determine the nature and extent of assistance
required to update their accounts as a basis for these decisions. This
preliminary examination should be completed by April 30, 1982. The second
step will be the appointment of a contractor to produce statements of
affairs, audits and financial analysis, as appropriate for these and even-
tually all the remaining parastatals, according to a timetable to be
agreed.

9.        Proposals have already been made to reorganize the Uganda
Development Corporation, the principal parastatal holding company, and its
subsidiaries. The Government expects to decide on this reorganization by
December 31, 1982. Finally, the Government wishes to strengthen its own
capacity to coordinate parastatal operations and policies, monitor their
budgetary and financial impact and ensure consistency and feasibility of
their objectives. Responsibility for these functions is located in the
Economic Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance. Government will
define and seek assistance in this area as part of its programme to obtain
technical assistance for the Ministry of Finance.
External Debt Management
10.       The Government recognizes that better monitoring and management
of its external debt is a vital part of its overall economic management,
and has already taken steps to effect such improvement. It has: (a)
employed a reputable merchant bank to verify its external debt and to
advise on the strengthening of its external debt management; (b) arranged
technical assistance from the IMF to improve the monitoring and repayment
of existing obligations, especially in relation to the foreign exchange
budget; and (c) sought formal rescheduling of its external debt obliga-
tions at the Paris Club in November, 1981 and with non-participants at the
Paris Club. Furthermore, the Government is committed to developing a
mechanism for ensuring that external borrowing is kept within prudent
limits.
