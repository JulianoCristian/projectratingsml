raark-a- was devalued from F-mK 3.20 LO rxk 4.20 for $p in vcuuouur L76J7, dA  a
stabilization nrogram was put into effect. Various proposals aimed at
elimiinating the regulations and practices which have hindered the development
of capital market are being seriously considered by the Government. The out-
look for an accelerated growth of the economy in general and industry in
particular appears favorable.
iii.      l'o arrest the drain on foreign exchange reserves, exports shoLld
be substantially increased.   Consequently there is a compelling need for
developing the more dynamic industries, other than the traditional wood-
working industry whose growth has been subsiding. IFF's role in working to-
ward this objective has been and will continue to be vitally important.
iv.       1FF has become a well-established institution, equipped with El
competent management and an efficient staff.    Annual loan approvals have
increased from Fmk 30 million in 1966 to Fmk l1 million in 1967 and
close to FRnk 90 million in l1)S8.   IFF's equity investment.s have been
negligible but it has made an important contribution in focusing the Govrern-
ment's attention on the need to make reforms directed toward achieving "a
speedier development of the capital market in Finland.
v.         IFF has carried out its operations in accordance with sound
policies. It has built up a sound and diversified portfolio. IFF's profit-
ability has imDroved since its reorganization and it has been able to enlarge
its equity base. IJhile the return on net worth registered a decline as a
result of the sizeable share capital increase which took place in late 1967,
the projected overall profitability is moderately good.    The return on A
shares and reserves is expected to be amproximately 8% - 9.50 during the next
three years, and after dividends of 7% declared on these shares, modera1;e

vi.       Operations in 1963 have been double those of 1967 with more modest
increases during the following four years. In the light of the applications
received cLuring the past few months and the country's industrial growth
prospects, these projections apDear realistic.
vii.      IFF's available resources were fully committed as of the end of
April 1968. In order to finance commitments from May 1968 to the end of
1970 IFF will need a replenishment of resources amounting to approximately
Fmk 256 million. Aside from its cash generation of Fmk 28 million IFF has
been able to line un from domestic sources a total of Fmk 122 million and is
expecting to secure more local funds through a share increase in late 1.970.
TFF has not, howevT r m-t with J       in raisilg funds abroad although

1.         Teollistamisrahasto Oy - Industrialization Fund of Finland Ltd.,
cabbreviated as TR or FF, was reorganized in 1963 with tne assistance oI the
Bank and IFC.  At that time it received a loan of $7 million from the Bank,
and IFC invested in its shares.  A second Bank loan, for $14 million, made
in June 1965, is fully committed and IFF has applied for a new loan. This
report covers major developments in IFF since the previous report circulated
to the Bank's Executive Directors, DB-20b, June 18, 1965, for presentation
of the second loan.  It is based on the findings of an IFC mission which
visited Finland in MVay, and on subsequent correspondence and negotiations.
II. ENVIRONMENT
2'.        During 1966 and 1967 Finland experienced a mild recession as
investment s'lackened and annual growth in GIP and industrial output
cleclined to 2.2/ and 3.5% respectively.  This was largely due to a slacken-
ing in demand for Finland's traditional exports of pulp, paper and forest
products. Although the growth of exports of other manufactures has been
remarkable at about 20% per annum, this growth did not offset the levelling
cff of wood products exports, which still account for 66% of Finland's exports.
This situation, ccoupled with the difficulty Finland has encountered in raising
f'oreign credits, resulted in a deteriorating reserve Dosition.  Efforts to
restrain demand seriously affected employment and consequently, on October 12,
1967, in an attempt to deal with some of the basic economic problems facing
the country, the Finnish markka was devalued by 23.8% and a stabilization
program was 'launched in an attempt to prevent the spiralling of prices and
costs.
3.         Two lrportant parts of this program are:  (a) elimination'
of lending rates tied to the cost-of-living index and (b) corporate
taxation reform.   Index-linked lending was part of a complicated inter-
connected svstem that tended to automaticallv sniral anv nrice increase into
a general increase in costs throughout the economy. Moreover, prior to the
reforms now underway; the system nraeticallv nrecluded develonment of the
capital market. Consequently, in March 1968 index linkage was abolished on
banking and security trnnsactions.  The final levels a.t which interest ra-es
will stabilize is not yet clear.  At present, 12-month bank deposits yield
OI nnd most iLnstitutiinn1 lending is at about 8-l/4%.  Governmient two-year
bonds are still of outstanding attractiveness to investors, bearing 8-l/4g
t__-free interest. *How^ever, t-he exprected issule of Govrer."mmen+t bonds this
year will be less than repayments of interest and principal on outstanding
issues, and hence, there may be some additinr liquidity in the m         which
may allow non-governmental security issues.



- 2 -
4.        In June 1968 the Finnish Parliament passed a law for the reform
of business income taxation, to become effective from the beginning of 1969.
The reform is aimed at freeing funds frozen in companies by the existing
tax system bv such means as a gradual elimination of hidden reserves and
modifying double taxation of dividends. This will improve the yields cn
equitv ancd therebv make enuitv investmernts relativelv more attractive than
they have been in the past. These revisions cover, among other things,
the tdefinitions of tnynhle inno-me- Adrcbtihthilityoftexenses; ev-fl1iticn of
inventories and other assets and the provision of deductible reserves.     The
reform also provides for balanc±ng of losses oveAr five years for state in-
come tax purposes and liberalizes capital gains tax to some extent.     Property

was raised to offset the property tax loss.
5.        Concerning the capital market, various proposals are now being

underwriting.   The present bond law is outdated; the main amendment to be
proposed :later thLs year would reMove the requireme11t that bond iussues be
approved by the Council of State, which has given priority to the Government's
own borrow- ing.  By the proposed law the Bank Of Finland will assume control
and instead of requiring permission for bond and debenture issues only
registration with the Bank would be required, along with meeting certain
minimum criteria for protecting the investor.    Among other changes aimed at
developing the capital market would be the abolition of stamp duties on all
financial transactions between institutions.    A proposal to this effect is
to be put forward for parliamentary action in early 1969 and favorable action
seems likely.
6.        As to the near future, the economic recovery now in process in
Western Europe coupled with the higher export opportunities resulting from
devaluation should improve business prospects and lead to a sharp recovery
in investment. Mlanufacturing investment should improve considerably above
the 1967 level, which was about Fmk 1.4 billion. Industrial growth in.
Finland will continue to depend to a large extent on the development of
wood-based industries but the possibilities for dynamic growth are in the
non-traditional, export-oriented sector.    Import substitution opportunities
in Finland at this stage of development are limited. Although Finland has
experienced quite severe economic problems in the last two years the biasis
for futurme growth appears now to have been established and the outlook is
much improved.

Ownership
7.       .i:ter the 1963 reorganization, IFF's share capital consisted of
FruWk 6 milliSon Series-A shares subscribed by Finnish commercial uatnks, savins
banks, insurance companies, foreign financial institutions and IFC and
Fimk 9 million Series-B shares subscribed by the Bank of Finiand. In October
1967, the Series-A shares were increased by Fmk 8 million to Fmk 14 million
and the Series-B shares were increased by Fnk 4 mill ion and the amount cut-
standing is now Fmk 11.5 million. Some shareholders including IFC did not
exercise their rights to subscribe to the new issue.   As a result, five new
Finnish shareholders, including the three largest pension insurance
companies, and eight new foreign shareholders were added to the Series-A.
shareholders. The Bank of Finland remains the onlSr silaroholder of
Series-B shares since the new B shares were again entirely subscribed by it.
A portion of the new A shares is now held by the Bank of Finland but it is
expected that this portion will be sold to various nrivate institutions dur-
ing 1969.
8.        Each Series-B share has one-tenth of the voting power of a
Series-A share. They are subordinate to Series-A shares in the event of
liquidation. The maximum dividend payable on these shares is 3% and can
only be paid after a 7% dividend on Series-A shares. Each year Fmk 300,000
Series-B shares are redeemed out of profits before taxes. The Series-B
shares now outstanding represent 8% of the voting rights, and the Series-A
shares 92%. Private shareholders control-74,- of the voting rights and WFC 310.
After the IBank of Finland sells its. A shares, the private shareholders and
IFC will have 85e' of IFF.s voting rights. and this rercentage will increase as
B shares are redeemed. The distribution of shareholdings in IFF as of
October 31, 1968, is shown in Annex 1.
Board of Administration and Board of Directors
9.        TFF has a Board of Administration consisting of 18 members and a
Board of Directors consisting of 8 directors. The Board of Administration
is the nolicy-makinv body and mets once or twice a vear.    Mr. Mauno Koivisto.
Prime 1Minister and Governor in absentia of the Bank of Finland, is the
Chairman. The other mmhbers a-re rep-resentatives of high stand ing from the
Finnish financial community. The number of members will be increased to 21
to take into n ,t^ii4 +the r.er shareholders from the 19Q7 mhmrn is.i
10.       The Board of Directors is ested with full p^owers to manage IFF's
affairs, it meets once a month.  It is headed by Mr. Teuvo Aura, former
Genvral Manager of the Post Office Savings Bak    as Chaiizm&i and Dr. Jaakko
Lassila, General Manager of IFF, as Vice Chairman. The Board's formal
approval i    [ requiredl for  lo 1Oans3ar. ,d inveSt nt s.. A list of the members
of the Board of Administration and the Board of Directors is given in
A r  2.-01



Executive Committee
11.        A three-member Executive Committee had been created in 1963 to
review all loan applications and appraisals before submission to the Board
of Directors.  Since members of the Committee are members of the Board and
the Board meets regularly to consider all applications, the Committee has
become redundant and is inoperative.
Management and Staff
12.        Dr. Jaakko Lassila, formerly Secretary of the Bank of Finland and
Assistant General Manager of the Central Association of the Finnish Wood-
working Industries, was appointed General Manager of IFF in January 1967 to
succeed Mr. Seppo Konttinen, who had been General Manager since March 1563.
Dr. Lassila has had a long and close association with IFF, as Special Advisor
to IFF's General Manager and a Director on the Board before his appointment
as General. Mlanager.
13.        IFF's staff has grown steadily since IFF's reorganization in 1963.
The number has now reached 31, including two assistant managers, two general
officers, thirteen financial analysts, two engineers, two accountants, one
translator, three secretaries, five clerical assistants and one part-time
technical advisor.  The organization chart is shown in Annex 3.   The staff
works efficiently and interest in the work is high. Turnover has been low,
despite frequent offers of other positions.   Though exceptionally young, most
being under 30, the staff members aonear to be well resDected by IFF's clients.
For several years IFF has undertaken to train staff of Finnish financiaL
institutions which are shareholders in IFF. These trainees work as regular
staff msmbers for A one-vyer n.riad-
Lh1.       To finance its operations, 1FF has obtained resoulrces from its
shareholders, in the form of shares, debentures and loans, and from the
World Bank. The resou     s that has.e beoen m.ade available TO tF   o +o
October 31, 1968 were as follows: (See Annex 4 for further details)

IV. POLIC IES AND OPERATIONS
Operating Policies
15.      A statement of policies to be followed by IFF was approved by the
Board of Administration in September 1963 and amended, with the Bank's
approval, in April 1968. The amended stntement is PivAn in Annex 5.   The
amendment raised the maximum investment allowed in any single enterprise by
taking into accoumnt tmm no 2dditional %mhmnrtinatrd dehenture issunes with long
grace periods, which had been made since 1963.
16.      IFF's operations have by and large conformed to the policy statement.
The lraprf norrm-i 5ssihbl e,.rmmn+.mnon+. i,n a cinaim en+eY-rJAi now r nTnunm.nts to
about Fmk 9 million; the largest commitment to date has been Fmk 8.0 million.
T.e total equity portfolio is limited to the amout of the capital and
reserves which, with the increase in share capital, is about Fmk 28 million.

policy statement should in due course De modified to reflect this new outlook.
Summary of Operations
17.      IFF's level of activity has been a function of industrial investment
activity in Finland more than of the availability of resources. After an
initial surge which had backlogged in anticipation of IFF's reorganization,
the volume of applications grew to a peak in 1965, and then fell sharply
during 1966 and early 1967, as a decline in exports and production, the
retrenchment policy of the Government and the tight credit situation combined
to reduce industrial investment. Picking up late in 1967, investment
activity is currently at a high level which has led to a record level of
applications in 1968.
18      Approvals of new loans and investments have followed a similar
pattern, increasing from Fnk 35.2 million during 1964, the first full year
of operation, to Fmk 37.4 million in 1965. After a 20% drop to Fink 30 millThn
in 1966, IFF's operations picked up rapidly in 1967 with approvals totalling
Fmk 41.3 million for the year, the highest level reached since its reorlganiza-
tion. 1968 has seen an even more remarkable increase, with Fmk 68.3 mi:Llion
approvals in the first ten months and a further Fmk 20 million expected by
the end of the year,
19.      Cancellations and reductions of loans already approved have not been
a problem for IFF. Of the loans granted only 15, for Fmk 7.5 million, have
been canceLled; reductions have amounted to only Fmk 0.7 million. Seven loans.
for Fmk 840,c00 have been wholly repaid in advance of scheduled maturity.

and disbursezmnts for each year since reorganization and also the use
of Bank funds during this period.
Lending Activity
21.       During the period from its reorganization in October 1963 to
October 31, 1968, IFF received 1,133 loan applications totalling Fmk 439
million and made 468 loans involving Fmk 226 million. Over half of the funds
applied for have been for financing machinery and about 35% have been for
buildings, working capital and other uses have been insignificant.
22.       Miost lending has been to medium-sized and small enterprises which
have needed to invest in cost-redueing errnansions and modernization so as to
increase their competitiveness. However, h5 loans accounting for 10% of the
total nrmber of loans approved ha   been for establishing new enterprises=
Two-thirds of the loans have been for concerns with 100 or fewer employees.
23.       Foreign Currency Comoonent.  In Finland much industrial equipment is
either entirelwy dorastically produced or v  ,n+iaA fromim+          co.,lonts
and the need of an enterprise for capital bears no direct relation to its need

loans and investments, which was at that tiTm considered a reasonable propor-
tion for the Bank to cover out of liF's total capital requirements and whiLch
was also IFF's estimate of the average import component, direct and indirect,
of all its financing activity.
24.       industrial Distribution.  IFFIs loans are fairly well diversified
among various industries outside the large, traditional industries of pulp,
paper and heavy machine manufacturing.  The engineering industry has received
the largest amount of financing with 25% of the total; food processing has
received 167%, furniture making 13% and the textile industry 12%. Other
industries received less than 10% each. A breakdown of the loans by indus-
trial categories is given in Annex 7.
25.       Geographical Distribution.  The location of projects assisted
follows the pattern of the distribution of industry in Finland. About 79% of
the loans granted have been for projects located in Uudenmaan, Turun-Porin,
Hameen and Vaasan Provinces, all in the southern and southwestern part of
Finland. Nearly one-third of IFF's loans were made for projects in ancd
around Helsinki, in Uudenmaan Province, by far the most important industrial
area in Finland. The geographical distribution of IFF's loans is summarized
in Annex 83.

26.       Size   Although 1FF lending has been characterized by a large
number of rather small loans, the number of relatively large loans has recent-
ly risen notab .   Of the 468 loans grant+ed up to October 31, 1968, 247 OLoans,
or 53%, are for less than Fmk 300,000, although these account for only about
16% of aprovals byvalue.  T=  overal.l alvera-ge of al loans Ls U11r,l  S2,3

more than 83% of this amount have been granted in 1967 and 1968. The size
distriVbutiou -ofI OI l's Loans is sunmmarized in Annex 9.
27.       Terms. IFF1s interest charges are related to the
prevailing rates for short-term loans and government bonds in Finland. The
rate charge,i by IFF has been increasing gradually; the 7-3/4% rate was d:is-
continued after 1965 and since September 1967 virtually all loans have been
at 8-1/2%.  IFF charges a 1% commitment fee, and 3% per annum (payable on the
whole amount of principal) is charged on arrears.
28.       The average maturity of the loans extended is about 11 years.    Of
the total amount committed, 91% was for a term of 10 years or more; 15% has
a term of 14-15 years.  The shortest term is for 5 years; the longest, 115.
The amortization period of each loan includes a grace period varying from one
to three years.
29.       Most loans are secured by a mortgage or a Bank guarantee or both.
Sixty-seven out of the 468 loans extended up to October 31, 1968, are secured
by a Government guarantee through the State Guarantee Office, the borrowers
being small firms which are unable to secure a bank guarantee or give a,lequate
mortgage security.
30.       The foreign exchange risk arising from the Bank loans is either
passed on to IFF's borrowers or to the Government. The Government has agreed
to bear the risk un to Fmk qOO.00Q equivalent for anv single loan if the firm's
sales are under Fmk 10 million per annum, it employs less than 500 workers and
if IFF thinks the comnanv is not strong enough to bear it itself.   The foreign
exchange risk over this limit is passed on to the borrower.   The Government
has recentl;y added another provision Concerning its guarantees to the effect
that it will not take the risk for a company which exports more than 40% of
its output   T IFF's clien.ts havie no+. ben chargeda fee for the exchange risk
protection provided by the Government. Of the loans made out of the proceeds
Of the two Bank loans, totalling $21 million, 48% has been covered by the
Government guarantee, the remainder being assumed by the clients themselves.
Equity Investments
31.       Only eight equity investments, as defined by IFF, totalling Fmk 1.7
AIL.L.L.Lon, have b'ieen approv)edU Uy Lrr ts DUZ siU ce the Vrgd1tizatoLt; f IlVe~ of
these have been approved since September 1967. However, the most recent
investments contain clauses whereby the companies or their sharehnoiders agree
to buy back the shares within a 10-year period at a price that will yield IFF
an i17% or i2% return, compounded annually and thus they are really like un-
secured loans.   The shares may be sold to others but existing shareholders
have pre-er?tive rights.



32.       IFF's investment in Marimekko Oy is particularly noteworthy as an
indication of IFF's willingness to take greater risks in appropriate cases.
In addition to the equity investment, IFF made a loan to the company without
security, taking into account the company's good prospects and high cash flow.
It is hoped that a public share offer may be worked out and if so IFF's share
investment could be sold to the public.
33.       Of the seven industrial companies in which IFF has invested, five
are operating profitably, one is not yet profitable and one does not commence
operations until 1969. Only one of these shares is traded on the exchange.
On the whole, the book value of IFF's equitv nortfolio somewhat understates
its real value. Annex 10 lists IFF's equity portfolio.
34.       The low level of real equity operations reflects the general un-
attractivenAes of eniuitv investment die to the financial and taxation prac-
tices in Finland. However, tax reforms have been put into effect recently
andi ot±her ohbstles to. t.he dclomant of t.he capnital mark-et. harTe been

loan for itS aupraisals.  Its appraisals are thoro-ugh, well prepared and
clearly presented.
End-Use Reporting
36.       IFF appears to be following its past loans with reasonable thorough-
ness and care. 1FF has about 350 clients and it requires the same reporting
for small as well as large investments, including quarterly progress reports
during construction and semi-annual reports thereafter. Visiting is not yet
on as systematic a basis as IFF's management would like. During the past year,
40 visits have been made, mostly to large clients or those obviously in some
difficulty.  A newly employed staff member has just been assigned to this
division to help keep up with the growing workload, and an additional engineer
has been recruited to assist with project follow-up work.
37.       IFF submits to the Bank and IFC semi-annual reports on its financial
condition and operations for the preceding six-month period. It also submits
progress reports on the projects where its aggregate commitment exceeds $250
$250,000 equivalent (IFF's free limit). Nevertheless, in order for the Bank tco
know more systematically about projects below IFF's free limit, which number
10 times the projects over the free limit, IFF will in the future send the
Bank copies of the detailed report IFF submits each year to its Board of
Administration on all projects.

Sponsor Cy
38.       In October 1967, IFF joined with the Bank of Finland and several
other of its principal shareholders to form a new industrial development
company, Sponsor Oy, This company has been created in response to the need in
Finland. where familv-owned enternrises nredominate. for promoting the
establishment of new enterprises (or reorganizing existing enterprises),
developingrj  new products And pnroduet ideas, and providing technical and economic

IFF is reimbursed for te se services. In due course, it will acquire a
permanent staff of its own.   The company also has a Technical Counsellor Group
to advise it, bringing together experts in atomic energy, physics, engineering,
chemistry, economics and finance. So far, Sponsor Oy has been spending
considerable time appraising a large number of cases involving inventions and
innovations which have been brought to it and has financed twelve proJeCts
totalling Fink 3965000.
Other Contributions of IFF
4o.      :CFF's management and Board have developed strong ties with the Bank
of Finlancl and the other main financial institutions in Finland, which have
fully supported the companyts development. IFF has made a significant
contribution in bringing more modern methods of accounting and control into
companies and in its methods of appraising loan applications, methods now be:int
adopted by other institutions as evidenced by the interest of commercial barks
in having some of their staff seconded to 1FF for training. Moreover, IFF has
been asked by its shareholders and the Government to do, on a fee basis,
special company or industry studies and it has recently engaged a new staff
member specifically for this purpose.
41.      ]n addition, IFF is establishing close relationships with the pension
insurance companies. which now give preference in their financing to companies
recommended by IFF. IFF expects theat these companies will invest in 1'F-
sponsored debenture or share issues. will participate with it in large new
loans and. will buy parts of larger loans from IFF's portfolio.

46.       By the end of October 1968, IFF's loan portfolio had reached
FmIk 1148 iUllion.  The ratio of ,eries-A shares plus reserves to all othrF
funds was 1.:7, a marked decrease in Leverage over the position bef'ore the
share increase (i:v.6)o.  WIitn Series-B snares inciuded in tne equity, t.ne
ratio of debt to equity was about 4:1. The ratio of non-subordinated debt
to all otheir junior funds was about 1.4 to 1, hence, the exposure of the Bank
as the main senior creditor is low.
47.       I'he borrowing limit under the two Bank loans was initially three
times  FFIFs net worth plus two subordinated debentures totalling Fimk 10
million. T'he Bank agreed on December 11, 1967 to include in the borrowing
base two additional issues of Fmk 10 million each (Debenture No. III in 1966
due in 1981-1°90 and No. V of 1967 due 1988-1992).  At the end of October 31,
1960, the actual derived ratio, as defined for the Bank's loan agreementis, was
1.7 to 1.
Income Statiements
148.      -3y 1967 IFF had reached a reasonable level of profitability,
achieved by a fairly high degree of leverage and low administrative costs
despite narrow spreads and heavy taxation.  Net profit after tax and pro-
visions in 1967 was Fmk 990,000 which represents a return of 6.2% on average
paid-in share capital and reserves and a return on average paid-in Series-A
shares and reserves of 12.3%. However, net profit after taxes and prov:isions
in 1968 is estimated at Fmlk 1,095,000 which reDresents a decline in the annual
returns to 14.7% on average paid-in share capital and reserves and 8.1% on
average paid-in Series-A shares and reserves. This decline in the percentage
return is the result of the increase 6f IFF's paid-in share canital, and
consequent reduction in leverage, which took nlace in early 1968.

Dividends and Share Value
52.       Prior to October 1968, IFF's Articles limited dividends on Series-A
shares to 5% and authorized Uividdends on Series-B shares -up to 3% if a ?/o A
dividend was paid.   IFF naid a 4% dividend on Series-A shares in 1964 and 5%
for  1965, 196G and 1967. The Bank of Finland however waived its dividend
1/ Before provisions and final tax assessment.
2/ Estimate for 1968, on an annual basis, after all provisions and taxes.



rights on the! Series-B shares in the interest of allowing IFF to build reserves.
The 5% dividend limit in the Articles was adopted to conform with a law waiv-
ing a 1% annual net worth tax for companies with such a statutory limitation.
This law was repealed in 1968 and in October 1968 1FF removed the Series-A
dividend limitation from its Articles and instead adopted a provision to allow
an A dividend of /7 before B dividends are paid and stipulating that; the B share
dividend rate is 1% for each 1% increment in A dividends over 7%, with a
ceiling B dividend of 3%. The distribution in 1966 amounted to 38% of net
profits and in 1967 to 27%. The share increase wi-ll raise the 1968 pay oult
rate to about 64% of earnings.   (For 1968, IFF's management will propose to
pay a 7% dividend on the 6,000 old A shares and half of the dividend on the
8,000 new A shares paid in in the course of 1968. The total amount to be
paid out wil:L be Fmk 700,000.)
53.       IFl's shares are not listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. In
1966, a total of 35 Series-A shares were sold at par by five existing share-
holders to Keskinainen Vakutusyhtio Tarmo, an insurance company. No other
sales of IFF's shares have taken place since its reorganization. The boolc
value of the Series-A shares at the end of October 1968. was lh22% of par.
compared with l1O% before the share capital increase. The recent capital
increase of A shares was priced at 110% of par.

Commitments and Additional Resources
55.       As mentioned earlier, IFF's business volume has increased markedly
ir, 1968.  Co.fI-tm.en'Lls had reached Fi 78 1U.LL.LVLI at ULM enu of 1NverLIIUe adU
are expected to have increased to Fmk 88 million by the end of 1968.   IFF
expects that its business in the following years should grow beyond this levei
at a moderate rate, rising to Fnlk 105 million in 1972. These expectations are
reasonable given the fact that IFF is now serving larger firms. Projections
of commitments and disbursements for 1968-1972 are given in Annex 13. Assum-
ing an increase in aggregate manufacturing investment of about 10% per annum,
IFF's contribution would gradually increase to about 5% of the total by 1972.
;6.       By the end of April 1968, IFF had fully committed its available
resources, excluding repayments of loans not required to service IFF's debt,
and retained earnings. Additional commitments since May (amounting to Fmk 71
million by the end of November) have been made in anticipation of new funds
to be raised. Commitments made since May together with those projected



-      -
through 10yu total irnk 2o56 million, which is 1FFFfs resource requirement. iFF
has been making serious efforts to raise additional resources both in Finland
and abroad. The result of its efforts to raise funds abroad has been dis-
appointing. In early 1967, a $10 million bond issue through Hambros in
London was planned but was postponed because of poor market conditions. The
possibilities of raising funds in New York and Germany were also explored
during the n)?st two years, but given up for the time being.
57.       IFF is experiencing better success in raising funds in Finland and
has made arrangements with its shareholding financial institutions and the
Government to raise Finnmark funds in the course of the next two to three
years as f'ollows:
(a) Debenture Issue No. VI, of Fmk 40 million, to be is,ued in
1969 and repaid in five equal installments, 1989-1993, with
the interest rate to be confirmed in later negotiations but
at least 6-1/2%, the issue to be subscribed by the Government,
(b) Debenture Issue No. VII, of Fmk 10 million, at 6-3/4%, to be
issued in 1969, with reavyment in five equal installments.
198331987, to the Finnish shareholding financial concerns.
(c) Shareholders' Loan No.3 from Finnish financial institutions
of FmPk 10 million, at 6-1/2% to be drawn in 1969-1970 writh
repayment in five equal installments, 1981-1985.
(d) Additional loans totalling Fmk 62 million: Fink 25 million from
Banko f Finand and --r 37 million fronm shaeholder bank, at.

content of the locally proc-Ured items was at least 12%-L5/o  ConLsequently, it
is proposed that under the third Bank loan, the Bank would finance 50Co of
each project commencing in December 1968 for a two year period.   (IFF would
itself fully finance   its operations in the interim between April, when the
second Bank loan ran out, and December 1968.)   Procedurally, the arrangement
whereby the Bank participates in all projects at a fixed percentage has worked
well and should be continued.
59.       On this basis IFF's business and funding since the second Bank
loan was f'ully used would be as follows:

The return on net worth in 1968-1970, while rising each year, is not expected
to su-pass the 1967 lerel because of the large capital increase in early 1968
and consequent reduction of leverage.  IFF expects to be in a position to pay

63.       IFF's debt limit ratio. as defined in the existing loan ngree:ment,.
would reach 2.7:1 at the end of 1969 and 3.7:1 at the end of 1970 against the
existing snecified maximum ratio of 3 to 1- Tt is proposed that for the new
loan two modifications of the existing debt limitation be made:
(a) The portion of the subordin,'ted debentures and of the redeem-
able B shares whlch are due prior to the last mratuity of the
propoa-ed Bank loan should be excluded from the borrowing base
and def-ined as -debt. Thsco.-,,- -with prset      -ak1olc

the total. debt/equity ratio would be 8.6:1 and the ratio of A shares plus
reserves to all othr-er f-unds would be 1:13.8. To support the anticipated
growth the!reafter, IFF intends to increase its capital by Fmk 13 million
(Fmk 3 million in A shares, Fimk 5 million in B shares) and tne above ratios
at the encd of 1972 would be 2.7:1, 8:1 and 1:12.4 respectively.  Because of
]FFIs subordinated loans, the ratio of senior debt to all junior funds
remains very moderate at about 1:1 in 1970 and 1972. Provisions and re!serves
wlll amount to 4.3' of portfolio at the end of 1972.
64.       IFF's debt service cover throughout the repayment period of t,he
Bank loan, on thle assumptions that business grows at approximately the same
pace as in the past and that resources raised to finance this growth have
terms following the pattern of the terms of resources raised in the past,
would rang,e from 1.7 to 1.5 times debt service obligations in the first ten
years of t1he proposed Bank loan and would decline to a low of about 1.2
times in the last year of the proposed loan's amortization period.   This
gives an adequate margin for servicing debt.
VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECO'ENDATIONS
65.       IFF, in the five years since its reorganization, has made good
progress in building a well managed organization, competent staff and a sound
portfolio.  It is achieving one of the principal aims for which it was re-
organized, that is to develop an appropriate institutional framework for
the encouragement of the expansion of industries other than woodworking by
providing long-term credits to small- and medium-sized industrial enter-
Drises.  It has played a particularly significant role in helping to focus
attention on the need to make basic changes in the laws and regulations
which have stifled the efforts to develon a canital market in Finland.
Substantial reforms have been made recently and IFF will continue to lend
its support to further nhanges so that it Can becom.e ative in investing in
shares and underwriting.
66.       IFF's assistance in the founding of Sponsor Oy, both by participat-
i   isr,n -  s hare -apta+  ad1 y- r,-- rv ing 1-n,r pnersnnnl t-ngt lts onra+io nn
started, is a valuable contribution to the future development of new indus-
trie-sand new nroducts in Virland.

67.     In 1967, IFF's operations had reached the highest level in its
historyv Fmk iQ.1 mnillinn fowr Inn-nn and FmIk 1.2 inil1lion for equitv invast-
ments, registering an increase of 33% over the 1966 operations. This level
of busJiness has been doubled in 1068 and sholld increade moderately there-
after. These projections do not appear to be over-optimistic in view of
the prospects of ind+stria)l growth in Firnland.
68e     Thle financial prospects of 1TF are moAerate.  I    +h' the  te of
return on. net worth for the following three years will not be as high as
1906-7, dtue to the r-ecer.ito s&ubstdAILic s.hare cappitfal iLn,emase., theprof-bl
of the institution will be 8%-9.5% on Series-A shareholders' net worth for
.7198170,   YYlLle -LL hag been aeLLu -,'o raIse auutlonLel f.uds fromI don.Lest
sources, its efforts in raising funds abroad have been fruitless and the
prospects in this regard are not favorable.  1xF is an appropr'iate
institution for receiving further finance from the Bank. On the basis of
exi.sting forecasts, if the Bank finances 50% of the total irr assistance to
projects, IFF would require about $22 million to cover its commitments in
the next two years. The other terms and conditions should be similar to
those of recent Bank loans to development finance companies, including a
fixed imterest rate and the standard commitment charge.
69.     in view of the quality of IFF's appraisal work an increase in the
limit for projects not requiring prior Bank approval before commitment of
Bank fundls is justified. Under the second Bank loan, all projects where
IFF's aggregate assistance was above $250,000 equivalent were submitted
to the Bank for approval. Since the second Bank loan became effective in
1965, altogether 23 projects (out of 292 approved by IFF's Board) involving
a total amount of $4,6 million of the Bank funds required the Bank's prior
approval:, which represents approximately one-third of the second Bank loan
of $14 m!Lllion. An increase of the present limit, to $750,000 equivalent,
the figure  again applying to the entire amount of any IFF commitment, would
be appropriate and would result in approximately the same percentage of the
Bank's funds being involved in projects requirina prior review, in view of
the greater number of larger loans IFF is now making and which it is
expected to make in the future.

1/   Capital gain from sales of property (office space).
2/   During 1965-1967, IFF charged to income "unrealized foreign exchange
losses" which would in fact be recovered from their borrowers. The
cumulative amount of the losses so charged is Fmk 295.0O0 ('Fmk 105.000
in i965, Fmk 74,000 in 1966, Fmk 116,000 in 1967).  By so doing, IFF's
net profit during the past three years has been slightly understated.
Since IFF's income has been subject to taxes of approximately 70% the
tota'l amount of nrofit which was not disclosed by TFF in their financial
statements is about Fmk 80,000.
