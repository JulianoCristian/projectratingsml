There are five project components, including\n            project management: (1) The competition and sector reform\n            component finances technical assistance to assist changes to\n            sector legislation in order to increase competition, in the\n            accession to the WTO, and in the design of a postal policy;\n            engagement of advisors for the award of a digital cellular\n            license; and professional development (training, study\n            visits). (2) The regulatory reform component assists the\n            introduction of effective regulation of the\n            telecommunications sector and strengthens the regulatory\n            capacity of the government ministry (MOPT). The component\n            covering the Corporate Reform of SamoaTel includes\n            assistance to explore options to privatize SamoaTel, and to\n            carry out its privatization. The Postal Reform component\n            will be carried out in two phases. Phase 1 involves\n            technical assistance to the government to elaborate a postal\n            sector strategy, and Phase 2 includes the investment to\n            upgrade SamoaTel's postal capacity."}, "docdt": "2002-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
