follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            in a small island economy, postal services have limited\n            space for growth, and need more support to build a diversity\n            of business streams (such as money transfers and payments)\n            and improved quality of service to regain market shares in\n            the parcels and express segments. Lack of leadership in\n            drawing the appropriate policy framework in a timely manner\n            is a key factor in delays for sector reform. The Ministry of\n            Finance (MoF) took the lead on a few items related to the\n            reform agenda items (particularly, SamoaTel's\n            restructuring and privatization), but the rest of the sector\n            reform agenda lacked momentum; and this inertia slowed\n            project implementation. In addition, there was limited\n            capacity to implement the reforms, and this translated into\n            delayed progress, and into extending the project three times\n            (for a total of 34 months beyond the original closing date).\n            In the future, project designs should assess the strength of\n            leadership, and provide for effective capacity for adequate\n            project implementation."}, "docdt": "2011-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
