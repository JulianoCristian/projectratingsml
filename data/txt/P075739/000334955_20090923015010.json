These changes will allow completion of\n            two key components of the project: (a) the privatization\n            transaction of Samoa Tel; and (b) the further strengthening\n            of the regulatory framework for the telecommunications\n            sector, particularly in the areas of interconnection,\n            convergence and downstream effects of privatization. The\n            results of both components are important to the development\n            of the sector.
