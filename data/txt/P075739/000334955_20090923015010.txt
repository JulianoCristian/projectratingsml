INTRODUCTION

1.       This Project Paper (PP) seeks the approval o f the Regional Vice President to
introduce the following changes in the Samoa Telecommunications and Postal Sector
Reform Project (Credit 3724-WSO (P075739) and any accompanying amendments to the
project's legal documents: (i)  extension o f the IDA Credit through October 15,2010 for
a cumulative extension o f 2.5 years; (ii)                                            ii
                                          reallocation o f the Credit proceeds; and ( i )
conversion o f the project's logical framework into the Results Framework. These
changes will allow completion o f two key components o f the project: (a) the
privatization transaction o f SamoaTel; and (b) the further strengthening o f the regulatory
framework for the telecommunications sector, particularly in the areas o f interconnection,
convergence and downstream effects o f privatization. The results o f both components
are important to the development o f the sector. Likewise, full utilization o f the Credit
and adequate monitoring o f project implementation and achievement o f outcomes will be
facilitated.

BACKGROUND REASONS RESTRUCTURING
         AND    FOR

2.      The project was approved by the Board in December 2002 and the Credit for SDR
3.4 (USD 4.48 million equivalent) million became effective in April 2003 and had an
original closing date o f April 15,2008. The project's original development objective i s
to assist the Government o f Samoa in implementing a comprehensive sector reform
agenda that focuses on: (a) introducing competition and private participation in
telecommunications and postal sectors; (b) advancing regulatory reform and developing
sector institutional capacity; and (c) extending access to basic communications, postal
services and Internet. The project was designed with five major components: (a)
Competition and Sector Reform; (b) Regulatory Framework; (c) Corporate Reform o f
SamoaTel; (d) Postal Sector Reform; and (e) Project Management Team with the Credit
financing goods, consultancy services and training requirements.

3.      While the overall pace o f project implementation reflects the limited institutional
capacity in Samoa (a shortage o f skilled staff and high staff turnover, both widespread
issues in Pacific governments), the Borrower and the implementing agencies have
performed in arelatively satisfactory manner and remain strongly committed to the




                                        Page 2 o f 11
project's objective to increase access to affordable telecommunications. 1The project has
achieved a number o f significant results and has paved the way for similar reforms in the
Pacific. In particular, penetration o f telecommunications has increased eight-fold since
2002 (there are 101,400 telecommunications customers in 2008 compared to 12,500 in
2002). The regulatory framework i s in line with international best practice.

4.      On the telecommunication side, some important milestones were reached
relatively early in the project implementation: the award o f a second digital cellular
telecommunications license, the enactment o f a new, pro-competitive telecommunication
law and the creation o f an independent regulator. As a result, telecommunication
performance indicators have outpaced the objectives with a sharp increase in penetration
from 12,500 subscribers in 2002 to 53,500 in 2006 (compared to an objective o f 35,000)
and to 101,400 in 2008 (compared to the objective o f 46,000 set in the PAD). However,
while it performed well in the first part o f the project, it experienced a slow-down on the
privatization activity and i s the main driver for the Credit extension beyond October
2009.

5.       The project's postal component, which represents about half o f the total amount
o f the Credit (US$3.19 million out o f a total amount o f US$6.33 million), got o f f to a
slow start. The investment part o f the postal component (US$1.45 million) remained at a
stand-still for four years, and successive procurement issues have continued to slow the
process. By the project's midterm review (November 2005), the team warned the
government o f the need to focus on this component. Shortly after the July 2007
supervision mission, the government requested a Closing Date extension and an initial
reallocation o f funds to reduce the postal component (from US$1.45 million to US$0.7
million) and to give more time for i t s completion, as well as for the implementation o f the
privatization process o f SamoaTel. The slow pace o f implementation led to the initial
extension o f 18 months (through October 2009) and initial reallocation.

6.       Since then, project implementation has focused on pushing the postal goods
procurement packages and on the privatization process. A supervision mission was
conducted in December 2007 that dealt, specifically, with privatization options. Before
the procurement process for the selection o f transaction advisors could start, the
government made some strategic decisions in i t s approach to privatization. In the spring
o f 2008, the government split telecommunication and postal business units (then housed
in SamoaTe1)-managing this reorganization in record time-so that in September 2008,
SamoaPost was incorporated as a public enterprise. Postal goods were purchased, albeit
for a total amount lower than the reallocated amount in September 2007 (US$0.3
million). As for the privatization transaction advisory tender, it started with two
regulatory issues pending (a dispute on interconnection tariffs and the unexpected
departure o f the regulator-for personal reasons-who was replaced by an interim
regulator, while in parallel an international recruitment was undertaken). In addition, the
government established a Unit Trust which added a layer o f complexity to the
prospective transaction structure and, therefore, to the procurement documents.

 ISR Ratings for the project have been Moderately Satisfactory for DO and IP for the past two FYs (2008
and 2009).


                                            Page 3 o f 11
Discussions on the fee structure, as well as on issues related to the first submitted short-
list, delayed further the procurement process.

7.      Early in December 2008, it became clear that the privatization would not be
completed within the time frame o f the project (October 2009). This led the government
to request a second extension o f 18 months. The length o f this second extension takes
into account the current market situation: the government anticipates a l o w response to
the tender and the possible need to re-tender. The extension also aims to build the
capacity o f the Office o f the Regulator, which i s a critical condition to stabilize the
environment o f the telecommunications sector in Samoa and which will, in turn, provide
better conditions for a successful privatization.

8.     By April 2009, all project covenants were met, and in parallel the government
requested a reallocation o f funds to better address the project priorities. With about 54
percent o f the IDA disbursed and substantial amounts o f unallocated funds available, the
government proposed to pursue during the extension period:

       (a) The remaining main procurement items in the PAD: the privatization advisors
           (US$850,000), together with three smaller technical assistances related to the
           socio-economic impact o f the telecommunication reform, the rural access and
           output-based aid scheme, and a pilot for the output-based aid.

       (b) Additional activities for:

           Ministry o Finance/SamoaPost:
                     f
           Cost assessment o f universal postal service US($SO,OOO)
           Antivirus and M Office Suites Software (US$20,000)

           and Services (US$60,000)

           Ministry o Communication and Information Technologj/Ofice o the
                     f                                                        f
           Regulator

           Capacity Building (US$200,000)
           Update o f the Telecommunication Policy (US$40,000)
           Update o f the National I C T Policy (US$40,000)
           Update o f the Broadcast Policy (US$40,000)

9.     Under the circumstances outlined in this project paper, the team supports the
government's request for extension on a phased basis and reallocation, for the following
reasons:

   0   W h i l e part o f the delayed implementation can be attributed to our counterpart
       (mostly technical delays related to procurement, reimbursement conditions to



                                        Page 4 o f 11
        expenses related to postal goods, and overdue reports that are project covenants),
        the Borrower i s clearly committed to complete the privatization, which i s an
        important milestone o f the project.
    0   The current market situation clearly i s not favorable, and the delayed privatization
        could benefit the government; and
    0   This time can be used to strengthen capacity within the Office o f the Regulator,
        which in turn will improve the sector environment and the conditions for a
        successful privatization.


PROPOSED CHANGES

Extension

10.     After substantial internal discussions, a first-stage 12-month extension was agreed
upon as a safer timeframe to continue supporting the government in project
implementation. There i s a possibility for a third extension (for six months or more) that
would be considered and submitted for R V P approval if certain milestones are reached
during the second extension. With this set-up, and particularly in the event that the
privatization o f SamoaTel was not proceeding as planned, the Bank would be in a
position to close the Credit in October 2010 (instead o f April 201 1 as was requested by
the government).

11.   The proposed milestones to be reached by August 3 1,20 10 (that is, within 10
months o f the second extension) are:

    0   Recruitment o f a transaction advisor through competitive bidding;
        Completion o f due diligence pertaining to SamoaTel (financial, technical and
        operational organization);
        Completion o f a draft information memorandum (together with the publication o f
        selection criteria and the transaction timetable);
        Opening o f data room for prospective investors so they can access relevant
        information and documents o f the enterprise being privatized; and
        Launch o f tendedselection process for the offering for sale o f SamoaTel.

12.     Part D o f the project (related to the postal activities under SamoaTel)2 i s now fully
implemented and will not be covered under the extension. It will close on the current
Closing Date (October 15, 2009). The extension will therefore cover: Part A
(Competition and Sector Reform), Part B (Regulatory Framework), Part C (Corporate
Reform o f SamoaTel), and Part E (Project Management Support) as such Parts o f the
Project are described in Schedule 2 to the D C A .


 The split of the telecommunication and postal business units was undertaken in September
2008.

    Changes in the Results Framework

     14.     The performance indicators framework in the PAD, while reflecting adequately
    the objectives set for the project, contains milestones rather than quantifiable indicators
    that would allow an adequate monitoring o f project implementation. Also, between 2002
    and today, the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) format followed by IDA has evolved
    and the proposed changes aim at following this latest framework (the "results
    framework"). The project's initial M&E framework follows the log frame model (in
    application in 2002) that focuses on outcomeshmpact indicators and outputs by
    components, whereas the results framework uses a slightly different terminology,
    respectively project development objective outcomes and intermediate outcomes. W h i l e
    aides-memoire tracked the seven key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the P A D
    (which were reduced to five after the July 2007 mission), ISRs have tracked the two
    outcome indicators (number of telecommunication customers: fixed and mobile; number
    o f Internet clients) and only one output indicator related to the Component 1 o f the
    project (amendments to the telecommunications law approved by cabinet) out o f the 14
    defined in the P A D (and this only since 2007). However, out o f those 14 output
    indicators only one i s quantified-and it i s virtually impossible to m ~ n i t o r . ~

16.     From the beginning o f the project, updating the indicators has been challenging:

        The telecommunication indicators related to fixed-line subscribers has not been a
        problem, however data on mobile subscribers have shown discrepancies
        depending on the source o f information (operators, regulator or line ministry).
        The Internet indicator i s by far the most difficult to track; from one supervision
        mission to the next and from one source to another, numbers provided are
        inconsistent.
        The postal indicators have also caused problems as there are no sector-wide data
        collected by the line ministry, hence the data are restrictively related to the postal
        activities o f SamoaTel (which became SamoaPost in September 2008) excluding
        private operators. The KPIs on "quality o f service" and "number o f inhabitants
        per full postal service outlet" were dropped because: (a) the quality o f service
        survey should ideally be outsourced, but neither SamoaPost nor the line ministry
        has shown determination to do so, hence the data provided by SamoaPost are
        considered to be biased; and (b) the "number o f inhabitants per full postal service

         outlet" indicator was considered redundant, having become less illustrative than
         the other indicator o f access ("number o f post office mail boxes per 100
         inhabitants").

17.     In summary, telecommunication penetration has far outpaced the original
objective o f doubling the number o f subscribers (Annex 1). With the introduction o f a
second mobile operator, the number o f subscribers increased eight-fold. Comparatively,
Internet penetration has progressed moderately, but based on some recent policy
orientation (in particular, to develop Internet access in school and community centers,
and, more importantly, to allow high-speed Internet rollout), the forecasts are positive.
The postal indicators have illustrated a decline in postal volume that was not anticipated
at the beginning o f the project but reflects a world-wide trend that, in a small-island
economy, i s accentuated despite the numerous activities in the project supporting the
postal sector. Access to postal services remains a priority for the government as
expressed in the postal bill that i s about to be submitted to Parliament.

Action Plan

18.     The team and the Borrower agreed o n an action plan for the duration o f the
project in order to complete the remaining activities (including newly-defined). Close
monitoring and support will continue to ensure the successful timely completion o f the
privatization transaction, the regulatory capacity building and the activities related to e-
Government.

ANALYSIS

19.     The proposed changes will not bring significant changes to the original economic,
financial, technical, institutional and social aspects o f the project. The main shift o f
support benefits the regulatory framework and institutional capacity building, while
SamoaPost benefits from less support. SamoaPost has performed remarkably well in
2009, however the future i s uncertain but the Government i s keen at providing adequate
support to this state owned enterprise.

20.    The existing project implementation arrangements including fiduciary will not
change with the restructuring. The proposed restructuring does not raise the
environmental category o f the project nor does it trigger new safeguard policies. The
restructuring does not trigger any exception to Bank policies.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES

21.  The proposed restructuring will not affect the PDO or the key outcome indicators.
However, the intermediate outcome indicators have been revised to allow for adequate
monitoring o f project implementation.

BENEFITS AND R I S K S

22.      The changes will bring marginally positive improvements to the project and are
associated with l o w risks. The project team and the P M U are monitoring closely the
implementation o f the project and will focus on the procurement and other project
management issues that have delayed the implementation o f the project. Whereas
procurement activities have contributed to delays in the past (due to the slow preparation
o f terms o f reference, loose compliance with procurement processes leading to several
back-and-forth communications before clearances were granted, delays in drafting
evaluation reports due to the (frequent) unavailable evaluation committee members, etc.),
the Borrower's capacity has improved over the years, and the remaining procurement
activities are less complex, with one large strategic technical assistance which retains the
government's full attention and i s led by the best-performing implementing agency
(Ministry o f Finance), and several small technical assistance activities that will be easier
to manage.
