Lessons learned include the following: Government\n            commitment to reform over the entire project duration was a\n            critical success factor.  Initially there was resistance\n            from some ministries, however, unwavering support enabled\n            the Ministry of Finance to achieve the transition. The\n            Government's ability to staff the project team with\n            competent and dedicated staff was critical during the\n            testing and implementation phases.  Functional and\n            procedural changes were the major drivers of the reform. The\n            technological changes, though the most capital intensive,\n            supported the functional reforms. A decision to go for an\n            interim computer system to handle core aspects of treasury\n            functionality enabled the introduction of change in a\n            gradual and a more manageable manner. Close project\n            monitoring and advice rendered by the Bank and IMF was\n            important.  The requirements for the inclusion of\n            appropriately qualified technical staff in the project team\n            needs to be recognized in the Bank.  The time needed to\n            introduce change at the very basis of budget execution needs\n            to be recognized in planning similar projects.  Low\n            government pay scales continue to be a crucial impediment to\n            attracting and retaining qualified technical staff"}, "docdt": "2003-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
