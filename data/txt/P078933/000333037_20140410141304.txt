F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
(As stated in the Financing Agreement) The objectives of the Project are to support the Recipient's
Program: (a) to improve quality of learning conditions for students; (b) to increase enrollment of students in
general secondary education; and (c) to initiate higher education reform.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO in the FA was not revised. However, as a result of the March 2012 project restructuring, the PDO
in the project documents was aligned, including in the PAD and FA.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Albania had successfully built the foundations of a market-based economy, created democratic
institutions, and gradually strengthened the public administration since the economic and political
transition in the early 1990s. Per capita GDP increased rapidly, from US$1,340 in 2001 to US$2,590 in
2005. Membership in the European Union (EU), Albania’s largest trading partner, had been a long-term
vision in the country with widespread popular and political support. However, despite rapid economic
growth, widespread poverty, high unemployment, wide regional disparities, and corruption remained as
daunting challenges.

2.       Education outcomes and performance within the education sector was recognized as a key
determinant of Albania’s future competitiveness and economic growth. The sector was characterized by
low educational attainment (8.6 years of schooling, lagging behind neighboring countries and almost 6
years below the EU average), low enrollment in secondary education (50% on average, 25% in rural
areas), and poor performance in reading, mathematics, and science on the Programme for International
Student Assessment (PISA) 2000. To systematically address these and other sector-wide issues, Albania
developed the National Education Strategy 2004-2015 (NES) for pre-university education. The NES
focuses on four priority areas, including: (i) governance – reforming and strengthening management
capacity, (ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, (iii) financing pre-university
education, and (iv) capacity building and human resource development. The World Bank had been
engaged in the education sector in Albania since 1994, with the first School Rehabilitation and Capacity
Building Project (1994-2000) and the subsequent Education Reform Project (2000-2004). The Bank had
also supported education policies through three Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) in 2002,
2003, and 2004. The Education Excellence and Equity Project (EEEP) was designed to build on past
experience and expand operational support for Albania’s comprehensive education reform program.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

3.      The PDO as stated in the Financing Agreement is as follows: the objectives of the Project are to
support the Recipient’s Program: (a) to improve quality of learning conditions for students; (b) to
increase enrollment of students in general secondary education; and (c) to initiate higher education
reform. There is a wording disparity of the PDO in the Financing Agreement compared with two
sections of the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) (main text and results framework). The three versions
of the PDO and the corresponding key indicators are shown in the table below.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

4.      The project was restructured in March 2012 to align the wording of the PDO in the PAD with that
of the Financing Agreement. The 2012 restructuring paper noted that although the two versions of the
PDO were consistent, the Financing Agreement’s PDO better captured project activities and would be
used for project reports.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

5.      The EEEP was intended to support the implementation of NES 2004-15 and have nationwide
coverage at the basic, secondary, and tertiary levels, thus all students, teachers, and administrators
benefited from the project. No specific groups of target beneficiaries were identified in the PAD.

1.5 Original Components

6.      The project encompassed the following four components (“priority areas”):

(i)     Strengthening leadership, management and governance of the education system (US$10
million). This component aimed to strengthen the leadership and management capacities, and to enhance
governance and accountability of the education system. This included activities associated with
decentralization, strengthening leadership, professional development of school principals, decision
making and resource management at the school level, increasing the communities’ participation,
introduction of performance-based management, and full utilization of the Education Management
Information System (EMIS) for decision making. Decentralized service delivery was expected to be
piloted in 2-3 regions before deciding on a rollout plan in order to form an institutional foundation to
address other priority areas.

(ii)     Improving conditions for teaching and learning (US$26 million). This component focused on
improving quality of teaching and learning conditions in a holistic manner. Special attention would be
paid to support teachers’ professional development to enable them to use more effective teaching methods
in their classrooms. It would also address the issues of curriculum reform, including the development of a
national curriculum framework, rationalization of subjects, integration and textbook development. To
implement curriculum reform, teacher education policies and practices would be closely aligned. The
development of assessment and evaluation of education would continue through strengthening the
capacity of the National Assessment and Examination Center, development of a national plan for
evaluation in education, and improving the transparency and integrity of the national Matura examination
system. This component would enable teachers and students to use a wider range of appropriate
educational tools and methods in teaching and learning processes.

(iii)   Improving and rationalizing education infrastructure, especially in secondary education
(US$32 million). This component was designed to address more efficient investment and (re)allocation
in physical infrastructure and human resources especially at the secondary education level. It would
support the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) in making investment decisions based on school
mapping, which takes into consideration the demographic development in Albania. Science laboratories



                                                    2
and information and communication technology (ICT) facilities would be provided to general secondary
schools in line with the new curriculum and teacher training to be supported in Component 2.

(iv)    Setting the stage for higher education reform (US$7 million). This component focused on
supporting the initial stages of higher education reform. It supported the MoES and universities to carry
out a review of the system to identify and sequence reform activities, which include strengthening of
university governance, increasing financial autonomy and accountability of universities, strengthening the
quality assurance mechanism, and promoting university partnership arrangements. It would also support
the development and implementation of the strategic development plan of key universities, as well as
expand the opportunities for students by mobilizing private financing and provision and making the use of
public resources more efficient.

1.6 Revised Components

7.      Component 3 was always intended to include minor civil works, though it was revised to include
new construction. This led to implementation delays which required other significant changes to the
project (see Section 1.7 below). The other components remained unchanged throughout the lifetime of
the operation.

1.7 Other significant changes

8.     The project was initially approved by Bank management in June 2006 and became effective in
October 2006. The project was expected to close in December 2010. The project was restructured twice
throughout the seven years it was active and the project closing date was extended three times, to June 30,
2013. The restructurings are summarized below.

9.      Level 1 Restructuring. Approved by the Board in March 2010, this restructuring amended the
legal documents to allow new school construction and to reflect that the operational safeguards policy on
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) had been triggered (see Section 2.4).

10.      One-Year Extension of the Closing Date. In October 2010, the Country Director approved a
one-year extension of the closing date, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. This was
primarily to compensate for the 23-months it took to resolve the safeguards issues noted above, during
which time civil works activities, which ultimately accounted for 49% of total project cost, were put on
hold pending completion of corresponding safeguards due diligence and subsequent approval of
restructuring.1

11.     Three-Month Extension of the Closing Date. In December 2011, the Country Director
approved a three-month extension, from December 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012, in order to allow for the
processing of a Level 1 restructuring.

12.       Level 1 Restructuring. Approved by the Board in March 2012, this restructuring was introduced
to: (i) realign the wording of the PDO in the PAD with that of the Financing Agreement; (ii) extend the
closing date by 15 months, from March 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013, to enable civil works and other key
activities to be completed; and (iii) to reallocate the proceeds across the project’s four components to
reflect progress to date, as well as expected activities over the remaining 15 months. For example,


1
 Although the Bank preferred a 24-month extension, the decision was taken to seek a 12-month extension due to the
pooled funding nature of the project and the co-financiers’ stated restrictions on granting extensions longer than 12
months. However, both co-financiers ultimately granted extensions longer than 12 months.


                                                         3
Component 2 (improving conditions for teaching and learning) was reduced from 34.7% of total
financing to 4.6%, largely due to problems with rolling out the school improvement process, particularly
the school grants. On the other hand, Component 3 (improving and rationalizing education infrastructure)
was increased from 42.7% of financing to 79.6%, partially due to the lingering deficits in school
infrastructure and to the difference between the original allocation to this component and actual costs.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Strengths

13.      The PDO was relevant and important for national and sectoral goals. The PDO specifically
identified improved quality of learning conditions for all students and increased enrollment in secondary
education as clear and realistic objectives that aligned with the Government’s NES and that furthered
goals articulated in the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY06-09. The project design also
incorporated lessons learned from prior CASs, including the creation of long-lasting and effective
institutions by shifting away from autonomous Project Implementation Units (PIUs); the incorporation of
investment lending into a Sector-Wide Approach; and the provision of support to areas with high poverty
rates, all three of which are identified in the CAS FY06-09. The project design also benefited from
strong technical analysis conducted through the development of the NES. The technical analysis
identified and targeted major constraints in the sector, especially low enrollment in secondary education,
low educational attainment compared with neighboring countries and the EU, poor learning outcomes,
substantial regional variations, and governance challenges related to ongoing decentralization process.

14.     There was also clear rationale for Bank involvement given that the Bank had been involved in
the education sector in Albania since 1994, and each subsequent operation built on the lessons of the prior
operation. At preparation, the Bank was one of the few, and the largest, development partners supporting
the education sector in Albania, and it had a key role in supporting the Government as it embarked on the
ambitious reform agenda detailed in the NES.

15.      The first operation of its kind in Albania, the EEEP benefited from a strategically relevant and
innovative approach. The EEEP was a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) project2 designed using a pooled
funding modality, in which the government and three donors3 pooled resources (totaling US$75 million)
to support the implementation of a larger sector program laid out in the NES. The EEEP was expected to
fill the gaps between the projected expenditure level by the Medium-Term Budget Framework and the
annual education budget for 3-4 years. The PAD describes this modality as a sector-wide approach
(SWAp) and though in practice it operated more as a pooled fund, it did provide greater flexibility to
changing country conditions and helped to coordinate institutions at the central, regional, and local levels.
The EEEP’s administrative, fiduciary, and safeguards procedures were streamlined under the World
Bank’s management, which minimized the Government’s burden to comply with multiple donors’ rules
and procedures. The pooled funding modality also facilitated coordination and synergies among the
Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the World Bank
(IDA), and simplified the work of the MoES. This design also allowed the World Bank to leverage its

  The terms “EEEP” and “the project” are used interchangeably in this ICR. In both cases, the terms refer to the full
project value of US$75 million, and this ICR assesses results achieved using the full amount.
3
  The CEB, EIB, and IDA each committed US$15 million, while the Government committed US$30 million for
EEEP.


                                                          4
US$15 million financial contribution to achieve the outcomes described in Section 3.2. However, the
pooled funding modality also resulted in high supervision costs for the World Bank (see Section 6).

16.     The project was designed and prepared with a high level of government commitment, evidenced
by the NES and the Government’s commitment of US$30 million of its own resources.4 The project was
designed to rely heavily on MoES staff and structures, as well as country financial management and
procurement systems, further indicating a high level of ownership from the Government and the MoES in
particular.

Weaknesses

17.     The project design was ambitious, especially given the weak capacity among implementing
agencies. The PAD acknowledged that even with mitigation measures, there was substantial risk that the
overall project was ambitious to manage and implement. The MoES had no previous experience with a
pooled fund, and without a PIU, the MoES would implement the program within its existing structure.
Even with an additional 2.5 years of implementation time, the project was not able to accomplish all of its
goals. This was compounded by weak institutional capacity among implementing agencies, especially
municipalities.

18.     The project design failed to include new school construction as a potential investment area,
resulting in retroactive and thus more time consuming efforts to address environmental and social
safeguards concerns. The original project documents only envisaged that civil works would consist of
minor works for rehabilitation, renovation, and extensions to existing schools on existing school property.
In June 2008, when the Bank informed the MoES that the Financing Agreement did not allow for new
school construction, the MoES expressed its desire for the EEEP to support new school construction. If
this desire had been explicitly captured during design and preparation, the extensive implementation
delays resulting from restructuring and the need to comply with Involuntary Resettlement Safeguards
could have been avoided.

2.2 Implementation

Factors outside the Control of Government or Implementing Agencies

19.      Project implementation, and specifically the construction of new schools, was affected by the late
triggering of the World Bank’s safeguards policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The project was
restructured through a two-year long process, protracted due to limited government capacity and
heightened sensitivity within the Bank to safeguards issues in Albania following the ICZMCP project.5
The delays had a negative impact on the co-financiers, who were required to put their programs on hold
for nearly two years, and on the MoES, which had finally begun to establish the structure and capacity
needed to implement the EEEP.

Factors Generally Subject to Government Control

20.    The project benefited from continued government commitment throughout the life of the project.
Education remained a priority of the government throughout the implementation period, and the MoES


4
  Although actual expenditure of the Government’s funds for the EEEP varied from year to year, the Government
ultimately contributed 36% of total project resources, while the three co-financiers each contributed approximately
21% of total project resources.

undertook additional reforms to improve the system in parallel with the EEEP. Starting in 2011, the
Albanian economy was adversely affected by the Eurozone crisis, leading to budgetary ceilings on
foreign financing imposed by the Ministry of Finance. Because they were set significantly lower than
planned disbursements, the ceilings resulted in disbursement delays and arrears related to project-financed
activities. Payment of arrears was prioritized in subsequent years, which led to cancellation of several
planned activities. However, the ceilings were imposed across the board as part of the Government’s
fiscal management in reaction to the Eurozone crisis and its effect on economic growth, budget revenues,
and public debt levels.

Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Controls

21.      The MoES remained committed to the EEEP, though changes in MoES leadership inevitably
led to some implementation delays. Under the leadership of three different Ministers between 2006 and
2013, the MoES took high-level leadership with respect to reform areas including textbooks and
curriculum for basic/secondary education, as well as higher education reform and university governance.
Throughout the life of the project, the MoES also successfully led regular semi-annual review meetings
on EEEP activities, outcomes, and goals. However, other agreed upon intervention areas, such as the
school grants program, were neglected and eventually the program was untenable given the time horizon
of the EEEP.

22.      Limited capacity within the MOES to manage the project and hold municipalities responsible
for project outcomes resulted in implementation constraints and delays. The EEEP contained many
disparate activities that needed to merge into a comprehensive and coherent set of investments and
outcomes. Initial limited capacity explains several significant implementation delays (e.g. slow
development and rollout of EMIS, lack of standardized school construction designs), though the MoES
had persistent challenges in allocating and engaging competent staff dedicated to the project. As a result,
the MoES relied on technical assistance which did result in safeguards compliance, greater fiduciary
capacity, and progress towards higher education reform. The MoES also lacked (and still lacks)
enforcement mechanisms to hold municipalities accountable for their roles and responsibilities (see
Section 5.2). This led to non-compliance with civil works designs and to serious quality and safety
concerns in several schools. For example, multiple schools lacked fire escape staircases and other safety
measures, and the Shkodra school lacked an external door to access the ramp for disabled students. Other
issues included persistent roof leakages (Kol Koci primary school in Pogradec) and lacking electrical
connections (Bajram Curri basic school in Durres). Though some of these issues were resolved before the
project closed, the Mar Lulaj School in Shkodra and the Keneta Secondary School in Durres were still not
operational as of January 2014.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

23.    M&E Design. The PDO indicators included in the results framework for the EEEP are
inadequate for measuring progressing towards the PDO, either due to lack of relevance or precision.
These are described in Table 2 below. There are also some disconnects between intermediate indicators
and PDO indicators. See Section 3.2 for a discussion on more appropriate PDO indicators.

Table 2. Review of Key Performance Indicators
Sub-PDO 1        Improve quality of learning conditions for students
KPI 1: Basic education dropout rate. This indicator is a measure of internal efficiency rather than a measure of
the quality of learning conditions. Other indicators that measure the conditions of the classroom environment
would have been more appropriate, including percentage of students using revised textbooks, percentage of schools
with new/upgraded facilities, or percentage of teachers who have received training.
KPI 2: Level of teachers’ satisfaction in their working conditions. This KPI was intended to serve as a proxy



                                                        6
measure for teacher effectiveness based on the rationale that job satisfaction is correlated with a teacher’s level of
commitment and productivity. There is a plausible relationship between teacher effectiveness and the quality of
student learning conditions (sub-PDO 1), though this particular KPI is a weak measure of teacher effectiveness.
Teachers’ satisfaction in their working conditions is a subjective measure that incorporates environmental and
normative factors associated with one’s personal feeling about his or her work. However, teacher effectiveness is
difficult to measure, so supplemental indicators would have been useful, e.g. the percentage of instructional time
on task or the percentage of teachers successfully using new teaching methods acquired through professional
development activities. However, data for these indicators are not available.
Sub-PDO 2        Increase enrollment of students in general secondary education
KPI 3: Progression rate from basic education (9 years) to secondary education, by region.
KPI 4: Secondary education enrollment rate, disaggregated by region and income groups. Although the
Results Framework failed to define enrollment as gross or net, the Education System Performance Indicators
included in the PAD documented net enrollment. The MoES reports on both gross and net enrollment. However,
both indicators of sub-PDO 2 measure rates at the national level. Indicators measuring progression and enrollment
in schools supported directly by the EEEP would have been more appropriate measures allowing results to be
attributed to project interventions.
Sub-PDO 3        Initiate higher education reform
No KPI related to higher education reform was included at project design or was added when the project was
restructured. However, three intermediate indicators were included and targets for all three indicators were either
met or surpassed (see Section 3.2 and Annex 2).

24.      M&E Implementation. The MoES demonstrated growth in M&E capacity throughout
implementation of the EEEP. The MoES now provides monitoring reports on a regular basis, and the
Annual Reform Program (ARP) semi-annual reviews provided opportunities to review progress on
project indicators as well as education sector indicators. However, the lack of baseline data at project
preparation phase delayed M&E implementation and utilization. For KPI 2, baseline data was not
available until December 2008, after the teachers’ satisfaction survey was conducted. For KPIs 1 and 3,
baseline data was not available until November 2009. Furthermore, the values for some indicators,
especially KPI 1, are debatable because they fall far below international norms.6

25.     M&E Utilization. Although M&E capacity has grown within the MoES, the quality of analysis
remains weak, with too great a focus on counting inputs and outputs with little linkage to outcomes. In
some cases, indicators were not produced and verified quickly enough to influence development of the
ARPs. Furthermore, the MoES failed to utilize M&E data to assess cost effectiveness and efficiency of
investments. The project supported a spectrum of interventions that were considered necessary for
improving learning effectiveness, though M&E data has not been used to conduct a more robust
evaluation of the project’s impacts.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

26.      The project remained compliant with the Environmental Assessment Safeguards Policy
(OP/BP 4.01) throughout the EEEP implementation period.                       Based on anticipated minor
reconstruction and rehabilitation of school facilities identified during preparation, the project triggered the
Environmental Assessment safeguards policy and was classified as Environmental Category ‘B’. Once it
was determined that the MoES intended for the EEEP to support new school construction, the project was
restructured accordingly in 2010. The restructured project remained classified as Category ‘B’ since any

 The MoES reported a basic education dropout rate for 2005-2006 of 0.94%. EdStats reports the primary education
dropout rate for 2006 at 6.1%, which is comparable to other countries in the region (6.7% in Romania, 5.9% in
Bulgaria, 3.8% in Moldova, 2.5% in Macedonia). 0.94% is below most countries in ECA and the regional average
primary education dropout rate of 3.9%.


                                                           7
potential environmental impacts of new school construction were site-specific and deemed reversible.
Site visits indicated that some municipalities lagged behind in the implementation of their duties related
to safeguards compliance, though none of these issues required discontinuation of civil works.

27.     The project was non-compliant with the Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard Policy (OP/BP
4.12) at several points throughout the implementation period. In large part, this was due to recurrent
land and property ownership issues in Albania. Although a land reform process has been ongoing since
the transition, major problems remained including unresolved conflicting claims to land and properties,
and illegal land subdivisions and construction projects.7 These issues persistently detrimentally affected
implementation, and are described in detail in Annex 10.

28.      Financial Management. Financial management (FM) arrangements and capacity within the
MoES improved over the course of the project. FM risks were properly identified, though mitigation
measures were at times inadequate. There were delays in fully implementing the fiduciary capacity
building plan, specifically the recruitment of technical assistance to work alongside MoES project
financial specialists. The international FM consultant hired initially as part of the capacity building plan
had finished his contract as of the mid-term review, but given the observed poor state of FM controls, it
was concluded that the consultant’s work was insufficient to meet the agreements of the FM capacity
building plan. The project also experienced some delays in the transfer of funds from the Designated
Account held at the Bank of Albania to the Treasury Account for implementation of the agreed ARP.
Improved internal guidance from the Ministry of Finance/Treasury was required to streamline the timing
of the transfer of funds and financial information to the MoES. Finally, for several years following
project effectiveness, the project utilized an inadequate accounting and internal financial reporting system
based on Excel spreadsheets. It was anticipated at appraisal that the Single Treasury System would be
deployed to line ministries including the MoES, but this was delayed. The MoES addressed this problem
by installing customized budget accounting and financial reporting software to meet the size and needs
of the EEEP while also replacing the Excel-based system which had been subject to human error.

29.      Procurement. Procurement arrangements for the EEEP were sufficient and risks were properly
identified. A combination of training, technical assistance, and exposure to different procurement
methods strengthened the procurement capacity of the MoES, the universities, the Institute for Education
Development (IED), and the Public Agency for Accreditation in Higher Education (APAAL). To a
limited extent, procurement capacity in the municipalities has increased, though the project’s goal to
improve fiduciary capacity at the local level to reach international levels was unrealistic, since most
municipalities led no more than three procurement processes throughout the project. In general,
procurement procedures complied with the Bank’s Procurement and Consultant Guidelines. Payment
delays to some contractors and suppliers in the last two years of implementation, resulting from lack of
budget allocation from the MoES, threatened project implementation, but these issues were resolved. The
most notable procurement challenge was the failure to procure computer labs, after three unsuccessful
attempts, for the 22 schools constructed by the project.

30.      Legal Covenants. The MoES complied with the four legal covenants stipulated. Delays in
complying with covenants resulted from delays in filling MoES staff and consulting positions, especially
the international FM specialist position.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.      The Government of Albania has expressed interest in a follow-up operation. The nature of this
operation is not yet determined, though it will be based on the new Government’s priorities for 2013-2017.
The Bank is preparing a series of analytical products in the education sector and will facilitate a
stakeholder consultation forum for the new operation. At the pre-university level, one option is to focus
on areas that were not addressed in the EEEP, including early childhood education and school readiness
interventions, as well as a more comprehensive system for teacher development and training. At the
tertiary level, another option is to build on the successes of higher education governance and management
reform by focusing on improvements in quality and relevance. See Annex 3 for a discussion on
alternative investments for a subsequent operation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

32.     The project’s relevance rating is considered to be substantial.

33.      Relevance of Objectives: High. Improving the quality of learning conditions, increasing
enrollment in general secondary education, and reforming higher education continue to be major priorities
in Albania. The EEEP and its ARPs were fully aligned with the NES 2004-2015, which remains the
guiding strategy for the sector. The Pre-University Law, passed with support provided by the EEEP,
supports decentralization, school autonomy, and per capita funding mechanisms which address NES
priorities for strengthening governance and improving financing for pre-university education. The NES
also prioritizes improvements to the teaching and learning process with specific reference to curriculum
and textbook development, introduction of ICTs into classrooms, development of an EMIS, and
improvements in the national examinations system, all of which were directly supported by the EEEP.
The EEEP also addresses a strategic objective of the Albania Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2011-
2014: to broaden and sustain social gains by improving education services. The CPS acknowledges that
“in education, the key challenge faced by the Government of Albania is to improve quality at all levels
while also improving access, particularly for secondary and higher education…” Improved quality at all
levels is embodied in the EEEP’s objective to improve the quality of learning conditions (defined in
Section 3.2), based on the rationale that quality learning conditions are a prerequisite for improved
education quality. Improved access to secondary education is an explicit goal of the EEEP, and the
project’s third objective, to initiate higher education reform, also remains relevant as a precursor to
increased access and improved quality at the tertiary level.

34.     Relevance of Design: Modest. The EEEP was designed to support and utilize country systems
while providing the Government with necessary flexibility to changing conditions. Albania’s External
Assistance Orientation Document, which articulates the country’s development strategy that drove the
CPS 2011-2014, called for the “World Bank to continue its leadership and build on the sector wide
approach that has been started in education.” However, design shortcomings in the PDO and results
framework make it challenging to measure the project’s achievements and to distinguish them from
higher sector-level outcomes. These shortcomings include disconnects between the PDO and PDO
indicators, disconnects between intermediate indicators and PDO indicators, lack of baseline data,
discrepancy in PDO language between the PAD and legal documents, and failure to include new
construction at the time of appraisal.

    3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

    35.     During the period of EEEP implementation, Albania witnessed impressive improvements in the
    education sector. The basic education dropout rate declined from 0.94% to 0.37%8 and the secondary
    education net enrollment rate increased from 55.3% to 80%. Results of the 2009 and 2012 PISA
    assessments indicate major improvements since 2000, especially in reading, with a strong spike of
    improvement since 2009.9 Reading scores improved from 349 in 2000 to 385 in 2009 to 394 in 2012.
    Functional illiteracy dropped from 56.7% in 2009 to 52.3% in 2012; innumeracy also declined from
    67.7% to 60.7% from 2009 to 2012.

    36.      Although the EEEP is likely to be a contributing factor to achievements observed during this
    period, this ICR can only reflect those achievements that are clearly attributed to the EEEP. Taking into
    account the assessment of all three sub-objectives, all of which were equally important, the project’s
    overall efficacy rating is considered to be substantial. Despite weaknesses in the Results Framework
    (see Section 2.3), all four PDO indicators were achieved. Of the 14 intermediate indicators, eight
    indicators fully met or surpassed their targets, two partially met their targets, and four were not achieved
    (see Annex 2). The table below portrays the efficacy ratings for each of the project’s sub-objectives, as
    well as the correspondence between the sub-objectives and the components.

    Sub-PDO 1: To improve the quality of learning conditions for students.

    37.     Because the reference to “teaching conditions” was included in the PAD Results Framework, and
    because “the level of teachers’ satisfaction in their working conditions” was selected as a key indicator for
    sub-PDO 1, this ICR infers that improving the quality of teaching conditions was part of this sub-
    objective, even though it was not explicitly stated. For assessing this sub-objective, “learning conditions”
    are defined as the pedagogical and physical classroom environment in which teaching and learning take
    place.

    38.     The project’s achievement in relation to improving the quality of learning conditions for students
    is considered to be substantial. Classroom environments improved as a direct result of activities
    supported under Components 1, 2, and 3 of the EEEP (see table above). In terms of the pedagogical
    aspects of the classroom environment, the project had an impact on improving teachers’ satisfaction in

their working conditions (see Section 2.3 for an explanation of the relationship between this indicator and
learning conditions). In 2008, 29% of teachers expressed high satisfaction, 57% expressed moderate
satisfaction, and 14% expressed a low level of satisfaction. These figures increased to 39% high, 48%
moderate, and 13% low by 2011. Although wage increases10 (not supported by the EEEP) were identified
as an important aspect affecting the overall level of job satisfaction among teachers, other top factors
include improvement of working conditions, reduction in number of pupils in classes, enrichment of
didactic materials, and school infrastructure, all of which were supported by the EEEP.11 During the ICR
mission, the Bank team met with teachers and school administrators in 7 different basic and secondary
schools, and all consistently reported satisfaction with the new student-centered curriculum and training
(see Annex 5). Indeed, between 2007 and 2011, the share of teachers that reported satisfaction with the
relevance of the curriculum increased from 50% to 75%. Teachers did receive cascade training on the
new curricula, though the continuous teacher professional development system that was envisioned in the
project design was not launched. This poses a risk to the expected impact and sustainability of this
intervention (see Section 4).

39.      In terms of the physical classroom environment, the EEEP supported a civil works program
through which 22 schools (15 basic, 7 upper secondary) were constructed or rehabilitated, benefiting
approximately 18,479 students.12 The civil works program also had an impact (though modest, given the
relatively small number of schools) on improving the quality of learning conditions by providing updated
classroom infrastructure in 22 schools and by reducing overcrowding in areas served by those schools.
Multiple shift schools decreased from 36% to 13.9% for basic education schools and from 15% to 5.6%
for secondary schools; triple shift schools were eliminated. This can be attributed in part to the EEEP’s
civil works program. Between 2007 and 2013, average class sizes decreased across all education levels.
In upper secondary schools, class sizes decreased from 36 to 32 pupils (and in Tirana prefecture, from 42
to 35) and from 27 to 25 in lower secondary schools. During the field visits, teachers and administrators
noted that the improvements in school infrastructure had an impact on improving classroom environments
for learning (see Annex 5). Although EEEP schools had some structural deficiencies, these were minor
compared with non-renovated schools where the heavy rains had caused flooding and overflowing
sewage.

40.      The achievement of sub-PDO 1 is further substantiated by the many outputs that resulted from the
project, as listed in Annex 2. As of 2009, all primary and basic schools are using an updated curriculum
and new textbooks, benefiting approximately 440,000 students across the country. All general upper
secondary schools have adopted revised curriculum which was implemented over a full three-year cycle
from 2009-2011, benefiting another 121,000 students approximately. Students’ access to computers was
increased substantially due to the EEEP; nearly 1,500 computer labs were installed in schools, including
over 24,000 computers and over 1,100 virtual labs. In urban areas, the student-computer ratio decreased
from 46 to 14, and in rural areas, the ratio decreased from 133 to 13. Two thousand basic and secondary
schools were also provided access to the internet. Approximately 700 physics, chemistry, and biology
labs were procured and installed in basic and secondary schools. Despite the fact that the school grants
program was not launched as expected, the passage of the Pre-University Law in 2012 introduced a
number of school-level institutional reforms that are expected to improve the quality of teaching and

   Indirect beneficiaries include students who attend nearby existing schools and now have smaller class sizes,
though the total number of indirect beneficiaries is unknown. In Lezhe, after the Beslidhja Basic Education School
was built, at least 500 students continued to attend the old school which now has improved conditions due to smaller
class sizes. See Annex 5.

learning conditions. For example, in secondary schools, teachers have far greater autonomy to select their
subject areas, and students can now decide which elective subjects to take for the Matura exam. Primary
school teachers also have autonomy on deciding on the content of the “free” hours in basic education, and
teachers and principals can now make decisions regarding teaching materials and complementary books,
on the basis of the per-student formula. Finally, the project also strengthened the culture of measuring
learning outcomes by ensuring continued implementation of the State Matura exam as well as the
successful completion of PISA in 2009 and 2012.

41.      Critical data needed to attribute achievement of this sub-objective to the EEEP interventions (e.g.
time on task, extent to which teachers are implementing the new curriculum, or changes in classroom
behavior by teachers) are not available. Incomplete data and the failure to launch some interventions as
expected represent shortcomings which curb the project’s efficacy with relation to sub-PDO 1, despite the
fact that achievement of this sub-objective is considered to be substantial.

Sub-PDO 2: To increase enrollment of students in general secondary education.

42.     Enrollment in general secondary education improved, due in part to the EEEP. The targets for
both of the key indicators for sub-PDO 2 were surpassed. The net enrollment rate increased from 55.3%
in 2006 (baseline) to 80% in 2011, according to MoES estimates. The gross enrollment ratio increased
substantially, from 68% in 2006 (baseline) to 91% in 2011. However, a better indicator for the EEEP is
the change in enrollment in the 7 secondary schools supported by the EEEP’s civil works program. In
these schools, enrollment did increase from 4,453 in 2006 to 7,038 in 2012 according to MoES data.

43.      The EEEP did meet both of the key outcome indicators for sub-PDO 2 and enrollment in the
secondary schools supported by the project did increase. However, the Government led a large parallel
capital investment program financed from the MoES budget which had a much larger impact on
enrollment. In total, the EEEP supported only 22 of 1,174 schools (2%) that were built or rehabilitated in
Albania between 2006 and 2012. The EEEP also supported the development and installation of network
infrastructure (computer hardware and software) required to implement the School Infrastructure
Mapping System (SIMS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) module, both intended to support
decision making regarding geographical positioning of educational facilities and infrastructure needs.
Although this is expected to inform any decisions about school infrastructure going forward, it was not in
place until 2012 and there is little evidence indicating its actual implementation. Furthermore, there was a
clear trend of increasing enrollment in secondary education before the project started. In fact, gross
enrollment increased by 22.3% in the period before the EEEP, compared with 20% during EEEP
implementation. Increased enrollment can be attributed to the EEEP only in the 7 secondary schools
which benefited from the project’s civil works program, so the achievement with relation to sub-PDO 2 is
considered to be modest.

Sub-PDO 3: To initiate higher education reform.

44.     The EEEP’s achievements with relation to sub-PDO 3 are considered to be high. The EEEP
advanced far beyond initial expectations in the area of higher education reform. The EEEP supported the
introduction of several reforms in higher education, initially through the development and implementation
of a Higher Education Reform Action Plan and ultimately the Higher Education Strategy 2013-2020. The
strategy underwent significant consultations with stakeholders as well as international experts. The
MoES advanced financing reforms in higher education with the development of a revised funding formula
as well as a student loan scheme that has been agreed upon with the Ministry of Finance. The Public
Agency for Accreditation of Higher Education was restructured. Five EMIS modules for higher
education were developed and all higher education students were enrolled online for the 2012-2013
academic year. Standards for higher education institutions were prepared and used to launch a Higher


                                                    12
Education Program Ranking Initiative. Laboratory equipment was purchased and distributed to 12 (of 15)
public universities. All universities in Albania have established external governing boards, surpassing the
50% target set for the project. All universities also have developed strategic plans. Although no key
outcome indicators were included at design or restructuring, the EEEP met or surpassed all three of the
intermediate outcome indicators established for this priority area.

3.3 Efficiency

45.     Overall, the project’s efficiency is considered to be modest. Data limitations and attribution
concerns limit efficiency analyses to unit cost comparisons and a comparison of expected and observed
benefits of civil works with the costs (see Section 3.2 and Annex 3).

46.      Component 3, which included both civil works and the provision of teaching and learning
equipment, is examined in depth given that it ultimately utilized 77% of total project funds (see Annex 1).
The civil works program in particular accounted for 49% of total EEEP expenditures (63% of the total
Component 3 expenditures), which is consistent with a declining Bank focus on civil works.13 Directly
benefiting approximately 18,479 students in total, the civil works program cost an average of ALL
178,752 (US$1,712) per student, although the per student costs range significantly, from ALL 53,220 to
ALL 450,241, depending on the type of civil works, region, number of enrolled students, and other
factors. On average, urban schools, upper secondary schools, and schools involving new construction or
extensions were more expensive than rural schools, primary/basic schools, and schools involving only
rehabilitation (see table below). A comparison of unit costs between EEEP schools and schools
supported by the Education Reform Project (ERP) and School Rehabilitation and Capacity Building
Project (SRCBP) indicates that EEEP schools are substantially more expensive, though this is largely
explained by the fact that EEEP schools were of higher quality than previously constructed or
rehabilitated schools (see Annex 3, Table 3). For example, EEEP schools included computer labs,
science labs, and internet connectivity. More details on unit costs and cost comparisons across projects
can be found in Annex 3.

47.     As demonstrated in Section 3.2, the civil works program contributed to improving the quality of
learning conditions (sub-PDO 1) and to increasing access to secondary school (sub-PDO 2). However,
for both sub-PDOs, this contribution is modest given that the civil works program serves a relatively

small beneficiary group. Direct beneficiaries of civil works amount to only 3.5% of the total number of
primary and secondary students in Albania (520,974). Although civil works did help to reduce multiple
shift schools, there is some evidence to suggest that this had minimal impact on increasing instructional
time, which remains at less than 6 hours per day (see Annex 3). It is difficult to justify the use of 49% of
the project’s funds to serve a relatively small beneficiary group for less than half the day, especially
because there is no evidence to suggest that these schools served the areas of most need. Although the
civil works program did contribute modestly to both sub-PDOs 1 and 2, the costs were high relative to the
benefits.

48.      However, the other 51% of project funds (non-civil works expenditures) were used more
efficiently because they contributed to achieving project sub-objectives for a broader beneficiary group at
lower costs. For example, under Component 2, the MoES revised the basic and secondary education
curricula and rolled it out nationwide, benefiting all primary and secondary students. This had, and
continues to have, a positive impact on improving the quality of learning conditions, and the per student
cost was ALL 718, compared with ALL 178,752 for civil works. The 51% of project funds further
contributed to achieving sub-PDO 1 (through the provision of ICT equipment, science laboratories,
internet connectivity, and an electronic system for the Matura exam) and to supporting institutional
governance reforms in higher education (sub-PDO 3).

49.     The EEEP also made investments in institutional capacity building within the MoES, which have
had a positive effect on the project’s overall efficiency. Though these investments cannot adequately be
measured against alternative investments, these capacities will ensure more efficient spending of
resources over the medium to long term. The ARP semi-annual reviews have demonstrated an increasing
culture of measurement and monitoring, despite the challenges of limited data availability. This is
demonstrated, at least in part, by the MoES’s comprehensive measurement of teacher job satisfaction and
perceptions of their working conditions. This information has helped the MoES to evaluate the EEEP’s
sub-objective on improving the quality of teaching and learning conditions.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

50.     The relevance of objectives is high and the relevance of design is modest, yielding an overall
relevance rating of substantial. The overall efficacy rating, taking into account all three sub-objectives, is
also substantial, and the efficiency rating is modest. The combination of these ratings yields an overall
moderately satisfactory rating for the achievement of outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

51.     Poverty Impact. The EEEP was designed to support a sector-wide approach in which all
students in the education system were expected to benefit. Analytical work indicated that poverty mainly
shifted from rural to urban areas since 2008 due to ongoing migration out of the rural mountainous
regions into urban areas along with low economic growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.14
Although the total population in poverty increased by 7.7% between 2008 and 2012, the urban population
in poverty increased by 36.8% during the same period. Because the EEEP aimed to reduce overcrowding
by building and expanding schools in urban areas, the project did benefit the poor.

52.     Gender Impact. Slight differences in enrollment rates by gender existed when the project began,
and although these differences still exist, they are not significant. The PISA 2012 results indicate good
performance parity across genders in math, with girls somewhat outperforming boys in reading. No
substantial positive or negative effects of the EEEP were observed with relation to gender.

53.      Social Development Impact. School construction efforts had an unexpected impact on social
development due to processes of complying with the Bank’s social safeguards policies. Municipalities
were obligated to inform the community and seek input on land expropriation and resettlement matters.
Through these processes, local communities were involved in the project’s implementation. The project
also strengthened the institutional framework for increased community-level involvement in the education
process: 90% of schools now have functioning school boards. The Pre-University Law also provides
greater autonomy to local government on curriculum and school management issues. The law also
strengthens social inclusion by providing attention to special needs students.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

54.      The EEEP made a significant contribution to institutional strengthening. Through direct reforms,
the institutional structure of the education system was clarified: IED and APAAL were restructured,
National Inspectorate for Pre-University Education (NIPE) was established, university governance was
strengthened, and the Pre-University Law was passed in 2012. The use of a sector-wide approach to
implement the reform program also had a positive impact on long-term institutional capacity. Using the
education system’s existing structures and agencies to implement the EEEP strengthened capacity to plan,
implement, and monitor a large-scale and nation-wide reform program.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

55.      Overall, the risks that the outcomes achieved under the EEEP might not be sustained are
considered to be moderate. The EEEP’s development objectives are still consistent with the Albania CPS
2011-2014 and with the social sector priorities of the new government elected in June 2013. Even so,
several factors present risks to maintaining achievements, especially towards sub-PDOs 1 and 2.

56.      Funding for in-service teacher training was reduced when the former Institute for Curriculum and
Training was replaced by the Institute for Education Development (IED). The MoES intended to
establish a teacher training accreditation body, but this was only partially achieved. As a result, the in-
service teacher professional development program is poorly funded and dysfunctional, creating the risk
that curriculum reforms made under the project will not have their intended effect on improving learning
conditions, putting sub-PDO 1 at risk. The new Government has also indicated that it will review actions
taken under the leadership of the former Minister, such as the new curriculum framework for basic
education. The EEEP also supported substantial investments in school infrastructure. Due to limited
funding for the maintenance of infrastructure and internet connectivity, along with the absence of a clear
mechanism to hold municipalities responsible for the maintenance of school infrastructure, there is a risk
that infrastructure investments made under the EEEP will not be sustained. If so, achievements made
towards sub-PDOs 1 and 2 may not be maintained. For these reasons, there is a moderate risk to sub-
PDOs 1 and 2.

57.     With regard to higher education reform and university governance, the MoES adopted a broad
consultative and participatory approach involving diverse internal stakeholders and well as international
experts. Higher education reforms, embodied in the strategy and law, are likely to be sustained.
Furthermore, the strategy and law have the objective of aligning the Albanian higher education system
with the EU. In general, EU integration is a common political goal in Albania with widespread popular



                                                    15
support. Even though the new Government will also review the higher education strategy before it is
fully adopted, the risk to sub-PDO 3 is considered to be negligible to low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry – Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

58.      The EEEP benefited from sound technical analysis and a strategically relevant and innovative
sector-wide approach which incorporated lessons learned from previous operations and feedback from a
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) panel. The EEEP’s design reflected both the Government’s
priorities for the education system as well as the Bank’s development goals articulated in the CAS.
However, the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry had significant shortcomings, including:
an overly ambitious design, given the weak fiduciary and implementation capacity of implementing
agencies; the failure to include new school construction as a potential investment area; a weak results
framework with disconnects between the components, the PDO, and the PDO indicators; and
discrepancies in the PDO language between the PAD and the legal documents.

(b) Quality of Supervision – Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.     Project supervision was responsive and thorough, benefiting from strong field support from the
Bank’s office in Tirana. Although IDA provided only one-third of the project’s donor financing, the
Bank provided in-depth technical, fiduciary, and safeguards supervision on behalf of the three co-
financiers through December 2013, even after the IDA funding closed in June 2013. The Bank conducted
a minimum of two supervision missions per year and provided substantial additional fiduciary and
safeguards technical assistance. The project supervision record, including aide-memoires and ISRs,
provides a detailed account of progress and implementation delays, especially following 2008 when the
safeguards compliance issues were identified. The Bank also worked closely with the MoES to provide
necessary flexibility and achieve successful implementation of project activities throughout
implementation. The Bank supported project extensions which provided adequate time to complete major
interventions that supported achievement of the PDO. The Bank also restructured the project in 2010 to
allow for new school construction, which contributed to improving the quality of learning conditions
(sub-PDO 1) by reducing overcrowding caused by migration. The Bank team resolved major safeguards
issues, despite the excessive resources used in doing so and the heightened sensitivity following the
ICZMCP investigation. Finally, restructuring the project in 2012 to reallocate funds across project
components directed funds to high-priority civil works activities and school equipment.

60.     The Bank’s supervision had some moderate shortcomings. First, three changes in the Bank’s
task team leaders created a disconnect between design and implementation. The TTL who designed the
project was only involved in implementation for the first 18 months of implementation, during which
time few project activities actually started. Also, given that the EEEP was restructured four times, the
Bank team had multiple opportunities to reallocate proceeds between the four components. For example,
by 2010, it was clear that some project activities such as the school grants program were not likely to be
launched under the EEEP, yet the Bank team did not reallocate funds away from this component until
2012. Furthermore, the Bank team did not capitalize on restructurings as opportunities to revise the
Results Framework; irrelevant intermediate outcome indicators were not dropped and other relevant
indicators, such as a key indicator for higher education reform, were not added. Analysis of costs and
efficiency could also have been strengthened, especially pertaining to civil works. Finally, the resolution
of safeguards issues ended up absorbing excessive resources, both financial and staff time.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance – Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.    Overall Bank performance is considered to be moderately satisfactory (MS). Despite significant
shortcomings in ensuring quality at project entry, an MS rating is justified given that substantial results
were achieved under the project as reflected in the moderately satisfactory overall outcome rating.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance – Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.     The EEEP benefited from continuous support across the central Government of Albania. The
Ministry of Finance provided continuous financial support to the Project. The Ministry of Finance
imposed budgetary ceilings on foreign financing starting in 2011 (see Section 2.2), although the ceilings
were imposed across the board as part of the Government’s fiscal management in reaction to the
Eurozone crisis and its effect on economic growth, budget revenues, and public debt levels.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance – Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

63.     The MoES exhibited strong ownership of the project during preparation and implementation.
Many of the reforms envisioned in the NES and operationalized through the EEEP remained priorities of
the project under the leadership of three different Ministers of Education. 15 Project management,
coordination, and monitoring within the MoES was limited when the project became effective, though
capacity within the MoES to implement and monitor the EEEP has increased substantially due to
organization of the semi-annual EEEP review meetings with stakeholders across the government and with
donors and other partners. National and international technical assistance has also strengthened the
fiduciary capacity of the MoES. Through implementation of the EEEP, fiduciary capacities among the
universities and APAAL have been strengthened as well. Among municipalities, fiduciary capacity has
increased somewhat, though varies substantially.

64.      Despite these factors, there were significant shortcomings in the performance of the MoES as the
principal implementing agency. Persistent delays in recruiting necessary technical assistance, especially
for financial management and civil works, delayed capacity building efforts in the MoES and resulted in
periods of non-compliance with the legal covenants related to MoES staffing and the fiduciary capacity
building plan. Insufficient supervision efforts on the part of the MoES, coupled with the absence of a
mechanism to hold municipalities responsible for their obligations, led to recurring safety-related
problems among civil works and concerns about sustainability of project-financed investments. The
M&E capacity of the MoES has improved, though M&E arrangements were limited by the delays in
establishing EMIS and delays in providing baseline data for results indicators. Finally, the MoES’s
commitment to resolve implementation delays in a timely manner and to complete key project activities
deteriorated in the final months of project implementation. This resulted in: (i) the delayed resolution of
procurement complaints and payments to service providers; (ii) the failure to procure computer labs and
digital equipment for the 22 EEEP-funded schools; and (iii) the delayed resolution of quality and safety
concerns      regarding     civil    works     (e.g.    construction    of     fire   escape     staircases,
water/electricity/sewage/drainage connections, and furniture installation).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance – Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.      Overall, the Borrower’s performance is deemed Moderately Satisfactory. Despite the fact that
Implementing Agency performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory and the Government performance
rating is Moderately Satisfactory, an MS rating is justified given that substantial results were achieved
under the project as reflected in the moderately satisfactory overall outcome rating.

6. Lessons Learned

66.     The Use of the Pooled Funding Approach. The EEEP’s pooled funding modality benefited the
Government by providing flexibility to changing conditions and simplifying fiduciary procedures.
However, it was challenging to manage from the Bank’s perspective. Even though IDA contributed only
$15 million to the EEEP, the World Bank as the primary fiduciary supervisor was responsible for
reviewing and approving hundreds of operational and procurement actions for the full $75 million
throughout the implementation period (resulting in implementation support costs of $1.16 million, fully
covered by IDA, over 7.5 years for a $15 million IDA contribution). Future pooled fund projects should
ensure that Administrative Agreements are signed with co-financiers to ensure adequate implementation
support funds are available. Furthermore, implementation was constrained by substantial capacity gaps,
which was apparent given the time it took for the government to fulfill the effectiveness conditions.

67.      Holding Municipalities Accountable.            Although municipalities were charged with
implementing school construction activities, they did not have the capacity to comply with World Bank
safeguards and fiduciary requirements. At the same time, the MoES did not, and still does not, have a
mechanism to compel the municipalities to act, which puts at risk the infrastructure investments supported
by the project. To support Albania’s decentralized system of government and ensure achievement and
sustainability of outcomes, there must be a formal mechanism (e.g. memoranda of understanding between
the MoES and relevant municipalities) to ensure transparency and accountability for project outcomes at
the level of the implementing agencies. Such mechanisms have been used in other countries to link
resources to agreements reached between central and sub-national government entities, as well as to
results achieved through project interventions.

68.      Civil Works. The project yields some important lessons regarding civil works, which were time-
consuming and unsystematic under the EEEP. Supervising civil works was costly and excessively
laborious given that the EEEP constructed and rehabilitated 22 schools while the Government undertook a
parallel civil works program that supported an additional 1,152 schools between 2006-2012. The
Government’s demonstrated capacity to manage civil works should discourage the Bank’s future
involvement. Going forward, the MoES must ensure that standard designs are followed across all
municipalities in order to ensure that facilities are appropriate for an educational context and for use by
children and adolescents. Quality could be improved if the architect would also supervise implementation
of the civil works. Furthermore, school administrators should be involved in the school design and
construction process.

9.    Expansion of EMIS system to regional and school levels.
      Partially achieved. EMIS software has been installed and tested at the NAE and EMIS trainers from the
      Regional Education Directorates were trained. Retraining is required (started in October 2013) though before
      school directors will be trained (expected in Nov-Dec 2013). The MoES is piloting the school-level rollout in
      October 2013 and expects EMIS to be fully operational at the school level starting in January 2014.
10.   IT infrastructure improved to support school mapping database.
      Achieved. The required infrastructure (hardware/software) required to implement the SIMS system of school
      mapping17 was purchased and two modules of the school mapping system have been deployed on the new
      infrastructure. SIMS can be accessed through the Albanian government’s portal e-Albania.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Even though the PAD’s economic and financial analysis does not explicitly state the rationale for public
investment, it is clear that equity considerations were important in shaping the project’s design. Indeed,
public investment in education is usually justified on the basis of equity, together with informational
asymmetries and credit market imperfections. General education in Albania is primarily provided
through public investment by the government. In 2013, over 93% of students in grades 1-12 attended
public schools. In that respect, investment in pre-university education is very well targeted since nearly
all children complete at least lower secondary education. In the case of Albania, investment in tertiary
education was also timely given the rapid growth in the number of students at this level, from 87,000 in
2007 to 174,000 in 2013.

The rationale for the World Bank’s involvement is based on its expertise in policy and strategic issues
and its international experience. The World Bank had been engaged in the education sector in Albania
since 1994, with the first School Rehabilitation and Capacity Building Project (SRCBP; 1994-2000) and
the subsequent Education Reform Project (ERP; 2000-2004). Each subsequent operation built on the
lessons of the prior operation. At preparation, the Bank was one of the few, and the largest, development
partners supporting the education sector in Albania. Moreover, in Albania’s financially constrained
setting, the Bank’s participation primarily in capital investments is well-founded given that most
resources are used for operational expenditures.

As described in Section 3.2 in the main text of the ICR, the EEEP’s achievements were substantial with
respect to sub-PDO 1 (improved quality of learning conditions for students) and high with respect to sub-
PDO 3 (initiated higher education reform). It had a modest role in achieving sub-PDO 2 (increased
enrollment of students in general secondary education), even though this objective was achieved during
the life of the project. Overall, the EEEP was moderately effective at achieving its stated
development objective.

In order to assess whether the investments were cost-effective and efficient, it is important to know the
extent to which the project actually contributed to the achievement of the PDO. However, based on the
nature of the pooled fund, attributing observed results to the project’s activities is not
straightforward (see Section 3.2). In the PAD, the economic and financial analysis argues that improved
coverage and quality of secondary and higher education are necessary to increase productivity, and
ultimately, growth and poverty reduction, but there may be lags between the project’s activities and the
point at which growth and poverty reduction is observed. Additionally, it is difficult to attribute growth
and poverty reduction to the project given the number of variables affecting these higher order objectives.
Furthermore, it is not feasible to quantify and monetize benefits (thereby prohibiting cost-benefit analysis)
or to calculate rates of return for the EEEP. These types of economic analysis were not attempted at the
appraisal stage. Moreover, the nature of education projects is such that analyses conducted immediately
upon a project’s completion are unlikely to be fully comprehensive as many of the benefits that accrue
from investments in education will materialize in the medium to long term. Therefore, the remaining
alternatives for assessing the project’s efficiency are to (i) compare unit costs with other similar projects,
(ii) compare expected and observed benefits of civil works with the costs, and (iii) consider cost effective
policy alternatives for subsequent operations.

I.      Cost Analysis

Data availability is a major constraint, making rigorous, quantitative analysis difficult. While detailed
information on the costs of the EEEP is available, data from other comparable projects are generally
unavailable. For the SRCBP and the ERP, the ICRs only indicate the total cost of the civil works
component and the overall number of beneficiaries. Therefore, it is not possible to break the SRCBP


                                                     28
down into the cost of rehabilitation and the cost of new construction in a way that it would be more easily
comparable to the EEEP.

The cost analysis focuses primarily on Component 3 (improving and rationalizing education
infrastructure), which accounted for 77% of the EEEP’s financial resources (see Table 1). A large
portion of Component 3 funds was used for civil works, to build 10 new schools, extend the capacity of 5
schools, and rehabilitate another 7 schools (22 schools in total). Most of the schools tackled by the
project were in urban areas (17), reducing overcrowding in urban schools. In addition to civil works,
Component 3 funds were used for the acquisition and installation of teaching and learning equipment for
schools.

Table 2 shows the average cost of civil works per school, classroom or laboratory and student for
different types of activities (new construction vs. rehabilitation, schools grades 1-9 vs. schools grades 10-
12, and urban vs. rural schools). These figures demonstrate that expenditures per school are higher in
urban schools than in rural schools, although they tend to benefit more children which explains the lower
per student costs. Additionally, upper secondary schools cost more than basic education schools, though
because upper secondary schools tend to enroll more children, the per student costs are lower than basic
schools. Expectedly, new construction is the most expensive, though not substantially more than school
extensions. Rehabilitation is much less expensive by any per unit metric, mainly because rehabilitation
generally involves minor repairs and building upgrades.

      The cost figures in Table 2 alone do not shed much light on the project’s efficiency. Nonetheless,
      comparisons of unit costs across projects have to be taken with a grain of salt as projects’ activities are
      not entirely comparable. Moreover, input prices can vary widely across countries (or time) causing the
      production of the same output to have substantially different costs (e.g. labor costs or energy). To
      minimize concerns regarding comparability, this ICR compares the EEEP with the three prior education
      projects. This adds the complication of bringing all projects’ cost figures to 2013, which is done with the
      use of the International Monetary Fund’s GDP deflator. As another robustness check, costs per student as
      a share of GDP per capita are also computed. This indicator is meant to measure the portion of an
      average individual’s wealth that was spent for each beneficiary student.

      Table 3 compares civil works costs of the EEEP with those of the SRCBP, the ERP and also with the
      Tirana Schools Development and Rehabilitation Program (financed by the CEB). The SRCBP
      rehabilitated 157 schools and replaced 26 schools, benefiting approximately 60,000 students, though costs
      and beneficiaries cannot be distinguished based on type of civil works (rehabilitation vs. extension).
      Additionally, the quality of civil works from the SRCBP was uneven. It was rated good in 15% of the
      schools, average in 65% and poor in the remaining 20%. The ERP rehabilitated 44 schools, but included
      no new construction. Around 22,000 children benefited from that component. The CEB’s project
      financed new construction and rehabilitation of 19 Tirana schools and benefitted almost 20,000 students.

      According to the efficiency indicators presented, the EEEP is considerably more expensive than the ERP
      and the SRCBP in terms of civil works. Costs per school and per student are significantly higher.
      However, when rehabilitation figures are compared across the three projects, the cost per student as a
      share of the GDP per capita is not substantially higher, demonstrating that these projects had a similar
      cost in terms of the average individual’s income. Moreover, the EEEP’s costs per student are very much
      in line with those of the CEB’s project, which happened simultaneously and is therefore more easily

comparable. As discussed above, it should be noted that (i) these activities are not fully comparable; (ii)
input prices may vary across time; and (iii) the EEEP’s civil works were primarily in urban areas, where
works tend to be more expensive.

II.     Comparing and Costs and Benefits of Investments in Physical Infrastructure

The cost analysis above takes the project’s civil works activities as given and intends to compare costs of
similar projects by unit of output. In this section, the costs of civil works are weighed against the
anticipated and observed benefits.

The PAD identifies several factors that contribute to poor learning outcomes in Albania, including the
existence of double or triple shifts (in some schools). Civil works were justified as a means to improve
the quality of learning conditions (sub-PDO 1) by reducing multiple shift schools, thereby enabling
students to have more classes and ultimately more instructional time. Evidence indicates that greater
instructional time does have a positive impact on student learning, especially among children from
vulnerable families.21 The PAD stated that the declining student age population presented an opportunity
to reduce the number of multiple shift schools and to lengthen hours in school. In that sense, from an ex-
ante perspective, the rehabilitation and construction of new schools would be a reasonable way to
improve the quality of learning conditions in basic and secondary schools (sub-PDO 1) while also
increasing enrollment in secondary schools (sub-PDO 2). The share of schools with multiple shifts is an
intermediate indicator for the project and its target was surpassed: the percentage of students in multiple
shift schools dropped from 36/15 (basic/upper secondary schools) to 13.9/5.6 between 2006 and 2012.
Civil works contributed directly to the reduction in multiple shift schools, and evidence from field visits
confirms that new and improved infrastructure has helped to improve the overall classroom environment
in the 22 schools supported by the EEEP (see Section 3.2 and Annex 5). However, progress reports show
that the expected increase in instructional time has not yet materialized. At ages 7-8, the average hours of
instruction per year have remained stagnant at 700-805 (less than 5 hours per day in a 175 days school
year) while at age 15 instructional time remained at 1,020 hours per year (less than 6 hours per day).22

Civil works under the EEEP directly benefited approximately 18,479 primary and secondary students,
which amounts to only 3.5% of the total number of primary and secondary students in Albania
(520,974).23 It is difficult to justify the use of 49% of the project’s funds for such a small beneficiary
group, especially because there is no evidence to suggest that these schools served the areas of most need.
In the context of a rapidly declining school age population (see Figure 1) and strict budget constraints,24
the construction of new schools that serve a relatively small group of beneficiaries less than half the day is
not a cost effective use of project funds.

   See Kutner and Gortazar (2013) for a review of the impact of time on task on school attainment.
22
   This data was provided by the MoES in 2013 and has not been verified. The PAD states that the baseline amount
of instructional hours is said to be 570/780 for ages 7-8 and 15, respectively.
23
   Civil works also had indirect beneficiaries: those who no longer share classrooms or administer/teach those who
enrolled in the new schools. See Section 3.2 and Annex 5.
24
   Public expenditures on education were 2.8% of GDP in 2013 and are expected to fall to 2.6% by 2015 (MoES
data).

Overcrowding in urban schools was also identified as a reason for investing in physical infrastructure.
Student-teacher ratios (STRs) and class size have fallen and converged to OECD levels for lower
secondary education. However, the same indicators did not show much improvement for primary and
upper secondary education (see Table 4). Regardless, educational research has failed to show convincing
evidence of the effects of class size on student learning.

III.                        Alternative Investments for Subsequent Operations

Since the project was designed in 2005, stronger economic evidence has been collected on various types
of education interventions and their relative impacts on improving student learning. Such evidence was
not available to inform the design of the EEEP, and the project could not have targeted all challenges in


                                                                          32
the education sector anyway. However, with stronger evidence and the experiences of the EEEP between
2006 and 2013, there is reason to consider alternative investments for a subsequent operation.

Teacher effectiveness is among the most important factors that influence student learning. While
the EEEP focused on school infrastructure for basic and upper secondary education, teacher quality and
professional development were not adequately addressed. There is strong consensus in the education
literature and research around the central role of teachers in the learning process. Evidence has shown
that the impact of having a good (“effective”) teacher, as opposed to an average teacher, can be
substantial (Rivkin, Hanushek and Kain, 2005). Hence, efforts to attract the most qualified into the
teaching force and to strengthen the skills of existing teachers through professional development is a
critical area for action. Given the EEEP’s investments in curriculum development and integration of ICTs,
teacher development is a natural continuation of and complement to the EEEP.

An accumulating body of evidence shows that investing in the early years of life is also an effective
policy. 25 Research by Nobel Laureate James Heckman praised investments in disadvantaged young
children as “a rare public policy with no equity-efficiency tradeoff” as it promotes social justice and
fairness by reducing inequality and at the same time raises the productivity of society. It has also been
shown that, due to the nature of the skills formation process, early investments are those with the highest
rate of return. Both medical and economics literature agree that gaps in both cognitive and non-cognitive
skills emerge early in life and persist, and policies to mitigate these gaps later in life have proven very
costly. Early childhood development (ECD) programs have been shown in other countries to have
relatively low unit costs and long-lasting impacts on school readiness and student achievement.26 In 2013,
Albania had approximately 81,000 pupils enrolled in pre-primary education. However, population
projections suggest that Albania will have to raise absolute enrollment to over 118,000 children by 2025
if it is to increase enrollment from its current level of 82% to 95%. The EEEP did not substantively
address early childhood care and education, but these cost effective investments (both increased access
and improved quality) would have a major impact on sustaining the improvements in learning conditions
achieved under the EEEP.

Higher education enrollment has seen impressive growth during the EEEP’s implementation. The
project was successful at developing and implementing the Higher Education Reform Action Plan which
led to the Higher Education Strategy 2013-2020. As enrollment and the institutional framework continue
to improve, overall quality and relevance of tertiary education will remain challenges to be addressed.
Although enrollment rates may still grow, population trends suggest that higher education will have fewer
students in the next 10-15 years, which poses continuing challenges for balancing quality improvement
with efficient resource allocation. Although the economic analysis presented in this annex does not focus
on higher education reform, there is strong evidence linking higher education with economic growth and
productivity as well as the performance of the pre-university education system. Further investments in
higher education quality and relevance would also help to sustain the gains achieved under the EEEP.

Summary of Field Visits for Implementation Completion and Results Report
The World Bank team conducted the ICR mission in October 2013, in collaboration with the CEB and
EIB. During this mission, the team conducted field visits over several days to nine (9) schools, all of
which were rehabilitated or constructed through the EEEP with the exception of Bathore 2 in Kamez. In
7 of the 9 schools visited, the mission team conducted interviews with school principals and teachers
regarding outcomes of the EEEP. In all 7 schools, directors and/or teachers confirmed that the new
facilities and new student-centered curriculum have had a large impact on improving the conditions of
teaching and learning. In the other two schools, administrators and teachers were unavailable, so
observations are limited to a review of physical infrastructure. The information below is a summary of
the findings from these visits.


1.       Bathore 5 Basic Education School (Kamez): The team met with the Principal, Deputy Principal
and two teachers of the newly built basic education school, funded by the EEEP. The principal
underwent several week-long training sessions that were funded by the project. These related to
instructional processes, internal activities, and students with special needs. The principal indicated that
these trainings were very useful. The teachers confirmed that the curriculum has changed since 2006 and
that textbooks are aligned with the new curriculum. They reported that the biggest change since 2006 is
that the student is the focus of the classroom, rather than the teacher. The teachers indicated that there
have been several theoretical and practical trainings to support student-centered teaching, though they
could benefit from additional training on how to deal with social issues faced by students because this
school serves students from diverse backgrounds. Overall, the school infrastructure is functional and in
good state. Teachers confirmed that this school is much better than schools at which they previously
taught. The principal noted that better facilities have reduced the number of students in each class, which
has improved the quality of teaching and learning. The school has a computer lab, though is not yet
functional. It does not have enough computers, meaning that many students share computers. The school
has science labs, and although they were not equipped at the time of the visit, the purchase of equipment
was underway.

2.       Bathore 2 Basic Education School (Kamez): This school (1,554 students in grades 1-9) was not
financed by the EEEP. The visit to the school was meant to serve as comparison to the schools financed
under the project. The condition of infrastructure was poor. In particular, the Principal said the school
was seismically unsafe and plumbing and electric systems were not good. Besides that, internet was not
working because the contract had not been renewed. In addition, the Principal and one teacher mentioned
the difficulties of still having two shifts and overcrowded classes (difficult to have teamwork and too
much homework to grade) and dealing with children from disadvantaged backgrounds. On the positive
side, the Principal and teachers praised the new, student-centered curriculum, which allows teachers to act
more as “managers of the learning process.” The principal also praised the good relationship with local
authorities and the increased autonomy granted by the new law. Teachers indicated that they had been
trained regularly allowing them to share experiences with teachers in other schools.

3.       Ibrahim Rugova Secondary School (Kamez): This school is in use and was the first EEEP
school to be completed. The school operates in two shifts as an upper secondary school. The school
director informed the team that the school has a fruitful and cooperative relationship with municipal
authorities, the MoES, the school board, the parents’ council, and the student senate. The teachers
mentioned the importance of the new student-centered curriculum, which allows more flexibility for
secondary students to choose courses. There are more career-oriented courses, and from the 10th grade,
students can decide if they want to focus more on sciences or on languages/social sciences. ICTs are
being used in teaching, but not equally with all teachers. The school’s IT teacher has conducted school-


                                                    37
based trainings for other teachers, to facilitate the integration of ICTs into different lessons. The director
confirmed that project inputs, especially infrastructure, have resulted in quality improvements in the
school. Even though teachers were receiving training before, few improvements could be seen in the
absence of improved school conditions. This school is full in terms of student enrollment, though
students in nearby areas would like to join this school because of the new infrastructure. The school’s
infrastructure is working properly, though the science labs do not have running water and the ceiling of
the gymnasium leaks.

4.       Beslidhja Basic Education School (Lezhe): This basic education school has 816 students
enrolled. The Principal told the Bank’s team that the new infrastructure eliminated the necessity for
double shifts and caused students to behave much better. Teachers confirmed that the new curriculum
focuses more on the student, and also on career choice with the involvement of counselors. Teachers and
staff were happy with the numerous trainings they received on integration of ICTs into the classroom. As
a result of the new school’s construction, conditions in the old school improved dramatically (used to
have 1,400 students and now has around 500). The Principal reported having a good relationship with the
Regional Directorate Office (better than with the municipality). Science and computer labs are functional
and new computers are awaited. Plumbing and electricity systems work well, but at the time of the visit,
the school was flooded as a result of heavy rains. Moreover, internet connectivity is not working.
Finally, the need for training on how to deal with children from disadvantaged background was
highlighted.

5.       Hydajet Lezha Secondary School (Lezhe): This was a secondary school, newly built using
EEEP funds, with an enrollment of 1,155 students. The Principal was very grateful to the Bank for the
investments and reported that students’ behavior has improved and teaching conditions have improved as
a consequence of the new infrastructure. Teachers noted that with the new curriculum, students can get 7
classes instead of the usual 5 or 6. However, the Principal pointed out some critical challenges faced by
the school: the relationship with the local government and Regional Directorate Office does not work
properly (lack of financial support and responsibilities of each body are not clear). He also complained
about the low quality of some of the materials used (switches and furniture), the power supply (contractor
claims the problem is the fact that the voltage is unstable) and air circulation is poor as a result of the fact
that windows open very little. Lastly, the Principal has not undergone leadership training (and was not
aware of such trainings).

6.       Bajram Curri 9-Year School (Durres): The team spoke with directors of the two schools that
are currently using the newly constructed school building. There are approximately 1,645 students
enrolled in the new school, split into two shifts comprised of 48 classes including 6 pre-primary classes.
According to the school director, this is the only school in Durres municipality that still runs in two shifts.
Teachers in this school did receive ICT training, though the computer lab contains computers brought
from the old school which are not connected to the internet. Teachers confirmed that the teaching
conditions in the new school were much better than the old school, which has had an effect on quality.
Teachers also confirmed that they appreciate the new student-oriented curriculum. Several structural
concerns were noted during the visit, such as insufficient drainage for rain water, restricted access to the
fire escape stairway, and sinks in the science labs which are already rusting and breaking away from the
wall. School directors also confirmed that they were not involved in the design or supervision of the
school construction process. The directors only saw the site supervisor two times while the school was
under construction.

7.      Peshkopi Secondary School (Peshkopi): This school moved into the new building in January
2013 and has reached 100% enrollment. The school director and teachers who participated in the visit
confirmed that there had definitely been positive changed in the curriculum since 2006, involving more
choices for students (mandatory courses plus optional courses), and that it “gives education a different


                                                      38
spirit overall. If [students] choose to go for additional courses, it is because they want to, though it is not
required beyond the mandatory coursework.” Each sub-department head received training in Tirana and
returned to Peshkopi to train the other teachers. The director preferred that all teachers had been part of
the original training. The principal and teachers agreed that ICT capacities have increased, though
facilities and equipment are insufficient. The school has one computer lab with 16 computers, but these
computers were brought from the old school. The director confirmed that 16 computers in one lab is
insufficient for the school which has 1,190 students. The director also confirmed that the Matura results
are analyzed every year and used to recommend further stimulation or other measures for teachers. One
concern is that the new school building seems to have had no impact on enrollment at this school.
Although the new building benefits from a better layout and facilities, it has the same number of
classrooms as the old school and is on a smaller plot of land further from town.

8.      Keneta Secondary School (Durres): This school is not yet open to students, so the Bank team
was unable to speak with school administrators or teachers. Secondary students are currently attending a
small adjacent school which is running three shifts to accommodate all grades, so the proper completion
and opening of the Keneta Secondary School is urgent. (As of January 2014, this school was not yet
operational). During the visit, it was observed that construction was mostly complete with the exception
of some supplemental works (e.g. replacement of sinks in chemistry labs). Furniture was in the school,
though not distributed in all classrooms.

9.     ZallMner 9-Year School (Kamez): This school, constructed using EEEP funds, is in use and has
approximately 1,000 students in total. 28 classes (Grades 1-2, 5-9) meet in the morning and 8 classes
(Grades 3-4) meet in the afternoon. Supplemental works on the roof of the building had not yet been
completed, but the school does have water and electricity. School administrators were not available to
speak with the team, and teachers were in classes with students.

I.        BACKGROUND

The Education Excellence and Equity Programme is funded by the Albanian Government, the
International Development Association (World Bank), the European Investment Bank and the Council of
Europe Development Bank. The EEE-P supports the implementation of the first phase of Albania’s
National Education Strategy (NES). The objective of EEE-P is improved quality of learning conditions
for all students and increased enrolment in general secondary education, especially for the poor. The
intermediate goals are that leadership, management and governance of the education system are improved,
teachers use new methods of teaching and wider variety of learning aids in schools, the quality of school
infrastructure and the efficiency of its use are improved, and the initial steps of higher education reform
are taken.

The four priority areas of the project:

         Priority 1: strengthening leadership, management and governance of the education system,
         Priority 2: improving conditions for teaching and learning,
         Priority 3: improving and rationalizing education infrastructure, and
         Priority 4: setting the stage for higher education reform.

EEE-P implemented through the three years Mid-Term Budget Plan (MTBP), including the Annual
Reform Program (ARP) developed by MoES. The Annual Reform Program includes the activities,
planned by MoES and dependent institutes, that should carried out in order to achieve the objectives
define for each priority area.

II.       THE FINANCIAL SOURCES OF THE EEE-P.

The Education Excellence and Equity Programme is funded by the Albanian Government, the
International Development Association (World Bank), the European Investment Bank and the Council of
Europe Development Bank.

The initial cost of the project was estimated in the amount 7.37 billion of Lek (USD 73.7 million or 59.6
million Euro). The contribution of each co-financing partner to overall programmed costs is summarized
below. The table below summarizes the financial sources and expenditures of the EEE-P, for the period

According to the above indicators, the Project has achieved the outcome indicators.

        I.       Project Implementation

Priority Area 1: Strengthening management, leadership and governance in the education system

Foreseen outcomes:
    Clearly defined roles and responsibilities and accountability structures in the education system,
       and decentralized service delivery.
    Increased school leadership, autonomy, and accountability.
    Education MIS fully functional and used for decision making at the MoES and regional level.
    Capacities for financial management and procurement at the MoES, regional and local levels
       close to international standards.

OUTCOMES/ ACHIEVEMENTS (2006-2013)

       1) In the context of educational reform:

       a)     The new RED / EO-s structure, respond to deepening decentralization in education, which
             develops RED-s role in the development of educational policies for the region. Self-evaluation
             wins priority instead of external evaluation. Changing the MoES structure according to the
             new unified standards and the adoption of this structure with four major functions performed by
             public administration institutions at central level.-Creation of two General Directory;
                     o The General Directory of Higher Education which includes the Department of no
                         public Educational Development and the Department of Higher Education and
                         Scientific Research.



                                                        42
           o   The General Directory of pre University Education, covering the Department of pre
               University Education and the Department of Human Resources and Regional
               Coordination.
           o   Innovation marks the creation of the Department of E-Education and Statistics and
               particularly the development of the IT sector for expansion of Internet service and
               modernization of the educational process.

b) Drafted, approved and published the revised Law of Pre University Education. For that MoES
   was assisted in the first phase by an international expert. The new law aims to accelerate the
   integration of our pre-university education in European education system, to consolidate
   important and successful reforms implemented in Albania especially in recent years, to open
   spaces for other fundamental reforms, and, consequently, the accelerate improvements in student
   achievements.
c) Inspection is disconnected from MoES and RED-s, being created as a separate entity, directly
   subordinate to the Minister. This is the first step of decentralization and autonomy of the
   inspection institution and external evaluation. Albanian inspection is assisted by international
   experts to be trained in the use of contemporary system of data collection in the inspection,
   analysis, and reporting on regional and school level.

2) Pre-university Information Management System , which contains;

a) The database of students in pre-university system with identification numbers & semester
   certificates grades. Also it is composed of the teacher’s database with information about skills
   and knowledge about teaching staff in pre-university system. This system significantly increases
   the quality of the services they provide educational structures in the pre-university system
   monitoring the performances, producing statistics and indicators and simplify inspections and
   audits.
b) Electronic database of higher education which includes the National Register of Students,
   where each student enrolled in any high school, public or private, from the academic year 2011-
   2012, in three university cycles will have national ID number, except one who has received in the
   university where studies. This Database contains four modules: Module of students, academic
   staff module, module recognition of foreign- diplomas and statistics module
c) GIS & SIMS (TA-ALB-10) Module GIS (Geographical Information System) helps decision-
   making structures in education and municipal authorities with data about the education system,
   the geographical position of educational facilities and their needs. Module SIMS (School
   Infrastructure Management System) is a web application that contains information about the
   school infrastructure in the Albanian territory. The integration of these two modules enables
   decision makers to direct investments, budget, infrastructure maintenance needs based on
   accurate and up to date dates.

d) Financial Module manages the expenses and budget of educational institutions in central and
   local level, in MoES and RED. System built on a platform and the central database / unique
   enhances the quality of interaction and avoid duplication of information. It also increases
   transparency and tracking their expenses electronically.

e) Create database for school teachers and principals and respective consultancy. This solves the
   problems of managing, finding, and tracking documents in MoES organization and provides
   MoES’s users with a single place for accessing information and improves MASH’s users’
   collaboration.




                                              43
3) Recruitment of local experts for EMIS, increasing financial management capacity through recruitment
of local and international consultants , Increasing capacity of the procurement sector through local &
international consultants to follow procurement procedures, recruitment of two local coordinators to
support the Secretary General Office in EEE-P framework, building a communication strategy with the
public on the education reform, as well as public awareness on educational reforms implemented through
leaflets, TV spots, meetings with representatives of groups of interests.

The total cost of priority 1 is 297,895,924 Lek or equivalent of 2.1 million Euro

Lessons learned and areas for improvement

 E-data” has been piloted with individual ID-s at higher education level and the data are collected by
  the National Agency for Examinations. Furthermore, preprimary schools are not included in the
  current EMIS, The MoES has not finalized this process yet;
 School mapping should be more effectively utilized going forward. Actually, the MoES is preparing a
  Decision of Council of Ministers, to define the clear rules and responsibilities for the MoES staff and
  Local Government Units in order to use, update and developed the school mapping system.
 The Law on Pre-University Education was approved in June 2012, with the exception of the area of
  curriculum in secondary general education; the actual implementation of the law is limited. To
  support implementation, the MoES intends to pass another legislation that will detail the operational
  details of the law, but this process is still ongoing. A part of the supported legislation (the Decisions
  of CM) are approved by the Government during September 2013 and actually are in force and under
  implementation, the other part should be finalized.

   Priority Area 2: Improving the quality of teaching and learning conditions
Foreseen outcomes:
    New curriculum fully implemented in all basic schools, and teachers’ knowledge and skills
       improved to teach according to intended educational goals.
    Teacher professional development system established, and all teachers engaged in lifelong
       professional development.
    State Matura operating in a reliable and sustainable way, and a national assessment of student
       achievement working satisfactorily.
    PISA 2009 conducted successfully.
    School improvement process underway in first batch of schools.


OUTCOMES/ACHIVEMENTS (2006-2013)

 Institute of Education Development assisted by international consultant to review the existing basic
  education curriculum. Establish working groups for comparative analysis of current basic education
  curriculum with that of the other countries, design of the curriculum framework, teaching plan and
  standards in the fields of basic education learning
 The activity for opening preparatory classes estimated to have reached its objective in relation to the
  assurance about the preparation of children 5 years old who have not previously attended in any
  school institution, to enter in the first grade. During four years of implementation of this activity
  (2008-2011) opened 400 preparatory classes, attended by about 10,000 children 5 years. This activity
  was conducted in cooperation with UNICEF, which has financially supported prepare and distribute
  free to all teachers and preschool children of methodical manuals for teachers, notebooks and
  notebooks                   assessment                work                for                 children;
  • Distribution of 400 packages type with work material for preparatory classes


                                                    44
    • Training of specialists RED / EO covering preparatory education, training of 400 schools principals
    that have preparatory classes and 400 teachers who work in them..

     It’s created an Albanian Pisa story (2000, 2009, and 2012). Achievements in PISA 2009 were
      very much appreciated for Albania. In reading Albania was among the three most improved
      countries for the period 2000-2009 from 65 participating countries. PISA 2012 main study for
      Albania took place in April 2012. The main field of assessment was mathematics
     Are trained about 370 school principals, teachers, coach and specialist of RED / EO for
      implementing the new curriculum of grade 10; 700 teachers of grade 11; 600 teachers of grade 12
      for the new high school curriculum. In total around 2700 teachers.
     Are compiled and published all training documents in relation to the standards for teachers and
      school leaders
     International technical assistance on the evaluation of textbooks reform and Assessment of the
      new programs implementation in basic education (lower and upper level)
     International technical assistance for the inclusion and the integration of ICT in education
     Publication to help teachers on curriculum in the secondary education level.
     conferences, publications, working group, operational cost, Local & international assistance for
      the implementation of e-school

The total cost of priority is 2, 374,025,337 All or 2.6 million Euro
Lessons learned and areas for improvement

     The challenge going forward will be the implementation of the revised basic education
      curriculum, particularly adequate provision of teacher training.
     The Matura will be revised for May 2014 to only serve as an exit exam (not also as a higher
      education entrance exam). The new Matura will also include foreign language in the mandatory
      subjects (in addition to literature and mathematics, and two optional subjects).
     The Project failed to support the development of a functional in-service teacher professional
      development program. The current teacher professional development program is only partially
      functional, not aligned with the curriculum reforms, and insufficiently funded. Under the Project,
      many teachers, principals and RED staff received professional training that was focused on the
      use of information technology in schools (ICT) and three additional training modules: (I) annual
      school plan development; (ii) development of learning objectives based on subject syllabi; and
      (iii) special needs education (in coordination with UNICEF). All the training follows the cascade
      model. One serious concern with the current system is that, at least for the time being, mandatory
      and elective courses are not defined, and teachers decide which course to take. The MoES
      believes that as the implementation of new basic education curricula progresses, the issue of
      teacher training will be addressed and defined better to specify the mandatory training that is
      linked with new curricula.

    Priority Area 3: Developing and improving education infrastructure

Foreseen outcomes:
    Enrollment rates in secondary education increased, especially in areas affected by poverty.
    Students’ learning environment improved.
    Teachers’ conditions for productive teaching improved.
    Student per computer ratio in basic and secondary schools improved.
    Computers with internet connection ratio in schools improved.
    Efficiency of the use of school buildings and facilities improved.

        order to guarantee all necessary legal documentations for civil works and provide the
        implementation of the works in time and without extra costs;
     The local government units and MoES should coordinated better, in order to avoid problems
        related to expropriation or project deviations, which may cause delay or failure of the civil works;
     The local government units, MoES and respective RED / EO, should coordinate better in order to
        provide the necessary infrastructure utilities, such as electricity connections, water and sanitary
        networks, aim that school to be fully operational and efficient.
     MAS and RED/OE should take measures for accommodation of students in just new constructed
        schools, in order that school to be fully efficient (9-year Mar Lula school in Shkoder and
        secondary school “Keneta” in Durres, are not yet operational).

    -   Priority Area 4: Modernization of the system for higher education reform

Foreseen outcomes:
    Higher Education Master Plan (strategy) developed.
    Higher Education Law 1999 revised and adopted.
    Governance structure of universities strengthened.
    Strategic development plan of universities developed and implemented.


OUTCOMES (2006-2013)


     The action plan by strategy for higher education finalized with the assistance of international
      experts and working groups contribute also reinforced with participation of higher education.
     Design of curriculum standards for higher education under study cycles;
     Increasing management capacity and development and improvement of basic systems of financial
      management for higher education institutions. Improved funding formula for HE and built
      funding scheme of student loans
     Universities assisted by the international experts develop proposals on establishing new programs
      of study (2 year post-secondary vocational programs, interdisciplinary studies etc.) and for the
      improvement of the quality of the scientific research and integration in higher education teaching

     The results of the project ranking the Higher Education Institutions in Albania are presented as a
      tool to improve further the quality in HEI. This project serves to provide students with more
      information to make the choice of HEI.



                                                    47
       All public universities are equipped with around 106 new science and teaching laboratories.
        Improve conditions and the quality of teaching in HEIs in the three study cycles.
       The state exam for regulated professions held for the first time in Albania. There are 35
        specialties of 10 professions provided in Law and CMD. For each specialty should be a bank of at
        least 3000 questions that includes an average of 10 disciplines. For the design of proposals and
        the questions bank will engage about 200 professors. Digital organization of state exams testing
        knowledge through computer CBT (CBT - Computer Base Test) using a number of questions
        randomly generated from a fund questions that have been introduced previously in Data Base.
       Increased confidence in the education system Increased transparence
       Giving the result immediately after the test and the possibility of verifying the responses
        significantly     reduced      the     number      of     complaints      to      the  outcome.
        This is a system that can be widely used by HEI in subject exams to increase objectivity in
        assessment.

The total cost of priority 4, is 889,192,102 All or 6, 3 million euro
Advantages and lessons learned from this component;

       Excellent Education and Equity Project gave valuable assistance in equipping HEIs and scientific
        research laboratories, in order to increase the quality of teaching and research in the public HEIs;
       Were raised and extended human capacities for procurement procedures for staff of HEIs, as the
        process of planning and procurement of scientific laboratories and teaching himself delegated
        HEIs;

IV.       EVALUATION OF THE BORROWERE’S OWN PERFORMANCE DURING THE
          PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPERATION

Borrower assess that Excellent Education and Equity Project has impacted the growth, improvement and
of human capacity development in all educational system, especially in the Ministry of Education and
Sports, Regional Education Directorates / Education Offices, Higher Education Institute and local
government units, referred to the priority 1 `, 2 and 4,
This has increased their ability in terms of financial management, public procurement, project evaluation
and use of modern methods of information technology through EMIS(Education Management
Information System).
Borrower assess that excellent education and equity project has impacted in achieving the objectives
defined in the strategy of pre-university education, by generating significant improvements in the
reduction of pupils per classroom ratio, pupil per computer, reducing the total learning in three shifts and
limiting with about 60% of double shifts and all public universities are equipped with around 106 new
science and teaching laboratories, improving conditions and the quality of teaching in HEIs in the three
study cycles.

The total cost of the project, in its early design was provided in the amount of 59.6 million Euros, while
actual expenditures at the end of the project totaled 6,829,412,639 ALL or about 50 million Euros.
The project was realized at around 84% by not using about 10 million Euros from the amount provided.

In this non realization, the factors that have influenced are not dealing only with the management
performance of MoES staff, but also with limitations due to budgetary ceilings from the Ministry of
Finance and non better coordination with other partners involved on this project (ministry of Finance,
Local Government Units, etc).

The financial scheme used for the EEE-P, (SWAP, fully treasury system) shown a set of difficulties
during implantation. Such problems are linked by limitations in uses of EEE_P funds due to the budget


                                                     48
ceilings and difficulties due to the differences of the exchange rate which are under the borrower’s
responsibilities. The SWAP scheme was used for the first time in Albania, so the MoES and MoF staff
has not the proper experience with financial procedures of this scheme. In our opinion, we consider that
implementation of the project would have been more flexible and all project’s activities will be realized
according to the Annual Reform Program without the upper mention limitations.

V.      EVALUATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK, ANY COFINANCERS,
        DURING THE PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPERATION

The MoES staff appreciates that the support, the recommendations, the suggestions, the expertise and the
monitoring process conducted by World Bank experts, were a valuable contribution to achieve the
objectives and goals foreseen in the project agreement EEE_P.

Moreover, electronic communication with the WB has been a highly effective tool to ensure the
implementation of the projects’ activities and procedures in due time.
The on-line applications by the borrower through Client Connection system has been a convenience and
gained experience by MoES’ users.

In our opinion, the WB policies and strict procedures regarding the expropriation /compensation of the
third parties involved on this process (such as the land users/owners) have had a positive impact to the
third parties, because, due to these strict policies or rules, was avoided/prevented any economic damages
to the third parties.

Although, these procedures have caused some delays and further financial costs as they were not
compatible with the current Albanian National Legislation, creating unforeseen higher financial cost for
the project and its postponement. For example, the compensation of the land owners of Beselidhja School
in Lezha or compensations of the users of the land in Shkodra, were the main reason of the project’s
postponement.

The Borrower considers that, compensation would have been realized even if the Bank would not have
recommended a drastic decision (suspended of the civil works till the MoES to finalize the payments for
the owners of the land).

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB): Comments to the World Bank Implementation
Completion and Results Report for the Albania Education Excellence and Equity Project

The implementation of EEE-P was challenging at many levels: by the nature of the Project being
implemented, by the country context and by the cooperation among the three financiers. Several lessons
can be drawn from the experience and are presented below.

       Design –SWAp. Favouring a SWAP model instead of a traditional investment model was
probably not the best suited option for a country like Albania, where the necessary capacity to implement
complex projects, monitor outcomes and financial data was not in place. Combining the SWAp
requirements (semi-annual review meetings, annual reform program to be prepared, no PIU, etc) with
those of a traditional investment loan (detailed No Objection at every step) as it was the case, made some
of the work redundant.

        Overarching reform. The Project addressed all education levels at once. Having such a large
scope made implementation more complex and monitoring more challenging for all. It also spread more
thinly resources. Some activities aimed at improving teaching and learning were dropped (school grants)
and others not given sufficient attention (teacher training). A more focused approach, targeting resources
to specific areas should be favoured in the future.

       Strengthening capacity under a decentralized framework as an objective. The fact of not
relying on a PIU or parallel structure to implement the Project contributed to strengthening MoE’s
capacity and ownership and provided opportunities for municipalities to demonstrate their competences
(or lack of). However, the time it took to develop the necessary capacity resulted in delays in delivering
the key inputs. While developing capacity is a valid objective in itself, trade-offs need to be carefully
assessed when defining project objectives and design.

        Link between preparation and implementation. During project preparation, numerous
documents had been prepared by several consultants analysing sector issues and preparing detailed
implementation plans. There was however no clear link established between all the background work and
early stages of implementation, suggesting that these papers were rather a response to IFI’s requirements
to complete project preparation quickly rather than a response to the MoE’s needs. Lack of ownership of
preparatory work resulted in delays in launching implementation. In the future, it is important to ensure
consultants are brought to work with and for the MoE.

       WB safeguards. The WB environmental and social safeguards proved extremely costly to
implement and very demanding for a country like Albania. When local capacity and practices are not in
line with them, additional resources are needed from IFI’s to ensure compliance and strengthen MoE
capacity to support and monitor their compliance.

        Weak central and local capacity. The limited capacity of the MoE on procurement, financial
and technical aspects resulted in delays in implementation; weak municipal capacity to implement civil
works contributed to additional delays and poor quality of works. Municipalities also came short of
fulfilling their responsibilities in relation to school landscaping, utilities connection, etc. Future Project
should ensure that the necessary management capacity is in place when projects become effective and that
identified partners can effectively fulfil their responsibilities.




                                                     50
       Poor quality of civil works. The lack of “quality” standards and norms for school construction,
the weak technical capacity at the municipal level, and the limited capacity of the MoE to guide and
monitor the work of the municipalities made the implementation of civil works very challenging and the
quality of the final work disappointing for IFI’s standards. Having norms and standards for school
construction acceptable for IFI’s should be a pre-condition to finance civil works. Ensuring the necessary
financial and human resources are in place to carry out a proper supervision is essential.

        IFI’s coordination. There were high transaction costs for IFI’s involved in the monitoring of
this Project as a result of the need to coordinate decisions, activities, missions and assessments and keep
each other’s informed. On the other hand, coordination also led to pooling of resources to co-finance
consultants and favoured the mobilisation of additional resources (WBIF €1.5 million grant). Having
signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding kept us working together and forced us to overcome the
moments when we would have preferred to let go of the effort. It was hard and challenging work but well
justified if “development” is the objective. Successful partnership and coordination are facilitated when
there is an understanding of each other as institution. Personal relationships were an important element in
making this coordination work.

Annex 10. Safeguards Issues

Social Safeguards: Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)

69.     The project became noncompliant with the World Bank’s social safeguards policy on Involuntary
Resettlement in 2008, when it was determined that the Bank had erroneously approved Government
investments, articulated in the ARPs and corresponding procurement plans, in new school construction
which was not supported by the Financing Agreement. However, no new construction had actually begun
under the project when the discrepancy was discovered. Complicating matters, in June 2008, the
Municipality of Shkodra ordered demolition of a 5,000 M2 orchard in anticipation of a contract for new
school construction. The Municipality alleged that the orchard was public land being used informally by
a private individual. At the Bank’s request, the MoES suspended all actions related to new school
construction and agreed to retroactively apply OP 4.12 and take remedial action with regard to the
affected party in Shkodra.

70.      Project restructuring was required to comply with OP 4.12, thereby allowing the EEEP to support
new school construction. The MoES developed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) as well as
individual Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (ARAPs) for each site requiring land acquisition. Due
diligence and repeated consultations with the Bank’s Safeguards team on satisfactory RPF and ARAPs
delayed the restructuring. Heightened sensitivity to safeguards issues in the aftermath of the ICZMCP
investigation led to further scrutiny of the EEEP restructuring. Although the restructuring process began
in May 2008, it was not approved by the Board and finalized until March 2010 – nearly two years later.
The restructuring revised the project’s implementation arrangements and the Financing Agreement,
specifically establishing that the Recipient was required: (a) to comply with the agreed RPF, including
retroactive application of the RPF to expropriation actions that had already been undertaken in connection
with school construction at Shkodra and other sites, and (b) to prepare site-specific ARAPs prior to
construction. The amended Financing Agreement also included a dated covenant that obliged the
Government to fully provide any compensation or assistance to the affected party in Shkodra, as required
by the RPF and ARAP, by April 30, 2010. The MoES had complied with this covenant by May 2010.

71.      In June 1010, the Bank received another complaint by an individual claiming that part of the
extension of the 9-Year Beslidhja Primary School in Lezha Municipality was being done on land that was
restituted to his family. The complaint was referred to the MoES for investigation and action, who was
also asked to stop all civil works in that site until the matter was legally and satisfactorily resolved. The
Bank also carried out its own review of the matter and was informed that the municipal government, in
agreement with affected parties and the MoES, had decided to expropriate the land in question. An
ARAP was prepared and disclosed in February 2011, and ultimately the land owner was fully
compensated for the value of the land.

72.      In 2013, the Bank was informed that a small structure adjacent to the Mar Lulaj school in
Shkodra, previously understood to be municipal property due for demolition as part of the school
construction, was being legally claimed by a third party. It was confirmed that the municipality remains
in compliance with safeguards policies, although the legal situation of this structure has not yet been
clarified. The municipality closed access to the structure by walling it off to students. Should the legal
claim be confirmed, the municipality is expected to start an expropriation process. The contractor, under
instructions from the municipality, constructed a wall that prevented access to the structure, and the Bank
requested that this be corrected. As of project closing, the current status of this issue was unclear.
