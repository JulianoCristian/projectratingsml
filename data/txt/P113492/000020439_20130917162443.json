for Post-Typhoon Recovery. They both resulted with a\n            satisfactory outcome by both the Bank and borrower. The\n            reasons for the loans were the sharp spike in global prices\n            of rice followed by large purchase by the National Food\n            Authority leaving the Philippines among one of the hardest\n            countries to be hit in the region. Also in 2009 they\n            experienced two major typhoons just weeks apart that caused\n            substantial losses and damage in some of the country\u0092s most\n            economically vibrant regions. Some of the key lessons\n            learned from the Development Policy Operation (DPO) were a\n            pre-existing government or country owned agenda is critical\n            to the effectiveness of the DPO. Also there are important\n            potential synergies between DPOs and Specific Investment\n            Loans (SIL) that can be exploited during program implements.\n            Finally, that there is potential to leverage reforms in one\n            sector, such as social protection to achieve reforms in\n            another, such as agricultural reform."}, "docdt": "2011-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
