F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

Food Crisis Response Development Policy Operation (DPO). In the short-term, the goal of the
Food Crisis Response DPO was to support the Government bridge the financing gap resulting in
part from expanded safety net programs aimed at supporting the poor and vulnerable households
cope with the impacts of the high food prices. Over the medium-term, the DPO sought to
accelerate dialogue and technical assistance to support the Government’s effort to overhaul the
country’s social protection system. Specifically, it had the following five objectives: (i) lowering
and stabilization of domestic food price in the short-term; (ii) mitigation of short-term impacts of
high food (and fuel) prices on poor households; (iii) improved policy coordination and
institutional arrangements for social protection; (iv) improved targeting of poor households; and
(v) improved impact, efficiency, and efficacy of social protection programs through a
comprehensive conditional cash transfer (CCT) program.

Supplemental Support for Post-Typhoon Recovery. The supplemental financing sought to support
the Government alleviate the budgetary pressures resulting from increased expenditures and
revenue losses induced by the natural disaster. The operation did not support specific policy
actions and activities, aiming instead to more generally provide the government with quick
disbursing resources to respond to disaster-related needs in a timely manner. At the same time,
the operation sought to ensure that the reforms and programs supported by the Food Crisis
Response DPO remain on track and are implemented without risk of delay due to insufficient or
competing budgetary priorities arising from post-disaster reconstruction.

Program Context, Development Objectives, and Design
    1.       Approved on December 10, 2008, the Food Crisis Response Development Policy
    Operation (henceforth referred to as the DPO) was a stand-alone, single tranche operation that
    was prepared under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) facility. The loan for
    US$200 million became effective on February 23, 2009 and was fully disbursed on February 25,
    2009. The DPO was envisaged to support the Government of the Philippines address the
    challenges of soaring international food prices that began to affect the domestic consumers in
    mid-2008. The DPO supported the measures that the Government took to immediately mitigate
    the short-term impacts of the food crisis on consumers as well as the steps taken to put into place
    an improved social protection system to cushion the poor from such shocks in the future. Apart
    from the policy dimensions of the DPO, the operation was also a response to the request of the
    Government for a quick disbursing budget support to help finance higher-than-budgeted food-
    crisis-related expenditures.

    2.      On May 20, 2010, the Bank approved a supplemental support for post-typhoon recovery
    (henceforth referred to as the Supplemental Financing) to respond to the Government’s request
    for assistance following the two major typhoons that hit the Philippines in late 2009. The
    Supplemental Financing was a single-tranche loan for US$250 million under the DPO, became
    effective on August 27, 2010, and was fully disbursed on September 20, 2010. It sought to
    provide incremental financing to address revenue losses resulting from the disaster and to
    finance previously unbudgeted reconstruction expenditure. More importantly, the Supplemental
    Financing aimed to protect the measures supported by the DPO from any effects of the fiscal
    shock due to the disaster. In particular, the expansion of social protection programs, including
    the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, required sustained financial support to protect the
    poor households that benefit from these programs.

           Context at Appraisal

    3.       The Food Crisis. In 2008, the international rice prices soared far above what would be
    expected based on the fundamentals of supply and demand, nearly tripling from December 2007
    to April 2008. As the largest rice importer in the world at that time, the Philippines was among
    the hardest hit countries in the region. The sharp spike in global prices in March to April 2008
    was prompted by rice export restrictions in several countries, followed by large purchase tenders
    by the Government that became worried about depleting stocks, long queues for the country’s
    staple, and the potential for social unrest. As the world food prices soared, including fuel prices,
    domestic prices followed. Food prices in the Philippines peaked in July 2008, increasing by 18
    percent, while rice prices increased by 57 percent during this period. Inflation increased sharply
    at 12.5 percent in August 2008, where food accounted for 47 percent of the core inflation and
    energy accounted for 7 percent. The inflation was particularly high especially if compared to
    earlier record of 5.3 percent average in 2003-2006 and 2.8 percent in 2007.



                                                    vii
4.     Rice is particularly important for Filipinos. It is a staple food for over 80 percent of the
population, contributing as much as 65 percent of the calorie intake. Food, in general, accounts
for about 41 percent of total expenditures of an average household while it accounts for about 60
percent for the poorest households, of which a third is consumed on rice. Given the high
vulnerability of Filipinos to food price shocks, the sharp increase in the prices of food and fuel
was seen to have contributed to the worsening poverty situation in the country. Simulations
showed that the combined effects of food and fuel inflation that peaked in July 2008 increased
poverty incidence in 2008 by 0.9 percentage points, pushing an additional 900,000 people into
poverty.1 In addition, the increase in the minimum wage in June 2008 was below the increase in
the consumer price index in the succeeding months thereby reducing the real income of the non-
rich. Opinion surveys reported an increase in self-rated poverty from 50 percent in March 2008
to 59 percent in June 2008 and hunger incidence from 15.7 percent to 16.3 percent during the
same period.

5.      Even before the food crisis, rice consumption in the Philippines was consistently greater
than production, and self-reliance based on domestic production has yet to be achieved. While
population growth averaged 2.3 percent per year since 1990, rice production grew at 1.9 percent.
Rice production has been low in absolute and relative terms—rice yields in 2005 averaged 3.6
tons per hectare while Indonesia and Vietnam achieved yields of 4.5 and 4.8 tons per hectare,
respectively. The Philippines also has the smallest area planted with rice compared to its
neighbors and, as a whole, arable land endowment per person is substantially lower than
countries in mainland Southeast Asia. Moreover, while Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand have
enormous natural irrigation, the Philippines' water resources are being depleted by the country's
inability to protect its watersheds. Another disadvantage is geography—the country is the first
landmass along the Pacific typhoon belt and is buffeted by numerous typhoons each year,
making rice production difficult and risky.

6.      As early as June 2008, the Government had anticipated the increase in expenditures to
respond to the food crisis and approached the Bank for financial assistance.2 Two months later,
the Bank began the preparation of the DPO, leading up to the loan approval in December 2008.
The following were the rationale for Bank involvement during the food crisis. First, the Bank put
into place the GFRP to provide quick support to countries that were subjected to the sharp
increase in food prices. Through the GFRP, the Bank was well placed to respond quickly to the
Government’s request for assistance. Second, the DPO focused on the area of social protection
where the Bank has a comparative advantage in providing support given its vast global
experience in this area. In particular, the Bank was already providing technical assistance and
policy advice to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) on this agenda.
Third, the objectives pursued by the DPO were consistent with the Bank’s Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for the Philippines in FY2006-2008 to foster increased social inclusion and
better governance. Given the complexity of the reform agenda on food policy and its political

1
  The World Bank estimated that during the peak of the food and fuel crises in July 2008 about 3.3 million people
immediately succumbed into poverty because of the 18 percent increase in food prices alone. However, food and
fuel prices quickly slipped back to their pre-crisis levels towards the end of 2008, in part due to the actions
supported by the DPO, which allowed many Filipino families to revert back to their old standard of living.
2
  On June 19, 2008, the Government’s Department of Finance (DOF) sent a letter to the World Bank requesting for
financial assistance to respond to the food crisis.

                                                       2
economy, consensus on long-term reforms would take time to develop. However, the Bank and
the Government recognized that the advancement of social protection policies supported by the
DPO would facilitate moving on the difficult agenda of food policy reforms and food subsidies.

7.     The Disasters. In late 2009, almost a year after the peak of the food crisis, two major
typhoons hit the Philippines within a space of two weeks that caused substantial losses and
damages in some of the country’s most economically vibrant regions. On September 26, 2009,
typhoon Ketsana (local name Ondoy) brought a record high rainfall to Metro Manila and nearby
provinces in Central Luzon, causing massive floods, which were the worst in 40 years. The
unprecedented amount of rain caused dam reservoirs and rivers to overflow, resulting in massive
flood in surrounding areas. A few days later, on October 3, 2009, typhoon Parma (local name
Pepeng) hit Northern Luzon. Strong winds and heavy rains caused extensive damages and
flooding in predominantly agricultural areas that already had fully saturated soil. The highest
cumulative rainfall, exceeding one meter, was experienced along the west coast of Northern
Luzon.

8.      Immediately following the typhoons, the Government asked the Bank to lead a post-
disaster needs assessment (PDNA), to be undertaken jointly with the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), United Nation (UN) agencies, and other partners.3 The PDNA estimated that the
damages and losses from the typhoons amount to US$4.38 billion, equivalent to 2.7 percent of
the country’s GDP. The estimate took into account the large share of Metro Manila (38 percent)
in the country’s total GDP, and the impact on agriculture, as Central and Northern Luzon
contribute to over half the country’s rice production. In fact, disaster-affected Luzon accounts for
60 percent of GDP. A total of US$942.9 million was required to meet recovery needs and a total
of US$3.48 billion was required for the reconstruction efforts over the short- (2009-2010) to
medium-term (2011-2012). The impact on the economy was expected to exacerbate the slow
pace of expansion in the near term, especially if financing for recovery and reconstruction was
delayed or partial.

9.     Moreover, the increase in unanticipated budgetary needs arising from the disasters was
expected to disrupt the financial support for the social protection programs that were introduced
and expanded during the food crisis. In particular, the Government had expanded the CCT
program in 2008 to over 330,000 beneficiary households and expanded it even more to 726,000
beneficiary households. Other measures were also undertaken during the food crisis that required
sustained financial support such as the improvement in targeting of social protection programs
and the establishment of the national database of poor households. Given the amount of spending
required for reconstruction, the Government approached the Bank in November 2009 for an
additional loan.4 At the Government's request, the Bank responded quickly by re-opening the
DPO (it was closed in June 2009) to begin the preparation for the Supplemental Financing,
leading up to the loan approval in May 2010.



3
  The PDNA provided a comprehensive assessment of the human and economic impacts of the typhoons, as well as
recommendations for recovery and reconstructions based on global best practices.
4
  On November 3, 2009, DOF sent a letter to the World Bank requesting to re-open the DPO to allow for
supplemental financing.

                                                     3
10.     The following were the rationale for Bank involvement in post-typhoon recovery. First,
the Bank support through the Supplemental Financing would allow for the sustained
implementation and commitment to the reform program supported by the DPO, which was
otherwise proceeding on schedule and in compliance with the agreed policy agenda aimed at
furthering reforms in social protection. Second, the Government remained committed to the
social protection program supported by the DPO and the Supplemental Financing helped keep
the policy agenda financed by the original loan on track. Third, the Supplemental Financing
allowed the Government to begin the needed reconstruction without foregoing planned
development expenditures. It provided additional financing at reasonable terms and allowed for
the Government to release “unprogrammed” budgetary funds to support its reconstruction
expenditure program.

       Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

12.     In the short-term, the DPO sought to support the Government bridge the financing gap
resulting in part from expanded safety net programs aimed at supporting the poor and vulnerable
households cope with the impacts of the high food prices. Over the medium-term, the DPO
sought to accelerate policy dialogue and technical assistance to support the Government’s effort
to overhaul the country’s social protection system. The DPO had the following five objectives:
(i) lowering and stabilization of domestic food price in the short-term; (ii) mitigation of short-
term impacts of high food (and fuel) prices on poor households; (iii) improved policy

                                                     4
coordination and institutional arrangements for social protection; (iv) improved targeting of poor
households; and (v) improved impact, efficiency, and efficacy of social protection programs
through a comprehensive CCT program.

13.     Meanwhile, the Supplemental Financing sought to support the Government alleviate the
budgetary pressures resulting from increased expenditures and revenue losses due to the two
major typhoons. The operation did not support specific policy actions and activities, aiming
instead to generally provide the government with quick disbursing resources to respond to
disaster-related needs in a timely manner. At the same time, the operation sought to ensure that
the reforms and programs supported by the DPO remain on track and are implemented without
risk of delay due to insufficient or competing budgetary priorities arising from post-disaster
reconstruction.

       Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

14.    There was no change in the PDO during implementation.

       Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

15.     The food crisis highlighted not only the vulnerability of Filipinos to economic shocks but
also the state of social protection system in the country. For several decades, the Government
had relied on social protection programs that were widely recognized to be poorly targeted,
uncoordinated, and fragmented. However, even before the food crisis, reform in the social
protection sector was underway, which contributed to accelerating the Government’s efforts to
respond to the crisis. The DPO’s program document described the Government’s program and
policy responses during the food crisis, which included short-term measures to mitigate the
impacts of the crisis on poor households and the measures to continue the efforts to strengthen its
social protection system. Among these measures, the DPO selected nine prior actions. This
section describes the context in which these prior actions were selected.

16.     The Government temporarily refrained from purchasing rice through international rice
auctions and temporarily lifted restriction on private sector imports of rice. Faced with soaring
international rice prices that began to erode the purchasing power of domestic consumers, the
Government undertook several measures aimed at stabilizing the domestic prices in the short-
term. The National Food Authority (NFA), the sole entity authorized to import rice and regulate
rice trading, released its stocks especially to the areas that showed the most price increase, and
attempted to further build up its inventory mainly by large-scale buying from international rice
market. However, the large rice tenders had contributed to the global rice market’s volatility. In
addition, relying solely on NFA for rice importation had made the country less able to respond to
the dynamics of the international market. Recognizing these issues, the Government resorted to
bilateral deals with its neighbors such as Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand to strengthen its rice
stocks. It also drew up a temporary mechanism to relax the 40 percent tariff rates on rice and to
allocate rice import quotas to the private sector.

17.    The Government scaled-up subsidies and transfers to poorer households in response to
the food price crisis and increased its spending, over and beyond the originally allocated 2008

                                                5
budget, to the rice subsidy program, nutrition and feeding programs, and other social protection
programs aimed at assisting poorer households. Spending on social protection, particularly social
assistance programs had been generally low. It was estimated that the national government
spending on social assistance programs was 2.7 percent of GDP in 2007.5 Moreover, due in part
to the limited Government assistance, Filipinos often rely on family and community ties for
assistance in times of crisis, mainly through intra-family and inter-household transfers. Filipinos
also cope by reducing their expenditures on food and education during difficult times, which
have detrimental effects on human capital particularly on children. Hence, there was a need for a
more expanded Government assistance through subsidies and transfer programs to assist the poor
and vulnerable households cope with the food crisis.

18.     The Cabinet Secretaries of Department of Health (DOH), Department of Education
(DepEd), DSWD, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), and Department of
Agriculture (DA) approved the Operational Guidelines for the Food-for-School (FSP) Program
for the School Year (SY) 2008-2009. The FSP is a conditional in-kind transfer, which provides a
kilogram of rice to school children in public elementary schools and DepEd-supervised pre-
schools and day-care centers for a specific period of time as long as the child goes to school. The
program, however, was estimated to have a high leakage rate (as much as 54 percent) to non-
poor households because of its bias towards including areas in Metro Manila.6 As the resumption
of classes in public schools for the SY 2008-2009 was in June 2008, which was the peak of the
food crisis, there was a need to revise the operational guidelines of the FSP to prioritize the
distribution of rice to children in the food-poorest areas. The revised operational guidelines
reflected the priority target areas of the FSP, which included the 20 food-poorest provinces, 100
poorest municipalities not included in the 20 selected provinces, and depressed barangays in
Metro Manila as identified jointly by DSWD and DILG.7

19.     The President issued Administrative Order (AO) No. 232-A on July 28, 2008 establishing
the National Social Protection and Welfare Program (NSWP) and assigning coordination
responsibilities to DSWD.8 The social protection system in the Philippines was characterized by
lack of policy and institutional coordination in the broad area of social protection, with several
agencies undertaking uncoordinated programs that address various aspects of social protection.
As an initial step towards addressing these challenges, the Government issued an official
definition of “social protection” in 2007 with a view to have a common framework in designing
and implementing social protection policies and programs.9 The food crisis in 2008, however,
called for accelerated efforts to follow-through on this initiative. The lack of coordination in this
area had made more difficult the development and implementation of a more coherent and

coordinated social protection response to the crisis. An important step was to improve policy
coordination and institutional arrangements by assigning the institutional mandate for this. Such
a mandate for coordination of social protection programs was deemed important to better ensure
that programs are effectively addressing the risks of shocks such as the food price shock.

20.     Issuance of a Department Order adopting a national household targeting system for
poverty reduction for DSWD’s social protection programs and services.10 Prior to the food crisis,
DSWD was developing a national household targeting system, which is called the National
Household Targeting for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR). The NHTS-PR uses the proxy means
test (PMT) methodology to identify the poor. It was pilot-tested in 2007 in four municipalities
and two cities in conjunction with the new CCT program that DSWD was developing. The
creation of a national household targeting system was meant to improve the governance,
transparency, and credibility of Government programs intended to support poor households. The
lack of such a system resulted in the proliferation of transfer programs, which had their own
targeting systems. For many of these programs, both the criteria for geographical and household
targeting were not transparent or standardized. The importance of having a household targeting
system was highlighted at the onset of the food crisis as the Government explored options to help
poor.

21.      Establishment of a database of over 200,000 poor households covering 83 municipalities.
The NHTS-PR was designed to include a database of poor households. The database is created
by enumerating all households in a given area and uses the PMT model to identify whether or
not a household is poor. The PMT is a widely used method to statistically estimate household
income using the PMT model. After the successful pilot-testing at the end of 2007, the food
crisis that happened in the succeeding months urged the Government to accelerate the roll-out of
the NHTS-PR. The Government was committed to creating a database of poor households in
about 140 poorer municipalities and 10 cities by the end of 2008. This was being undertaken on a
priority basis to identify poor households for coverage under the new CCT program that the
Government intended to launch in these areas. In addition, the Government expressed its desire
to expand the database nationwide and result in a database of poor households in the country.

22.     Inclusion in the 2009 President’s budget adequate funding for expanding the database to
cover at least the 20 poorest provinces in 2009. The growing consensus within the Government
on the priority for such a household targeting system and the database of poor households would
lead to the allocation of budget in 2009. Since its inception, the budget for NHTS-PR was part of
the CCT program under DSWD’s budget. Enumerating the households in the poorest provinces
and municipalities, including mobilizing field workers, encoding the information in the database,
and ensuring that the database is free from errors and duplicities, would require substantial
financial resources. Not only would it require additional manpower, it would also need a reliable
management information system to help DSWD create a functional database that could be used
to select beneficiaries of social protection programs.

23.    Adoption and launch by the Government of a CCT program using the PMT-based
national household targeting system. The Government saw the potential of a CCT program as the

reduction for DSWD social protection programs and services, issued on September 30, 2008.

                                                   7
back-bone to a medium-term social protection and poverty reduction strategy that would reduce
the risk of the current food crisis and future such shocks to households welfare. The CCT
program would provide an income supplement to poorest households, which could help protect
them from the shock of increased food prices and other household level shocks. Moreover, a
CCT program conditions the cash transfer on “co-responsibilities” that ensure households do not
sacrifice human capital development of their children due to such shocks. Indeed, an articulated
concern at the level of the Cabinet indicated that the food price shocks could result in the falling
primary net enrollment rate.

24.    Inclusion in the 2009 President’s budget adequate funding for scaling up and sustaining
the CCT program for 320,000 households. It was critical that, for the sustainability of the CCT
program, there was a dedicated line item for it in the 2009 budget, with adequate funding to
cover the program at the scale designated by Government. While the Government’s decision to
undertake an initial CCT program at the scale of 320,000 households was welcome, the CCT
program was designed to be a multi-year commitment to households. Preparation for this
program came through with the supplementation in 2008 of previously approved funds on the
basis of a decision to augment this program as a response to the food crisis and the poverty
problem. However, its sustainability required an adequate budget allocation for 2009, along with
a concomitant increase in the DSWD’s budget ceiling to undertake the program on a multi-year
basis.

       Revised Policy Areas

25.    There was no change in the policy areas during implementation.

       Other significant changes

26.    The Supplemental Financing was the significant change in the DPO implementation. It
was approved by the Bank based on the following justifications:

27.    Unanticipated financing need. The Supplemental Financing was consistent with the
provisions of Operational Policy (OP) 8.60. The magnitude of the losses and damages caused by
the typhoons, including the recovery and reconstruction needs, were expected to have a sizeable
impact on the overall financing needs of the Government. The economic impact of the typhoon
compounded the effects of global economic crisis that happened in early 2009, which resulted in
diminished tax revenues and augmented the fiscal deficit target from 0.4 percent of GDP to 3.9
percent of GDP for 2009.

28.     Sustained implementation of and commitment to the DPO. The Government was able to
mitigate the impacts of high food prices on vulnerable populations, including as a result of the
expansion of safety net programs and measures supported by the DPO. In addition, sustained
implementation and commitment to the program was reflected by reforms progressing beyond
the envisioned short-term outcomes of the operation, particularly in the area of social protection
policy coordination, establishment and use of a targeting system, and roll-out of a CCT program.




                                                 8
    29.     Inability to obtain sufficient funds on reasonable terms or in reasonable time. The
    Supplemental Financing sought to help the Government address immediate budgetary needs. The
    Government introduced a fiscal stimulus package in early 2009 to mitigate the effects of the
    global financial crisis, which increased the budgetary pressures and reduced revenue buoyancy.
    While other development donors provided grant financing, it remained limited compared to the
    needs.11 The World Bank also offered to reallocate its existing portfolio for reconstruction needs
    as well as redirection of its lending pipeline towards this end.

    30.     More fiscal space for budget reallocation. The Supplemental Financing was the first
    significant financing package to help the Government address immediate reconstruction needs.
    As it did not constitute part of the financing plan of the regular 2010 budget, it could be used to
    access some of the appropriated PhP50 billion in contingent, unallocated budgetary spending in
    the 2010 budget. These funds can be released against additional, previously "unprogrammed"
    funding. In so doing, the Supplemental Financing could enable the Government to increase
    expenditures against priority recovery and reconstruction expenditures.

    31.     Lower risk and reasonable financing terms compared to commercial financing. Given the
    large financing needs even before the disasters, the Government’s financing plan also called
    upon substantial commercial financing of the pre-disaster budget. While the Government was
    able to tap global bond markets at a time when the appetite for East Asian emerging market
    bonds was strong from international investors, it was concerned that access to market on
    reasonable terms could evaporate quickly. The Supplemental Financing supported the
    Government in its plan to mitigate this risk and diversify its financing sources. Moreover, the
    Supplemental Financing offered terms that were well below market rates. For debt management
    purposes, the Government was keen to improve both the maturity structure of public debt and
    reduce gross financing needs over the short-term. The Supplemental Financing, with its 25 year
    horizon and 10 year grace period, addressed both of these points.

    32.     Insufficient time to prepare a free-standing loan. The use of Supplemental Financing
    option could enable the Bank to deliver quick disbursing budget support in a timely manner to
    respond to urgent financial needs stemming from the typhoons. While there were other types of
    financing schemes, including a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat-DDO), they would
    likely take significant time to prepare.

    33.     Apart from the Supplemental Financing as discussed above, there were no other
    significant changes made under the DPO.


Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
            Program Performance



    11
     Development partners offered redirected loan financing from their existing program. ADB, in particular, provided
    more than US$1 billion in budget support during 2009 to finance the Government’s fiscal stimulus plan.

34.     Table 2 summarizes the nine prior actions that were selected for the DPO (as discussed in
Section 1.4) and the expected short-term outcomes as articulated in the Policy Matrix. By design,
the prior actions were taken before the operation was sent to the Board in November 2008, so all
of them were fully implemented. The DPO had six short-term outcomes, all of them were
successfully achieved, as presented in Section F(a). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the DPO had
exceeded beyond the stated short-term outcomes, particularly on the three outcomes related to
policy coordination in social protection, targeting, and the CCT program.

2.     The Government scaled-up subsidies and transfers to           Mitigating short-term impact of high food (and
       poorer households in response to the food price crisis and    fuel) prices to households (as measured by the
       increased spending, over and beyond the originally            increased budget and off-budget allocation in
       allocated 2008 budget, to the rice subsidy program,           2008 for social assistance programs).
       nutrition and feeding programs, and other social protection
       programs aimed at assisting poorer households.
3.     Operational Guidelines for FSP for SY 2008-2009               FSP targeting primarily vulnerable and poor
       approved by the Cabinet Secretaries of DOH, DepEd,            children (as measured by the increased share of
       DSWD, DILG, and DA.                                           FSP budget to the 20 poorest provinces).
4.     The President issued AO 232-A on July 28, 2008,               Institutional framework in place for enhanced
       establishing the NSWP and assigning coordination              coordination and delivery of social protection

                                                                     overlap.
5.     DSWD’s issuance of a Department Order adopting the            A standardized database of poor households

       for expanding the database to cover at least the 20 poorest
       provinces in 2009.

       system.
9.     Inclusion in the 2009 President’s budget adequate funding
       for scaling up and sustaining the CCT program for
       320,000 households.

35.     Decline in the domestic retail price of rice between June and October 2008. Domestic
retail price of well-milled rice declined by almost 13 percent during this period, from
PhP38.37/kilo in June 2008 to PhP33.54/kilo in October 2008.12 Slight deceleration in food
inflation was also seen during this period, from 16.5 percent in June 2008 to 15 percent in
October 2008 compared to the same months in 2007. Rice prices continued to decline in the
succeeding months, reaching PhP32.52/kilo in December 2008, and stabilized in 2009, averaging
PhP34.12/kilo. The average retail price of rice in 2009, however, was higher than that in 2008 by

     Prices are based on data compiled by DA's Bureau of Agricultural Statistics.

4 percent, reflecting the step increase in longer-term global rice prices after the food crisis.
Nonetheless, food prices, in general, stabilized in the succeeding years. Average food inflation
was 5.8 percent in 2009 and 3.1 percent in 2010, which were lower than the 12.9 percent average
food inflation in 2008.13

36.     Mitigating short-term impact of high food (and fuel) prices to households (as measured
by the increased budget and off-budget allocation in 2008 for social assistance programs). The
Government spent an estimated amount of PhP58 billion for social assistance programs in 2008,
which accounted for 5.6 percent of national government expenditures. This amount was more
than double the estimated amount in 2007 of PhP25 billion, which accounted for only 2.7 percent
of national government expenditures.14 The NFA rice price subsidy showed the biggest increase
(mostly off-budget) in 2008. The Government’s spending on NFA rice subsidy (including tax
expenditure subsidy) was estimated to reach PhP39 billion in 2008, which was higher than
PhP16 billion recorded in 2007. The Government also significantly increased the budgetary
support for its cash and in-kind transfer programs, from PhP1 billion in 2007 to PhP8 billion in
2008. These covered the expansion of the existing programs and the creation of new ones in
response to the crisis.15

37.    FSP targeting primarily vulnerable and poor children (as measured by the increased share
of FSP budget to the 20 poorest provinces). In October 2008, following the Cabinet approval of
the revised operational guidelines for the FSP, DepEd issued a Department Memorandum to
implement the revised guidelines for SY 2008-2009.16 The memo highlighted the revisions in the
operational guidelines, which included the new set of priority areas for the distribution of rice.
This covered the pupils in pre-schools and Grades I-III in all public elementary schools in the top
20 food-poorest provinces, top 100 food-poorest municipalities (excluding those that belong to
20 food-poorest provinces), and the depressed barangays in NCR as identified jointly by DILG
and DSWD. This change in priority areas was estimated to have increased the share of FSP
budget allocated for the 20 poorest provinces from 46 percent to 78 percent.17

38.     Institutional framework in place for enhanced coordination and delivery of social
protection program, leading to reduced fragmentation and overlap. Upon the creation of the
NSWP in July 2008, the inter-agency cluster drafted a social protection framework to serve as a
guide in improving the coordination of social protection programs. Since then, the Government
has gone beyond achieving this short-term outcome. DSWD took the lead in stocktaking the
Government’s social protection programs and the type of risk that these programs sought to
address. It was found that several agencies undertake programs that address the same type of
risk, indicating overlaps in beneficiaries and geographic areas of implementation. The cluster
expanded this initiative and decided to conduct a study to review the existing social protection

programs with a view to scale up and reallocate resources to the most effective and efficient
ones.18

39.      The study recommended the following: (i) upscale existing programs that are proven
effective; (ii) make the CCT program as the core social protection program; (iii) complement the
CCT program with other impact to achieve a greater impact; (iv) merge social protection
programs that have overlapping objectives, targeted vulnerable sectors, and covered geographical
areas; (v) adopt the NHTS-PR to reduce leakage in identification of beneficiaries; and (vi)
institutionalize a unified monitoring and evaluation across all agencies. Subsequently, the
President instructed DSWD to form a technical working group to draft a Social Protection
Strategy Paper that lays the groundwork for addressing the deficiencies and gaps in
implementing social protection programs with a view to come up with a more appropriate,
integrated, and coordinated social protection system.

40.     In October 2009, the Social Development Committee (SDC)19 created its Sub-Committee
on Social Protection to operationalize the strategies identified by the technical working group.20
Chaired by DSWD, the sub-committee is mandated to formulate a five-year social protection
plan consistent with the national development objectives and priorities, which would also include
the strategies identified in the Social Protection Strategy Paper. Among its other functions, the
sub-committee is tasked to recommend to the SDC policies and strategies related to the
operationalization of the imperatives of action identified in the plan. The sub-committee also
advises the SDC on matters concerning social protection.

41.     A standardized database of poor households (identified using the PMT) established and
used for selecting households by at least one national social protection program. Following the
pilot-testing of the household targeting system between September and December 2007, DSWD
further developed the targeting tool in preparation for the scale-up of the CCT program in 2008.
With technical support from the World Bank, DSWD developed the NHTS-PR’s management
information system, drafted the Operations Manual for the NHTS-PR, and set up the institutional
structure within the agency to operationalize the system. In March 2008, the Government
decided to scale-up the CCT program in response to the food crisis and used the NHTS-PR’s
standardized database to identify the beneficiary households. By this time, the Government
already achieved the short-term outcome of the DPO.

42.    Several developments have transpired since achieving this outcome. In September 2008,
DSWD adopted the NHTS-PR as the main targeting tool for all of its social protection programs,
in addition to the CCT program (which was selected as a prior action). The Government also
decided to further expand the coverage of the NHTS-PR nationwide and added a dedicated line
item in the GAA 2009 with a budget allocation of PhP650 million for the targeting system.
Meanwhile, the targeting system garnered more support within the Government. In November

2009, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) issued a resolution recognizing the
NHTS-PR as a tool to facilitate the identification of beneficiaries of social protection programs.21
In the following month, DSWD and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth)
entered into a memorandum of agreement to use the NHTS-PR for the selection of the
beneficiaries of PhilHealth’s program for the indigents.

43.     In March 2010, the NHTS-PR became the official household targeting system for all the
social protection programs in the country. The President issued an Executive Order directing all
national government agencies to adopt the NHTS-PR as a mechanism in identifying the
household beneficiaries of social protection programs nationwide and to use the database in
prioritizing the poor beneficiaries, reflecting the Government’s commitment to improve the
targeting of its programs to the poor.22 The Government also increased the budget allocation for
the targeting system in 2010 to PhP723 million. During the year, DSWD continued to expand the
database that, by December 2010, about 10 million households were surveyed, of which about
half were identified as poor.

44.     320,000 poor households receive income support in the form of cash transfer. The
Government launched the CCT program in March 2008, following the successful pilot program
at the end of 2007 along with the household targeting system. As of ICR preparation, the CCT
program is called Pantawid Pamilya.23 The first phase of expansion was conducted between
March and December 2008 in 17 regions, 33 provinces, 4 districts, and 170 municipalities and
cities. The geographic coverage for this expansion included the poorest municipalities in 20
poorest provinces and poorest provinces in other regions. By the end of 2008, the CCT program
already covered about 333,000 beneficiary households, achieving the short-term outcome of the
DPO. Since then, the CCT program significantly expanded in coverage and scale. The program
had two more phases of expansion until December 2010, covering almost the entire country. By
the end of 2010, the CCT program had a total of over one million beneficiary households. This
was triple the expected short-term outcome of the DPO.

45.     With the expanded coverage, the budget allocation for the CCT program also increased
significantly. From the budgetary support of PhP1.3 billion in 2008, it increased to PhP8.3
billion in 2009 and to PhP10 billion in 2010. In the review of social protection programs
conducted by the NSWP in 2009, the CCT program was commended as a program that addresses
multiple types of risk and employs a well-designed targeting methodology that helps ensure that
the program benefits accrue to the poor. In December 2009, the National Anti-Poverty
Commission (NAPC) directed all national government agencies, including the government-
owned and controlled corporations and government financial institutions, that were

         Major Factors Affecting Implementation

47.    Various factors contributed to the success in program implementation. These include the
following:

48.    Government’s commitment to the agenda. Even before the food crisis, the Government
had already recognized the weaknesses in the social protection system in the country and had
made positive steps towards improving the policy coordination of social protection programs. At

24
  Refers to NAPC Memorandum Circular No. 1 Series of 2009 directing all anti-poverty programs and projects to
focus on the one million poor households as beneficiaries, issued on December 23, 2009.

                                                        14
the same time, DSWD was embarking on a reform agenda, which included improving the
targeting of its programs and putting into place a household-based model of service delivery in
the form of the CCT program. Despite competing budgetary needs arising from the crisis, the
Government maintained its commitment to sustain its efforts to enhance its social protection
system.

49.     External shocks that happened shortly after the food crisis. While the food prices peaked
in July 2008, there were signs that the global financial crisis that was happening in the developed
countries would have an impact on the domestic economic activity. The signs became more
apparent in late 2008 when exports contracted. Real GDP slowed down to 0.4 percent in the first
quarter of 2009 after posting 2.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008. These events prompted the
Government to have a more aggressive stance in protecting the poor and vulnerable households
not only from the food crisis but also from the looming global financial crisis.

50.     Technically sound programs. The DPO supported the establishment of the NHTS-PR and
the implementation of the CCT program. The technical grounding of these two programs is
based on international best practice and methods. The national household targeting system, for
instance, uses the PMT method in combination with geographic targeting, which is widely
recognized to help minimize the inclusion and exclusion errors, thereby enhancing program
impact. Meanwhile, the CCT program is known to improve the health and education outcomes in
the target areas as indicated by impact evaluation studies of CCT programs in other countries.
Moreover, the CCT program is so far the only social protection program in the Philippines in
which control and accountability mechanisms are embedded in the core program design.

51.     Continued technical support from the Bank team. While the Bank team had been
providing technical assistance to DSWD to put in place the targeting system and the CCT even
before the DPO preparation, it intensified its support to DSWD during the DPO implementation.
Despite the merits of the PMT-based household targeting system and the CCT program, they
also present implementation challenges as they are administratively complex by nature.
Recognizing these, the Bank team provided continued and hands-on technical assistance to
DSWD to assist the agency in successfully rolling out these programs nationwide.

52.    Follow-through of related Bank projects. The DPO capitalized on the policy dialogue in
the context of the ongoing preparation of a Sector Investment Loan (SIL), namely the Social
Welfare and Development Reform Project (SWDRP), while broadening the social protection
dialogue beyond DSWD. The SWDRP, which was approved on November 17, 2009, served as
an important vehicle that allowed a deepening of reforms and support toward operational
implementation while also ensuring a sustained engagement of the reform agenda catalyzed by
the DPO.

       Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

53.    During the preparation of the DPO, the six short-term outcome indicators (presented in
Table 2) were selected in agreement with the Government counterparts. However, there was no
agreed methodology to conduct monitoring and evaluation of the progress of program
implementation. Nonetheless, monitoring and evaluation of the program implementation took

                                                15
    place through supervision activities carried out under related projects, such as the SWDRP, the
    Governance and Anti-Corruption Technical Assistance (GAC TA) Program, and through
    analytic and advisory activities (AAA) related to social protection.25

               Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

    54.        There are no follow-up operations contemplated under the DPO.


Assessment of Outcomes
               Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

    55.    The objectives pursued by the DPO were fully consistent with the CAS for the
    Philippines in FY 2006-2008. The CAS Progress Report completed in FY 2008 reaffirmed the
    two objectives of the CAS as economic growth and social inclusion, and the two levers (which
    contribute to achieving growth and social inclusion) as fiscal stability and good governance.
    Meanwhile, poverty reduction was central to the Government’s Medium-Term Philippine
    Development Plan (MTPDP) for 2004-2010. Through the DPO, the Bank supported the
    Government’s efforts at reducing poverty, as well as social inclusion and social stability, by
    supporting measures to alleviate the impact of food price increases on poorer households.
    Moreover, the measures supported by the operation, particularly with regard to improved and
    more transparent targeting, aimed to improve the governance in the social protection area.

    56.     Nearly three years since the DPO preparation, the objectives and the measures that it
    supported continue to be highly relevant with respect to the Bank’s new CAS as well as the
    Government’s current development priorities. They are aligned with one of the four strategic
    objectives of the CAS for FY 2010-2012, namely to reduce vulnerabilities, by expanding and
    rationalizing the country’s social safety net, and the CAS' cross-cutting theme to promote good
    governance. The new administration, which began in June 2010 under President Benigno Aquino
    III, has expressed its commitment to continue the efforts initiated by the previous administration
    in the area of social protection, including those pursued by the DPO, namely, enhancing the
    coordination of social protection programs, improving the targeting of the poor, and expanding
    the CCT program.

    57.     Moreover, the new administration reiterated its commitment to this end during the
    Philippine Development Forum (PDF) held on February 26, 2011. The new Secretary of DSWD
    announced that the agency plans to expand the coverage of the CCT program to cover as many
    as 2.3 million beneficiary households, or almost 60 percent of the poor households in the
    country, and expressed its support for the NHTS-PR. The Government also allocated more funds
    for the CCT program for 2011, which amounted to PhP21 billion, doubling the budget for the
    program in 2010. With a view to enhance coordination in the delivery of social protection
    services, the agency is also moving toward convergence of its major programs, which included
    the CCT program.

       Achievement of Program Development Objectives

58.     The DPO has successfully achieved the five program development objectives as stated in
Section 1.2. This section discusses how the operation contributed to the achievement of these
objectives.

59.     Lowering and stabilization of domestic food prices in the short term. The DPO supported
the Government’s decision to temporarily suspend purchasing rice through international rice
auctions and to increase temporarily the participation of the private sector in the importation of
rice (prior actions). These actions helped eliminate the speculations in the global rice market,
lowering down the volatility of international prices. It was estimated that the Philippine tenders
contributed to driving the global price of rice from US$385 per metric ton in January 2008 to
US$567 in March 2008 and close to US$1,000 per metric ton in April 2008. Moreover, allowing
the private sector to import more rice from international market helped ease out the supply
pressure that was pushing the domestic rice prices up. However, it should be noted that, in
addition to the measures supported by the operation, other factors were at play that contributed to
achieving this objective. These included the NFA’s release of its buffer stock to the domestic
market to contain domestic prices in time for the low-harvest season, which resulted in the
gradual decline of domestic retail prices and even mitigated the seasonal increase in rice prices
that was normally associated with the lean season.

60.     Mitigation of short-term impacts of high food (and fuel) prices on poor households. The
DPO supported the Government’s decision to scale-up the rice subsidy program, nutrition and
feeding programs, and other social assistance programs (prior action) with a view to mitigate the
short-term impacts on food and fuel crisis on poor households. The CCT program was among the
programs that had largest increases in spending, from PhP50 million in 2007 to PhP1.3 billion in
2008. The targeting method employed in the CCT program, particularly in the first phase of
expansion that covered the poorest provinces and municipalities, helped ensure that the increased
in spending on cash transfers went directly to the poor. Under this objective, the DPO also
supported the approval of the revised Operational Guidelines for the FSP for SY 2008-2009
(prior action), which reflected the improved targeting mechanism that prioritizes the most food-
poor areas. With the improved targeting mechanism and higher budget for the program, more
children from poor households were reached by the program. More discussion on poverty
impacts of supported programs is presented in Section 3.4 (a).

61.      Improved policy coordination and institutional arrangements for social protection. The
DPO supported the establishment of the NSWP and the assignment of its the coordination
responsibilities to DSWD (prior action), which became critical to achieving this objective. The
creation of the cluster provided an institutional framework to set in motion the agenda to enhance
the coordination and delivery of social protection program. It facilitated the review of existing
social protection programs, which eventually led to the creation of the dedicated sub-committee
under the SDC to formulate a more coherent strategy on social protection. While several studies
have previously pointed out the challenges in the social protection system in the country, the
initiative undertaken by the Government to make its own assessment allowed for more country
ownership of this agenda. As of ICR preparation, improving the policy coordination and

                                                17
institutional arrangements for social protection remains an on-going effort, but the measure
supported by the DPO was critical in laying out the groundwork to move forward.

62.     Improved targeting of poor households. The three prior actions supported by the DPO
contributed to the achievement of this objective: (i) DSWD’s adoption of the national household
targeting system to select the beneficiaries of its social protection program; (ii) the establishment
of a database of poor households; and (iii) the provision of adequate funding for expanding the
database. DSWD’s role in developing the NHTS-PR and the increased funding support from the
national government to expand and further develop the household targeting system, including the
database, were essential in achieving this objective. Furthermore, the Government’s adoption of
the NHTS-PR as the main targeting tool of social protection programs in the country was a
significant improvement in the targeting of poor households. For the CCT program alone, the
NHTS-PR has so far produced good targeting outcomes. Incidence analysis of the program using
the FIES 2009 suggests that about 72 percent of the CCT program’s beneficiary households
belong to the poorest 20 percent of the population, where the 52 percent belong to the first
bottom decile and the 20 percent belong to the second bottom decile.26

63.     Improved impact, efficiency, and efficacy of social protection programs through a
comprehensive CCT program. The DPO supported two Government’s actions with a view to
achieve this objective: (i) the adoption and launching of the CCT program using the PMT-based
national household targeting system; and (ii) the provision of adequate funding for scaling up
and sustaining the CCT program for 320,000 households. These two actions led to the successful
roll-out of the CCT program, which became one of the largest social protection program in the
country to date. As will be discussed in more detail in Section 4(a), ex ante simulation analysis
shows that the CCT program can significantly reduce poverty in targeted areas. The cash transfer
to beneficiary households was estimated to reduce poverty incidence in these areas by as much
as 2.6 percentage points. Moreover, the income gap of beneficiary households is estimated to be
reduced by 5.3 percentage points and poverty severity by 4.3 percentage points. These impacts
can be further enhanced by the additional benefits from anti-poverty programs, which would
prioritize the existing CCT program beneficiaries.27

           Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

           Rating: Highly Satisfactory

64.    Overall, the DPO is rated highly satisfactory. As discussed in detail above, the
operation’s development objectives were successfully achieved, all of which remain highly
relevant in terms of current development priorities. The objectives, design, implementation, and
outcomes of the DPO reflected the Bank’s understanding of the Government’s agenda in short
and medium-term as well as the Government’s commitment and capacity to undertake reforms in
social protection. This overall rating is also warranted by the progress made in program
implementation, which have gone over and beyond the expected short-term outcomes.

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

65.     The DPO and the measures it supported, with its focus on social protection and safety
nets, had positive impacts in mitigating the poverty and social impacts of the food crisis. During
the peak of the crisis, the Government’s policy of protecting the domestic rice market and
making more rice stocks available on the domestic market through importation and release of
existing buffer stocks helped mitigate the increase in domestic retail prices. It was estimated that
the general domestic retail market price of rice was approximately 10 percent below what it
would otherwise have been (as proxied by world market prices).28 Analysis would indicate that
had this mitigation not taken place and had prices risen by another 10 percent, poverty incidence
would have increased nationally by an additional 1 percentage point, or close to an additional 0.9
million people falling into poverty.

66.     In addition, negative poverty and social impacts of food price increases were mitigated to
the extent that the Government provided subsidized rice to consumers. As noted earlier, with the
increase in world prices, the implicit subsidy to consumers who accessed subsidized NFA rice
increased dramatically. Most of the subsidized rice was sold at PhP18.25 per kilogram. In
contrast, regular-milled rice was at PhP32.30 per kilogram in the second quarter of 2008 and the
estimated world price was at PhP36.04 per kilogram. While the targeting of NFA subsidized rice
to the poor was not particularly efficient, access to the subsidized rice, while coming at a huge
fiscal cost, had positive poverty and social benefits. Even if the total implicit subsidy through
NFA had been equally distributed to all households in the country, whether rich or poor, it was
estimated that this action itself would have reduced poverty incidence by 1.4 percentage points
and the income gap by 0.8 percentage points.

67.     Measures to improve geographic targeting of the FSP program focused the benefits of
this program to the poor. Better geographical targeting, as was laid out in the new operational
guidelines, was estimated to cover as much as 78 percent of the poor, with savings estimated to
be PhP465 million of the DepEd’s PhP750 million budget for the FSP in 2007.29 Alternatively,
assuming a revenue-neutral scenario, such improved targeting was estimated to improve poor
households’ benefit from the program from PhP6 a day to PhP15 a day, or additional 114 days of
free NFA rice.30

68.     More importantly, putting into place an accurate household targeting system is expected
to greatly benefit the poor if it is used to distribute the benefits of social protection programs.
For example, as noted above, the current implicit subsidy through NFA would reduce poverty
incidence by 1.4 percent and the income gap by 0.8 percent if the subsidy were equally
transferred to all households. If, with the existence of a targeting system, the same aggregate

   World Bank staff estimates based on the cif value of imported Vietnam 25% broken in the second quarter of 2008
and the observed domestic retail price of regular rice during the same period.
29
   It was estimated that based on the original targeting rules for the DepEd’s FSP – using the income classification
of municipalities and the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability Information Mapping System (FIVIMS) – 62 percent of
the municipalities targeted were not the poorest municipalities. If targeting had been based solely on Small Area
Estimates of poverty at the municipal level, the program would reach an additional 38% of poor municipalities.

                                                        19
subsidy was targeted and distributed only to rural poor households, poverty incidence could be
reduced by as much as 6.4 percent and the income gap by 4.2 percent. Alternatively, the
Government could achieve the same poverty reduction impact of its current subsidy program at a
substantially lower cost. The Government’s actions to put into place such a system can
significantly improve the efficacy and poverty reducing impact of its social assistance programs
to deal with such shocks.

69.     Ex ante simulation analysis suggested that the CCT program can reduce poverty in the
targeted areas significantly. Based on the program's data, it was estimated that 62 percent of the
population in municipalities covered in the first and second phases of program expansion live
below the poverty line.31 The cash transfer to beneficiary households, which increases their
household income, was estimated to reduce poverty incidence in these areas by as much as 2.6
percentage points. Moreover, the cash transfer could reduce the income gap of the beneficiaries
by 5.3 percentage points and poverty severity by about 4.3 percentage points. The average
increase in per capita income among the beneficiaries is 12 percent. Although based on predicted
income figures, these estimates are consistent with the results of impact evaluations of
comparable CCT programs in other countries. For instance, poverty was reduced by 17 percent
in Progresa communities in Mexico while the Familias en Acción program in Colombia reduced
the poverty gap by more than 6 percentage points.32 Furthermore, the CCT program is expected
to contribute to women empowerment in the target areas. In addition to the program’s feature of
giving the responsibility of managing the cash grants to the mother, the program also helps
improve women’s health outcomes through variety of activities such as pre-natal health care as
well as their knowledge base through family development sessions.33

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

70.     The measures supported by the DPO, particularly in the areas of policy coordination in
social protection, targeting, and the CCT program contributed to institutional development in
social protection sector. The creation of the NSWP, and subsequently the SDC Sub-Committee
on Social Protection, laid the foundation for a more coherent and unified strategy to enhance the
coordination of social protection programs in the country. Meanwhile, the creation of the
household targeting system and the CCT program contributed to the improvement of DSWD’s
technical capacity as well as the agency’s implementing capacity to take the lead in social
protection.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

31
   World Bank estimates based on analysis of Set 1 and Set 2 beneficiary households, where NHTS-PR surveyed at
least 80 percent of the total households. Household cash transfers (health and education grants) were computed
according to the actual demographic composition of beneficiary households and per capita income predicted using
the PMT. The transfer was adjusted using the compliance rate for education (77 percent) and health (70 percent)
based on the data for the first quarter of 2011.

Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
            Rating: Negligible to Low

    73.    As of ICR preparation, there are risks that the development outcomes will not be
    maintained, although these risks are considered to be negligible to low. These are the following:

    74.     Future external shocks. The country continues to be a large importer of rice. In 2010, the
    NFA imported 2.25 million metric tons of rice. Although slightly lower than the importation of
    rice in 2008 of 2.34 million metric tons, it was higher than the importation in 2009 of 1.58
    million metric tons.34 As such, it remains sensitive to the volatility in international rice prices.
    The country is also prone to natural disasters that are typically large enough to cause major
    destruction on crops that could affect the domestic supply of rice. However, as a contingency
    measure to ensure food security, the NFA increased the rice import quota for the private sector to
    660,000 metric tons in May 2011, which account for almost a third of the country’s rice imports
    in 2010. Moreover, the country has strengthened its systems to address disasters with the passage
    of the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act in May 2010.35

    75.     Manipulation of the targeting database. The Philippines has a history of using transfer
    and subsidy programs for political ends. The adoption of the NHTS-PR as the tool to select the
    beneficiaries of social protection programs in the country was a major step towards improving
    the targeting of the poor. DSWD is tasked to provide the list of potential beneficiaries to
    agencies that implement social protection programs. Although it may be the case that the
    database generates the list of poor households, there is no guarantee that the list will be adopted
    by the implementing agencies or local government units, which tend to have their own set of
    target beneficiaries. To mitigate this risk, the Government is working towards creating a unified
    multi-purpose ID system for the NHTS-PR to strengthen the monitoring of beneficiaries of social
    protection programs in the country.36


    34
       Importation in 2010 is based on the NFA Administrator’s speech before the Philippine Rice Congress on February
    8, 2011 while the importations in 2009 and 2008 are based on import statistics data from NFA as of August 4, 2010.

Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
           Bank Performance

    (a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

            Rating: Satisfactory

    76.     The Bank performance was satisfactory during the program preparation and appraisal. It
    responded rapidly to the Government’s request for assistance to mitigate the adverse impacts of
    the food crisis (11 weeks since the Government approached the Bank for assistance). Barely four
    months later, the Board approved the DPO. The preparation of the DPO was in time to address
    the food crisis. During that time, not only was it evident that increases in international food
    prices had significant impacts on domestic consumers, there were also signs that the global
    financial crisis would affect the domestic economic activity, increasing the threat to the poor and
    vulnerable Filipinos. Faced with external shocks that could possibly put an end to years of good
    economic growth and reverse the gains from its poverty reduction efforts, the Government
    needed both the financial as well as technical support to cope with the crises.

    77.     Moreover, the DPO was prepared while the Bank was already providing technical
    assistance to DSWD to articulate its reform agenda.37 The reform included, among others, the
    development and implementation of a social protection framework, the development of a
    targeting system for the poor, and putting into place a CCT program. In 2007, DSWD was able
    to pilot-test the CCT program as well as the PMT methodology for a household targeting system
    with technical support from the World Bank. This was being undertaken in parallel with the
    Government’s efforts to address the major lapses in its social protection policies. The close
    collaboration between the Bank and DSWD well before the food crisis enabled the Bank to have
    an understanding of the overall policy direction that the Government wanted to pursue in the area
    of social protection as well as the capacity to realize the short-term outcomes articulated in the
    Policy Matrix.

    78.     The set of objectives embodied in the Policy Matrix was aligned with the Government’s
    agenda both in the short and the medium term. The set of measures supported by the DPO related
    to rice policy were grounded on the Bank’s on-going analytical work and policy dialogue on the
    rice sector. Likewise, those related to social protection and targeting drew on the Bank’s
    analytical work, policy notes, and consultant studies on the issues of improved targeting, as well
    as on the Bank’s AAA program on Inclusive Growth that was underway during the DPO
    preparation. As reflected in the program document of the DPO, the Bank team conducted a
    thorough poverty impact analysis of the food crisis and the efficiency gains from improved

    79.    Likewise, the Bank stood ready to assist the Government after the disasters. The Bank led
    the preparation of the PDNA, which was the basis for the meeting among the Government,

    37
      In November 2006, the World Bank made available a grant amounting to US$500,000 to assist DSWD in
    developing its desired reform agenda.

development partners, and the private sector that was convened on December 2, 2009. This
meeting resulted in indications by partners of their readiness to support recovery and
reconstruction efforts. Following the Government’s request to re-open the DPO to allow for
Supplemental Financing in November 2009, the Bank began the loan preparation in December
2009 (6 weeks). Besides the Supplemental Financing, the Bank has also identified up to US$300
million in commitments from existing projects, or projects under preparation, that could be
partially reallocated to address disaster-related needs. More importantly, the Bank also provided
just-in-time technical assistance to the Special National Public Reconstruction Commission
(SNPRC) in spearheading the formulation of the Indicative Reconstruction and Expenditure Plan
(IREP) for the country and in developing the Reconstruction Monitoring and Evaluation System
(RMES).38

(b)      Quality of Supervision

         Rating: Satisfactory

80.     The quality of the Bank supervision to ensure the achievement of relevant outcomes of
the DPO was satisfactory. The supervision activities were carried out through related projects
such as the SWDRP, the GAC TA, and the Bank’s subsequent AAA work related to social
protection. However, as DSWD was the main Government counterpart for these projects, the
progress of DPO implementation was closely supervised to the extent that DSWD was involved.
DSWD was co-implementing agency of the FSP, a member of the SDC, and the main
implementing agency of the NHTS-PR and the CCT program. Nonetheless, this did not deter the
Bank to ensure that the operation remains on track, considering that (i) the four outcomes related
to rice prices, Government spending, FSP, and policy coordination, whose progress was
indirectly related to DSWD, were already achieved shortly after the DPO’s approval; and (ii) the
two outcomes related to targeting and CCT program required more technical support.

81.      Through the SWDRP and the GAC TA, the Bank was able to provide intensive and
hands-on technical assistance to DSWD in rolling out the CCT program and the targeting
system. Given the complexities in setting up the operational systems of the CCT program and
targeting system as well as the limited preparation time between the pilot-testing and scale-up,
achieving the outcomes related to CCT program and targeting was considered to be the most
challenging. The Bank team conducted frequent meetings with DSWD officials and technical
staff, including hiring international experts to provide technical guidance to DSWD. While these
activities were carried out external to the food crisis operation, they provided the Government
the much needed help in achieving the outcomes over and beyond those articulated in the DPO.

82.      Meanwhile, as the Supplemental Financing did not support specific policy actions or
activities, there was no need of supervision. Nonetheless, the Bank assisted the Government to

   Refers to Executive Order 838 creating the Special National Public Reconstruction Commission to undertake a
study of the causes, costs, and actions to be taken in the wake of typhoons Ondoy, Pepeng, and Frank, to seek aid to
fund the reconstruction, and to enter into a partnership with the private sector for the foregoing purposes, which was
signed on October 22, 2009. Typhoon Frank hit the country in June 2008. The IREP was a consolidated list of
priority programs, activities, and projects to be funded, which was gathered during the workshop with line agencies
on February 5, 2010. The RMES was formally established on March 16, 2010 with the passage of Executive Order
870.

                                                         23
put in place the RMES, which served as a tracking system to monitor funding, expenditure, and
implementation of reconstruction programs and projects. The monitoring system would track
funds from all sources—donors, NGOs, private sector, and government. The tracking of on-
budget reconstruction expenditures would require the indicative reconstruction expenditure plan
as a basis, as well as the “tagging” of government expenditures that go toward activities detailed
in the plan (whether they are incremental to the budget or reallocations within the budget).



(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

       Rating: Satisfactory

83.     Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory during the DPO implementation. The Bank
stood ready to assist the Government at the height of the food crisis. It provided not only
financial but also technical support to assist the Government mitigate the impacts of the food
crisis and, at the same time, helped ensure that the poor and vulnerable households are protected
in case such shocks occur in the future. The preparation time between Concept Review Meeting
and the Board approval of the DPO was less than four months. Moreover, the Policy Matrix that
was prepared for the DPO embodied the objectives that were aligned with the Government's
program. The Bank selected outcomes that could be realistically achieved within the program
implementation period given the Government's capacity as well as commitment to achieve them.
Although there was no formal supervision activities carried under the DPO, these activities were
undertaken through other Bank projects whose objectives were related to those of the DPO.

       Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

        Rating: Not applicable

84.    The Government and the implementing agencies for this DPO are indistinguishable.
Hence, only an overall rating is necessary.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

        Rating: Not applicable

85.    Same as in Section 5.2 (a) above.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

        Rating: Satisfactory

86.   Overall, Borrower performance was satisfactory during the DPO implementation. The
Government showed ownership and commitment to achieving the development objectives of the

                                               24
    operation. Almost five months since the Government approached the Bank to request for
    financial assistance, it was able to provide the Bank with all supporting documents for the prior
    actions selected for the DPO, reflecting its readiness for implementation. As discussed in Section
    2.1, the program’s performance can be assessed as having surpassed all the six short-term
    outcomes of the DPO, which can be mainly attributed to the Government’s efforts to further the
    agenda in social protection. This was evident from the numerous policy directives that were
    issued by the implementing agencies, including the Office of the President, to push through with
    the reforms supported by the DPO. Moreover, although the risks to specific reforms supported by
    the DPO were recognized at the preparation stage, particularly the weak institutional capacity in
    rolling out the targeting and the CCT program, the Government (through the DSWD) has
    maintained the policy dialogue with the Bank and requested for technical assistance to assist
    them in setting up the programs’ operational systems as well as in mitigating the implementation
    risks associated with the rapid scale-up.


Lessons Learned
    87.       There are lessons to be learned from the results of the DPO:

          •   A pre-existing government or country-owned agenda is critical to the effectiveness
              of the DPO. The effectiveness of the DPO as an emergency operation lies in its ability to
              catalyze a nascent reform agenda in social protection and further it due to the
              circumstances and exigencies of the crisis. The DPO benefitted from a pre-existing policy
              dialogue by the Bank on the social protection agenda, but was useful in broadening this
              policy dialogue from one about specific agency-wide reforms (at DSWD) to broader
              cross-sectoral reforms in social protection.

          •   There are important potential synergies between DPOs and SILs that can be
              exploited during program implementation. First, the DPO capitalized on the policy
              dialogue in the context of the ongoing preparation of the SIL, namely the SWDRP, while
              broadening the social protection dialogue beyond the one implementing agency of the
              SIL. As mentioned earlier, the SIL served as an important vehicle that allowed a
              deepening of reforms and support toward operational implementation and also ensuring a
              sustained engagement of the reform agenda catalyzed by the DPO. Moreover, through
              the SIL, the Bank was able to ensure that the DPO operation remains on track,
              particularly on CCT program and targeting, as those were among the main components of
              the SIL.

          •   There is potential to leverage reforms in one sector, such as social protection, to
              achieve reforms in another, such as agricultural reform. While the timing of the
              emergency operation did not allow reform champions in Government to secure reforms in
              agricultural marketing and subsidy policy, the DPO helped further the policy dialogue in
              these areas. In particular, the successful achievement of an improved targeting system
              and the roll-out of a cash transfer scheme opened up options in the future to replace
              poorly targeted commodity subsidies, such as that for rice, which distorts domestic
              agricultural markets, with a more cost effective social safety net scheme.

              US$250 million Supplemental Support for Post-Typhoon Recovery39

The Global Financial Crisis

1.      Liquidity disruptions and increasing debt burden experienced in major economies in mid-
2007 followed by steep rise in the prices of rice thereafter had significant adverse impact on the
global credit and financial markets as a whole.

2.      Losses resulting from subprime mortgage loan delinquencies, bankruptcy and acquisition
and restructuring of certain financial institutions in the United States and the debt problems faced
by some countries in Europe have prompted regulators to take steps to respond to the
unprecedented conditions faced by financial institutions. Globally, stocks of rice have
plummeted resulting to price volatility. Rice has been one of the worst hit with prices jumping
50% towards the end of March 2008 and at least doubling since 2004 an Associated Press report
stated.

3.      While the Philippines experienced slower growth rates during the onset of the global
financial crisis, it did not go through a recession unlike many of the major economies in East
Asia. Reasons identified for such resilience of the domestic economy include: (i) sound
fundamentals in the banking sector; (ii) domestic consumption as the main driver of growth; and
(iii) Overseas Filipino Workers’ (OFW) remittances did not contract as expected during the
crisis. Nevertheless, despite the avoidance of a recession, it cannot be ignored that the impact of
the crisis on the economy and the social sector had been nonetheless severe.

4.     In response to such impact, the Government of the Philippines (GOP) launched numerous
programs specifically intended to immediately address the impact of the crisis while other
programs that already existed were expanded and intensified in terms of area or beneficiary
coverage. These programs are contained in the Economic Resiliency Plan (ERP) the GOP
introduced in 2009.

The Economic Resiliency Plan (ERP)

5.      To keep the economy afloat, the government adopted an economic stimulus package
called the Economic Resiliency Plan (ERP), a pump-priming program with a total budget of
PhP330 billion or an estimated 4% of GDP. The ERP involved not only the frontloading of, but
likewise an increase in the spending of the 2009 budget on items that include infrastructure

39
     Prepared by DOF’s International Finance Group and submitted to World Bank on August 29, 2011.

                                                        28
projects, expansion of social protection programs, tax cuts for less than minimum wage earners,
and emergency job creation.

6.      The PhP330 billion is allocated as follows: (i) PhP160 for an increased budget for
infrastructure, agriculture, social protection, health and education sectors for quick job creation;
(ii) PhP20 billion for tax exemptions for low income earners and another PhP20 billion for
corporate income taxes; (iii) PhP100 billion for large infrastructure projects of the Departments
of Public Works and Highways, Transportation and Communications, Agriculture and
Education; and (iv) PhP30 billion for additional social security benefits.

7.       The Pantawid Pamilya (2Ps) Program, commonly known as the Conditional Cash
Transfer (CCT) Program of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) was
among the existing programs of the government expanded under the ERP. Launched in 2008, the
first set of 330,000 poor households identified through the proxy means test (PMT) benefited
from cash grant (PhP6,000 health grant and PhP3,000 education grant yearly) upon full
compliance with the program’s conditions. The second set increased the coverage for another
320,000 households in 2009. According to DSWD, coverage has now grown to about 2.3 million
household beneficiaries.

Typhoons Pepeng and Ondoy in 2009

8.      Two major cyclones that hit the country in 2009 further added to the strains of the
financial crisis. Typhoon Pepeng (Ketsana) that made landfall in September resulted to severe
flooding mostly in the Metro Manila area and displaced about 1.8 million people. After only a
week, Typhoon Ondoy (Parma) in October 2009 hit the northern provinces of Luzon, further
aggravating the flooding and damage already brought by Pepeng and causing landslides that left
roads impassable and increasing the number of displaced residents. According to the National
Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC), these two typhoons resulted in approximately PhP38
billion in damages. While relief resources were immediately mobilized and deployed to the
affected areas, and the government implemented additional measures in 2009 and 2010, such as
supplemental budget allocation and other additional financings and aid options to mitigate the
damage caused by these storms.

9.      It was under these circumstances that the Economic Stimulus Fund (ESF) was created by
Congress in the 2009 General Appropriations Act. Congress approved a supplemental budget
amounting to PhP10.07 billion, mainly to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts
needed after the onslaught of the typhoons. It likewise intended to continue funding other on-
going projects complementing the ERP such as scholarships, training programs, reintegration
programs for displaced OFWs, construction of school buildings, medical assistance to remote
areas, food production and DENR support for the protection of forests, marine and watershed
areas and recycling of agriculture waste products.

Other Programs and Policies during the crisis

10.    The government made sure that there were enough safeguards in place to prevent some
people from taking advantage of the crisis by raising prices of basic goods and services. The

                                                29
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) closely and regularly monitored the prices of basic
commodities. President Arroyo then imposed price ceiling on basic commodities under the Price
Act or Republic Act 7581. Shortly thereafter, the President signed Executive Order 839
instructing all oil companies to keep the prices of all petroleum products temporarily at 15
October 2009 levels. It must be noted though that both Presidential actions were a month later
after receiving heavy criticisms from the affected sectors.

11.     Related to the government’s continuing effort to limit rice importation and attain rice
self-sufficiency by 2013, the government launched in early 2008 a program called FIELDS or
the Fertilizer, Infrastructure/Irrigation, Extension/Education, Loans, Drying and other post-
harvest facilities and Seeds) program. Under the ERP, PhP44 billion was earmarked to fund
FIELDS.

DPO Program Performance – Borrower’s Assessment

12.     Against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and significant reconstruction funding
requirements following the aftermath of Typhoons Pepeng and Ondoy in 2009, the GOP received
financial assistance from the World Bank through a US$200 Development Policy Operation
(DPO) loan under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) facility and a US$250
million Supplemental Financing for post-typhoon recovery efforts. Both financing were released
as budgetary support to finance existing and already approved budget items focused on social
protection and allowed the release of unprogrammed budgetary funds to support the
reconstruction expenditure program.

13.    The approval and release of the GFRP in 2009 showed the rapid response of the Bank to
our request for assistance to cushion the impact of the food crisis. Immediately thereafter, the
Bank was ready to mobilize other development partners in conducting the post disaster needs
assessment (PDNA) resulting from the typhoons. The PDNA unlocked another opportunity for
the Philippines to tap concessional financing to fund unexpected reconstruction additional and
expenditures from the calamities through the Supplemental DPO.

14.     It must be highlighted that the Bank’s responsiveness came at a time when the GOP was
embarking on a huge economic stimulus package to weather the global financial crisis. Because
of this simultaneous occurrence, it can be said that the DPOs complemented the ERP and the
ESF in 2009 by providing the source to unlock the “unprogrammed” expenditures brought about
by the crisis. Thus, the Borrower’s assessment of the DPOs will be linked to the implementation
of the programs contained and supported by the ERP and ESF.

15.    The GFRP supported the expansion of the CCT program, scaling up the coverage by
321,000 identified poor households in 2009 as envisioned in the ERP. To date, the program is
being implemented nationwide in all 17 regions, 79 provinces, 939 municipalities and 75 cities
bringing a total of 2.2 million registered beneficiary households as of 10 July 2011. According to
DSWD, they will need more than PhP21 billion in funds to further expand the program in the
coming years.

16.     The DPO was able to provide the funding necessary to address the supply side strategy in
increasing food production that include repair and rehabilitation of irrigation facilities, training
on inter-cropping, seed subsidies through the FIELDS program. It also supported the delivery of
food through farm-to-market roads, barangay food stores and the Food for School Program of the
Department of Education.

17.    Reducing poverty and inclusive growth remains important in the current administration’s
development priorities as reflected in the Philippine Development Plan 2011-2016, supported by
the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Philippines for 2010-2012.

18.    As the country remains vulnerable to natural catastrophies, immediate access to quick
disbursing financing facilities such as the Bank’s Supplemental DPOs will continue to be
relevant and an important source of funding for unprogrammed/unanticipated expenditures.


Borrower’s Comments on the Draft ICR40

On page 18, Section 2.3, paragraph 50, it was mentioned that the monitoring and evaluation of
the progress of program implementation were done looking at activities under related projects
such as the SWDRP. To be consistent, we have likewise used as reference the NEDA Project
Monitoring Staff evaluation report as of December 2010 and the SWDRP Implementation
Review Mission Report dated October 2010 to come up with the following observations:

1.      The CCT Program disbursement under the SWDRP US$405.0 million loan remains low
at 15% as of October 2010 due to, among others, lower compliance rate and reduction of the
number of households and the average number of children in households. This is despite the
significant increase in the budget allocation for the CCT Program in 2009 and 2010.There may
be questions on absorptive capacity on the part of DSWD which may require further discussions
with the view to facilitate use of the funds being made available under the loan.

2.     Another delay on the impact evaluation and 4Ps spot checks due to the slow procurement
process and delays in the data collection was reported in October 2010 SWDRP Implementation
Review Mission Report. This is crucial as it would be of interest for us to determine even at this
early stage, if possible, the project's relevance to the over-all social protection program.
However, we note that despite this constraint, the compliance level remains satisfactory as
reported at this point.
