The lessons learned\n            indicate that the decentralization of urban rail systems\n            from the Federal to the State or a lower level of government\n            is desirable because it brings the operator closer to the\n            users, thus allows for the service to be more responsive to\n            user needs and wishes. The bus and metro operators in the\n            Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Region (BHMR) have more or less\n            regularly met throughout the implementation of the project\n            under the auspices of a commission operated as a thematic\n            chamber of Metropolitan Assembly of the Belo Horizonte\n            Metropolitan Region (AMBEL). One of the reasons for the\n            success of Belo Horizonte Municipal Transport and Transit\n            Company (BHTRANS) was the courage of the mayor's office\n            of Belo Horizonte to prevent and eliminate the proliferation\n            of informal transport. It is a good idea to build a strong\n            communication program and linkages to affected communities\n            in order to create a favorable atmosphere for negotiations."}, "docdt": "2004-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
