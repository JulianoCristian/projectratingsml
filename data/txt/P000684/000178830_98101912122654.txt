IMPE1aAL BOARD OF TELECOMUNiMC.MTIONS OF E±HIOPTi
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOKUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMARY AN) CONCLUSIONS
i.        The project appraised in this report is the first phase (1974-
1977) of the Fifth Telecommunications Develop-ment Program (1974-78) of
the Imperial Board of Telecomnications of Ethiopia (IBrE).  An IDA credit
of US$21.4 million is proposed to help finance this program.
ii.       This would be the fifth Bank Group project for telecommunica-
tions development in Ethiopia. The fourth project, financed under Loan
605-ET initiated in 1969, is proceeding satisfactorily though a few items
earlier planned for completion in 1973 are now expected to be completed
in late 1974.
iii.      The Fifth Development Program (1974-78) proposes to extend and
improve service to meet demand in the areas now being served and to extend
service to some of the areas of the interior of the oountry where tele-
communications services are sparse or nonexistent. The program includes
the addition of 39,800 automatic and 4,500 manual exchange lines; four new
microwave systems extending good qulaity communications to new areas of
the country; and an earth satellite station which will greatly improve in-
ternational cormni cations.
i-v.      The Program has been divided into two overlapping phases.  The
timing and cemposition of these phases have been chosen to allowJ adequate
procurement lead times and meet service target dates. The first phase
constitutes the project appraised in this report.
v.        The project includes the installation of 29,300 watomatic and
4,500 manual exchange 1ines; two microwave systems and an earth satelli te
station
vi.       The estimated cost of the project is US$37.1 million equivaleJ2t
including a foreign exchange cost of US$22.9 rl,lion equivalent.  The xmounv
proposed for an IDA credit, US$21.4.r m1llion, 2oald cover the foreign s:x-
change requirement exclusive of certain facilities which have alreadq  bee-
contracted.
vii.      The second phase of the Fifth Development Program, schec_a1d
for implementation during 19?5-78 will be considared for financing b:y the
World Bank Group in the Bank Fiscal Year 1975, subject to oonfirzation
of continued priority for the program.



- ii4-
viii.     The borrower would be the Government of Ethiopia, which would
relend the funds to the beneficiary, IBTE, which vould be responsible Ior
execution of the project.
ix.       All procurement under the credit would be through international
competitive bidding with the exception of the provision of extension equip-
ment for existing telephone exchanges and transmission systems. This
equipment, estimated at US$1.3 million (6% of the proposed credit), would
be procured from the original suppliers for reasons of compatibility and
economy.
xo        As a part of the international competitif  bidding, options
will be obtained for the purchase of equipment for the second phase,
thereby eliminating the need for a second round of cmpetittve bidding
if the second phase is approved later for Bank Group financing ad as-
suring IBTE of the benefits cif standardization.
Xi.       The forecasts indicate that tariff revision will be required
daring the later half of the program period in order to ensure the finan-
cial viability of the entity. Assuming the necessary action is taken,
the project is technica1ly and financially sound. The mdnimum estimate
of economic return is at least 15% using shadow prices reflecting a 33%
premium on the foreign exchange component.
xii.      Provided that the assurances in Section 7 are obtained during
negotiations, the project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$21.4 million.



ErOPIA
IMPERIAL BOARD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF ErHIOPIA
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
l. INTIlDUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ethiopia has requested IDA assistance in
financing a project comprising  the first phase of the telecommunications de-
velopment program for the period 1974W-78. This program will be undertaken
by the Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (ITrE);, which
provides all public telecommunications services within Ethiopia and with
other countries.
1.02      The Bank Group has made four loans for telecommunications
development in Ethiopia. The first loan, for US$1.5 million, was made
in 1951 to the Empire of Ethiopia to help finance a project wiich was
completed in 1956. The next three loans were made directly to IETE. The
second loan, 314-ET for US$2.9 million, was made in 1962 and was related
to a project which was completed in 1965. The third loan, 441-ET for
US$4.8 million, was made in 1965 and was related to a project completed
in 1969. The fourth loan, 605-ET for US$4,5 million with participation
from the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA), who provided
an equal amount,was made in 1969 to cover part of the foreign oost of the
1968-72 expansion program. Progress on the project has been satisfactory;
however, certain items originally scheduled for conpletion in 1973 have
been delayed by about one year and are not expected to be completed until
late 1974.
1.03      The Fifth Development Program (1974-78) would extend and improve
service to meet demand in areas now being served and extend services to
some areas in the interior of the country where telecommunications services
are sparse or nonexistent. It would also provide high quality telecommuni-
cationa to other ccsntries throu&h use of an earth satellite station.
1.04      The estimated cost of the project is Eth$76.8 (US$37.1) million
with a foreign exchange component of Eth$47.3 (US$22.9) million. An IDA
credit of Eth$44.3 (US$21.4) million is proposed to cover the foreign exchange
0o0t8 exclusive of certain facilities which have already been corntracted.
1.05      IBTE was established in 1952 to comply with a condition of the
first Bank loan agreement. It is responsible for all public telecozmiuni-
cation services in Ethiopia and would be the beneficiary of the proposed
credit. The borrower would be the Government of Ethiopia.
1.06      This report is based on information obtained from IBTE and on the
findings of missions composed of Messrs. B. Johnsson and R. C. Mitchell which
visited Ethiopia in January and July 1973. Mr. H. Jansson of SIDA accompanied
the January mission.

2.  THE ECONOMY Ali THE SECTOR
The P>ooXn
2.01      The 1npire of Ethiopia, situated in the northeastern part of
Africa south of the Red Sea, covers an area of about 1.22 million kn2 
consisting of highlands and plateau except in the easternmost part and
along the Red Sea, where the topography changes into lowlands.  The two
most important cities and industrial centers ae Addis Ababa, the capital
and Asmara, in the province of Eritrea. The co-ntry's most important
ports are Massawa and Assab, both on the Red Sea. Agriculture is spread
throughout the country except for tne less-fertile southeastern region,
2.02      The principal inidustry is agiculture, which is the livelihood
for 92% of the population,, Coffee is the principal export product, pro-
viding 60% of Ethiopia's foreign exchange earnings. In the immediate future,
however, the growth of coffee exports probably will not exceed 2% per year;
hence it will be necessary to develop other commodities to supplement coffee
exports.  Unlike many other developing countries5 Ethiopia has the potential
to diversify into other products such as livestock, pulses and oilseeds.
To support its overall goal of a 6% annual growth rate over the next five
-years, it is estimated that Ethiopia miust maintain an export growth rate of
8%. The per capita GNP was about US$80.00 in 1970.
2.03      Wlth its excellent climate, scenic beaaty, historical relics
and proximity to the East Africa tourist flow, Ethiopia appears to have
a potential for the development of tourism.
2.04      An adequate telecomunication network is required to support
the economic development of the country. The difficult topography, the
wide area over which agriculture is distributed and the scarcity of good
allweather roads makes telecomnications particularly important for
coordinating the movement, distribution and marketing of agricultural
and other products. Also, industry, commerce and the young tourism in-
dustry will make increasing demand on adequate national and international
telecommunication facilities.
The Telecommunication Sector
2.05      IBTE was established in 1952 as a condition of the first Bank
loan to Ethiopia for telecommunications. It is solely responsible for all
public telecommunications services in 2.blopia and between Ethiopia and
other countries. IBTE is organized as a Government owned commercial
corporation under overall direction of the M.nisty of Commuications and
has considerable autonomy to administer its day-to-day operations. Addi-
tional details of the organization and managernt of IBTE are set out in
paragraph 5.01.
Excisting Telecomminication Facilities
2.06      As of December 31, 1972, Ethiopia had atfbout 54%500 telephone
stations, giving a telephone density of 10.2 per 100 population.  Only five



-3 -
of the 38 other African countries for which statistics are available have
lower telephone densities. Comparative figures for other developing coun-
tries are given in Annex 1.
2.07      About 88% of the subscribers are connected to automatic telephone
exchanges, which provide good local service. The long distance network and
the international routes are very congested and in some cases the service
is extremely poor. Basic data on IBTE and information on the existing
facilities are set out in Annexes 2 and 3. The main routes of the long dis-
tance network are shown on Map IBRD 10405.
Local Telephone Service
2.08      At the end of 1972, Ethiopia had 17 automatic telephone exchanges,
two of which are in Addis Ababa. The installed capacity was 52,790 lines,
35,500 of them in Addis Ababa. Most of the equipment is of the modern cross-
bar type; it is well maintained and should provide good service for many
years.
2.09      There are 255 manual exchanges, with an installed capacity of
10,840 lines, serving the small towns and rural areas. Service is usually
provided only in the daytime.
2.10      The outside plant is in reasonably good condition, particularly
in the main cities where underground pressurized cables are used. The
cable fill is high, in some areas reaching 100%.
Long Distance Service
2.11      The long distance network consists of the recently inaagurated
microwave system linking Addis Ababa and Asmara, a number of VHF systems
and open-wire lines, which are supplmented by carrier systems on main routes.
The network oomprises 137,670 trunk-circuit kilometers.
2.12      The microwave system, Addis Ababa to Asmara, provides good service
between the two largest cities in the country. Three other microwava sys-
tems will be put in service in August 1974 and will improve service between
Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa/Harar, Jima and Shashamane. The four microwave
systems are all part of IBIE's Fourth Development Program (1968-72) financed
by a previous Bank loan.
2.13      Three automatic trunk exchanges were put in service in May 1973.
Along with the microwave systems, they made possible subscriber trunk
dialing (STD) between the most important cities in Ethiopia. The com-
pletion of these works will also facilitate future provision of good
quality long distance service to new areas.
Telegraph and Telex Service
2.14      Telegraph service is provided over the telephone network and HF



radio. I=tellation of a GEWLEX network with terminals in 14 cities is
almost completed.
2.15      Telex service is offered .from one automatic exchange in Addis
Ababa and from manmal exchanges in Asmara, Assab and Dire Dawa. The
number of telex subscribers at the end of 1972 was 220. An order has been
placed for axtension of the Addis Ababa exchange by 200 lines. The service
offered to the subscribers connected to the manal exchanges is poor,
partly due to congestior in the long distance telex network.
International Services
2.16      International telephone, telegraph and telex service is offered
via HF radio to 19 destinations abroad. The present facilities do not
meet the demand and booked calls are frequently cancelled dae to unaccept-
ably long waiting times.

3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      IBTE's Fifth Development Program for the five-year period 1974-78
aims to meet the anticipated growth of demand for telephone connections and
of traffic and to help to provide improved quality of service by expanding
and modernizing the telecommunications network in the country. The program
has been largely drawn up by IBTE; foreign experts have assisted in the
survey of routes for the microwave systems and in carrying out feasibility
studies for an earth satellite station.
3.02      The program comprises the following main items:
(a)  installation of 39,800 automatic and about 4,500 manual local
exchange lines;
(b)  installation of six new microwave and VHFAJHF links and
expansion and reconstruction of existing long distance network;
(c)  expansion of the telex network; and
(d)  installation of an earth satellite station for international
traffic.
3.03      The Fifth Development Program has been divided into two over-
lapping phases. Its total cost is estimated at Eth$113.6 (US$54.9) million
with a foreign exchange component of Eth$72.8 (US$35.2) million. The
timing and composition of the two phases have been chosen to allow for
adequate procurement lead times and meet service target dates. The first
phase constitUtes the project being appraised in this report.
The Project
3.04      The project provides for the expansion of the telecommunications
facilities to meet the demand during approximately the first three years..
1974-76, of the program period, however some of the physical worlk will not
be completed until the end of 1977. Dae to relatively long delivery and
installation times for wvitching equipment, the project provides for sanme
overlapping with the next project period. The capacity of the earth
satellite station is sufficient to meet the demand up to 1979. Details of
the project are given in Annex 4.
3.05      The project includes:
(a)  installation of automatic telephone exchange equipment for
29,300 lines and manual switchboards for about 4,500 local lines
(b)  extension of local cable distribution networks, cable pres-
surization equipment and subscribers plant for about 27,000 new
subscribers stations;



- 6 -
(c)  instalation of microwave systems for the Amara-Tessenei and
Dlese-Assab routes; multiplex equipment for about 720 channel
ends on microwave systems; line carrier equipment for about
200 system channels; extensions and reconstruction of the
open-wire netvork and installation of automatic trunk switching
equipment for Shashanane;
(d)  teleprinters; telex and telegraph extension equipment; and
(e) installation of an earth satellite station, including a SPADE
terminall// an international telephone exchange for semi-
automatic operation, an interconnecting microwave syrstem and
consultants  assistance.
Cost of the Project
3.o6      The estimated cost of the project is Eth$76.8 (US$37.1) million
equivalent. Details are given below.

3.07      The cost estimates are based largely on prices IBTE has obtained
for similar equipment under international competitive bidding during the
ongoing project and have been adjusted to reflect the effects of currency
parity changes up to the end of July 1973. For new types of equipment,
the estimates have been based on preliminary price quotations from possible
suppliers. The cost estimates are realistic.
Y  Satellite conmunication provides two types of facilities.  For desti-
nations with high trafffic the economic method is to use a block of circuits
on a whole time basis. More recently a special facility, SPADE, permits
economic traffic routing to other destinations by which circuits are made
available on demand onlr for the duration of the calls providing for time
sharing of circuits with other satellite users.



3.08      IBTEts development program wil  Comprise instlaations at a great
number of locations every year. The possible increases of costs in specific
areas is likely to be compensated by reductions elsewhere. A physicnl
contingency, US$1.3 millio4 has however been included to cover costs of
meeting higher than anticipated traffic on tie long distance service, where
the forecast of demd has been conservative, and for a change in pattern of
traffic in the Addis Ababa network vhich might necessitate engineering changes.
3.09      Due to the present uncertain price level of telecommunications
materials, a price contingency of about 7% has been included in the foreign
costs.  The price contingency for local costs, 5%, will primarily cover
unforeseen increases in prices for acquisitcion of land and costs of transport.
Cost of labor has been stable in Ethiopia dur±ng the last few years and no
changes are foreseen.
Items for IDA Financing
3.10      Besides the local cost of the project, IBTE will finance the
following purchases costing Eth$3.0 million (US$1.4) million:
(a)  5,300 lines local automatic exchange equipment;
(b) about 600 lines local manual exchange equipment (demand for
1974); and
(c) local network and subscribers' plant (part of demand for 1974).
lhe balance of the foreign cost US$21.4 million equivalent, is proposed for
financing under the credit.
Procurement
3 1.      All goods financed by the IDA credit would be procursd tUroug.gh
international bidding, with the exception of extension equip&ent for astig,
telephone exchanges and tranmission systems and for special test equipmezro
and instruments-  These items, which are estimated to cost US$1,3 :2M0on or
about 6% of the IDA credit, Vill be procured through negotiation from -the
original suppliers. Negotiated procurGment .8s Austiied by the fact that the
initial installations, while designed to meet ultimate capacity raeuirenzs,
provided only for initial needs ard economics id.11 therefore resut from t a
use of existing common equipment, power supplies, rack space and othILer O-'t
items. In order to achieve these economies, it is sssenti ;2 stc;.at
additi6ns be of the same type for reasons of compatibility.
3.12      IBTE has alreadzy sc. a contract for t:ae supply oaf 5 3 00 Ie
of local automatic exchange equiXaent (para. 3.-10 (a)). 'Ihe bulk oI -he
apparatus and material for manual exchanges, subsc:bIos' plant ancd net' or
expansion (para. 3.10 (b) and (c)) has already been purchased and is available
in IBTE's stores.



- 8 -
3.13      In order to expedite the procurement process for the second phase
of the program and to allow the IBTE to standardize equipment, IBTE will
follow international competitive bidding procedures for equipment to be
financed under the project (the First Phase of the Program) and at the same
time obtain options for purchase of equipment to be financed under the
Second Phase, thereby eliminating the need for a second round of intar-
national competitive bidding when financing is arranged for the second phase.
Disbursement
3 .l4     The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed against the CIF cost
of imported equipment and the foreign cost of imported services. The
estimated schedule of disbursement is shown in Annex 5. Any unused balance
of the credit should be made available, after consultation with IDA, for
the purchase of additional goods and services, similar to those already
procured under the credit.
3.15      In order to conform to the procurement and construction schedule
for the satellite earth station, consultants will have to be employed as
soon as possible. Therefore expenditures might be incurred before loan
approval. An amount which would not exceed Eth$0.10 (US$0.5) million has
been provided for this retroactive financing.
Execution of the ProJect
3.16      Competent staff is available within IBTE for the preparation of
bidding documents, bid evaluation and detailed engineering of the project
with the exception of the earth satellite station, for which assistance
by a consultant is foreseen as necessary. The routes for the microwave
systems have already been surveyed by ITU and a Japanese consulting team
sponsored by the Government of Japan.
3.17      The equipment will be installed mainly by IBTEs own staff with
the assistance of the suppliers.  The construction schedule is given in
Chart WB-7596.

4. JUSTIFICATICN
4.01      The basic justification for the project is to support Ethiopias
development objectives by providing an essential service for industry,
trade, agriculture and tourism. Efficient organization for the production,
transportation, distribution and marketing of agriculture goods depends on
rapid and reliable access to various points serving industry. The present
inadequate telecommunicatiorn facilities hamper soth flow ox' the necessar
inputs to production. The improved and expanded telscommunication facil-
ities will also help in meeting the requirements of industry and adinistration
as well as of health and other social services.
4.02      IBTEIs current project mould assist in the economic development
of the proovinces through improved long distance services and extension of
services to about 100 rural areas which have no telephones now.  The pro-
ject provides for new microwave links and additions to the backbone
microwave network now being provided in the fourth project, and will give
reliable communications between the provinces concernzed and the capital.
The installation of the earth satellite station would provide economically
24 hour high quality, reliable international talecomunications to edstIng
and new destinations in America, Erope, Africa and part of Asia and  auld
be a great help in the promotion of exports and tourism.
Market Demand
Local Service
4.03      The actual telephones installed over the period '1968-71 averaged
about 122% pe- amux  with a small nmarber of waiting applications for tele-
phone service. IBTE have carried out detailed development stud.es of
subscriber and traffic demands in each exchange area, considered past grorth
trends and have forecast an average rate of growth during the program paieod
of 11%, about the same level as during 1968-71. Tnis forecast appea
reasonable. The project and its tldng are designed to meet these d&aiMs
for the first part of the program period and the loc00g. sir_C otcs
installed provides for an appropriate overlap to taa last paz. ot tU
period. Chart WB-7595 gives the actual and estiMat-ed teleapone ' iza
service during the period 1960-80.
Long Distance Service
4.04      IBTE have proposed  - increase Ln the nu:dber of long dista{e
circuits based on traffic projections on each route  a}ng int.order-
ation all the circuits whiach iJold be available orn coupetiorn ofaczfne
raicrowave comunmication systems pro7idad n.. t':hLe fourth -p.t
additional circuits would remove congestioia on various :outas. deZLa-e L
obtaining service and generally Izprove senrice and me the additional
growth during the period. One o  t:-e microwave links included in tk
project will also be utilized for t1he plamned Pan Africa  Net r    he. The
average annual growth rate of circuits is about 18%, which can be considered



reasonable. Chart WB-7595 gives the actual and estimated growth of t^he
long distance network during the period 1960-78.
Telegraph and Telex Service
4.05      The expansion of telegraph service is confined to providing access,
often the only one, to business users and for acuinistrative and social
services purposes in remote areas of the counmty.
4.06      The number of telex subscribers has increased by 1L% anuaZly
during the last four years. Since the backlog of demands has already been
met, IBTE have now forecast a 12% annual growth for telex subscribers for
the project period based on demands and applications for this service arge
in Addis Ababa. This is reasonable and the project is aimed to satisly this
demnd. Chart WB-7595 gives the actual and estimated telex lines during the
period 1963-80.
International Communications
4.07      Despite several limitations in the quality of international
service provided currently through HF radio, international telephone traffic
increased 16% and telex traffic 24% annually, during 1967-71. The ex'Isting
plant has not been able to meet the demand. This has resulted in long
waiting periods, sometimes more than 24 hours, and a generally unacceptable
quality of service.
4.08      To provide for 24 hour service and Improve reliability of inter-
national communications, IBTE,in accordance vith current trends in all
countries, has provided for the installation of an earth satellite station.
Based on experience in other countries and on expert advice from consul-
tants, IBTE has planned circuits to cater for a 100% traffic increase in
the first year of operations, 50% in the second year, 30% in the third
year and 20% in each of the following years. The cost for providing high
quality international service via satellite is for all practical purposes,
a one time investment (about 18% of the cost of the current project).
Further growth of traffic can be handled with additions of multiplex
equipment at marginal costs.
Least Cost Solution
4.09      The basic structure of EShiopia's telecommunications network -ias
been drawn up some years ago to provide for continuous economic expansion
based on long-term forecast demand. Numbering, transmission and routing
plans have been careful3y considered and are appropriate for the countzr.
The choice of comon control switching systems, made prior to 1953, z
sound and the principal long distance routes are being established to
provide for easy and economic extensic,r
4.10      The planning of the local network and location of exchange3 i
Addis Ababa city area has been based on a study of demands for telephones
made block by block. The results from this study have been computed tO
give the least combined cost for local network and switching equipment.



- i.3 -
In other parts of the country additions to existing exchnges and opendng
of new ones have been designed in accordance with standard plant practices
to provide for least cost.
4.11      Microwave equip1en' has been provided on certain links as few
roads exist and the area is generally mountainous making the use of cable
routes expensive and less reliable. This solution represents the least
expensive alternative.
4.12      The earth satellite station represents the best solution for
providing international telephone, telegraph and telex connections to
distant destinations. Further with the installation of a SPADE te.ninal
international comunications could be set up directly at small marginal
cost to a great number of destinations which have only occasional traffic
vith Ethiopia without using expensive trans its via other countries. The
alternative to the earth station, HF radio, has several disabilities, i.e.
a lower quality of service, limitations on expansion, requires constant
operational attention and is subject to interruptions during certain hours.
IBTE has made a study of the economics of satellite versus HF comunica-
tions and has concluded that the earth satellite station is the least cost
solution,, wil. provide better and more comprehensive service and w12I be
operating profitably from the second year of operation.
Return on Investment
4.13      The internal rate of         on the project, aefed as 'he dio-
count rate wich equalizes the s treax of expected revenues attribu.tabLe to
the project with t1he capital and operating costs excluding taxes, is 18%
(Annex 6). Although this rate of return is not in itself a critierion by
which the project should be accepted or rejected, it does provide an estimate
of the extent to which the Justification for investment is automatical:ly
signalled by subscribers' observed willingness to pay. So estimated. the
rate of return of 18% for the project is an indication of its aconovLc isrt0
If the foreign exchange component is shadow priced at a val:e 33% above he
estimated cost, the rate of return mould be 15%. Sensitivity ana-yses
reflecting a one year project delay and a 10, variat.ion in r3vEracv s -.iyere
made which, produced a rate of retuzrn of not less -.-n l3 9E
4.4       mThe true economic return on the -project is ho-vever undoub'edly
higher than the foregoing suggests since (a) the prices charged dlo rxot
adequately- measure the full benefits to subscribers, particularly those
obtaining access to service for the first times, (b) there are exteri
benefits which accrue to parties othter thsanr those who pay directy for use
of the facilities and (c) the costs include the ^fu  cost of ertndig
service to new areas even though the flull benefits wi±l be obtainad ony iz
the fuiture when additional !Lnes are coriected in thiose areas.  iLte ccorio-2CIC
return of at least 15% compares favorably with miarginal rates of rsturn
obtainable in other sectors of the Ethiopian economy.

5.  THE BENEFICIARY
Organization and Management
5.01      IBTE's responsibilities and its relationship with the Governnment
are set out in paragraph 2.05. The organization of IBTE is shown in
Chart WB-7542. The governing body of the corporation is the Board of
Directors, composed of five to seven members appointed by the Enperor.
The Chairman of the Board is the Minister of Communications. The General
Manager, appointed by the Board, is responsible for IBTE's management and
operations.  He has the broad authority necessary to effectively carry out
his responsibilities.
5.02      IBTE's organization is generally satisfactory and effective.
IBTE have recently taken steps to appoint a Manager of Planning and to
implement measures to strengthen the Accounting Organization. While the
changes have enabled IBTE to handle current work reasonably well, addi-
tional measures are required to consolidate the organization to make it
fully effective in these two areas. The improvements to the planning set
up are discussed in paragraph 5.03 and those relating to accounting and
other financing matters are covered in paragraphs 5.06 and 5.07.
5.03      On November 1, 1972, in accordance with the Bank's recommenda-
tions, IBTE appointed a Manager of Planning reporting directly to the
General Manager. However, the Manager of Planning has not been furnished
-with supporting staff and the planning function continues to be largely
performed in the Engineering Department. While the actual work up to now
is being handled competently, the planning staff now in the Engineering
Department should be transferred to the planning group under the Manager
of Planning to make this group efficient and effective over the long period.
In addition the relationship of the planning group to the rest of the
headquarters organization needs to be defined. IBTE is aware of these weak-
nesses and has agreed to take necessary steps to define the function of the
planning group and to provide the necessary staff to the group. Confirmation
was obtained during negotiations that an objective review of the Planning
Department by a competent consultant, defining the lines of responsibility
and the means of coordination of the function will be completed before the
end of 1974 and submitted to IDA for comment.
Staff and Training
5.04      The management of IBTE and technical staff are generally we2Z
qualified and competent. Many of them have been sent abroad for traniLng
to make them effective in their specialties. The corporation staff -'s
now composed almost entirely of Ethiopians .(there are on3ly two axpatLrateas)
5.05      The training school, started in 1953 with the assistance o-f ITU9
effectively provides instruction for about 300 students and has a teaching
staff of 14. These trainIng arrangements are adequate. The capacity of
the school is being further increased to provide for future needs and living
accommodations will be improved by the addition of a new dormitony and
restaurant in 1974.



Accounting
5.o6      IBTE have established the position of Finance Manager repo.rting
directly to the General Manager in accordance with the Bank's recommen-
dations, and have placed the Supply Division as well as the Accounting and
Data Processing Division under his direction. A Collection Department has
been established which effectively administers the collection of all
coummercial accounts. The internal audit group has matured and is adequately
performing its function. The accounting staff is qualified and well trained
and is performing reasonably well.
5.07      Improvements within the newly set up Finance Department are
planned to increase its effectiveness. These Improvements wLl relate to the
division of functions between the departmental staff and the Accounting
Division.
5.08      The accounting practices are reasonably effective.  However, due to
unsatisfactory internal procedures financial reports are issued several
months after the close of the accounting periods and are therefore of
limited value to management. The Finance Manager is aware of this situation
and is reviewing all accounting routines with a view to tne gradual revision
of those Which are cumbersome. Plans are being formulated for using the
computer for inventory control and for accounts receivable control and
account treatment.
5.09      The only major problem in the finance area is that the Finance
Manager is reaching normal retirement age and has bean continued in ahis
position by short-term contracts.  Presently there is no cndidate fo. this
position within IBTE and management has been investigating possibsle external
sources. No candidate has been located to date but managementG is confident
that a suitable replacement for this position will be located in the near
future.
Audit
5.10      An annual independenv audit of IBTE's accounts is perforai.md by
Getachew Kassage Co., a firm of certified accountants0  This ai-rangeisnt L
satisfactory to IDA. Assurances were obtained during negotiaions "that 8z^>
accounts will continue to be audited by an independent firs of audi' trs
acceptable to IDA  and that certified financial statements (ineluding hs,
auditors, opinion5 will be submitted to IDA within five months after tlh
close of each fiscal year.
Tariffs
5.13      IBTE in the past had authority to establish X  :re2,7i  its 
without Goverrment approval. A special GoCver=t ite stent e
has recently been organized to study public u4tility rates, and to eventually
serve as a regulatory authority. -However at this t&ie this new caiwnittee
is not fully organized and -no definitive information is available as to its
exact functions or responsibilities. It has not assumed any responsibility
for the establishment or regulation of communication tariff levels or



- 14 -
structure.  During negotiations Government agreed to submit a letter to MA
defining the tariff regulation responsibility of this comnittee and
providing copies of enabling legislation.
5.12      Details of the existing tariffs are given in Annex ?.  The latest
tariff revision was in 1971 when local call charges were increased by 33%.
The tariff structure as between the local rental, call charges and long
distance charges is balanced. The tariffs are on the high side as compared
with most other developing countries.  The annual income per telephone
connection (DEL) is US$226 which is significantly higher than that in most
European countries despite the considerably lower income in Ethiopia as
compared with Europe and the long distanwe service now in the early stages of
development has not made its full contribution to revenues.
5.13      The level of current tariffs does not appear to be satisfactory to
enable IBTE to earn an adequate rate of return on its investment and generate
internal cash to meet future program needs. Therefore, it -would be appro-
priate to review the tariffs when the effect of the larger availability and
lower costs arising from the introduction of the operations of the microwave
system and STD is definitely  knoiwn (see para. 6.15).
Taxes and Insurance
5.14      In the past IBTE was not subject to any form of taxation or custom
duties.  However, effective June 1, 1973 the tax and customs duty exemptions
for IBTE were abolished. The effect of the decision will be to significantly
decrease the rate of return on net plant in service of IBTE thus requiring
tariff revision during the project period (see para. 6.15).
5.15      IBTE carries comercial insurance to cover property damage and
enployee group insurance. The property damage insurance provides full
coverage for al risks.



- 15 -
6. FINANCES
6.01      The level of tariffs in the period 1968-72 allowed IBrE to earn a
satisfactory rate of return (ratio of net operating income to value of net
plant in service) varying fonm 10.7% to 12.3% annually and the internally
generated funds during this period were sufficient after servicing all debt
to provide for 60% of the funds required for development. The forecasts
indicate that as a result of the recent tax legislation (see para. 5.14)
the current level of tariffs will not provide an adequate rate of return on
net plant in service through the last half of the program period (see
para. 6.15) and a tariff revision will be necessaryo
Past Earnings
6.02      In accordance with a covenant in the Joint Financing Agreement for
the fourth project, IBTE was required to produce a rate of return of not less
than 9% on its net fixed assets. IBTE exceeded this requirement in all years,
as follows:
Year       Rate of Return
1968           11.0%
1969           10 . 7%
1970           11.1%
1971           12.4%
1972           12.3%
IBTE had no tax liability during this period and the continuance of tis
requirement after reflecting the tax requirement would be unrealistic.
Detailed income statements for the years 1970-72 are included in Annex 8.
Collection Performance
6.03      There has been substantial improvement in IHTE's collection
practices since the fourth project. The aged accounts receivable do -not
completely reflect this improvement since they contain a substantial amount
of old weakly documented accounts which have doubtfuLl value. Presently 305
of the balance is over 120 days old and many of these accounts date back
several years. IBrE is now reviewing these accounts and those which cannot
be properly supported will be written off.  The first of these wnite-off's
(Eth$358,000) was made in the first quarter of 1973. Current billings are
being collected on a timely basis or the service of the delirnquent sub-
scriber is being terminated thus limiting in the future the magnitude of
uncollectable accounts.
6.04      The collections of Government accounts have impzrved significantly
since the fourth program. We anticipate that further improvementG will be



- 16 -
made since IBTE adopted the new practice of sending a monthly notice to th6
Finance Ministry on the status of all Government accounts. The Finance
Ministry now makes direct payment for services to all budgetary supported
agencies and follows up with any delinquent department or agency. IBTE has
renegotiated the contract with the Broadcasting Authority establishing the
billing on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis and providing for the
charging of interest at 8% per armum on late payments. In addition to these
steps and in view of the large program being undertaken and IBTV's need for aUl
its resources to contribute toward the program's financing, Government agreed
during negotiations to include a covenant in the onlending agreement that
they vould take the necessary steps to ensure the settlement of arrea-- smd
the payment of current accounts on a timely basis.
Financial Position
6.05      The estimated financial position of IBTE at December 31, 1972 is
sumaraized below. A detailed statement is shown in Annex 9.

6.06      Plant additions prior to December 31, 1967 are valued at the
appraisal value at that date and all subsequent additions are valued at =est.
Accumulated depreciation is 40% of gross value. Both of these valuatione
appear reasonable.

- 17 -
capital was increased at December 31, 1967, to Eth$20 million by capitalizing
part of the Renewals and Expansion Reserve accumulated from earnings retained
by IBTE in order to enable IBTE to incur additional debt. The share capital
will again have to be increased to allow for the lending proposed for the
Fifth Development Program. IBTE plans to increase its share capital to
Eth$40 million during 1973 by again capitalizing part of the Renewals and
Expansion Reserve. The Government will provide DA with copies of legis-
lation authorizing the increase in share capital by capitalizing a portion of
the Renewals and Expansion Reserve as a condition for making the credit
agreement effective.
Financing Plan
6.o8      The forecast of sources and application of funds for the period
1970-81 is given in Annex 10. A summary for the program period 1974-78 is

6.09      The above financing plan estizaates that 38% of the requirements
will be provided from internally generated funds.  Another 4% will be
obtained by a reduction in working capital, principally made possible by
reduction in inventory and cash balances reflecting improved resource
management. The remaining 58% of the requirement will be provided by
external firancing - 4% from IBRD/SIDA Loan 605-ET, 34% from the proposed
credit and 20% from the financing of Phase II which is scheduled to be
considered for an DA credit during the Bank fiscal year 1975.

6.10      The debt/equity ratio during the program period vii vary from
38/62 at December 31, 1974, to 52/48 at December 31, 1978. This is satis-
factory. Internal cash generation wil cover annnul debt service at least
2.4 times during each year of the period. The debt service covenant of the
Joint Financing Agreemant for Loan 605-ET reqaires IBTE to obtain the Bank's
agreemmt before contracting new debt unless the debt service coverage as
usually defined exceeds 1.5. During negotiations it ma agreed that the
new credit agremet will contaln a simila  cvenant.
6.11      The relending tezms for the proceeds of the proposed credit were
agreed during negotiations to be 20 years, including a five-year grace period,
with an interest rate of 7V2, the current Bank rate.

6.13      Operating revenues during the program period are estimated to
increase at an average annual rate of 12.9% as a result of the expanded
network, improved long distance facilities and the provision of good cor-
munications with other countries. At the same time operating expenses
exclusive of depreciation are projected to increase at an average rate of
3.4.l% annually of which 5.7% can be attributed to the change in tax practices
applicable to IBTE's operations. Depreciation has been estimated to increase
to Lth$10.5 million in 1978 from Bth$4.3 million in 1972 due to the increased
value of the plant in service and to the increase in the composite depreci-
ation rate to 4.25% in 1973 and 4.5% in 1976.
6.14      The construction program during 1973-78 will result in more than
doubling the value of gross plant in service from Eth$104 million to
Eth$249 million. The net value of plant in service (after deducting
accumulated depreciation) will increase to Eth$164 million from Eth$63
million. As a result of these factors, particularly the increase in the
level of expenses resulting from the removal of IBTE's tax exemption, the
rate of return declines from 12.3% in 1972 to less than 6% in 1978 if tariffs
were to .rma;n at the existing Levels.
6.15     The plant placed in service in this program understandably winl
not be oompleitely utilized by the end of the program period (1978) therefore
significant revenue increases can be anticipated as a result of greater
utilization during the imoediate subsequent period. However, it is not
anticipated ttat these increases will be sufficient to provide funds to
service IBTE's increased debt and to provide the necessary contribution to
the forthcoming Telecomdniation Development Program VI. Daring negoti-
ations agreaient was reached that IBTE will maintain revenues aufficient to

produce an annual rate of return of 7% until the project is completed at
which time the requirement will be increased to 8% for that and all sub-
sequent periods. It is anticipated that the requirement will probably make
necessary a telephone tariff increase of from 6 to 8% in 1976 followad by an
additional increase of from 8 to 10% in 1978.
Fiscal Impact
6.16      Up to now IBTE has not made a significant contribution to Govern-
ment's revenues although since 1951 it has not required any Government funds
for its operations or expansion programs. The forecast for the period
1973-81 reflects a change in the Government's taxing policy making IBTE
subject to all taxation usual to a commercial operation.  As a result of the
change IBTE will contribute over Eth$59 million to Government in the form of
taxes during this period. In addition Government receipts will be increased
by an estimated Eth$27.9 million by payment of interest due to the onlending
of the proposed IDA credit and subsequent Phase II financing at Bank rates.
Perfonmance indicators which can be used to measure future perfonmance are
shown in Annex 11.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMME1ATIONS
7.01      Daring credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following principal points:
(a)  independent auditing and financial reporting arrangement will
be continued (para. 5.10);
(b)  Government will take all measures necessary to ensure payment
of government accounts (para. 6.o4);
(c)  existing debt limitations will be continued (para. 6.10);
(d)  the proceeds of the credit will be onlent to IBTE on current
Bank tents (para. 6.11); and
(e)  a rate of return of 7% will be maintained until completion
of the program when the rate of return requirement will be
increased to 8% (para. 6.15).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the credit is the enactment
by Government of legislation authorizing IBTE to increase its share
capital in order to make the proposed borrowing comply with the provis-
ions of the corporate charter (para. 6.07).
7.03      With the indicated assurances and confirmations, the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of US$21.4 million.

Total       52,790                          181
The average percent exchange fill is 65% is reasonable considering
the extensive expansion of the automatic exchanges in 1972.
The automatic exchange equipment is the modern crossbar type,
with the exception of Harrar, Jima and 9,500 lines in the Filwoha ex-
change where Ericsson's 500-point selector system is used.
The manual exchanges are mostly of the magneto type. Exchange
capacities vary from 5 to 200 lines. Service is usually provided only
during daytime. The distribution of the manual exchanges in the different
regions is given belows
Number of
Region                                                  Exchanges
Addis Ababa                                                  68

Total         255
2. Long Distance Service
The present long distance network is mainly based on the recently
inaugurated microwave system linking Addis Ababa and Asmara and on open-wire
lines using oopper or copperwelded wires, supplemented by 1-12 channel
open-wire carrier systems. Other microwave links to connect the cities of
Harrar, Jima and Shashamane to Addis Ababa will be completed by August 1974.
VHF multi-channel radio systems of varying capacities are in-
stalled on 15 routes. Single-channel VHF radio is also used to connect
remote 5- and 10-line manual exchanges to the long distance network. At
the end of 1972 the long distance network comprised 137,670 trunk-circuit
kilometers. Subscriber trunk dialling is possible between Addis Ababa,
Debre Zeit, Asmara, Massawa and Dese. The rest of the long distance traffic
is set up by operators at manual switchboards. The trunk dialling facilities
will be further extended after the completion of the other microwave systems
in August 1974.



Page 3 of 4 pages
Almost all routes in the long distance network are heavily
overloaded and subscribers often have to wait several hours before a
long distance call can be put through. Also, the open-wire network is
vulnerable to damage and expensive to maintain.
3.  Telegraph and Telex Services
(i) Telegraph service is generally provided using the long distance
telephone network and to remote places by use of HF radio in
some cases.
(ii)  Telex service is provided by an automatic 200-line exchange in
Addis Ababa and by manual telex exchanges in Asmara, Assab and
Dire Dawa. By the end of 1972 the number of subscribers con-
nected totalled 220, of which 158 were in Addis Ababa.
(iii) A national GENTEX network is nearing completion and will oonnect
the following cities%
Addis Ababa                        Nazareth
Asmara                             Shashamane
Massawa                            Jima
Mekele                             Nekempte
Dese                               Bahar Dar
Assab                              Gondar
Dire Dawa                          Harrar
All GENTEX terminals will be equipped with both Latin and Amharic
type of teleprinters.
4. International Servces
IBTE provides international telephone, telegraph and telex services
by HF radio to the following cities:
London                                 Tokyo (telegraph and telex only)
Paris                                  Poona

Abidjan                                Kinshasha
Some of the telephone HF channels have been equipped with LIN-
COMPEl.



ANNEX I
Page 4 of 4 pages
There is a landline route with four telephone channels to
Djibouti in the French Territory of Afars and Issas.
The international HF routes are heavily overloaded and the
service offered, specifically for telephone calls, is very poor.

Economic AnalUsis of the ProJ oct
Benefit Period
1.        The period of benefit from the project extends from 1974., when
the first disbursement on the project will be made, to 2000 when the
additional facilities included in the project on the average will have
completed their useful life in accordance with the present composite
depreciation life of 24 years.
CaDital bxenditures
2.        Capital expenditures are based on 1973 prices and do not include
taxes., customs duties or price contingency allowances. The residual value
of the project in 2000 is estimated at Eth$15 million.
Operating Costs
3.        Operating costs are based on 1973 prices and do not include taxes
or customs duties on spares. Expenditure-forecasts were analyzed to
detemine which costs could be reasonably associated with the project by

Revenues
Telephone
Urban installation fees - projected on basis of estimated
telephones to be installed during year based on past
experience of average revenue per installation of Eth$199.00
which includes installation charges of PA1X's assistance sets
and other special equipment and the excess line distance
charges.
Urban rental - projected on basis of estimated telephones in
service during year based on past experience of revme per
average telephone of Eth$75.00.
Urban call charges - projected on basis of estimated automatic
telephones in service during year at experienced revenue per
average telephone of Eth$124.00-
Urban other - represents revenues from moves and changes of
telephone equipmuent. The nmber of moves and changes is assumed
to be proportional to average nmber of telephones in service
during each year. The revenue projection based on past experience
provides for Eth$4 per telephone in service.
Interurban calls - projected on basis of past growth rate of 8%
plus special stimulation for Asmara., flre Dawa, Shashamane and
Jima microwave routes where the quality of service is being
considerably improved.
International calls - the revenues are based on an anticipated
growth rate of 24l.5% per year up to 1975 when the satellite routes
will be commissioned. The revenues of satellite traffic for the
years 1976-78 are based on a growth rate of 100% in 1976, 50% in
1977, 30% in 1978 and 20% thereafter. The recent two year
trend in revenues on routes that will be transferred to satellite
operation has been 32% per year and hence the projected growth
rate to 1975. The anticipated growth rate for the period after
commissioning of the satellite earth station is based on
experience in other countries under similar conditions.



ANNEX 8
,Page 3 o0 3 pages
Additional revenues reguired - in trae years 1976 and 1977
additional revemues have been reflected in order to maintain
a rate of return of 7% in each year. In 1978, the year the
project is completed, additional revenues have been reflected
to produce a rate of return of 8%. The 1978 additional revenue
figure was then projected for the years 1979-81 based on 4ts
relationship to total identified telephone revemes.
Telegraph
Inland - proJected on basis of a growth rate of 5%.
International - projected primarily on basis of a growth rate
of 2% per year.
Telex - primarily composed of international traffic, which is
forecast on basis of a growth rate of 16% until the installation
of the earth satellite station, when the growth rate for satel-
lite traffic is increased to 19%.
Broadcasting - projected based on new contract with the Broad-
casting  thority re-flecting anticipated growth.
Miscellaneous - presents radio license,, rental and special wozis
revenues and is projected at a reasonably constent fig-re.
lcpenses
Wages - projected at a yearly increase rate of 9.393% pls estimated
additiona1 wage requirements related to the microwave and satellite
earth station installations.
Other Operating - projected at a yearly increase ral1i of 11% plus
estimated additional exenses related to the microwave and
satellite earth station installations and taxes (other than
profits tax).
Depreciation - computed at the rate of 4.25% of average gzros3
plant in service through 1975 and 4.50% therenafter.
Profits Tax - computed on net income including intere- ezpens(
at the rate of 20% for first Eth$300,000, 30% next Eth$1.2 mii1ion
and 40% for remainder.

Notes and Assumptions on the Statement
Of Financial Position
1974l-8a.
1.        Plant under construction at the end of each year has been related
to the constraction schedule.
2.        Accounts receivable balances at the end of each year daring the
early years of the project have reflected dedactions resulting from a more
aggressive collectbon policy and the write-off of unoollectable accounts.
After 1974 the accounts receivable show an increase relating to the
increase in revenue bil1ings.
3.        Inventories have been increased modestly over the entire period
to reflect the requirement to service a larger plant investment, minimized
by improved inventory-control applications based on computer utilization.
4.        Current liabilities reflect the scheduled amortization of long-
term debt vI the following year.
5,        Other current liabilities reflect IBTE's estimation of its require-
ment reflecting modest increases resulting from the expanded volume of
operations.
6.        Share capital has been increased in 1973 to comply with the corpo-
rate charter and allow for the proposed project financing. The corporate
charter restricts the amount of indebtedness to not more than three times
the amount of authorized and subscribed share capital.
