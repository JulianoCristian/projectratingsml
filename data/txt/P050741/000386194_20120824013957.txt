      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to ad apt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covering two education
projects in Sri Lanka. The first operation, the Improving the Relevance and Quality of
Undergraduate Education Project, was financed through IDA Credit No. 37810 in the
amount of US$40.3 million equivalent and a planned Government contribution of
US$10.7 million equivalent. The credit was approved on June 10, 2003, became
effective on August 25, 2003 and was closed on June 30, 2010, 6 months after the
original closing date.

The second operation, the Education Sector Development Project was financed through
IDA Credit #444230 in the amount of US$60 million equivalent, approved on December
15, 2005. An additional $US10 million was approved on June 5, 2008. The credit closed
on June 30, 2011 on schedule.

This PPAR was prepared by Maurice Boissiere, IEG consultant. The findings are largely
based on a two-week mission to Sri Lanka from February 13 to February 24, 2012. The
mission met with education authorities, both national and provincial, as well as private
business people. The mission visited schools and administrative offices in Central and
Northern Provinces as well as a number of universities. A list of persons met is given in
Annex B. The mission also examined: (a) World Bank project files, (b) project related
reporting and evaluation, and (c) education studies with data by government and other
Development Partners, as well as the relevant research literature.

The IEG team gratefully acknowledges the logistical assistance and support of the staff in
the Colombo Office of the World Bank for expediting the work of the mission. Many
other ministry, provincial, and university officials were generous with their time,
especially in arranging visits to project sites.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and feedback, and no comments were
received.

Summary
The objective of this report is to assess the development effectiveness of two education
projects in Sri Lanka – the Improving the Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate
Education Project and the Education Sector Development Project. The Undergraduate
Education Project was approved on June 10, 2003 for total cost of US$51.0 million
equivalent financed by an International Development Association (IDA) credit of
US$40.3 million equivalent with the rest financed by the Government. The Education
Sector Development Project was approved on December 15, 2005 for a total cost of
US$60.0 million financed by IDA credit of US$60.0 million, which was increased in
2008 by US$10.0 million for total of US$70.0 million.

Sri Lanka is a lower-middle income country with per capita income of around US$2,240
in 2010. Its population of 20.8 million grows modestly at about 0.7 percent per year.
The population is diverse ethnically (Sinhalese, Tamil, and other minority groups) and
religiously (Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, and Christians). Despite the serious military
conflict with Tamil separatist groups since 1983, the most intense fighting was confined
to the north and east, and the overall economy grew about 5 percent on average
throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The conflict finally came to a close in May 2009. The
country now faces the challenge of restoring civil harmony by undertaking reconciliation
and reconstruction in the war torn areas and finding a viable political resolution. The
education sector was thought to have an important role in the quest for social cohesion.

The structure of the education sector consists of primary school (grades 1 to 5), junior
secondary (grades 6 to 9), and senior secondary (grades 9 to 13). Primary and junior
secondary are considered to be basic education, which is compulsory. Overall, about four
million students are enrolled in basic and secondary education in almost 10,000 schools.
Universal primary education, for grades 1 -5, was achieved with net enrollment rate
reaching 96 percent in 2005; the net enrollment rate for grades 1-9 was less (81 percent).
Tertiary education, comprising university degree programs and some post-secondary
training programs that confer diploma-level credentials, enrolls about 390,000 students.

Improving Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education Project

The project development objectives were to ―support the government‘s tertiary education
reform program by enhancing institutional capacities conducive to greater relevance and
quality in undergraduate education.‖ The issues to be addressed involved the
unemployment problem of university graduates, the need to update the curriculum and
make it more relevant to labor market demand, and the need to modernize both
curriculum and administration in higher education

The relevance of the objectives is substantial given that the Government development
strategy and the Bank‘s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (2008) stressed equitable
development with conflict resolution, economic growth, and improved public service
delivery. The relevance of project design was substantial in that the activities and
instruments chosen, such as competitive grants and block grants to universities, provided
incentives and resources to change and renew their academic programs. There was a
                                            viii


reallocation of US$9 million to the Tsunami Emergency Relief Project in 2006 when the
Bank and Government agreed to close the Tharuna Aruna II private sector internship. The
latter program was no longer relevant because the new Government in 2004 decided to
provide public sector employment to unemployed graduates.

The Institutional Block Grant program was successfully implemented, which built up
teaching infrastructure. The Quality Assurance and Accreditation Council was
established and operated successfully. The National Higher Education Management
Information System was developed. Private sector employers report that they value
English fluency and Information Communication Technology (ICT) skills along with
academic achievement. The Institutional Block Grants and Quality Enhancement Fund
increased training in these areas. The average time to first job after graduation fell
substantially, from 14 months (June 2004) to 4.5 months (September 2009). The Quality
Assurance and Accreditation Council conducted assessments and training that benefited
over 32,000 students and 3,200 staff members. From 2005 to 2008 test scores in English
rose from 49 to 56 percent and in Information Communication Technology from 59 to 69
percent.

Based upon substantial relevance, substantial efficacy for all three objectives, but modest
efficiency, the project outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. The risk to
development outcome is moderate given that new measures, such as quality assurance
and competitive funding, have gained acceptance. The performance of the Bank is rated
moderately satisfactory at entry. There were shortcomings in the Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) design. However, strong efforts during supervision to revise the
M&E design resulted in significant improvement. The quality of Bank supervision is
rated satisfactory. The borrower‘s performance is rated satisfactory. The Government
remained committed to all of the objectives. This was shown by the budgetary
commitments to the project and the follow-on project Higher Education for the Twenty-
First Century, which essentially supports the same objectives. The Ministry of Higher
Education and its Policy Planning and Development Unit were well staffed with
committed and hard-working professionals. Thus, Government and implementing
agency performance were both satisfactory.

Education Sector Development Project

The project development objectives were to: ―(a) promote equitable access to basic
education (grade 1-9) and secondary education (grade 10-13); (b) improve the quality of
education; (c) enhance the economic efficiency and equity of resource allocation and (d)
strengthen education governance and service delivery.‖ The project was designed as a
Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) and the objectives were derived from broad themes
identified as important during the preceding preparation and sector work. Thus, the
project was designed to be implemented across the whole sector and in all the provinces.
The SWAp modality included the broad policy framework and the pooling of Bank funds
following the country budget system.

The relevance of the objectives is substantial and they are aligned with the overall
objectives of the most recent CAS (2008) and with the Government strategy as outlined
                                             ix


above. The relevance of project design as a SWAp was substantial given the widespread
nature of the objectives and their range of implementation.

Equitable access was substantially improved. In primary grades 1-5, Sri Lanka has had
gender parity for some years. The national network of schools is complete, with only
maintenance and refurbishing tasks, depending upon location. This achievement is being
maintained through the demand side incentives of the project, such as providing free
uniforms and meals and snacks. The completion rate through grade 9 has increased from
78 percent (2005) to 91 percent (2011).

Quality and learning outcomes also improved. The National Assessment of Learning
shows that achievement scores for grade 4 in first language improved from 69 percent
(2005) to 83 percent (2011). The achievement scores for grade 4 in mathematics
improved from 67 percent (2005) to 82 percent (2011). The percentage of schools with
teaching plans increased over the project period from none to 100 percent, the percentage
of schools staffed with qualified staff and supported by teacher development increased
from 80 percent to 95 percent, and the percentage of textbooks delivered to schools on
time increased from none to 100 percent.

Before the project there was very little information on how resources were allocated;
budgets were developed on an ad hoc basis. The Public Expenditure and Quality
Education Tracking Survey was developed, the first round in 2006-07 producing a report
to track both quality and resources. Resources for higher order learning processes, such
as critical thinking and problem solving, were increased in the recurrent budget from 0.5
percent at project start to 3.3 percent at completion. The capital budget did not prioritize
higher order learning processes at project start, but by completion 43 percent was
allocated compared to a target of 40 percent.

School-based management—the Program for School Improvement—was introduced.
This involved a model of balanced control in which some functions of school
management were devolved to the school level while others were retained at provincial
and national levels. The basic features involved communities through a School
Development Committee, school-level planning, a sustained program of training for
teachers and the community, and high level support within the province and national
Ministry of Education. An impact evaluation of the pilot schemes showed that program
schools attained better student learning compared to non-program schools.

The project outcome is rated satisfactory. The risk to development is negligible to low.
The thematic objectives are now firmly rooted with strong ownership across all levels
and the understanding of the SWAp approach is widespread. The performance of the
Bank is rated satisfactory at entry. The design and preparation were based upon strong
analytical work. The sector issues were well understood and there was high level
involvement of Government officials that resulted in the necessary ownership for a
SWAp. The performance of the Bank during supervision was also satisfactory. The
Bank team provided frequent and detailed implementation support by visiting the
provinces and zones. In addition to assisting in procurement and fiduciary issues, support
for the analytical work continued throughout the project.

1. Background and Context
1.1      This report assesses two completed education projects that represent the results of
nearly a decade of World Bank support for primary, secondary, and tertiary education in Sri
Lanka. The Improving the Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education Project
(henceforth referred to as Undergraduate Education Project) was approved on June 10, 2003
for an International Development Association (IDA) credit of US$40.3 million equivalent,
with a government contribution estimated at US$10.7 million equivalent. The Education
Sector Development Project was approved on December 15, 2005 and was financed by an
IDA credit for US$60.0 million with an additional US$10.0 million approved in 2008 for a
total of US$70.0 million.

1.2     These two projects were selected for assessment because they address issues that not
only reflect strategic priorities in Sri Lanka, but in many other countries over this period,
namely: increasing access, quality, and learning outcomes in primary, secondary, and
tertiary education; the extent to which the poor, disadvantaged, and girls have been reached;
and the extent to which schooling inputs have translated into greater learning and acquisition
of skills. In addition to these sector objectives, there are potentially important lessons to be
learned from these projects concerning: how effective the basic and secondary education
system prepare students for tertiary education; the relationship between post-primary
educational investments and labor force relevance and outcomes; and the extent of project
coordination to build effective linkages between primary, secondary and post-secondary
education. This evaluation could also help to throw some light on the effectiveness of
undertaking reforms in an environment made all the more difficult by ethnic conflict and
natural disaster (the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami).

SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT IN SRI LANKA

1.3     Sri Lanka is a lower-middle income country with per capita income of around
US$2,240 in 2010. Its population of 20.8 million was growing modestly at about 0.7 percent.
The fight against poverty has shown progress with the poverty rate falling from around 23
percent of the population in 2005 to 15 percent (2006/7) and about 9 percent (2009/10).
Despite suffering from a separatist conflict since 1983, the economy grew about 5percent on
average throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Much of the fighting was concentrated in the
Northern and Eastern provinces, with serious bombings occurring in Colombo and other
major urban centers. Nonetheless, the Western and Central provinces managed to experience
economic growth above the national average, which could have been even higher if not for
the conflict and the costs that it imposed. The conflict finally came to a close in May 2009
after many years of suffering by civilians and the loss of much economic progress. The
country now faces the challenge of restoring civil harmony by undertaking reconciliation and
reconstruction in the war torn areas and finding a viable political resolution. The education
sector is seen to have an important role in this quest for social cohesion.1

  This is a complex issue, which goes well beyond the scope of this report and reaches back into Sri Lankan
history (see Silva 2005). After independence from Great Britain in 1948, a number of policies about official
languages and education (Sinahala, Tamil, and English) led to a sequence of events, culminating in the ethnic
                                                        2


EDUCATION IN SRI LANKA

1.4     The education sector in Sri Lanka had been recognized as one of the better
performing ones among developing countries with its achievements being above those
countries in its income group. Overall, about four million students are enrolled in basic and
secondary education in almost 10,000 schools. Given that population growth has slowed, Sri
Lanka does not face the demographic pressure on school enrollment it did during the early
days after independence. Universal Primary Education, for grades 1 -5, was achieved with
net enrollment rate reaching 96 percent in 2005. However, access to junior secondary
(grades 6-9) and senior secondary (grades 10-13) is much lower than primary, especially in
the poorer or conflict affected regions. For example, in 2001, the Bank sector report (2005)
showed the enrollment rate for provinces at grades 1-5 varied little—from 92 percent
(Northeast) to 98 percent (Western province). For grades 6-9, it varied from 73 percent
(Northeastern) to 87 percent (Western province). At the end of grade 11 there is the
examination for General Certificate of Education O-Level and at the end of grade 13 there is
the examination for General Certificate of Education A-Level. The latter has very high
stakes, as it determines entry into one of the public universities, for which only about 20
percent qualify. Net enrollment in basic education (grades 1-9) was 81 percent with a
completion rate to grade 9 being only 78 percent.

1.5    With respect to senior secondary level, there has been steady progress in enrollment
over the past 2 decades, with gender parity being more or less maintained over the years,
though there is still a slightly higher net enrollment rate for girls (Table 1.1).

1.6     Tertiary education comprises university degree programs, public and private, and
some post-secondary training programs that confer diploma level credentials. The Ministry
of Higher Education has overall responsibility for tertiary institutions and for policy. The
public universities receive their funding through the University Grants Commission, which is
a quasi-autonomous commission reporting directly to the Minister of Education, while the
other public tertiary institutions come under the Ministry of Higher Education. The foreign
private universities and training institutes in the table below can set up affiliates in Sri Lanka
as a foreign investment that comes under the Board of Investment. This arrangement allows
for meeting some of the high demand for tertiary education, but will likely change when a
new higher education law comes into effect. The higher education law was expected to allow


riots of July 1983 in Colombo, which is the date used for the start of the civil war. It should be noted here that
the official policy documents of the Government recognize a special contribution of education to achieving
reconciliation (see ―Education Framework Sector Development Framework, Ministry of Education (2007) and
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, Presidential Commission (2012). These relate to the language
policy in schools, the overall curriculum, and other aspects. Both of the projects under review here and the
follow-up projects have activities related to social cohesion.

for academic accreditation of private as well as public universities, but it was recently
withdrawn from parliamentary debate due to strong criticism from public university
professors and student unions who voice the fear it will reduce support for public higher
education. The parliamentary committee responsible for higher education said that more
time is needed for public consultation. It is also possible that the needed measures will take
the form of a series of regulations as opposed to a single comprehensive law. Table 1.2
below gives higher education enrollments by type of institution.

1.7      There are 15 public and only 3 currently recognized private universities (these had
been in operation during colonial times). Although tertiary level education enrolls around
390,000 students according to official statistics, only 19 percent of this is in the 15 full-time
public universities, while 58 percent of this is in the external degree programs of public
universities. These external degree programs originated many years ago when the University
of London had such arrangements with Sri Lanka, as it did with India and other colonial
countries at the time. As the name implies, these students are external to the university and
do not attend lectures on campus, and it resembles to some extent a correspondence course.
However, this evolved from a relatively small program under the public universities to its
present day size, as the demand for higher education was strong. External degree students,
many of whom are also working full or part-time, are eligible to take the degree
examinations, but the complaint is often voiced that they receive very little academic support
and thus must study mainly on their own, with less than 10 percent ultimately passing the
degree examinations. There is also an Open University, which has about 12 percent of the
total tertiary enrollment. As in Table 1-2 above, about 2 percent of enrollment is in the new
public Sri Lanka Institutes for Advanced Technology Education and 12 percent in various
types of private higher education and training institutions, some of which have foreign
affiliation as mentioned above. The gross enrollment rate in higher education went from 9.5
percent (1990/91) to 21.2 percent (2007), although this is considered to be an overestimate by
some analysts, especially given the large share of external degree students in the official
statistics.

QUALITY OF EDUCATION

1.8    Despite the achievements in access at all levels, there are concerns about learning
achievement and quality. Inequity in learning and resources exist in the poor rural areas and
provinces compared to the more affluent ones. At the university level, quality and relevance
have become the major concern, especially as unemployment among university graduates has
become such a major issue.

SCHOOL TO WORK TRANSITION AND YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT

1.9      General unemployment has declined over the years to 4.9 percent in 2010, but youth
unemployment, defined for ages 15 to 29, was still high at 17.1 percent2. Precise figures for
unemployment for university graduates are not available, but the prevailing belief is that it is
high. One retrospective survey of graduates from University of Colombo found that four
years after graduation only half had found a job (see Gunatilaka, Mayer, and Vodopivec,
2010). Another study by the Department of Manpower Planning in the Ministry of
Productivity (2011) identifies some causes for high unemployment among graduates. First,
new job creation in the labor market is not sufficient to absorb the supply of new graduates.
Second, the private sector relies more on non-graduates with technical qualifications and
English fluency since many graduates are in arts and studied in the local language. As a
result, there are long queues for public sector jobs which are preferred by graduates because
they see it as having more job security and being less demanding in work effort compared to
private companies. It should be noted that this is not a recent phenomenon as Sri Lanka was
one of the early countries to be identified as having a graduate unemployment problem (see
Seers, 1971).

EDUCATION FINANCING

1.10 Spending on education in total is about 1.9 percent of GDP, which is US$50 billion in
2010, with 0.5 percent of GDP on public higher education. The financing of the universities
is done through the University Grants Commission, but the funding methodology is
considered ad hoc in that it simply gives a percentage increase, using the same budget
categories and based in part upon the negotiating power of individual institutions. Sector
analytic work indicated the need for reform to relate funding of institutions to policy goals.
In addition, most analysts consider this funding for education in general and higher education
in particular relatively low compared to other middle income country comparators. This
contrasts with the 1960s, when Sri Lanka was regarded as an outstanding performer in
education among developing countries and spent as much as 4 to 5 percent of GDP on
education.

1.11 With demographic pressure easing on the basic education age group, more spending
per student could be possible to raise quality of education and learning. For example, the 5 –
9 year old population and the 10 -14 year old population are estimated to have declined from
about 2 million in 1994 to 1.7 million in 2003. The new census of 2011-2012, the first
census to cover the whole island since 1981, will shed more light upon this issue. More

                                                   5


analysis is needed to see if increased spending on quality inputs could be offset by savings
elsewhere, such as less teachers needed for a declining student population.

CHALLENGES IN EDUCATION IN SRI LANKA

1.12 The Bank has been involved in Sri Lanka education since the 1980s. Although Sri
Lanka had a good reputation for the coverage of its primary education, the country was aware
that the quality of its system needed improvement and invited to the Bank to help with sector
analysis. Also, budgetary constraints that prevailed in the 1980s meant that Bank financing
would help with investments to improve quality. Prior to the Improving Relevance and
Quality of Undergraduate Education (2003) project, the Bank provided support through the
Second General Education Project Credit (1997) and the Teacher Education and Teacher
Deployment Credit (1996). Together with the Government, the Bank has undertaken major
sector reports and reviews that provided the analytical basis for the projects under review.
The Bank reviewed the tertiary sector in the Towers of Learning Report (World Bank 2009)
and basic/secondary education in the Transforming School Education report (World Bank
2011d). This provided the analytical basis for more support to the sector with the Higher
Education for the Twenty-First Century Project (2010-2016 US$ 40 million) and the
Transformation of School Education Program (2011- 2017 US$ 100 million).

1.13 The main donors after the Bank are Japanese Bank for International Cooperation
(JBIC) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The JBIC supports some school
infrastructure in the provinces and its funds flow to the provinces through the government
budgetary mechanism, the same as for the Bank‘s Education Sector Development Project.
The ADB supported a traditional investment project for secondary education in 2005, but in
2007 also planned to move over to using a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) mechanism by
integrating its funds into the government flow of funds3. However, it did not do so although
the ADB and others support the SWAp policy framework through parallel financing. Other
donors provide smaller amounts using the traditional stand-alone mode in specific areas of
support. UNICEF focuses on schools in conflict affected areas. Germany‘s Ministry for
International Cooperation, United Kingdom‘s Department for International Development
(DFID), Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA) primarily provide grant funds for technical assistance in
support of the overall Education Sector Development Framework Program.




3
   See Vaillancourt 2009, The World Bank defines a SWAp as ―an approach to a locally owned program for a
coherent sector in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, moving forward in the use of country systems.
SWAps represent a shift in the focus, relationship, and behavior of donors and governments. They involve high
levels of donor and country coordination for the achievement of program goals, and can be financed through
parallel financing, pooled financing, general budget support, or a combination.‖

2. Improving Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate
Education Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
Objectives

2.1     The Improving Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education was approved on
June 10, 2003 and became effective on August 25, 2003. The objective, as stated in the
Credit Agreement and Project Appraisal Document, was to support the government‘s tertiary
education reform program by enhancing institutional capacities conducive to greater
relevance and quality in undergraduate education. The rationale for the project is based upon
the analysis by the Government (the Presidential Task Force on University Education 1998)
and the Bank during project identification and preparation. The issues to be addressed
involved the unemployment problem of university graduates, the need to update the
curriculum and make it more relevant to labor market demand, and the need to modernize
both curriculum (content and equipment) and administration in higher education. There was
no specific mention of connections of higher education to basic and secondary education.
The project closed, after a six month extension, on June 30, 2010. The credit was almost
fully disbursed.

Relevance of the Objectives

2.2    The relevance of project objectives is rated substantial. Given the difficulties of
graduates finding employment in the private sector, it was important to reform the HE system
to make it better and more relevant to the country‘s economic needs. There are, however,
many important issues not addressed in the project objectives, but it may not be realistic to
take on many more issues.

2.3      The objectives related to quality and relevance, and capacity building to their
achievement that are directly relevant to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2008, as
well as to the prior Strategy of 2003. The development of high level human capital for the
private sector is an important element in the CAS objective of promoting the competitiveness
of the economy. Improving education services, including higher education, is an important
CAS objective. The objectives also are relevant to the Government strategy as put forth in
the document ―Reforms in University Education‖ by the Presidential Task Force on
University Education (1998), which was widely discussed within Sri Lanka. On the basis of
this the Government requested Bank support for higher education at the Paris Development
Forum (2000). The reforms envisioned included a policy framework with performance
incentives, improvements in quality and quality monitoring, improving employability of
graduates for the private sector and increasing access (though quality was to be emphasized
first).

2.4     Likewise, the project objective is relevant to the Government‘s strategy for higher
education, as well as its overall economic vision (known as the Mahinda Chintana framework
for a ten year development program). Both the Government vision and the CAS stress three
                                             7


main areas: (i) achieving more equitable development through accelerated rural development,
(ii) accelerating growth through increased investment in infrastructure, and (iii) strengthening
public service delivery. The CAS 2008 also stressed the need to mitigate risks and proceed
cautiously, given that the cease fire agreement in the separatist conflict had broken down and
serious violence erupted again in 2006. Thus the CAS emphasized being conflict sensitive in
all Bank operations. Even though the war has ended, there is still some risk that the
underlying causes of the conflict might not be addressed. Thus the CAS emphasis on
building social cohesion, which comes under the strategic area of promoting peace and
dealing with the causes of the conflict, is still relevant and this higher education operation
can contribute to that goal. Although social cohesion was not explicitly part of the
objectives, it was referred to in many places in the project documents and the grants have
criteria that social cohesion should be addressed.

Design

2.5      Components. The project defined two broad components. The first component was
Building Capacity in the Tertiary Education System (later changed to Higher Education
System). This involved strengthening capacity at the national level, including the Ministry of
Higher Education and the University Grants Commission that determines funding allocations
to universities. Building up the management capacity at the individual university level was
also included in this component, especially via providing training and a program of
Institutional Block Grants, which required submission of proposals for strategic planning and
institutional strengthening. Strengthening quality assurance mechanisms were to be
developed under the Board for Quality Assurance (later renamed the Quality Assurance and
Accreditation Council) which was initially set under the University Grants Commission with
the intent that it would become independent later (so far it has become semi-autonomous but
still under University Grants Commission).

2.6     The second component was aimed more directly to quality and relevance activities.
A program of competitive grants (the Quality Enhancement Fund) was established in which
individual departments of the universities would prepare proposals, the best of which would
be selected by peer review to receive grants for implementation. The criteria for selection
would be publicized and training would be provided for proposal preparation, which was a
new activity in Sri Lankan higher education. Another sub-component was the Tharuna
Aruna II program for Improving the Employment Prospects of Unemployed Graduates. At
the time of appraisal the Government requested the Bank to add this subcomponent to the
project so as to assist in improving the Tharuna Aruna I program that it had started in 1997.
The Tharuna Aruna, which translates as Young Professional Program, was an internship
program that placed graduates in private sector firms for six months. They would hopefully
continue with the firm or find employment in another one. It was estimated that there were
about 27,000 unemployed graduates in 2003 and the Government was concerned about the
potential for social unrest, as had happened in the past, and also the waste of human capital.

2.7    The detailed activities in the original components as described in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) are listed in the table below:
                                                                8

Institutional Block Grants were awarded for this purpose,
especially for English and ICT training labs. Improved social
harmony activities to be supported.

supports a continuous public awareness campaign and
stakeholder dialogue to build consensus on the reform
programs and disseminate information about their
achievements

supports research activities to monitor and evaluate the
impact of project investments on important academic,
economic and social outcomes.

2.8    M&E design. The M&E activities were designed as part of Component 1 of
Building Institutional Capacity. A number of indicators were specified for which baseline
and end of project target values were to be collected. Some of these indicators came from the
individual universities and statistical agencies. Others required special studies that were to
be contracted to research institutes and consulting firms.

2.9    Financing. The project was financed by a $40.3 million equivalent International
Development Association credit as a Sector Investment Loan with a government contribution
of $10.7 million equivalent. There was no co-financing or parallel financing by other donors.

2.10 Implementation arrangements. The institutional framework for implementation at
the national level thus included the Ministry of Higher Education as well as the University
Grants Commission, which was home to the Quality Assurance and Accreditation Council.
Each university also had an implementation unit, known as the Local Technical Secretariat,
to liaise with the national entities and to coordinate activities within the universities.

Relevance of Design

2.11 The relevance of project design is also substantial. The Results Framework
(described schematically in the table below) was adequate to achieve the objectives of
improving quality and relevance. Each of the project interventions has a clear mapping onto

the elements of the project objectives. In terms of design, the use of block grants and
competitive funding to universities was an appropriate mechanism in the Sri Lanka context
for providing incentives to universities to achieve project objectives of improving relevance
and quality. The use of such grants, which can be a demand-driven way of identifying
individual institutional needs, has become a standard approach now in higher education
projects in the Bank over the past decade or so (see Berk 2002). Experience with such grants
in other higher education projects, ranging from Hungary to Indonesia, show that allowing
institutions to identify their needs, but within a framework of criteria for relevance and
quality, is more effective than a top down approach in delivering results.

2.12 The project design was also relevant to the Government‘s concern about graduate
unemployment and the Bank responded to the Government request to help restructure the
Tharuna Aruna program aimed at promoting the employability of unemployed graduates for
jobs in the private sector. The dropout rate was high (45 percent) and the private sector firms
did not perceive the graduates as attractive candidates. While reforming higher education
would not help those already graduated, it was important to support somehow their
employment prospects. The project improved the program by introducing a training
component in skills valued by the private sector such as English fluency, basic Information
Communication Technology (ICT) skills and development of interpersonal and team work
capabilities. The project design was selective in that it did not try to address all important
issues in higher education, but stressed priority objectives that were feasible in the Sri Lanka
context. For example, the large number of students enrolled in external degree programs or
the need to improve research and graduate education were postponed for a later phase of
reform.

Implementation
2.13 The project became effective two months after approval on August 25, 2003 and had
a satisfactory start-up with the commitment of the Government still being high and with an
adequate staffing of the Policy Planning and Development Unit, the implementation unit in
the Ministry of Higher Education. Throughout most of implementation (from July 2003 to
June 2010), the project was rated satisfactory in the Implementation Status Reports, except
once in Jan. 2007, when the rating was moderately satisfactory. As project activities
proceeded, disbursement took place at a regular pace, close to the planned disbursement
schedule. However, appreciation of the SDR versus the US dollar, in addition to some
reallocations described below, brought the IDA credit to US$45.5 million equivalent and the
Government contribution to US$9.8 million equivalent.

Implementation Experience

2.14 Project objectives remained the same throughout, but there were some changes and
challenges during implementation. The Tharuna Aruna II program to promote graduate
employment was cancelled by the mutual agreement of the Bank and Government because
the new Government that came in after the April 2004 elections decided to provide public
employment for graduates who could not find employment in the private sector. According
to IEG mission discussions with informed observers, this practice of providing public sector
jobs for graduates had been done before, especially with promises around election times.
Given the role of student unrest in Sri Lankan politics since the 1970s, a large group of
unemployed graduates was a sensitive issue with the Government. As a result, many
participants in Tharuna Aruna II, anticipating public sector jobs, which they preferred over
private sector jobs, dropped out of the Tharuna Aruna II program. Many of these, who were
arts graduates, were hired as teachers by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in their local areas
in the provinces. Thus the backlog of unemployed graduates was cleared up.

2.15 On December 26, 2004, the devastating tsunami hit Sri Lanka as well many other
Indian Ocean countries. Since the aim of this subcomponent was to promote private sector
employment of unemployed graduates, with the agreement of the Bank and Government, the
remaining US$9 million in funds for this subcomponent were reallocated to the Tsunami
Emergency Relief Project in 2006, following all of the usual legal procedures for such
reallocations. This, together with appreciation of the SDR, resulted in the reduction of
disbursement to US$45 million (90 percent of that planned). Table 2.3 below givens the
estimates at appraisal versus the actual project costs at completion.

2.16 The development of the Higher Education Management Information System proved
to be much more challenging that envisioned at appraisal. One reason for this was that the
design and specifications of the system in the PAD were not very detailed. More time was
needed to complete detailed specifications for procurement purposes. The Bank team and
counterparts agreed during implementation that there should be two systems, one for the
national level for strategic planning by the UGC and Ministry of Higher Education, and the
                                                               11

other to be used at the university level for their own management purposes. During
discussions about this with the IEG mission, it was reported that the whole design and
development process was much more complex than imagined. It was not until mid-term of
the project that the development really started up with the signing of contracts with two
firms, one for each part of the system. The costs also exceeded estimates and this was
covered by using part of a reallocation of project funds (US$1.84 million) that took place in
March 2009. Moreover, many change requests were made by the universities, resulting in
some disputes with the contractors. These were resolved and the system is still only about 75
percent complete according to estimates by some staff of the Policy Planning and
Development Unit, who believe that those parts of the design not completed can be done so
with Government funds. However, the system is still useful and fulfilling its main purpose.

2.17 Under the Quality Enhancement Fund, two rounds of grant competitions were
successfully implemented under this subcomponent. A third round was added later during
implementation at the request of the Ministry of Higher Education and the University Grants
Commission. This third round was aimed at faculties of Arts, Social Sciences and
Humanities, which were not able to win grants in the first two rounds. This also included
university of Jaffna in the Northern Province that needed more time due to delays from the
separatist conflict. The costs of this additional round was covered from the reallocation
project funds that took place in March 2009 (see above) and in October 2009 (US$2.62
million). The purpose of this was to provide more IT training in the academic programs for
the arts students to prepare them better for the labor market. In addition, Advanced
Technology Institutes were allowed to participate in the third round.

Implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation

Safeguards

2.18 No safeguards were triggered by project activities. The project adhered to Bank
guidelines for both environmental and social issues. An Environment Management Plan was
prepared for each rehabilitation or expansion of facilities under the project. The project had
no negative social impacts such as involuntary resettlement.
                                              12


Fiduciary

2.19 No financial management issues arose during the audits and reviews of financial
management of the project. The implementing entities performed according to Bank
financial guidelines with regard to acceptable financial management arrangements. The
capacity of the financial management staff allowed for accurate and timely financial records.

2.20 Financial procurement activities were handled in a decentralized way by the
universities using the grants awarded through the project. This required extensive training to
develop the procurement capacity of the Policy Planning and Development Unit and the
Local Technical Secretariats. No major procurement issues were encountered. Financial
management reporting was handled by the trained staff within the Policy Planning and
Development Unit. These reports were acceptable based upon annual financial audits carried
out according to Bank policy.

Achievement of the Objectives
ENHANCING INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY

2.21 The first objective of enhancing institutional capacity was substantially achieved. As
enumerated in the previous section, the introduction of Higher Education Management
Information System (HEMIS) improved the planning and implementation capacity
considerably. Despite the fact that the National Information System is not 100 percent
operational in the way desired, the University System at each institution is a big step forward,
and the partially operative National Information Management System is useful to the
University Grants Commission and may still develop fully in the follow-on higher education
project or on its own with Government funding. The Institutional Block Grants also played a
significant role in enhancing institutional capacity, especially by promoting programs that
improved the quality and relevance objectives. Public awareness activities helped to increase
understanding of the project objectives and activities both within the academic community
and the public at large. Numerous conferences were held and press releases given to the
newspapers. The Undergraduate Education project website was set up to inform the public
and numerous visits (12,358 over the time of the project) to the site were recorded.

2.22 The project achieved a number of results that improved institutional capacity at the
system and the individual institutional levels. The activities under Component 1 were
designed to align with this dimension of the overall objective. The establishment of the
Higher Education Management Information System at the system level and the individual
institutions strengthened the capacity for analysis and planning in the overall higher
education system. At the University level, the Student Information Module, made standard
administrative tasks more efficient and also provided the university management with useful
information for planning and decision making. However, the National Management
Information System does not connect up to the university-level System as planned due to
technical problems encountered during its specification and implementation. As in other
higher education projects, this task was more complex than anticipated and the IEG mission
was informed that each university also wanted customization changes that would take more
time. The management information system of each university is a stand-alone system, which
                                             13


helps the individual universities, but since they are not connected in real time to the national
one, the system did not fulfill the promise of national planning that was initially intended.
Nonetheless, around 4,100 personnel of the Ministry, University Grants Commission, and
individual universities were trained in national planning and monitoring and evaluation
systems, spreading awareness of best practices throughout the higher education system.
Institutional Block Grants were also awarded to universities if they submitted a corporate
plan and went through the evaluation procedures of the Quality Assurance and Accreditation
Council. The Grants, although not competitive, still helped to improve infrastructure as
evidenced by the upgrades of computer labs and networks as well more modern
instrumentation in science and engineering labs. Given that each block grant needed to have
a strategic plan as a condition of eligibility for a grant, it also introduced a modern planning
culture into the university administration.

IMPROVING RELEVANCE OF UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS

2.23 The objective of improving the relevance of higher education is rated as substantial.
Both the institutional capacity enhancements and the Quality Enhancement Fund helped
bring about more labor market relevance. Private sector employers reported to the IEG
mission that they can now see changes in the soft skills of graduates coming out, as well as
ICT and English language skills. Although the Tharuna Aruna II, the Young Professional
internship program, was cancelled due to the Government reverting back to its practice of
public sector jobs for graduates, the objective of increased relevance was substantially
achieved by the other two components, which were independent of the Tharuna Aruna II
program that dealt with the backlog of unemployed graduates from past years.

2.24 Improving relevance was interpreted in the project documentation to mean better
employment prospects for undergraduates. The average waiting time before getting a first
job after graduation declined from 14 months (June 2004) to 4.5 months (Sept. 2009). Over
the same time period for science-based programs the average waiting time declined from
10.6 to 3.5 months and for social science/humanities it declined from 21.6 to 8.7 months.
This is based upon data collected from tracer studies conducted by the Quality Enhancement
Fund programs. The establishment of the Labor Market Observatory helped to develop data
that provided feedback on the relevance of to undergraduate programs. Specifically, it
provided feedback in judging the relevance of competitive grants under the Quality
Enhancement Fund, especially those grants that established new programs. The IEG mission
had detailed discussions with the Department of Manpower in the Ministry of Productivity,
which has taken over the functions of the Labor Market Observatory. A recent tracer study
(2010 data) was conducted by the Department of Manpower, which showed that the
structural dimensions of the graduate unemployment problem are pretty much the same. The
Arts graduates are still most susceptible to this, but discussions the IEG mission had with
private employers indicate that the English and ICT training being offered to Arts graduates
is starting to have a positive impact on their employability. However, this anecdotal
evidence has not yet been documented with hard statistics.

2.25 New programs in ICT and English were instituted in order to prepare graduates for
the labor market, especially as part of a global knowledge economy. As part of the
Institutional Block Grants and Quality Enhancement Fund, computer and language labs were
                                             14


set up to supplement the classroom based theoretical training. Faculty and students at the
universities visited expressed the opinion to the IEG mission that these were critical
resources they lacked before the project. Given the time frame in which relevant resources
were provided, the plausible result is that average ICT scores improved (from 49 to 56 over
2005 to 2008) on a test given to a sample from participating universities, and tests on
English language skills also improved (from 59 to 69 over 2005 to 2008). The testing
program was designed by an international consulting firm that was contracted to assist with
the M&E. This subcomponent trained 4,331 graduates in ICT and English and provided
them with some subsidized private sector job experience.

2.26 In addition to the hard technical skills of their academic disciplines, the Tharuna
Aruna II program aimed to develop ―soft skills‖, such as a strong work ethic with willingness
to follow the pace of work in a private sector job. Although the program was discontinued
because the public sector employment program introduced by the Government in 2004
cleared up the backlog of unemployed graduates, the IEG mission discussed some of the
Quality Enhancement Fund and Institutional Block Grant projects that also included
internships in private companies, so that students could see how inter-personal skills are
valuable in the work place. Other projects emphasized team work among the students
involved and required them to make presentations to improve their communication skills. As
one private employer emphasized to the mission, they are concerned with more than just the
grade point average of the graduate, but with the all around capabilities and attitudes.
Another aspect of relevance to the social development of the country was providing
incentives for programs that promote social cohesion and harmony, especially germane to Sri
Lanka as it seeks to reconstruct the economy after long years of civil war. Each proposal for
Institutional Block Grants had to provide some activity or aspect for social cohesion. The
IEG mission saw some examples in universities visited, for example, measures to attract
students from all over the country so that the different ethnic and religious groups would
interact. The University of Jaffna in the Northern province, very much affected by conflict,
has had some success in attracting students from the south to its new applied mathematics
programs. The IEG mission found that in all the faculties visited and in the ministries there
was a widespread awareness and concern to make progress on improving social cohesion.
However, no systematic evidence was available.

IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS

2.27 The objective of improving the quality of higher education is rated as substantial.
The Quality Enhancement Fund played a big role in launching new teaching methods
involving more interactive modes of learning and inquiry appropriate for university level
education. The Institutional Block Grants also helped in this by providing computer labs and
teaching-learning technologies that were not available before the project. In addition, the
activities prompted by the Quality Assurance and Accreditation Council reviews can also be
cited as contributing to quality of undergraduate programs.

2.28 The Quality Enhancement Fund achieved a number of results that demonstrate
improved quality. The Grade Point Averages remained on the same level: 2.94 (2004) to
2.98 (2009). More direct evidence is the ICT and English scores cited above, which also
indicate improvement in quality as a result of the extensive improvements in curriculum and
                                             15


facilities. The IEG mission discussed this at the universities visited with faculty and saw that
the equipment was available to and used by students. The competitive procedures for
applying to the Quality Enhancement Fund for grants also had an impact on raising quality
concerns within the higher education system. The establishment and start up of the Quality
Assurance and Accreditation Council also indicates improvements in the overall system as
more universities, especially the weaker ones come into compliance with the quality criteria
concerning staff and facilities available to students. The Quality Assurance and
Accreditation Council conducted external assessments in public universities, which also did
their own self-assessments as part of the process. Over 32,000 students and 3,200 staff
members benefited from these quality enhancing activities. A number of documents on
quality were produced by the Quality Assurance and Accreditation Council and the overall
process of quality assurance, despite the detailed efforts of self-evaluation and external
evaluation, is now widely accepted in Sri Lanka higher education. Most faculty felt that this
has moved Sri Lanka out of its old fashioned academic approach and that the students are
benefiting from improved academic programs. Other countries in the region have
recognized this and requested assistance from the Sri Lankan Quality Assurance and
Accreditation Council in order to set up their own quality assurance systems.

Efficiency
2.29 Efficiency of the project is rated modest. The analytical basis for evaluating project
efficiency was well developed in the PAD Annex on the basis of standard economic cost-
benefit analysis of the project. The PAD Annex used a best case, some intermediate cases,
and a worst case scenario based upon assumptions about increased earnings from higher
education (relative to next lowest level) in the labor market and decreased duration of job
search. The best case used a 7 percent earnings increase and decreased job search of 12
months while the worst case was 3 percent earnings increase and 3 months decreased job
search. Following standard cost benefit analysis, the PAD analysis then calculated the net
present value (using 5 percent discount rate) of the benefits streams from the above cases and
compared this to the total project costs. In the best case scenario the benefits exceeded costs
by 180 percent and in the middle case by 150 percent. In the worst case the benefit was 75
percent of the costs. Although no similar analysis was done after completion of the project
by the project team, analysis of labor force survey data (2008) for the economic and sector
work in preparation for the follow on projects would suggest results would be somewhere
close to the best case scenario (see World Bank 2011d). For example, the earnings
differential for higher education showed male graduates earned 284 percent more than
workers with no education (base case) and male A-level certificate holders earned 151
percent more than the base case. Thus the earnings differentials for higher education
appeared to still be large.

2.30 The efficiency of the Institutional Block grants and the Quality Enhancement Fund
grants appeared to be high in that the benefits, although hard to quantify, were rated as very
significant by almost everyone the IEG mission interviewed. Moreover, these were high
impact areas for the project to address, given its objectives and other sector issues.

2.31 However, given the modest results of the Tharuna Aruna II program during its 2 years
of operation, it is not likely that efficiency of the project funds for that purpose was high, and
                                              16


the transfer of funds to tsunami relief seemed more pressing. Also, the project got off to a
slow start in some areas and ended six months late.

Ratings
PROJECT OUTCOME

2.32 The overall project outcome is moderately satisfactory. The relevance of project
objectives and of design was substantial and each of the three objectives was substantially
achieved. Efficiency was modest, however, amounting to a moderate shortcoming.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.33 The risk to development outcome is rated as moderate given the progress made in
building institutional capacity and the widespread support for the new competitive funding
mechanisms introduced by the project. Discussions with academic and government officials
indicate that they feel it was a success and on that basis want to continue it. There is wide-
spread recognition within the academic community that quality assurance and accreditation
was needed and the initial resistance has been overcome. The Government and institutions
have accepted the approach. At the Government level and within the political parties, there
is support for the broader reforms to be introduced by the new higher education project.
However, the remaining uncertainty relates to the precise role that will be allowed for private
higher education under the new Higher Education Law being discussed in Parliament. The
IEG mission was informed that the Government felt more time was needed to discuss the law
and arrange for wider consultations, which should help to develop stronger support.

BANK PERFORMANCE

2.34 The overall performance of the Bank was moderately satisfactory. Bank performance
during preparation was moderately satisfactory, while during supervision was satisfactory.

2.35 Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank prepared the operation
with the Government and Sri Lanka academics that involved a careful sector analysis. The
Bank also reviewed relevant lessons from other higher education projects in all regions. The
risks from the on-going separatist conflict were also assessed and taken into account in the
need to build social cohesion and harmony through higher education. A major shortcoming
of preparation was M&E design, which was not sufficiently developed. One important
indicator of unemployment was unrealistic and other indicators were lacking baseline values.
The Higher Education Management Information System was only described in terms of its
general aims instead of having operational specifications close to readiness.

2.36 Quality of supervision was satisfactory. The Bank team recognized the
shortcomings in M&E and worked hard to overcome them. It also worked hard to bring the
development and specifications of the Higher Education Management Information System up
to speed. Supervision was carried out at regular intervals twice annually. There were two
changes in Bank Task Team Leader (TTL), but in each case the transition was smooth since
the new TTL had been a core team member already familiar with the project. The Bank
                                             17


helped to keep up progress on the Higher Education Management Information System when
severe difficulties were encountered in the working relationship between the ICT firm
selected as contractor and the end-users. The IEG mission noted very positive feedback
during the field visits concerning the implementation support provided by the Bank
implementation team. There was a positive spirit of joint problem solving that was much
appreciated by the local counterparts.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

2.37 Overall the performance of the Borrower was satisfactory. The Government
performed satisfactorily, and so did the implementing agencies.

2.38 The Government performance was satisfactory. Although the new Government
after the 2005 elections discontinued the Tharuna Aruna II program, it remained committed
to the overall project objectives. The political party that won the election had promised to
provide public sector jobs to graduates, something which has been done in the past elections.
They delivered on that promise and the Tharuna Aruna II was no longer needed. While the
Government‘s concern with social unrest arising out of youth unemployment is
understandable, given such incidents in the past, the need to improve the relevance of
undergraduate education remains. The new Government continued to support the relevance
objective of the project. Given the emphasis on social cohesion, especially after the cessation
of the military conflict in May 2009, the Government supported the extension of time to
allow Jaffna University in the Northern Province to receive funding and complete its grant
activities, all of which were delayed due to renewed outbreak of the separatist conflict in
2006. The IEG mission visited Jaffna University to see its progress in rebuilding, which is
impressive to date, although more is still needed to make up for the effects of the conflict.

2.39 The performance of the implementing agencies for the project was satisfactory.
The two agencies most directly responsible for the implementation were the Ministry of
Higher Education and its Policy Planning and Development Unit. The Unit in particular had
a dedicated professional staff that was a big factor in the success of implementation of
Quality Enhancement Fund and the Institutional Block Grants. Within each university, there
was a Local Technical Secretariat, staffed by professors and sometime by administrators, that
was responsible at the institutional level for the grants received. This included many aspects
of grant administration, such as procurement in conjunction with Policy Planning and
Development Unit assistance, and preparation of quarterly progress reports. The IEG mission
had meetings with the Unit and the Local Technical Secretariat during university visits,
which served to confirm reports concerning their work and due diligence, which they viewed
as part of their regular responsibility. The quality assurance activities were carried out by the
Quality Assurance and Accreditation Council, which was placed under the University Grants
Commission. The universities visited by the IEG mission pointed to the value of the Quality
Assurance and Accreditation Council activities in improving their operations and academic
programs.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.40   Overall quality of M&E is modest.
                                              18


2.41 Some shortcomings in the design of M&E in the PAD delayed the effective start of
M&E. For example, one of the five key indicators specified higher employment rates among
future graduates, which would not have been feasible until after project completion. Other
indicators, such as English and ICT tests, although relevant to project objectives, did not
have baseline data at appraisal. Grade point average was also specified, but not available as a
baseline indicator, and the overall relevance of Grade Point Average might be questionable,
since it is not standardized across universities. More subject specific academic performance
would have been more relevant. The design of the Higher Education Management
Information System could have contributed to the M&E effort, but the System was not well
specified in the PAD.

2.42 Implementation of M&E got off to a slow start, partly because of the design issues
and also lack of suitable staff. An M&E specialist was recruited in the second year, the Bank
supervision teams helped to sort out issues, and baseline values were collected. The
unrealistic indicator of employment rates of graduates was replaced by one measuring time to
get first job using a tracer study of participants in Quality Enhancement Fund programs.
Each individual grant program also had indicators to assess their progress. The Higher
Education Management Information System had difficulties in design and start up. IEG
mission discussions with the ICT directors in the universities visited indicated they thought
the System was not flexible enough to adapt to their institutions. Thus, each institution had
their own university-level System for their own administrative purposes, but the national
System, which was intended to link to the System in each institution, was not able to function
in that way. The full potential of the Higher Education Management Information System is
still to be realized.

2.43 The utilization of M&E results became more effective near the end of the project.
M&E reports on outcomes, outputs, and inputs were compiled and shared in regular meetings
of project stakeholders, including university administrators not directly involved in the
grants. In some institutions, the IEG mission found that there was sharing of information
with representatives of the private sector in order to get feedback on the employability of
graduates.


3. Education Sector Development Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
Objectives

3.1     The US$60.0 million Education Sector Development Project was approved on December
15, 2005 and became effective on February 21, 2006. It was financed by an IDA credit. The
objective, as stated in the Credit Agreement and the Project Appraisal Document, was to: (a)
promote equitable access to basic education (grade 1-9) and secondary education (grade 10-
13); (b) improve the quality of education; (c) enhance the economic efficiency and equity of
resource allocation and distribution within the education system; and (d) strengthen
education governance and service delivery. The project closed, as planned, on June 30, 2011.
The credit was fully disbursed. .
                                            19


Relevance of the Objectives

3.2     The relevance of the project objectives is substantial. All four of the objective (or
thematic areas) are closely aligned with the overall objectives of the most recent CAS (2008)
as well as the Education Sector Development Framework Program (2007) that outlined the
same thematic areas as above. Moreover, the CAS and project objectives fit well with the
Government‘s policy for both the overall economy and the education sector. The CAS had
three areas of focus: equitable development across regions and rural areas, accelerating
growth, and strengthening public service delivery (including education). All of this was to be
done in a way sensitive to the conflict situation in Sri Lanka, which had seen the ceasefire of
2002 deteriorate and a resulting escalation of conflict in the North and East. These are the
same areas that are given priority in the Government‘s Ten Year Development Framework.

Design

3.3    Components. There were a number activities grouped under each of the four
thematic objectives:

3.4     Equitable access to basic and secondary education. Four key initiatives were
provided for all children aged for basic (grades 1-9) and secondary education (grades 10-13):
(1) demand side incentives for school attendance, (2) upgrading the school network to relax
constraints on geographically equitable access to good quality basic and secondary education,
(3) strengthening special education programs for children with special learning needs, (4)
strengthening non-formal education programs for adolescents not in school.

3.5    Improving the quality of education. This component aimed to improve learning
outcomes by developing generic skills, such as creativity, communication, problem solving,
and non-cognitive achievements. There were three policy initiatives: (1) restructuring and
upgrading curriculum, (2) teacher development, (3) modernizing exams and testing.

3.6     Improving economic efficiency and equity of resource allocation. There were
three policy initiatives under this theme: (1) establishing a medium term budget framework;
(2) developing an overarching education sector development plan; and (3) establishing a
public expenditure and quality education tracking system.

3.7      Improving governance and delivery of education. There were three policy
initiatives under this theme: (1) establishing a balanced control model of school based
management; (2) conducting organizational analysis for capacity building; and (3)
implementing a human resource development strategy.

3.8    Implementation Arrangements. The project was designed as a Sector Wide
Approach (SWAp) based upon a comprehensive education framework developed by the
Government in partnership with the Bank. Other donors accepted the policy goals of the
SWAp and participated through parallel financing of their investment projects. There were
arrangements for an annual review with donors and efforts made to harmonize support. The
Government and the Bank, as the two main SWAp partners, took the lead on these annual
reviews. The institutional arrangements for a SWAp were appropriately developed with the
Finance Commission, which is responsible for the provincial education budgets, playing an
                                               20


active role. The arrangements for school based management, drawing cautiously upon
lessons in other decentralization project, allowed the policy framework to be disseminated
down to the school and classroom level (see section on achievements). The IDA credit
funding was integrated into the government expenditures, rather than assigning procurement
and disbursement to individual components. However, all project procurement followed
agreed upon Bank procedures. As a SWAp, the policy objectives of the project were
comprehensive and covered major themes relevant to improving sector wide performance.
These project development objectives were derived from themes directly elaborated in the
document ―Education Sector Development Framework and Programme‖ (Ministry of
Education 2007). There was no specific mention of connections to the labor market or higher
education, but the project would develop general skills of critical thinking, English language,
and ICT.

3.9    Finance. The Bank finance for the project was originally for US$60 million and an
additional US$10 million was added in 2008. The project objectives remained unchanged
and the additional financing was used to enhance the original objectives given that
implementation and utilization of resources was proceeding well (see section on
achievements). The additional Bank financing was also fully disbursed when the project
closed on schedule.

Relevance of Design

3.10 The relevance of design is substantial, given that the objectives were actually broad
policy themes that require sector wide action as opposed to the kind of specific activities of a
traditional project. The design of the thematic component activities drew upon the latest
research and sector work concerning how to connect project activities to results in terms of
increased access, improved learning, and enhancing governance (see for example, Boissiere
2004). Thus, the results chain envisioned improving curriculum, developing teachers, and
linking the budgeting of resources to improving learning as the major determinants of
improving education outcomes. With respect to improving access, the project design
provided demand side incentives as well as supply of school facilities within appropriate
locations for all households. However, as noted in the IEG education portfolio review,
increased inputs do not always translate into improved learning (see IEG 2011). Hence, it is
necessary to have assessments of learning to verify learning outcomes, as was done in this
project. The project design also included intensive and detailed participation by the
Government, the relevant central agencies, as well as provincial governments. This resulted
in a detailed understanding of how the education sector works so as to achieve results in Sri
Lanka that was incorporated into the design of implementation. Table 3.1 gives a schematic
description of the Results Framework while the evidence for extent of achieving results in
given in the section below on efficacy.

Implementation
3.11 While the objectives were not modified during the project implementation, in 2008
US$10 million was added to the original funding of US$60 million. It was clear by then that
the project was making significant progress, and additional initiatives could be supported
under the original themes. The added initiatives were consistent with the CAS and the
original objectives, and included activities to expand educational opportunities in poor
regions and conflict affected regions. Also, more emphasis was placed on English language
and higher order thinking skills to support the ten year development framework for
accelerating Sri Lanka‘s progress to becoming an upper middle income country.

3.12 The project financing is listed in project documents as a Sector Investment Credit,
but the implementation arrangement is defined in all the project documents as SWAp. It is
regarded as a SWAp because of the wide ranging and coherent policy approach, the use of
local budgeting systems and the flexibility of arrangements for donor contributions. In the
end, the only donor to use the local budgeting systems was the Bank, but the other donors
recognized the broad policy framework. The institutional framework for implementation
followed the provisions of the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution (1987) that
                                                                  22


allowed for devolution of some government services (that is, health and education) to the
provincial levels of government. The provincial governments are structured parallel to the
central in that there is a Provincial Council under which comes a Provincial Education
Department. These provincial education authorities deliver education services following the
national policy and guidelines of the Ministry of Education (with the exception of some
national schools which come directly under the Ministry).

3.13 The planned and actual expenditures do not follow the project components as is done
in a Specific Investment Loan. As this is a SWAp, the Bank disbursed US$72 million
(including the additional grant) over the lifetime of the project. The report-based method of
disbursement was used with the Financial Management Reports being used as the basis for
the Bank‘s no-objections and tranches being released twice a year. These Financial
Management Reports also provided SWAp-type implementation arrangements similar to
joint reviews of progress and policy dialogue. Two special accounts were set up, one for the
national level activities with the Ministry of Education and the other for the provincial level
authorities. The Government education sector budget was planned at appraisal to be
US$2,700 million equivalent over the project lifetime, which went through the normal
Government financial procedures. There were no analyses made at project completion
concerning the actual amount of Government budget allocated to the basic education sector.
Project progress was monitored through a system of M&E indicators rather than though
disbursement profiles.

3.14 Implementation took place throughout all of the provinces since education is one of
the Government services that were devolved to the provinces. Thus the provincial structures
of government, organized in a manner parallel to the national one, were in effect the
implementation agencies on the front line of delivery.

3.15 Procurement for the Education Sector Development Project was carried out centrally
through the Procurement Cell at the Ministry of Education which received extensive training.
Financial management was carried out by the Technical Support Unit in the Finance
Commission, which worked closely with the Procurement Cell and also did the Financial
Management Reports. There were no major issues in either procurement or financial
management, although the audit opinion was qualified for a period due to weakness in asset
management, which was resolved by the end of the project. The construction and renovation
of schools followed Bank policies and complied with environmental safeguards.


Achievement of the Objectives
EQUITABLE ACCESS TO BASIC AND SECONDARY

3.16 The objective of equitable access was substantially achieved. In primary grades 1-5,
Sri Lanka has had gender parity for some years (Table 3.2). The national network of schools
is complete, with only maintenance and refurbishing tasks, depending upon location. This
achievement is being maintained through the demand side incentives of the project, such as
providing meals and snacks. Since Sri Lanka has achieved universal primary education, the
emphasis of the project is on particular groups, such as those needing special education.
While no hard statistics are available, in each school the IEG mission visited there are
provisions for special education and they reported increased training for teachers.

3.17 Given Sri Lanka‘s success in primary grades, the emphasis has shifted to access to
basic education (grades 1-9) and, more specifically, grades 6-9. Thus, one of the targets
selected for this objective was to increase the net enrollment rates for ages 6-14 from 81
percent baseline (2003) to 83 percent by project end (2011).

Source: School Census (2008) and Household Expenditure Survey (2006/07)

3.18 However, the census was delayed when the Cease-Fire Agreement of 2002 broke
down and fighting started again in 2006. Reliable nation-wide population data will not be
available until the next census planned for 2012. Nonetheless, data from a household survey
in 2006/07 showed that net enrollment for grades 6-9 was 94 percent. This can be sorted out
when the next census takes place, but it would seem that almost universal access to basic
education is already achieved.

3.19 Another indicator was that out of school children was reduced by 68,000 compared to
target of 50,000. The survival rate through grade 9 increased from 78 percent baseline to 91
percent at project end, exceeding the target of 88 percent. The conflict affected Northern and
Eastern provinces showed significant improvements due to strategic emphasis in these areas
which lag behind the others. This is due in part to the additional project financing being
                                              24


targeted to conflict affected schools. Demand side measures of the project at grades 6-9
level, especially provision of free uniforms, helped to keep children in school. The pro-
active measures of the School Attendance Committees as part of the Program for School
Improvement also helped. The Ministry of Education is also committed to expanding and
improving special education for children with a variety of disabilities. The IEG mission
visited classrooms for special education in the urban areas, although no numbers were given
as to how much of the special education population is covered and no targets were specified.
Anecdotally, the mission was informed that access for special education is increasing, and
attitudes of families about their children are changing. In the past, families were ashamed
and kept such children at home, but, due in part to the Ministry‘s efforts, more of these
children are attending regular schools. However, it should be noted that education up to
grade 9 or age 14 is compulsory, although no active program of punitive measures seems to
be in effect.

3.20      Progress was also made in improving access to secondary education, defined as
grades 10-13. The net enrollment rates for females improved from 51 percent (2002) to 69
percent (2007), and for males from 46 percent (2002) to 65 percent (2007). The network of
secondary schools has expanded to the point where in 2010 a secondary school is available to
every child within a five kilometer distance of their homes. The Asian Development Bank,
as a SWAp partner, is especially involved in secondary education, with its Secondary
Education Modernization II Project( completed in 2010) and follow on Skills Development
Project (due to close in 2012). In principle, as result of Government and donor partners
efforts, there is universal access since tuition is free, but other factors, especially economic
ones intervene as the students approach working age. That is given as a reason for the
somewhat lower male net enrollment rate. The Non-Formal Education Branch in the
Ministry of Education did an island-wide survey (2007) of children not in school and makes
provisions to enroll them in non-formal education programs. UNICEF in particular among
donors in the SWAp is active in this area of non-formal education and is bringing to bear its
experience from other countries, especially in conflict zones, into getting adolescents back
into schools. During its visit to the Jaffna, the IEG mission also had conversations with a
UNICEF representative who was also visiting the area at that time. Although no hard
statistics were given for this activity, it appears from anecdotal evidence that progress is
being made.

3.21 Data from the indicators collected show significant success in attaining those
indicators, even under difficult circumstances. The IEG mission in visits to schools and
discussions with teachers and provincial officials in Central Province and Northern Province
could also see evidence first hand of project success. Even in the Northern Province, which
is one of the weakest, due to the prolonged conflict, the schools appear to be back to
functioning. Nonetheless, reports to the mission from zonal education officials indicate that
there is still a great deal of reconstruction to do in some zones where the fighting and
destruction were greatest during the last year of the conflict in 2008 to early 2009, At a
meeting of in Jaffna, attended by directors and staff from all five districts and twelve zones
of the Northern province, recovery efforts were described in zones like Killinocchi and
Mullaittivu, where fighting was heaviest in late 2008 and early 2009. Not only was there
physical reconstruction needed, but whole populations had been displaced and serious
                                                  25


psychological problems were being addressed. Local school attendance committees are
making an extra effort to try to get children back in school.

IMPROVING QUALITY OF EDUCATION

3.22 The objective of improving quality of education is rated as substantial. The
percentage of schools with teaching plans increased over the project period (from none to
100 percent), the percentage of schools staffed with qualified staff and supported by teacher
development increased from 80 percent to 95 percent, the percentage of textbooks delivered
to schools on time increased from none to 100 percent. Defects and mistakes in textbooks
were corrected. An examination item bank was established and exam guidelines specified
and sent to schools and stakeholders.

3.23 Using the National Assessment of Learning test scores as an indicator of learning
improvement, gains were made in first language, mathematics, and English for grade 4
between 2003 and 2009. This is based upon a random sample of students, as opposed to a
high stakes public exam taken by all students. Over the six-year period, using the proportion
of students scoring more than 50 percent score on this test, improved learning was recorded
for mathematics (65 percent to 79 percent), Mother Tongue (67 percent to 80 percent) and
English (31 percent to 56 percent, Table 3.4).

scoring more than 50 percent on each test)

Source: National Assessment Report 2011

3.24 Similar gains were recorded for grade 8, with mathematics going from 33 percent
(2005) to 45 percent (2008) and science going from 53 percent (2005) to 59 percent (2008).
Given the time sequence of Education Sector Development Project activities, which officially
started in 2006, it is likely that a significant part of this progress in learning can be attributed
to the additional resources from the project. However, it cannot be ruled out that other
factors, for example improvements in inputs from previous projects, could have also
contributed to the increase in scores. Based upon preliminary econometric analysis, the
project activities most likely to be sources of improved learning are providing more
textbooks, improving in-service teacher training, and instituting the school improvement
program.4


4
  More data and analysis is needed to sort out the attribution of project inputs to learning outcomes.
Preliminary econometric analysis shows a plausible connection. See ―The Impact of School Quality, Socio -
economic Factors, and Child Health on Students‘ Academic Performance: Evidence from Sri Lankan Primary
Schools by Aturupane, Glewwe and Wisnieski (2009). This paper uses the household survey data collected in
connection with the National Learning Assessment.
                                              26


3.25 Improving the teaching and learning of English was an important part of quality in the
project. The project supported this by expanding access to bilingual education. Although
fairly successful, the bi-lingual program reached 87 percent of its target of 1,000 schools due
to shortages of teachers. This resulted in measured improvement in cognitive achievement
scores in English language from 32 to 58 at project end with all provinces exceeding targets.

3.26 Besides test scores and learning assessments, the concept of education quality also
included social cohesion goals, although the objectives do not spell that out. However, under
curriculum reform subcomponents, the goal of social cohesion was listed among curriculum
activities. Textbooks, such as history and social studies, were revised with this goal in mind.
Thus, Teacher Centers conducted multi-ethnic teacher training to promote multi-cultural
ideas in the curriculum. By end of project 78 training courses were conducted. Nonetheless,
it is difficult to develop a genuine outcome measure of this goal in the short run.

IMPROVING EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION

3.27 This objective of improving resource allocation (in terms of efficiency and equity) is
rated as substantial. Before the project there was very little information available on how
resources were allocated and budgets were developed year by year on an ad hoc basis. The
Public Expenditure and Quality Education Tracking Survey was developed and put into
operation, the first round in 2006-07 producing a report to track both quality and resources
allocated. The first round report showed that provincial schools received less than the
national schools (directly under the Ministry of Education) in terms of spending per student
and spending per school. The average spending per student country-wide was 16,380 rupees,
whereas the national schools received 19,313 rupees per student. None of the provinces,
which ranged from about 14,000 to 17,400 rupees per student, was higher than the national
schools. Based upon these results, it was decided to increase resources for provincial
schools. The second round of surveys is in progress, which is expected to show more equity
in provincial resource allocations.

3.28 A Medium Term Budget Framework was developed to overcome the inefficiency of
ad hoc budgets that reflected old priorities and did not make room for new objectives, such as
enhancing higher order learning processes (critical thinking and problem solving) and skills
in education. National level results show improvement in resource allocation to higher order
processes (defined as those activities conducive to developing critical thinking and problem
solving), and provincial level data suggested progress in this area. The percentage of
recurrent budget to higher order learning process and inputs, identified as textbooks and other
learning materials, increased from 0.5 percent to 3.3 percent. The percentage of the capital
education budget to equipment and facilities, identified as computers, language labs and
science labs, for higher order process and inputs increased from 40 percent to 43 percent.
Resources allocated for maintenance and repair of education capital stock increased from 5
percent to 18 percent. All of this indicates more resource allocation to quality generating
inputs as opposed to barely maintaining recurrent costs like teacher salaries.
                                            27


IMPROVING GOVERNANCE AND DELIVERY OF EDUCATION

3.29 This objective of improving governance and delivery of education services is rated as
substantial. One major result was the introduction of school-based management—the
Program for School Improvement. This involved a model of balanced control in which some
functions of school management were devolved to the school level while others were
retained at provincial and national levels. The basic features of the model involved active
community involvement through a School Development ‗Committee, school level planning
aimed at improvement, a sustained program of training for teachers and the community, and
very high level support within the province and national Ministry of Education. An impact
evaluation of the pilot schemes show that program schools attained better student learning
outcomes compared to non-program schools.

3.30 The indicators for the organizational capacity objective were completed and the long
term human resource development plan was produced and put into operation. Based upon
this analysis, Human Resource Development plans for provincial education officials were
developed and delivered by the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration. The IEG
mission visits to some provinces and discussion with officials there point to the important
role of local capacity development in making progress during the project. At both the school
and the provincial office level, the concerns about quality and improving management could
be seen in the way the schools were working and how the provincial officers organized their
work. While these are anecdotal impressions, they are fully consistent with the monitoring
reports collected by the project implementation units. There appears to be a culture of good
governance and management reaching down to the school level. For example, the mission
conducted a rapid reading assessment in a few of the primary schools visited. The class
teachers and principals did not see this as a threat, but they were genuinely interested in this
as a method they should use themselves for feedback. In the provincial office meetings, it
was not only the Chief Education Officer, but also the Chief Officer of the province as a
whole who took a keen interest in the education reforms as a way to revitalize their local
economies. This augurs well for the success of the devolution of education services down to
the provinces.

Efficiency
3.31 The efficiency of the project is rated as substantial based upon the way in which the
SWAp mechanism helped to improve the efficient performance of the whole sector. The
Bank‘s contribution was not a large percentage of overall financing of the sector over the six
years of the project, but the Bank‘s contribution served as the policy lever that transformed
the way education policy and planning is done in Sri Lanka. Thus, not only was the Bank
contribution used effectively, but the total Government contribution was allocated based
upon a specific set of policies, and more resources were allocated to higher order learning
objectives as opposed to simply increasing the budget in an ad hoc way across budget
categories. In addition, a cost-benefit analysis using project cost data and earnings analysis
from labor force surveys estimated an internal rate of return of about 16 percent. In addition,
the project closed on time and completely disbursed its original and additional allocations.
                                              28


Ratings
PROJECT OUTCOME

3.32 Given a rating of substantial for relevance, efficacy and efficiency, the overall
outcome rating for the Education Sector Development Project is satisfactory. With respect to
efficacy, all four project objectives are rated substantial. Relevance of objectives and of
design is also rated substantial.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.33 The overall risk to development is negligible to low. The IEG mission found that in
all of its meetings and visits that the four thematic objectives supported by the SWAp are
now firmly rooted and supported by the major actors and agencies. From the budgetary point
of view, the Finance Commission and the Treasury are committed to the methods for
allocating education budgets to the provinces and ensuring that higher order education
processes get their adequate share of budget, both recurrent and capital. The executing
agencies (Ministry of Education, NIE) are committed to the policy objectives of the project
and have embodied these goals in the next five year strategic document (2012-2016).
Enthusiasm for and understanding of the SWAp approach itself is widespread. Thus, there
are no major political or policy risks going forward. There may be some risk from the
economic and budgetary aspects if the growth of the economy falls below expectations,
resulting in less resources being allocated to the development objectives. As of now, both
the Bank and the IMF expect economic growth to continue as it is now (about six percent) or
maybe more. There will be technical challenges and problems to be solved, especially in the
weaker provinces of the North and East, and also the poorer provinces in the South (Uva and
Sabaragama). However, the Second Education Sector Development Project will provide
much of the needed support for that. Given that the budgetary risks look minimal, the
technical risks of implementation are also low with Bank support, and the ownership level of
the development objectives are now widespread, the overall risk to development outcome is
low.

BANK PERFORMANCE

3.34   The overall performance of the Bank was satisfactory.

3.35 The quality at entry was satisfactory based upon strong analytical sector work
during preparation. This had essential inputs and ownership by the Government agencies as
well as local academics and other donors. Thus, the issues that needed to be addressed in the
SWAp were well understood and identified. This helped in developing the comprehensive
set of performance indicators that guided the progress of the project. Also, lessons learned
from the two previous projects and a number of special studies contributed to the quality of
preparatory work.

3.36 The performance of the Bank during supervision continued to be satisfactory. In
mission visits to both central and provincial agencies, there was widespread appreciation of
the Bank for fielding a sufficient implementation support team with appropriate specialists in
                                             29


all areas of the project. In addition to helping with procurement and fiduciary issues, the
Bank team continued its strong analytical support through special studies and continued
sector work mid-way through and at the end of the project (to lay the basis for the follow-up)
Education Sector Development Project-2. Numerous supervision visits throughout the
provinces and zones also gave critical support to the decentralized approach to
implementation and helped build up capacity, even at the school level.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

3.37   The Borrower‘s performance was satisfactory.

3.38 Throughout preparation and implementation, the Government was actively involved
and provided support. The Central Government showed its strong support and commitment
to decentralization in the education sector, with the Finance Commission helping to develop
the capacities of the Provincial authorities. This was especially important to help the
Program for School Improvements to get up and running.

3.39 The implementing agencies, namely the Finance Commission, the Ministry of
Education, and the Provincial Education Authorities were able to coordinate and monitor
their respective responsibilities and activities. The Ministry established a procurement cell to
do project procurement and the Finance Commission took care of Financial Management
Reports. There were no procurement and financial management issues. The IEG mission
met with the main leaders from the implementing agencies who were involved in the
preparation and early implementation. Based upon these discussions, it was clear that a
thorough commitment to the SWAp developed early on and the need for broad but clear
policy commitments were needed to make the approach work. As the project proceeded,
monthly high level monitoring meetings, chaired by the Secretary of the Ministry, helped to
maintain the momentum of project activities. Periodic visits, on average every two months,
to provinces and zones were conducted by the Ministry and Bank teams.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.40   The quality of M&E is rated substantial.

3.41 The design of M&E specified a comprehensive set of indicators that were relevant to
the four main objectives. The methods and sources of collecting the data needed for the
indicators were planned out during the preparation process.

3.42 As a result of good specification and planning of the M&E framework,
implementation of M&E went well. One problem, which was beyond the scope of the
project, was the flare up of the separatist conflict in the North after the break down of the
Cease Fire Agreement in 2006. The M&E process was interrupted there, but it picked up
again after May 2009 when the conflict ended.

3.43 The utilization of M&E was very extensive throughout project implementation. This
was especially useful for the devolution of the governance and management of the education
system, and the provincial authorities have now adopted a more evidence based approach to
policy and planning. The comprehensive system of M&E also contributed to the sector work
                                               30


at the end of the project, in conjunction with the extensive sector work for preparation of this
project, which helped the Government and education agencies understand what was
achieved, and what more is needed in the follow-on project.

4. Lessons
4.1     Since beginning the collaboration in the education sector with the various agencies of
the Government, the Bank and the Government have achieved a holistic understanding of the
problems of the school system, skill training and development, and the needs of higher
education and the economy and the labor market. Given this holistic understanding, the two
projects under review might have made more explicit links to take advantage of synergies
such as aligning the curriculum changes to develop critical thinking.

4.2    Based upon the experience of the Undergraduate Education project, a few priority
lessons can be drawn.

      M&E activities for objectives related to economic and labor market relevance
       need to be carefully planned for early in the project cycle. The key performance
       indicators needed more careful definition in relation to the objective (for example,
       employability) and specification of methods for obtaining and analyzing the related
       data (for example, tracer studies, comparison groups, on-going or special household
       or establishment survey programs).
      In designing higher education sector reform programs, it is helpful to be
       selective and pick the top priority, feasible, issues first, avoiding trying to do too
       much in one project. In Sri Lanka, the selection of quality and relevance, and the
       related systemic capacity building, were the entry points into a reform program that
       all stake holders could agree upon. This provided the initial momentum to get
       program of sector reform started, with the realization that it would take more than one
       project cycle.
      Institutional and competitive grants provide a good incentive to overcome, for
       the most part, the accumulated inertia of past academic bureaucracy, at least in
       new programs. The use of institutional and competitive grants provided a good
       incentive as opposed to trying to create changes by administrative or legislative
       decree. In addition, it was recognized that there was a demonstration effect in which
       other academic programs improved, even if they did not directly receive a grant. This
       adds to the lessons about the effectiveness of competitive grants found in the IEG
       review of higher education lending during the 1990s.
      In a reform where there is some initial resistance, it is important to have the
       support of a few respected champions within the sector. In Sri Lankan higher
       education, the quality assurance process succeeded in the end, after some initial
       suspicion and misunderstanding on the part of some professors, due to the effective
       leadership of a few energetic and respected professors.

4.3     The Education Sector Development Project also presents some useful lessons.
                                          31


      A sector-wide approach can increase ownership of sector goals and the work
       program by working through the country budgetary system and implementation
       arrangements. In the case of Sri Lanka, both provincial and national level officials
       became more involved in sector planning, programming and resource allocation as
       well as review and M&E of sector performance.
      The SWAp can serve as an important catalyst to leverage both the financial and
       technical support provided by the Bank and other donors. In Sri Lanka, where
       this was the first SWAp, the Bank‘s sector-wide support initiated a broader and more
       regular policy-level dialogue with the Government and leveraged Bank influence on
       sector resource allocation beyond the resources it directly provided.
      Learning assessments are critical to know whether the increased resources and
       inputs to improve education quality translate into improved learning outcomes.
       The National Assessment of Learning was very important in terms of measuring
       learning outcomes for reading and mathematics, as a result of the increased resources
       and inputs to improve quality measured by the M&E system.
      Decentralization and school-based management has the potential to improve
       education processes and outcomes. In the situation of devolution to the provinces
       in Sri Lanka, the school-based management program enhanced ownership of the
       project objectives. The capacity building and support activities of the project were
       also major reasons for successful implementation.

4.4     Lessons from both projects have been incorporated into follow-on projects. The new
higher education project, ―Higher Education for the Twenty-First Century‖ (2010), continues
and builds upon using grants as a performance incentive mechanism. Grants will also be
expanded to post-graduate level research and innovation to make better connections to the
private economy. The quality assurance and accreditation activities are being extended to
cover private as well as public universities. The new project ―Transforming School
Education‖ continues and updates the broad policy framework of the Education Sector
Development Framework Program. The M&E system is now robust enough that this project
is using the Results Based Method of Disbursement, the first time this is being done in Sri
Lanka. Thus, some of the successes of these two completed projects provided the foundation
for more ambitious operations.
