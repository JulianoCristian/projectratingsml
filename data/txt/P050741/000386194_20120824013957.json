       Quality of Undergraduate Education Project for Sri Lanka\n            were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Education Sector Development\n            Project for Sri Lanka were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was negligible to\n            low; Bank performance was satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            includes: Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) activities for\n            objectives related to economic and labor market relevance\n            need to be carefully planned for early in the project cycle.\n            The key performance indicators needed more careful\n            definition in relation to the objective and specification of\n            methods for obtaining and analyzing the related data. In\n            designing higher education sector reform programs, it is\n            helpful to be selective and pick the top priority, feasible,\n            issues first, avoiding trying to do too much in one project.\n            In Sri Lanka, the selection of quality and relevance, and\n            the related systemic capacity building, were the entry\n            points into a reform program that all stake holders could\n            agree upon. Institutional and competitive grants provide a\n            good incentive to overcome, for the most part, the\n            accumulated inertia of past academic bureaucracy, at least\n            in new programs. The use of institutional and competitive\n            grants provided a good incentive as opposed to trying to\n            create changes by administrative or legislative decree. In a\n            reform where there is some initial resistance, it is\n            important to have the support of a few respected champions\n            within the sector. In Sri Lankan higher education, the\n            quality assurance process succeeded in the end, after some\n            initial suspicion and misunderstanding on the part of some\n            professors, due to the effective leadership of a few\n            energetic and respected professors. Learning assessments are\n            critical to know whether the increased resources and inputs\n            to improve education quality translate into improved\n            learning outcomes. The national assessment of learning was\n            very important in terms of measuring learning outcomes for\n            reading and mathematics, as a result of the increased\n            resources and inputs to improve quality measured by the\n            M&E system. Decentralization and school-based management\n            has the potential to improve education processes and\n            outcomes. In the situation of devolution to the provinces in\n            Sri Lanka, the school-based management program enhanced\n            ownership of the project objectives. The capacity building\n            and support activities of the project were also major\n            reasons for successful implementation."}, "docdt": "2012-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
