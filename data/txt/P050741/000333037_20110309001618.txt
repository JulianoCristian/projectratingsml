1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Sector information. At the time of appraisal, the higher education system was failing to provide the
modern skills required for Sri Lanka's development. The main issue was insufficient relevance and
quality in public universities. Teaching and learning practices did not encourage the acquisition of
competencies and social skills demanded in the labor market. Curricula in many disciplines were not in
tune with broader economic and social needs. Faculties lacked critical learning resources, modern IT
systems, laboratory equipment, library materials and adequate facilities. A high proportion of academic
staff (over 60%) lacked postgraduate education and exposure to high quality teaching and research
environments. In addition, faculty management systems failed to encourage sound performance and
transparent quality monitoring.

The Government recognized the fundamental weakness of the higher education system and made higher
education reforms a priority and developed a long-term strategy to respond to this concern. The reform
projected the rationalization and restructuring of university and non-university. The reform also focused
on improving public-private partnerships, introducing accreditation mechanism, cost-recovery strategies,
supporting innovative faculties to enhance education quality, and increasing access in higher education.

The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS ­ 25413 LK , April 23, 2003) targeted economic growth and
poverty reduction. It focused on four themes: (i) improving fiscal discipline/ensuring sustainable
macroeconomic balances; (ii) developing/promoting the private sector; (iii) enhancing social protection
and building human capital; and (iv) improving portfolio performance. The Sri Lanka Improving
Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education Project (IRQUE) supported the second and third
goals of the CAS by promoting relevance and quality of higher education, and by contributing to efficient
public administration, economic development and social harmony.

IDA had been supporting Sri Lanka's efforts in the education sector since mid-1980s focusing on general
education, vocational training, and teacher education. IRQUE was the first higher education project in Sri
Lanka. Many lessons drawn from the design and implementation of higher education projects in other
countries were taken into consideration during preparation of this credit.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the Improving Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education Project was to
support the Government's tertiary education reform program by enhancing institutional capacities
conducive to greater relevance and quality in undergraduate education. This would be achieved by
building institutional capacity in the tertiary education system and improving relevance and quality in
undergraduate education.

The project's key performance indicators were the following:

    1. Higher employment rates among future graduates of selected undergraduate programs;
    2. Improvement of Information Technology (IT) capabilities;
    3. Improvement in English proficiency level;
    4. Improvement of Graduate Records Examination (GRE) where applicable; Grade Point Average
       (GPA) test scores; and
    5. Higher employment rates among retrained unemployed graduates.




                                                    1
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

There were no revisions to the Project's Development Objective during implementation. However,
revisions were made to the key performance indicators to make them clearer and measurable. In addition,
due to a policy decision taken by the government for systematic recruitment of graduates into the public
sector, the sub-component 2.2 ­ Improving the employment prospects of unemployed graduates (i.e.
Tharuna Aruna program II) was discontinued in December 2006. The balance funds were reallocated to
Tsunami Emergency Reconstruction project. Accordingly, the fifth indicator (higher employment rates
among retrained unemployed graduates) was considered redundant, and it was agreed to limit to the first
four PDO indicators during the IDA mission in November-December 2006.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, Original and Revised

The project's target population included the following groups: (i) undergraduate students; (ii) academic
and professional staff of universities; (iii) professional staff in the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE),
the University Grants Commission (UGC); and (iv) unemployed graduates.

By enhancing the quality of teaching through training, increasing the market­oriented courses and
improving access to modern learning resources, the project expected to directly benefit all public
university undergraduate students (about 73,500),            some private higher education institutions,
unemployed graduates through training in English, IT skills and job acquirement skills. Additional 4,148
academic and professional staff of universities was trained with degree courses, short term training (3-6
months). The project also expected to indirectly benefit private sector and self-employment from a greater
pool of well trained graduates with a more positive orientation towards a career in the private sector given
the fact that about 74% of the jobs are in the private sector and self-employed category.

1.5 Original Components

The contents in this section are directly from the PAD.

Component 1. Building Institutional Capacity in the Tertiary Education System (US$14.7 million)
equivalent of total project cost). This component had following sub-components:

A.   Strengthening national planning, monitoring and evaluation systems, and coordination at the
     national level. National-level governance bodies set the vision, define the policies and develop the
     strategies. Implementing these functions requires further capacity to monitor and evaluate the
     sector's performance. The improved national planning and monitoring system supports tertiary
     education policy makers in monitoring the implementation of new policies. This sub-component
     finances capacity building in the Ministry of Tertiary Education and Training and the UGC and
     provides technical assistance to introduce a Management Information System (MIS) and a Labor
     Market Observatory (LMO). Financial support is available to conduct policy studies including, inter
     alia, the feasibility of a voucher scheme, support to the new national policy framework to increase
     access, and the introduction o f national planning, and monitoring and evaluation systems.

B.   Establishing the Board for Quality Assurance (BQA). The BQA is responsible for developing
     policies related to quality criteria and organizing independent peer reviews of self-assessments by
     faculties and accrediting, on demand, national and international accreditation agencies. The BQA
     develops a comprehensive evaluative review system, which applies to all public and private
     institutions, based on techniques and tools consistent with international best practice. The results of
     quality reviews are made available to the public via the UGC Web site. This evaluative framework


                                                     2
     becomes institutionalized in a continuous degree program review cycle. The BQA: (a) is established
     within the framework of the UGC; (b) becomes an independent body by 2004; (c) is subject to
     periodic reviews; and (d) is supported by an appropriate MIS.

C.   Strengthening management of public universities and faculties. The project finances efforts to
     improve planning and management capacity at universities and other TEIs. Training and technical
     assistance is available to help institutions modernize their practices in strategic planning, financial
     management, human resource management, academic management, and management of buildings
     and equipment. Institutional grants are available for special programs to strengthen management,
     student services, social harmony, improved English language competency, and computer skills of
     teachers and graduates. Training is provided to public and private TEIs to prepare proposals to be
     submitted.

D.   Enhancing public awareness. As part of the strengthening of the MTE&T and the UGC, a
     continuous public awareness campaign and stakeholder dialogue is supported to build consensus on
     the various stages of the reform program and disseminate information about achievements attained.

E.   Monitoring and evaluation. Research activities are implemented to monitor and evaluate the impact
     of project investments on important academic, economic and social outcomes. Both the national and
     institutional levels are covered through monitoring and evaluation measures. The studies are
     contracted through research institutions and consulting firms.

Component 2. Improving relevance and Quality of Tertiary Education (US$36.30 million equivalent
of total project cost). This component had following sub-components:

A.   Establishing a Quality Enhancement Fund (QEF) to allocate resources to improve undergraduate
     degree study programs in public and private TEI's. This sub-component supports quality
     improvement block grants for study programs to enhance the relevance and quality of undergraduate
     degree programs. The QEF supports programs selected by transparent and objective procedures.
     Universities are invited to submit development plans elaborated by degree programs. Each
     development plan indicates: (i) how the degree program improves the employability of future
     graduates in the coming three years; (ii) additional investments needed; (iii) resource mobilization
     strategies to ensure the sustainability of investments; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation of progress
     to access the next tranche of the grant. The review panels for the QEF selects the proposals which
     offer the maximum net benefits and help accelerate the pace of improvement in undergraduate
     programs.

     To promote competition among institutions of comparable institutional strength the potential grant
     recipients are tiered in four categories: (i) established public universities; (ii) regional public
     universities; (iii) conflict-affected public universities; and (iv) private institutions and professional
     organizations.

     Eligibility is limited to existing study programs (with the first intake of students before January 1,
     2001) and whose minimum entry requirement is passes in two national GCE A/L subjects taken in
     the same year. A maximum of three block grants are awarded to any one university. In addition to
     the general eligibility criteria, private institutions receiving grants is also required to provide: (a)
     evidence that investment to the grant amount is made in the corresponding study program by the
     institution; (b) evidence of use of at least 5% of the grant for social and inter-cultural harmony
     initiatives; and (c) in the case of private institutions, agreement to repay the principal of the grant
     (interest free), after a five year grace period in five equal tranches over a five year term if the annual
     tuition fee per student (including fees for examinations and administration) is greater than 100,000


                                                      3
     SLR. Private institutions are also required to provide a legally registered guarantee equal to the grant
     amount. The Quality Enhancement Team manages the collection of grant repayments and a
     revolving fund made up of such funds (to be established by the Government). The revolving fund is
     used to finance further quality enhancement investments in the private tertiary education sector.

B.   Tharuna Aruna II Program (Young Professional II program). This sub-component supports
     training initiatives that lead to more appropriate and productive employment for a maximum of
     10,000 currently unemployed graduates. The proposed program supports work experience modules
     and training for unemployed graduates to become more employable in the private sector. An
     unemployed graduate is defined as "a graduate from a Sri Lankan tertiary education institution,
     under the age of 35 years, with less than 1 hour paid occupation in the previous week." An
     unemployed graduate is considered to have found "full-time employment" when he or she has
     obtained a contract with a minimum duration of one year in the private sector. Unemployed
     graduates entering the Tharuna Aruna II Program is eligible for up to 12 months training under the
     scheme. This training comprises up to 8 months of work experience, during which a graduate is
     eligible for an allowance and stipend of LKR 6,000 per month. The Government, through IDA-
     support, will provide LKR 4,000 per month and the company accepting the graduate matches this
     with a further LKR 2,000 per month. The training component comprises up to 4 months of intensive
     courses, or 8 months of intensive evening and weekend courses. The Government, through IDA-
     support, funds a combined living/travel allowance of LKR 5,000 per month for up to 4 months of
     attendance in a training program by an approved course provider. In addition, the Government,
     through the proposed program, provides each participating unemployed graduate with LKR 40,000
     in vouchers, redeemable only with approved course providers. An unemployed graduate is not
     required to undertake the full twelve month program if an employment opportunity becomes
     available. He/she may accept a job offer at any time during the work experience module or course
     period. This ends his or her participation in the program and allowance / stipends cease.

1.6 Revised Components

The credit agreement was not revised during the life of the Project.

1.7 Other significant changes

Restructuring (February 2005). Sub-component 2.2 ­ Tharuna Aruna program II was discontinued in
December 2006. The balance funds SDR5,341,000 (80% of the original funds assigned for the
component) were reallocated to the Tsunami Emergency Reconstruction Project , which was presented
and approved by the Board on February 15, 2005. The Board paper included a list of names of all the
projects from which funds were taken to finance the Tsunami Emergency Project. This was taken as
simultaneous Board approval of the implied re-structuring of these projects.

Funds Reallocation (March 2009). The reallocation was to: (i) use of savings from the project for the
development of the University of Jaffna and Vavuniya Campus in the Northern Province to improve
conditions of the campuses affected by the conflict; and (ii) allow to fully implementing the critical
Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS), the cost of which has exceeded earlier
estimates.

Funds Reallocation (October 7, 2009). The reallocation allowed the project to provide additional
funding to Jaffna University (affected by the conflict) and Faculties with greater need to make their
programs more employment-oriented in Arts, Humanities, Management and General Science through
Institutional Block Grant (IBG). It also allowed the Government to utilize the project resources for the


                                                     4
preparatory work of the new operation, Higher Education for the Twenty-first Century Project. The funds
reallocated amount to SDR1,653,750.

Project Extension. The project was extended for six months until June 30, 2010, mainly to meet the
needs of the universities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, where project progress was hampered by
the war conflict.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Ownership and participation from the Government. The Government's commitment was high and
made higher education reform a priority. During the project preparation, MoHE launched a multi-media
awareness campaign to inform the public at large on the Government's policies related to higher
education. The Ministry of Labor and Employment installed a task force to advise the Government on
policies to improve the employment prospects of unemployed and underemployed graduates in private
companies as an alternative to the 25,000 underemployed graduates. The government was very
committed to introduce the reform. Stakeholder consultation was conducted to maintain a platform to
carry out the reform.

Bank team's communication and dialogue with the government. The Bank team made conscious
efforts to consult with the stakeholders from the higher education sector. During the preparation mission
the Bank team participated in the working session with the Steering Committee to discuss matters related
to project preparation and the studies under the under the PHRD grant, which supported the
implementation of Government's reform program. The Bank team participated in a monthly meeting of
the Vice Chancellors of all universities. The Bank team and the MoHE jointly defined the project
development objectives and actions to achieve them.

Quality enhancement at entry. The Bank team requested a quality enhancement review (QER) during
project preparation (March 22, 2001) to seek advice from a group of experts with rich knowledge and
experience in the higher education sector as well as the Bank operations. The QER panel recommended
the team to simplify the project design, which was too complex and ambitious in the initial design. This
advice, along with other suggestions, was very helpful for the final project design and had a positive
impact on the achievement of the project objectives. On targets and baseline data for the PDO indicators,
it would have benefited if the QER panel had focused more on M&E design ­ requiring that baseline and
end-of ­project targets be established as part of preparation / appraisal process.

Lessons learned were taken into consideration. The project design incorporated lessons learned from
the Bank's publications on higher education policy and reform as well as previous Bank-financed tertiary
education projects Argentina, Chile, Ghana, Indonesia, Hungary and Congo. Major relevant lessons
included competitive funding scheme, specifically on rewarding and recognition for good competitive
performance and procurement procedures for universities. Another lesson was drawn from the Sri Lanka
Teacher Education and Teacher Development Project which was still under implementation at the time of
preparation of IRQUE. The lesson was that ambitious reform program in higher education should be
implemented in carefully phased stages and project design should be as simple as possible. In doing so,
the chances of achieving project objectives would be high.

The project was in line with the CAS (CAS -25413 LK, April 23, 2003) for Sri Lanka. The CAS
identified economic growth and poverty reduction as its primary goals. The project supported the CAS
goals by promoting relevance and quality of higher education, and by contributing efficient public
administration, economic development and social harmony.


                                                   5
2.2 Implementation

The project was prepared between 2001 and 2003. The Government was highly committed to the project
and continued its strong leadership for the project. As a result, the project declared effectiveness two
months after the Board approval. There was a widespread agreement among the major stakeholders that
the IRQUE functioned as a forerunner of major reforms needed in the next decades. The synergy among
stakeholders was high.

The DO and IP ratings for the project maintained Satisfactory throughout the entire project life. However,
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was rated Moderately Satisfactory at one time; but it was improved to
satisfactory after the efforts made by the Bank team and Policy Planning and Development Unit (PPDU)
staff (see more on section 2.3).

Tharuna Aruna program II was discontinued. This program was a sub-component under component 2.
It was designed to provide training to unemployed graduates to make them more employable by the
private sector. The background of Tharuna Aruna II was as follows: In 2003, the number of unemployed
graduates was estimated to be 27,000. This presented the Government with economic and social
problems, in the sense that the pool of unemployed graduates represented a significant potential for social
unrest. The Government perceived potential radicalization of unemployed graduates as a significant
threat to the. The Government addressed the issue of unemployment graduates as an urgent priority. Thus,
the program was included in the IRQUE. However, in 2005 the new Government made a policy decision
to recruit all unemployed graduates into the public sector. As a result, the program lost its justification to
be financed. Implementation of Tharuna Aruna was satisfactory. The remaining fund (SDR5,341,000)
of this program was reallocated to the Tsunami Emergency Recovery Program. The discontinuation of
financing of the Tharuna Aruna program was not due to a deficiency in implementation, but to a Bank's
decision based on policy considerations. It did not affect the overall achievement of the project objectives.

Support for the Government's higher education strategy. After the presidential election, the new
government launched a consultative process to prepare a higher education strategy and requested the
Bank to support the initiative under the IRQUE. The Bank team made four presentations at the launching
workshop. In addition, the Bank used the proceeds of the IRQUE Project to finance the costs of the
technical assistance needed to develop the documents leading to the final framework. The collaboration
further enhanced the Bank's relationship with Sri Lanka in the area of higher education.

Change of Bank TTL. There were two changes (September 2005, and April 2009) of task team leader
(TTL) during implementation. Both transitions were smooth. Core team members remained and a new
one was added with M&E expertise which was very much needed for the project at the time. In addition,
some of the core team members were based in Colombo (i.e. FM and procurement specialists, and a lead
education specialist). This enabled frequent and close collaboration on solving implementation issues.
Throughout the implementation, the dialogue between the Bank team and the government and PDDU
were smooth and frequent. Both parties sought and found solutions to facilitate the implementation
bottlenecks. Regular implementation missions and close monitoring contributed to the achievements of
the project development objectives.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design. There were no baseline and end-of-project targets for the PDO indicators and some of
output indicators in the project design. These values were retrofitting during implementation. Though the
output and input indicators were directly linked to project components, the PDO/Outcome indicators in
the PAD did not include either baseline data, or end-of-project targets. Furthermore, one of the five PDO
Indicators was not realistic (the first one in the PAD). It was difficult to measure "Higher employment


                                                     6
rates among future graduates of selected undergraduate programs" because of the time lag which
characterized the production of graduates. In fact, very few students would go through the whole
graduation process while benefitting from the project activities. In reality employment patterns were
affected by many factors exogenous to the project. Thus, this indicator was replaced by a more responsive
one, namely the waiting time before the first job. Another weakness of the M&E design was lack of
clarity. Some of the outcome/output indicators in the PAD were ambiguous (i.e. not specific) and not
measurable. This adversely affected the M&E of different sub-components of the project, especially
during the initial stages of project implementation.

M&E implementation. Because of the reasons mentioned above, monitoring of project progress had a
slow start. But it picked up as the capacity at the university and the Policy Planning and Development
Unit levels was strengthened through training and recruiting an M&E specialist for the PDDU. In 2006,
The IRQUE M&E report system was established. Progress in the M&E activity was well reflected by the
M&E Reports. Initially reduced to their bare minimum, these reports gained in depth and width over time.
The reports covered outcome, output and input indicators. The reports clearly described the methodology
followed to estimate them, and provided a short but informative analysis of the results. They explained
the initial shortcomings, and the approach to mitigate them. They also presented the limitations inherent
to quantitative indicators, and cautioned the readers about the interpretation of the results, especially in
comparisons (e.g. inter- and intra differences variations in grading the GPA). This project-based M&E
became a start for the development of a sector-wide M&E system.

In addition to the project outcome, input and output indicators, the M&E reports were complemented by a
number of instruments developed during the life of the Project. First, each study program with a Quality
Enhancement Fund (QEF) grant developed its own set of indicators to follow up activities under this
scheme. Second, these study programs submitted quarterly reports to PPDU. Third, annual stakeholder
fora were conducted during the whole life of the Project, gathering the QEF Local Technical Secretariat
(LTS) staff, the IBG coordinators and members of the academic community (including university vice
chancellors, faculty deans, department directors, and bursars). These meetings provided a unique
opportunity to gather the feedback from the Project stakeholders to find solutions for common issues.
Fourth, the PDDU conducted annual review to assess: (i) the grantee's capacity to implement the plan; (ii)
the feasibility to achieve the performance targets within the given time frame; and (iii) to recommend the
necessary corrective actions to improve performance. These practices indeed improved the
implementation smoothness and the quality of the output/outcomes.

In December 2006 PDO indicator 5, "Higher employment rates among retained unemployed graduates",
was dropped due to the discontinuation of Tharuna Aruna Program under the Component 2. It was based
on the policy decisions taken by the Government for systematic recruitment of unemployed graduates. At
the time of discontinuation of the program, out of 6,000 targeted pledges, 4,331 placements (72% of the
target) were made.

Some of the PDO indicators were modified to make them clearer and measureable (see section 3.2)

M&E utilization. Quality and reliability of data to feed indicators progressively improved. The M&E
report data not only monitored project progress, but also provided critical data for an external impact
evaluation of the IRQUE, which effectively informed the policy makers in the higher education sector.
The data assisted the preparation of the Borrower's ICR as well as the Bank's ICR.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard. The project adhered to the Bank's environmental guidelines and prepared Environment
Management Plan for each rehabilitation and expansion of facility financed under the project. No


                                                     7
safeguard issues were triggered at the time of appraisal or emerged during project implementation. On
social safeguard: The project was designed not to have any negative social impact, and did not trigger
Bank policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous people. In fact, the IRQUE project generated
positive social benefits through the promotion of social cohesion and humanization in universities.

Financial management. The PPDU and implementing entities consistently performed as per the
expectations of IDA with regard to having acceptable financial management arrangements. The capacity
of the FM staff was strong, the deliverables of financial reports were accurate and timely, sound record
management was in place and other control mechanisms also were in place consistently throughout the
life of the project. Annual financial audits were carried out in line with the Bank's policy (under Terms
of Reference and by auditors acceptable to the Bank). During the review of audits and during
implementation missions neither the auditors nor the Bank identified any major issues that affected FM
performance.

Procurement. Public universities and eligible private institutions played a major role in executing the
project including procurement, monitoring and other project activities through the Local Technical
Secretariat (LTS). Procurement capacity of the PPDU and the LTS staff attached to universities was
improved substantially during the project period. Extensive training programs organized by the PPDU
and assisted by the Bank contributed significantly for such capacity development. No major procurement
issues were encountered during implementation. However, the mid-term review mission identified some
generic and specific issues such as low review thresholds. Agreed time-bound mitigating actions were
taken after the mid-term review.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Transitional arrangements have been made through the follow up operation "Higher Education for the
Twenty-First Century Project (HETC)", which was approved by the Board on May 13, 2010. The most
successful interventions under the IRQUE Project have been continued and expanded under the HETC,
such as improvement of English language and IT skills, quality assurance, higher education management
information system. By continuing these interventions with the support of this new project, the
Government has taken forward the reforms aimed to enhance the higher education sector and to
strengthen even further the quality of the higher education institutions in Sri Lanka.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of the project's development objectives was high at the time of preparation and remains
high today. The development objectives are consistent with GOSL's current NEC National Policy
Framework on University, Technical and Vocational Education (2009) as well as the World Bank Higher
Education Report for Sri Lanka (2009). The current Country Assistance Strategy FY09-FY2012 (CAS)
for Sri Lanka emphasizes human development, economic performance and social progress. The follow
up operation HETC is a key element of the CAS agreed between the GOSL and the WB.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory
The project made substantial progress towards its Development Objectives and it is rated Satisfactory.
The rating is based on baselines/targets retrofitting during implementation (see Table 1 and section 2.3
M&E design).



                                                   8
The PAD proposed a set of indicators to measure (a) enhanced institutional capacities conducive to
greater relevance and; (b) improved quality in undergraduate education. The retrofitting PDO indicators
were as follows:

      1.   Reduced averaging waiting time for the first job
      2.   Improved average IT score
      3.   Improved average English language score
      4.   Improved average Graduate Grade Point Average (GPA)

The average waiting time for the first job decreased significantly from 14 months in June 2004 (baseline)
to 4.5 months in September 2009 against the target of 6.3 months. The overall average English Language
score increased from 59% in March 2005 (baseline) to 69% in December 2008 against the target of 67%;
and the overall average graduate GPA rose from 2.92 in September 2004 to 2.98 in September 2009 and
met the target of 2.98. The overall average IT scores increased from the baseline of 49% to 56% in
December 2009, though it did not meet the target of 60%. It should be noted that this score was
calculated based on the average of IT theory scores and Software Application scores. While there was no
significant change in the average value for the theory score (baseline of 60% to 61% at end of project),
there was a substantial improvement in the average value for the software applications (i.e. practical
aspect) score which increased from the baseline of 38% to the end-of-project value of 52% (Table 1).

The project interventions directly contributed to the achievements of these targets. The average
waiting time was calculated based on a sample of 650 graduates supported by the Quality Enhancement
Fund (QEF) Batch 1. The data were collected from the tracer studies conducted by the QEF study
programs. The average IT score and English Language score indicators were based on Institutional Block
Grants (IBGs). English and IT skills are considered as critical in improving graduate employability in Sri
Lanka. In order to measure the effectiveness of the project, these two skills were chosen as main
performance indicators. A total of 450 students from 12 public universities were included in the sample.
The average graduate GPA was measured to assess the impact of the project on the overall university
system as a whole. For average GPA, 19 faculties in 8 universities were selected on a random basis.

Besides the PDO indicators, other achievements / positive impact were observed, which were not
measurable by numbers. For example, the qualitative feedback received from the university community
pointed out that the IRQUE Project made a significant contribution for a conceptual and attitudinal
change. New concepts were introduced through the project (e.g. competitive funding based on proposals,
proposals based on activities rather than investments, performance measurement through indicators and
other means, external quality assessments etc.) are now widely accepted and appreciated by the university
community. The administrative staff accepted the importance of strategic planning and other similar
methods. Further, academics were involved in project administration, thereby working closely with
administrative and accounting staff. It helped to develop a close working relationship and understanding
among all parties, which had not existed prior to the IRQUE project.

Achievements of major project activities against output indicators (see Annex 2) are elaborated in the
following section.

Component 1: Building Institutional Capacity in the Tertiary Education System

The activities under this component were implemented beyond their original scopes and achievements
exceeded the targets, which in turn has impacted the learning achievements of the undergraduate students.

Strengthened Management Capacity of Universities and Faculties
Under this component, 168 training programs were conducted benefitting 4,148 officials in the areas of
planning, monitoring and evaluation of HE sector activities. IT centers were established or renovated in
universities. New IT and English programs were introduced. These interventions showed positive impact
on the achievements of student's abilities in utilizing computer software and other IT equipment, and
English. In addition, training workshops and awareness programs on quality assurance, strengthening
management capacity at public and private TEIs contributed towards capacity building at the national
level.

The project also provided additional support to strengthen the Planning Unit of the MoHE by sponsoring
a major study on "Developing Major Strategies for Better Higher Education in Sri Lanka." The study on
Labor Market Observatory was transferred to the Ministry of Youth Affairs which has set up a Labor
Market Information System.

Established National Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Systems
The core activity under this first sub-component was the development of a Higher Education Management
Information System (HEMIS). Initially defined only in very broad terms in the Project Appraisal
Document, the nature and scope of this activity was specified at project mid-course. Likewise, there were
no baseline or target values for the activity indicators, and those were defined afterwards.




                                                   10
It was then decided that the HEMIS would be established at two distinct and interrelated levels: the
national level (N-HEMIS) to support sector-wide planning, monitoring and evaluation (M&E); and the
University level (U-HEMIS) to computerize core operations and support planning and M&E for
universities and to provide data for the N-HEMIS.

N-HEMIS.         The N-HEMIS was technically well established at the end of the project. Its
institutionalization was steadily progressing, and its long-term sustainability is likely as substantial efforts
were made in dissemination and training to a wide range of users. The N-HEMIS software application
was completed, and the system was operational and accessible on-line (www.NHEMIS.lk). Core data on
higher education were loaded and available in the system. Like any information system, maintenance and
further improvement would be an on-going task in the future. For example, data coming from outside of
the higher education sector including employment, population, research and public finances would still
need to be collected, and their integration in the N-HEMIS would take time because of the validation
process.

U-HEMIS. When the U-HEMIS was designed in 2007, the initial objective was to install core modules
in selected universities. The following modules were envisaged in the U-HEMIS: (i) Student Information
System (SIS), (ii) Logistics and Facilities Module, (iii) Student Self-Care), (iv) Human Resource
Management (HRM), (v) Accounting and Budgeting System, (ABS), (vi) Staff Payroll System, (vii)
Fixed Assets Module, (viii) Management Information Interface with N-HEMIS, and (ix) Library System
(as a built-in option). The installment of the U-HEMIS took longer than initially expected, but it
proceeded well. At project closure, the SIS Module and the Student Self Care Module were fully installed
in all universities 1 after a lengthy customization process made necessary because of the specificities of
each university. These modules were fully operational in 11 universities after base records and
transaction data were successfully entered. The other modules were installed in 11 universities. The
potential benefits of the U-HEMIS would be considerable and would become more obvious as the system
is more widely used in the universities.

Strengthened Quality Assurance
One of the major achievements under the IRQUE project was the establishment and implementation of a
quality assurance accreditation (QAA) function for public universities. The QAA Council was
established in 2005. The achievements of QAA council included the development of Codes of Practice
and a Credit and Qualification Framework. Under the quality assurance process, 163 subjects /
departments were reviewed through external assessments by multi-disciplinary teams. This was about 51
percent of all degree programs. Over 32,000 students and 3,200 staff members in 51 out of 76 faculties in
public universities benefited from the external quality assessments conducted by the QAA Council. To
promote quality culture, 146 awareness programs and 114 workshops were conducted in public
universities. A Quality Assurance Handbook for university libraries was developed and 13 awareness
programs were carried out. The QAA process was extended to cover postgraduate degree programs and
research. The QAAC established under the IRQUE project is now a division of the UGC.

The success of QAA did not come by easy. The development of quality assurance mechanisms required
considerable work by the MoHE and the UGC at the commencement of the project. The notion of quality
assurance reviews of university study programs conducted by external parties was unfamiliar to the
university system, and met with considerable resistance at the start of the project. The MoHE and UGC
engaged in extensive and wide-ranging discussions with the stakeholders, particularly the university

  With the exception of Moratuwa University which already had a SIS system of its own, and therefore, additional work is
needed to integrate the two systems




                                                             11
academics. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Directors (CVCD), which had initiated the quality
assurance process, championed the activity with the university communities. At the end of the project,
there was widespread acceptance of quality assurance activities as a vital and integral component of the
higher education sector.

Institutional Block Grants (IBGs)
The positive impact of the IBG on the academic environment and the students `employability was
recognized by faculty and students alike. IT training, facilities and equipment (1,270 PCs) under IBGs
were highly appreciated. IT and English training skills were in high demand from employers. The
mainstreaming of IT training in the regular curricula of some universities was a testimony of the success
in this area. Activities under the Social Harmony Banner were credited to have created a more cohesive
student body, which was an important result in a country that had experienced a long civil war.

Public awareness campaigns built consensus on HE sector reform among the academic community
through media campaigns, newsletters and workshops. The project conducted 357 awareness programs
and workshops between 2004 and 2009. The number of visits (cumulative) to the IRQUE website
reached 12,465 by June 2010. The awareness campaign activities started at the project preparation and
continued during the project implementation period. It was noted that further awareness programs and
sensitization would be needed to ensure the sustainability of the new concepts introduced by the IRQUE
Project, as well as to promote the general public awareness on reforms introduced by the project.

Component 2: Improving Relevance and Quality of Tertiary Education

Established Quality Enhancement Fund
The objective of QEF was to allocate resources to improve the quality and relevance of undergraduate
degree programs in public and private HEIs. The QEF scheme had an impact on the first outcome
indicator, namely the average waiting time before getting a first job. The waiting time drastically
decreased from 14 months in 2004 to 4.5 months in 2009, largely exceeding the 6.3 target. It should be
noted that other factors also contributed to the decrease (i.e. IBG activities, labor market demand).

The QEF exceeded its original scope of two rounds of QEF. A third batch was added during project
implementation in 2008 at the request of the MoHE and UGC. The QEF 3 was `to benefit the Faculties of
Art, Social Sciences, and Humanities, which had not been able to win bidding during the first batches of
the QEF. Advanced Technological Institute (ATIs) of the Sri Lanka Institute for Advanced Technological
Education, which had not been part of the initial competition, was also included in the third round.

The feedback received from members of the academic community during the visits to universities and at
the stakeholder workshop held on June 30, 2010 was very positive. The QEF scheme had a direct impact
on the quality of teaching and on the learning environment. It contributed to the increase in practical
literacy in English and IT. Curricula development and revisions, and staff development were recognized
by stakeholders as major benefits of the scheme. The QEF allowed study programs to be equipped with
renovated libraries, laboratories, pedagogic materials and computers which were largely lacking prior to
the Project. Furthermore, the development of tests such as the Test of English Proficiency to measure
progress made under the QEF was a positive by-product of the scheme.

In addition to these specific benefits, the introduction of discipline in the areas of planning, monitoring,
and procuring was repeatedly singled out by the beneficiaries. The concepts of standards and
performance are now more widely accepted in universities. The idea of competing for funds to achieve
specific objectives percolated the entire academic community. More profoundly, the competitive
approach contributed to attitudinal changes within this community and unleashed more creativity and
appetite for change.

3.3 Efficiency

Due to lack of data, an economic analysis was not carried out for this ICR. Nonetheless, the team
reviewed the "Impact of IRQUE Project"which was conducted by an independent consultant, and
included the relevant information in this section of the ICR.

Decreased job search duration. The Average Waiting Time for the First Job was calculated in months
for all the graduates supported by QEF Batch 1 excluding medical students. The evidence reveals a
significant drop from 14.0 months in June 2004 (baseline value) to 4.5 months in September 2009.
Further, the average waiting time for the first job of Arts, Social Sciences & Humanities graduates
decreased from the baseline value of 21.6 months (June 2004) to of 8.7 months (September 2009).
Similarly, the average waiting time for the first job of the graduates from science based programs
decreased from 10.6 months to 3.5 months. Gender comparison was not possible due to lack of baseline
data. It is obviously that the reduction in the average waiting time for the first job has gone well beyond
the targets. But it is difficult to distinguish the specific impact of IRQUE on graduate unemployment.
The reason is that graduate employment is a function of several factors such as economic growth,
government employment policy, and the quality of graduate output which the project has likely boosted.

The average scores on IT, English and GPA demonstrate significant improvements in undergraduates'
learning during the project period. It is obvious that a thorough analysis would be needed to evaluate the
project impact on these four Outcome Indicators, and to distinguish the same from other contributory
factors. It is important to note that return to investments in higher education is long-term and hence the
impact assessments based on project life span tend to under-estimate the full benefits of the project
interventions.

In addition to decreased job search time among graduates, the Impact Evaluation of IRQUE Report
includes an analysis of efficiency. The following are some results from the survey designed to assess the
impact of IRQUE.



                                                    13
Efficiency and effectiveness of training. The impact of training examined in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness reveals positive changes with respect to time management, and promoting continued
learning within the universities. It also indicates above 70 percent rating at the upper ends of the scale of
efficiently using human resources and office resources. In fact, this confirms the findings on quality and
relevance, and changes in behavior and approach to work. Undoubtedly, these changes have a long-term
positive impact on overall performance of the university system.

The overall assessment of the project interventions on a 1 to 5 scale by project coordinators (4.6),
beneficiaries of training (4.3), and university academics on QAAC (4.2) and QEF (4.0) indicate the
fulfillment of expected project outcomes set in the PAD. These high ratings by different stakeholders
confirm the major achievements of the capacity building, quality assurance, and monitoring and
evaluation components. The average score of 3.9 given by the students confirms positive changes of the
higher education system due to the project interventions. The overall rating of 3.2 given by the employers
also reveals positive changes in the HE system and highlights the need for further improvement in quality
and relevance of higher education.

Improving employability was one of the key areas of actions identified by the Government for IRQUE
project interventions. The data from the "Labor and Social Trends in Sri Lank 2010" showed an increase
in graduate employment. During 2003-2006, the graduate employment was 206,000 per annum and it
went up to 255,000 after 2007. While the increase could be attributed to several factors such as overall
economic growth and government employment policy, one could safely identify improvement in quality
and relevance of undergraduate studies as yet another key determinant of graduate employment.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
The Project's overall outcome rating is Satisfactory based on the high relevance to the Government's
reform in higher education sector, building of national higher education sector capacity, and improving
relevance and quality of higher education. The project achieved its development objectives and covered
broader scope of reform and realized more benefits. All this was achieved within the original budget.
Besides the PDO indicators, other achievements / positive impact were not measurable by numbers. For
example, the qualitative feedback received from the university community pointed out that the IRQUE
Project made a significant contribution for a conceptual and attitudinal change. New concepts were
introduced through the project (e.g. competitive funding based on proposals, proposals based on activities
rather than investments, performance measurement through indicators and other means, external quality
assessments etc.) are now widely accepted and appreciated by the university community.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project did not include any specific impact measurement on poverty or gender. Notwithstanding, the
Project covered universities in the remote and conflict affected region in Sri Lanka.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project had a direct impact on strengthening the capacity of MoHE, UGC, and especially on
universities. All the sub-projects (i.e. Institutional Block Grants, QEF grants and others.) were
implemented by the relevant universities, faculties and departments. The project activities at university
level were coordinated by the project office called Local Technical Secretariat (LTS). The monitoring of


                                                     14
the progress of project activities was conducted at the university level on a regular basis by the Project
Monitoring Committees (PMCs) appointed by the universities. Positive feedback had been received on a
regular basis from the university community regarding the M&E concepts and mechanisms introduced
through the project. The initiation of outcome and results based approach as well as the promotion of
accountability through the M&E mechanisms of IBGs and QEF grants had created a new culture within
the university community. It is anticipated that these new concepts and good practices would be
incorporated into the regular activities of universities.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The development of tests such as the Test of English Proficiency to measure progress made under the
QEF was a positive by-product of the scheme.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

This is a Core ICR, but it has some features of an intensive learning ICR. The following is a summary of
a beneficiary survey results from the "Impact of IRQUE", which was conducted by an independent
consultant before the project closing. While the survey is not statistically representative, it provides a
glimpse of beneficiary perceptions of Project interventions. For that reason, the results are listed below.

    The survey results indicated that interventions of the project through component 1 and 2 made a
    positive contribution to improve quality and relevance of higher education system in Sri Lanka. The
    positive feedback also indicated potential benefits associated with the project in terms of promoting
    higher education sector development and thereby strengthening long-term socio-economic
    development of the country.

    The evidence revealed that 90 percent of respondents rated the training programs of IRQUE were
    relevant, high quality, and useful for future career development and communication skills.

    On the changes in behavior and approach to work aspect, the evidence showed that benefits were
    realized through improved analytical ability, effective decision making, planning and organizing of
    work, operational efficiency, and team orientation.

    Seventy percent of the respondents reported rated efficient use of human and office resources. This
    confirmed the findings on quality, relevance, and changes in behavior and approach to work.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate
The assessment of risk to Project Development Outcome is rated as Moderate. Several factors bode well
for sustaining the Project benefits over time, and Sri Lanka Government's commitment and ability to
continue implanting its higher education reform program. These are: (i) the activities supported by the
project continue to be fully consistent with the national higher education policy; (ii) the follow up
operation (Higher Education for the Twenty-First Century Project) is aimed at broadening and deepening
the level of engagement and support for the higher education sector; (iii) MoHE's management capacity
has been strengthened through IRQUE project, with well-qualified staff. MoHE is capable of
coordinating the implementation of a complex project; (iv) implementation and monitoring capacity at the

One area that needs to be focused on is enhancing public awareness. The general public continues to
criticize university education system, and the media highlights mostly the negative aspects of university
education system. The progress of higher education policy reforms, investments in quality enhancement
activities, improved learning outcomes and contribution to human capital development are yet to be
brought to the notice of the university community and the general public at large.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank team worked closely with the GoSL during the preparation phase, making conscious efforts
with stakeholders from the higher education sector as well as other relevant ministries, and jointly
defining the project development objectives and actions to achieve them. Project preparation took into
account lessons learned from the previous projects. While the Bank team made good efforts in ensuring
quality at entry in most aspects of the project, the M&E design was not adequate. The PDO/outcome and
output indicators in the PAD did not include either baseline data, or end-of-project targets. Furthermore,
some of the PDO indicators were ambiguous and not measureable. This adversely affected the efficient
monitoring of progress of the project. Considering the negative impact on the project implementation
especially at the initial stage, the Bank team performance at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory
The quality of the Bank's supervision efforts is rated as Satisfactory. The supervision team included the
appropriate mix of skills, and support for procurement and financial management was provided to the
PPDU as well as the coordinators at the universities. Supervision missions were carried out at routine
intervals, and periodical video conference meetings were held to review project progress and issues that
needed immediate attentions.

During project supervision there were three different team leaders. The transitions in task team leaders
were smooth and did not have any delays in project implementation. Team leaders were pro-active in
responding to rising issues, and bringing necessary technical expertise as part of supervision missions.
The Bank's team frequently carried out field visits to meet stakeholders and listen to their concerns.

It should be recognized that the Bank team's efforts in responding to GoSL's request in preparing its
policy framework for higher education. After the presidential election, the new government launched a
consultative process to prepare a higher education strategy and requested the Bank to support the
initiative under the IRQUE. The Bank team made four presentations at the launching workshop. In
addition, the Bank used the proceeds of IRQUE Project to finance the costs of the technical assistance
needed to develop the documents leading the final policy framework for the development of higher
education.

Because of the efforts made by the Bank supervision team, the DO and IP ratings of the project
maintained as satisfactory throughout the entire life of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The rating for the Bank's overall performance is considered Satisfactory, based on proactive
implementation support and the satisfactory project results.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The Borrower's performance during preparation and implementation is rated as Satisfactory. The two
administrations during project's preparation and implementation showed high commitment to the
Project's main development objectives. More importantly, the Government's higher education sector
goals remained unchanged, even with changes in administration. The Government demonstrated strong
leadership during the preparation and implementation of the Project. It led the preparation process,
adequately shaping the Project to support its priorities. This drive continued during implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The project was implemented by the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), through its Policy Planning
and Development Unit (PPDU). The MoHE's performance is also rated Satisfactory. The PPDU staff
was dedicated and professional. The university teams in charge of the implementation of the project were
competent and enthusiastic. This unique combination of skills and attitudes allowed maintaining the
momentum and keeping implementation on track. This was evidenced by the positive feedback provided
repeatedly by the stakeholders.

IRQUE was the first higher education project financed by IDA. Both the PPDU and the Local Technical
Secretariat (LTS) at the universities were new to the Bank's operation procedures. In addition,
competitive funding mechanism was first introduced to Sri Lanka higher education institutions. Facing
these challenges, Quality Assurance under the UGC, PPDU and LTS learned the skills needed for
implementing the project in a relatively short period. Implementation capacity was enhanced
dramatically. The Bank provided support and advice during this capacity building process. The MoHE
achieved development objectives stated in the PAD and introduced a new concept of competitive funding
mechanism to the Sri Lanka higher education community.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
The overall performance of the Government and the MoHE is rated Satisfactory based on the following:

       Government's strong vision and leadership during project preparation;
       Government sustained commitment to higher education sector reform;
       Achievement of Project development objectives;
       Good performance by the MoHE, UGC, PPDU, project coordinators and LTS at universities in
       ensuring effective coordination of all project components.

6. Lessons Learned

M&E in project design should have sufficient details on performance indicators (i.e. input, output
and outcome indicators) relating to various components and sub-components. This is critical for the
effective monitoring and evaluation of projects during the implementation. Similarly, the establishment of
baseline values and the projection of target values at project inception are important.

For tertiary education projects, project management should delegate implementation power to the
University Local Technical Secretary (LTS) and coordinators. It is an effective method of
implementing the competitive funds and the non competitive (in the case of IBG in IRQUE project)
grants. In the case of IRQUE, LTC executed the programs under the grants at each university. A large
number of university staff were trained in the GoSL and World Bank procurement systems and gained
extensive skills. Through this practice, implementation skills of universities were substantially
strengthened. The delegation of implementation power facilitated speedy implementation of the project
activities and bolstered ownership. The structure is also efficient for decision making.

On procurement, a wide dissemination of operational guidelines (in addition to the World Bank
Standard Bidding/SRFP Documents) is a prerequisite for smooth project execution. In the case of
IEQUE project, the customized bidding/RFP documents that were prepared by the PPDU and distributed
to universities after the Bank's concurrence helped to maintain the uniformity and standard of activities
implemented by universities and study programs.

Competitive funding for tertiary education institutes should pay attention to the following aspects:
    All faculties do not have the same level of implementation capacity. Hence, a tier-system and/or
    specific windows are often necessary when designing a scheme such as QEF.
    Initial and ongoing training (i.e. proposal writing and procurement procedures) for staff are critical
    for the success of competitive funds.
    The amount of a grant absorbable by study programs or departments and the time frame of
    implementation must be carefully thought through.
    Proper incentives (monetary and non-monetary) for the academic staff in charge of implementing the
    activities play an important role.
    Procurement can become a hindrance if not properly managed.
    Performance Indicators must be selected carefully, their number should be kept at a reasonable level,
    and the targets should be realistic.

Regarding the length of sub-project duration, it is recommended that it be limited to a maximum of
three years in future operations. The comparison of similar World Bank funded projects in other
countries also shows that in most of the cases the sub-project duration was limited to three years. The
reason is that comparatively lengthy sub-project duration (i.e. 4-5 years) resulted in frequent changes of
project personnel (i.e. coordinators and persons-in-charge of activities). Moreover it could, to a certain
degree, result in receding energy and enthusiasm among the project staff during the latter part of project
implementation.

On quality assurance (QA), transparency of the external assessment process is vital to build up the
confidence in, and acceptance of, the external quality assessment, especially during the introductory
phase. The concept of QA in higher education was a new phenomenon to the Sri Lankan university
system. Therefore, active awareness campaigns at the initial stage were crucial for such attitudinal and
cultural changes.




                                                   18
During the process of building quality assurance culture, university authorities should make every
effort to induce the desire for quality as a main principle in every operation in their institutions to
create a quality culture. The experience of IRQUE showed that the internal QA procedures need to be
strengthened along with the external assessments, especially with the first review cycle. Accordingly,
internal QA units need to be established in all public universities during the project period, with the
involvement of all the stakeholders.

It is essential to rally the university community and the general public at large around policy
reforms in higher education by using robust public awareness campaigns publicizing the impact of
investments in quality enhancement activities, and improved student learning outcomes.

Students are key stakeholders in higher education reform and need to be involved in proposal
preparation as well as in implementation of project activities under the competitive (IBG and QEF)
grants. Their participation in project activities (from the proposal preparation and during the
implementation) is critical for smooth implementation and success of the project.

Frequent stakeholder consultation involving university and industry can improve the quality and
relevance to suit the changing needs. In doing so, industry sectors can provide continuous feedbacks to
the university community. This, in turn, will strengthen the linkage between academic and industry.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Due to lack of data, an economic analysis was not carried out for this ICR. Nonetheless, the team
reviewed the "Impact of IRQUE Project "which was conducted by an independent consultant, and
included the relevant information in this section of the ICR.

Decreased job search duration. The Average Waiting Time for the First Job was calculated in months for
all the graduates supported by QEF Batch 1 excluding medical students. The evidence reveals a
significant drop from 14.0 months in June 2004 (baseline value) to 4.5 months in September 2009.
Further, the average waiting time for the first job of Arts, Social Sciences & Humanities graduates
decreased from the baseline value of 21.6 months (June 2004) to of 8.7 months (September 2009).
Similarly, the average waiting time for the first job of the graduates from science based programs
decreased from 10.6 months to 3.5 months. Gender comparison was not possible due to lack of baseline
data. It is obviously that the reduction in the average waiting time for the first job has gone well beyond
the targets. But it is difficult to distinguish the specific impact of IRQUE on graduate unemployment.
The reason is that graduate employment is a function of several factors such as economic growth,
government employment policy, and the quality of graduate output which the project has likely boosted.
The average scores on IT, English and GPA demonstrate significant improvements in undergraduates'
learning during the project period. It is obvious that a thorough analysis would be needed to evaluate the
project impact on these four Outcome Indicators, and to distinguish the same from other contributory
factors. It is important to note that return to investments in higher education is long-term and hence the
impact assessments based on project life span tend to under-estimate the full benefits of the project
interventions.

In addition to decreased job search time among graduates, the Impact Evaluation of IRQUE Report
includes an analysis of efficiency. The following are some results from the survey designed to assess the
impact of IRQUE.

Efficiency and effectiveness of training. The impact of training examined in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness reveals positive changes with respect to time management, and promoting continued
learning within the universities. It also indicates above 70 percent rating at the upper ends of the scale of
efficiently using human resources and office resources. In fact, this confirms the findings on quality and
relevance, and changes in behavior and approach to work. Undoubtedly, these changes have a long-term
positive impact on overall performance of the university system.

The overall assessment of the project interventions on a 1 to 5 scale by project coordinators (4.6),
beneficiaries of training (4.3), and university academics on QAAC (4.2) and QEF (4.0) indicate the
fulfillment of expected project outcomes set in the PAD. These high ratings by different stakeholders
confirm the major achievements of the capacity building, quality assurance, and monitoring and
evaluation components. The average score of 3.9 given by the students confirms positive changes of the
higher education system due to the project interventions. The overall rating of 3.2 given by the employers
also reveals positive changes in the HE system and highlights the need for further improvement in quality
and relevance of higher education.

Improving employability was one of the key areas of actions identified by the Government for IRQUE
project interventions. The data from the "Labor and Social Trends in Sri Lanka 2010" showed an increase
in graduate employment. During 2003-2006, the graduate employment was 206,000 per annum and it
went up to 255,000 after 2007. While the increase could be attributed to several factors such as overall
economic growth and government employment policy, one could safely identify improvement in quality
and relevance of undergraduate studies as yet another key determinant of graduate employment.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Stakeholder Workshop Findings. A stakeholder workshop was held on June 30, 2010, specifically in
support of the ICR preparation. About 50 participants included the Secretary and staff of Ministry of
Higher Education, Chairmen and staff of UGC, University Chancellors, Professors, faculty researchers,
and project coordinators from universities, private sector, six PPDU staff, and four Bank ICR mission
members. In the past few years, five stakeholder meetings involved public and private universities,
covering all regions in Sri Lanka.

The presentations from universities, MoHE and UGC on relevant components were well received. The
stakeholders invited to the workshops unanimously reported favorably on the project. There was strong
support among gathered stakeholders for the continuation of the program.

During the Stakeholder Workshop participants shared their experiences and lessons learned in the
following areas:

Quality Assurance & Accreditation (QAA) Experiences. QAA process was the first formal and in depth
evaluation conducted at the department level in universities in Sri Lanka. Having some apprehension of
outsiders looking in their "business", faculty members were anxious. However, once the review process
commenced they were more than happy with how it was conducted and never felt apprehensive or
anxious. Their feedbacks were; (i) the exercise gave them an opportunity for a thorough look at what they
do / achieve as a faculty; (ii) it also gave them an additional opportunity to ensure quality in their
activities and their products; and (iii) they learned how to work as a team,

Capacity building in grant proposal writing, and implementing project activities. Most participants
expressed how the project helped them build capacity in writing proposals and implementing project
activities, which they did not have the skills before.
English and IT skills are considered as critical in improving graduate employability. In order to measure
the effectiveness of the project, these two skills are chosen as main performance indicators. Most
universities improved their IT centers by purchasing computers and establish network systems and
internet facilities. Therefore, additional slots were incorporated into the time tables to provide hands on
experience on it.

Student Learning Environment: Lecture rooms, hostel, student canteens, recreational facilities were
improved in all universities. There is a possibility of increasing student intake in to universities.
Special Needs for Student and Staff Facilities were improved for this purpose by
purchasing special vehicles and equipment, improving washroom facilities, establishing elevators etc.
Therefore, all universities are compelled to admit differently able students.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.      DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES:

1.1 Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Goal: To reorient and improve tertiary
education by making it more supportive for Sri Lanka`s social and economic development needs.

1.2 Project Development Objective: To support the Government`s tertiary education reform program
by enhancing institutional capacities conducive to greater relevance and quality in undergraduate
education.

2. COMPONENTS:

The project was designed to include two major components: a) Building institutional capacity in the tertiary
education system, and b) Improving the relevance and quality of tertiary education.

Component 1 Building institutional capacity in the tertiary education system:

This component has five sub-components, a) building national level capacity, b) strengthening quality
assurance, c) strengthening management capacity at public and private TEIs, d) enhancing public
awareness, and e) monitoring and evaluation.

     a) Building national level capacity: The project has conducted 168 training programmes offering
        benefits to 4148 officials in planning, monitoring and evaluation of HE sector activities. In
        addition, training workshops and awareness programmes conducted under other sub-components
        (i.e. quality assurance, strengthening management capacity at public and private TEIs etc) have
        contributed towards capacity building at national level.
        The accomplishments in capacity building in planning also include research studies and
        consultancies undertaken by the project. During the initial stage of the project, two studies on
        formula based funding were completed and utilized for initial sensitization purposes. The
        adoption of such policies, however, requires the acceptance of the Ministry of Higher Education
        (MOHE) and UGC. The project has also provided additional support to strengthen the Planning
        Unit of the MOHE by sponsoring a major study on "Developing Major Strategies for Better
        Higher Education in Sri Lanka." The consultancy on LMO was not implemented as the Ministry
        of Technical Education and Vocational Training has already set up a Labour Market Information
        System (see para 7of Aide Memoire November 22-29, 2005).

        The development of Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS) has marked a
        satisfactory progress despite a late start. N-HEMIS is hosted in the Servers of the Ministry of
        Higher Education and University of Colombo School of Computing and is accessible from
        www.nhemis.lk. NHEMIS data-marts were implemented at UGC and NEC. Approximately 100
        end-users in the stakeholder organizations were trained to use NHEMIS. MoUs were signed with
        key organizations to provide data to NHEMIS. Higher Education related data from 2007 to 2010
        have been uploaded into the NHEMIS database.

        The implementation of the Higher Education Management Information System (UHEMIS) in the
        universities was delayed due to reasons beyond the control of the IRQUE. However, the Student
        Information System (SIS) module of UHEMIS was installed in all the Universities and is now
        operational in most of the Universities. The HRM and FIN modules of UHEMIS have been
        installed in all the Universities and base-record collection and fine tuning of the system is in
        progress.

b) Strengthening Quality Assurance: This is a major accomplishment of the IRQUE. The Quality
   Assurance and Accreditation Council (QAAC) established in 2005 performed three main
   functions: training, subject reviews, and institutional reviews. The principal achievement of the
   QAA Council is the successful establishment of a national QA function for public universities.
   This has achieved a great deal in last five (5) years, including developing of Codes of Practice (11
   Parts) and a Credit and Qualification Framework, as well as undertaking 10 Institutional Reviews
   out of 15 Institutions, 288 Subject/Programme Reviews out of 320 potential subject reviews and
   13 Reviews out of 15 University Libraries. Also 38 Subject Benchmark Statements were
   developed. During the project life it reviewed 305 subjects/departments/institutions offering
   benefits for more than 32,000 students and 3200 staff members. It has also conducted 146
   awareness programmes and 114 workshops to inculcate quality culture in public universities.
   Some of the vital topics covered under subject review assessments included Curriculum Design,
   Content and Review, Teaching, Learning and Assessment Methods, Skills Development, Quality
   of Students, Student Feedback, Peer Observation, Postgraduate Studies, and Academic Guidance
   and Counseling.

    The Quality Assurance Process of IRQUE was also extended to cover research studies and
    postgraduate degree programs. Information on both research studies and postgraduate
    programmes were compiled and a check list for evaluation of research studies was developed.
    The coverage of 13 universities and 14 libraries within the public university system is also a
    major contribution to enhance quality standards of the university education system. This includes
    13 awareness programs on review of library services and Quality Assurance Handbook for
    University Libraries. The QAAC has presented 8 research papers on quality assurance system in
    Sri Lanka at international conferences. In recognition of this achievement, the UGC has decided
    to treat the Quality Assurance and Accreditation Council (QAAC) as one of its divisions with
    effect from December 2009.

c) Strengthening management of public universities and faculties. This sub-component covers two
   broad categories: (a) Special Programs and (b) Improved Student Services. It also includes grants
   for increased intake of students for IT and Computer Science streams. The allocation of funds
   under this sub-component was implemented through Institutional Block Grants (IBGs). During
   the project life, three rounds of Institutional Block Grants amounting to Rs. 1020.7 Million were
   spent on improving English Language and IT skills, promoting social harmony and catering to the
   special needs of students.

    The achievements of this sub-component of the project are remarkable. It has conducted 116
    programmes in financial planning and management, human resource development, procurement
    procedures and asset management between 2004 and 2010. Its target beneficiaries include
    Lecturers, Engineers, Senior Assistant Bursars (SAB), Accounts Assistants/ Secretaries,
    Technicians and Staff of Finance Units. Further training on procurement procedures have also led
    to capacity building within the HE system and target beneficiaries cover Lecturers, Engineers,
    SARs, SABs, and Technical Officers. Under the same component, the project has also provided
    57 consultancies on financial management, and accounting and procurement.

d) Enhancing public awareness: The project has made a satisfactory progress in building
   consensus on HE sector reforms among the academic community through dissemination of
   information through media campaigns, newsletters and workshops. The project has conducted
   357 awareness programmes and workshops between 2004 and 2009. The number of visits
   (cumulative) to the IRQUE website by 31.5.2010 was 12358. In addition, promotion of awareness
   among the principal stakeholders, the academic community and the student community through
   other modalities such as, IRQUE Newsletters, Newsletters devoted to university related


                                                29
            procurement activities and student managed Newsletters, have also been effective in enhancing
            public awareness on quality and relevance of HE.

 Component 2: Improving relevance and quality of tertiary education
 This includes two sub-components: a) Establishing a Quality Enhancement Fund (QEF) and b) establish
 Tharuna-Aruna II.

     a) Establishing a Quality Enhancement Fund (QEF): The objective of QEF was to allocate resources to
        improve the quality and relevance of undergraduate degree programs in public and private TEI's. The
        award of QEF grants were based on a rigorous evaluation process and facilitated by a series of training
        workshops conducted by the IRQUE on project proposal writing. The response from university sector
        was very positive and the total allocation under QEF was Rs. 2449 million. About 60 percent of these
        funds were given to established universities and the rest was distributed mainly among Mainly Rural
        (15%) Conflict Affected Areas (19%), and Non-UGC Institutes (5%). In terms of field of study, 72
        percent of grants were distributed among Science based study programmes, while the rest was
        shared by Management & Accounting (15%) and Social Science (13%) fields.

        The QEF was extended to cover all faculties of Arts and Humanities in a third round, and a total of Rs.
        260 million was allocated among 14 faculties, providing benefits to 16,000 students and 725
        academic staff members. The QEF support was extended to include the Sri Lanka Institute of
        Advanced Technical Education (SLIATE) and a total of Rs. 60 million was granted for the benefit of
        11 Advanced Technological Institutions representing approximately 9000 students and 190 academic
        staff members.

b)       Tharuna Aruna II Program (Young Professional II program): The objective of this sub-
         component was to enhance the employability of graduates in the private sector. During the first
         two years of implementation, the project provided training for 4352 students and 68 percent
         were females. The number of hours of IT and English courses offered to undergraduates
         between 2004 and 2006 were 380 and the value of vouchers given to students during the same
         period was Rs. 0.13 Million. The number of graduates successfully trained in the Tharuna Aruna
         institutions was 4331. However, the Tharuna Aruna was discontinued in 2006 and funds were
         utilized for Tsunami rehabilitations work.

 In overall terms, the project intervention has resulted in an increase of average IT scores from the baseline
 score of 49 to 56 percent between 2005 and 2008. Similarly, the average value for Software Applications
 has increased from the Baseline of 32% to 52% during the same period, indicating a significant
 improvement during the same period. The average English language score improved from the baseline
 score of 59 percent to 69 percent and the average score for Spoken English (SESOL- Spoken English for
 Speakers of Other Languages) increased from the baseline of 57% to the End-of-Project value of 74%
 during the same period. This could be attributed to significant improvements made to the English
 language laboratories and associated support systems.

 The Average Graduate Grade Point Average (GPA) 2 increased from the baseline value of 2.92 in
 September 2004 to 2.98 in September 2009. Among the faculties of Arts, Social Sciences & Humanities
 the increase of GPA was from the baseline value of 3.02 to 3.16, while the GPA for Management
 programs was from 2.75 to 2.77 during the same period. The Science based programs marked an increase
 from 2.95 to 3.00 between 2004 and 2009.

The IRQUE impact on employability of graduates reveals a significant drop in the Average Waiting Time
for the First Job3 for QEF Batch 1 students from 14.0 months in June 2004 (baseline value) to 4.5 months
in September 2009. Further, the Average Waiting Time for the First Job of the Arts, Social Sciences &
Humanities graduates decreased from the baseline value of 21.6 months (June 2004) to 8.7 months
(September 2009). Similarly, the Average Waiting Time for the First Job of the graduates of Science
based programs decreased from 10.6 months to 3.5 months.

The IRQUE has funded 59 PhDs, and 5 Masters programmes offering benefits to Arts/Humanities/ Social
Sciences, Commerce and Science faculties representing six universities. The quality of training offered by
the IRQUE for both academic and non-academic staff was assessed and the evidence reveals that the
project has provided maximum benefits to target beneficiaries through improved analytical ability,
effective decision making, planning and organizing, operational efficiency and team orientation. The
impact of training assessed in terms of efficiency and effectiveness reveals positive changes with respect
to time management, and promoting continued learning within the organization and efficient use of
human and office resources. Undoubtedly, these changes will have a long-term positive impact on the
overall performance of the university system.

As viewed by the project coordinators, the infrastructure support component of the IRQUE has made
maximum contribution towards efficient utilization of human resources and physical resources, capacity
building of universities, and improving student learning environment and quality of teaching. The
responses of the academics have also affirmed the positive impact of IRQUE in terms of creating
awareness among university academics on quality assurance, curriculum development, career guidance,
and labour market demand for university graduates.

The feedback evidence from students on IRQUE contribution to university system in terms of
infrastructure development, computer facilities, and promoting social harmony reveals that the project
was successful in offering significant benefits to the university community. They also appreciate the
efforts of the project in promoting national development and social harmony among university students.
As viewed by private sector employers4 recently passed out graduates indicate positive attitudes towards
work relative to those who graduated during the pre-project stage.

The overall assessment of IRQUE intervention on a 1 to 5 scale by project coordinators (4.6),
beneficiaries of training (4.3), and university academics on QAAC (4.2) and QEF (4.0) indicate the
fulfillment of expected project outcomes spelt out in PAD (Figure 1). These high ratings by different
stakeholders confirm the major achievements of the IRQUE capacity building, quality assurance, and
monitoring and evaluation components. The average score of 3.9 given by the students confirms positive
changes of the HE system due to IRQUE intervention. The overall rating of 3.2 given by the employers
also reveals positive changes in the HE system and highlights the need for further improvement in quality
and relevance of HE.

6.3 Lessons learned

Project design
It is important to provide clearly defined performance indicators (i.e. input, output and outcome
indicators) in the PAD for efficient progress monitoring of the project. However, Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) performance indicators stated in Annex 1 of the PAD included neither baseline data,
midterm nor end-of-project targets. Further-more, the majority of KPIs outlined in the PAD were
ambiguous and not measurable. This has adversely affected the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
function of the project.

Project management
The project implementation was done by the PPDU at the central level (i.e. at the Ministry of Higher
Education) and through a sub Project Implementation Unit, Local Technical Secretariat (LTS) at
university level. The monitoring of the progress of project activities at the university level was conducted
at the university level on regular basis by the Project Monitoring Committees (PMCs) appointed by the
universities. However, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) frameworks on an earlier stage of the project
was less robust. Subsequently, a system of regular monitoring of different project components/sub-
components was employed at the central level by the PPDU i.e. through quarterly progress reports, mid-
year forum and the annual review.

Conducting tracer studies is one of the data collection strategies stated in PAD and this was not
implemented by the project management. The absence of feedback information on training activities is
also a major data limitation. The project impact on graduate employment was measured at
university/faculty level and the accuracy and the validity of such assessments are questionable.

Institutional and policy support
The absence of institutional support and clear cut policy directives has had a negative impact on project
performance. The situation however improved with the establishment of a separate ministry for HE sector
in 2007. Similarly, the decision of the government in 2004 to take responsibility for providing


                                                    32
employment for university graduates within the public sector raised doubts about the relevance of key
assumptions of the project i.e. enhancing employability of graduates. In view of high labour absorptive
capacity of private sector enterprises and increased access to HE, policy directives on graduate
employment need to be clear and specific.

Procedural delays
The six year project was initially planned for the period, August 2003 to June 2009. However, it was
delayed by about 12 months and its original completion date was extended to June 30, 2010 through a
special request by the Government of Sri Lanka to the World Bank. The delay was due to difficulties in
hiring qualified personnel and the procedural issues.

Enhance public awareness
The achievements of the project need to be brought to the notice of the general public. More specifically,
the progress of policy reforms, investments in quality enhancement activities, improved learning
outcomes and contribution to human capital development need to be highlighted through a continuous
public awareness campaign.

Sub-Project Period ­ 3 Years
In the first round of competition for QEF, 17 grants were awarded (with a maximum of Rs. 100 million
per grant) in 2005 for a period of five years. In the second round (Batch 2), 10 grants were awarded (with
a maximum of Rs. 80 million per grant) for a period of four years. Any project with a life span of 4 to 5
years is too long for the university system due to frequent changes of project personnel (i.e. coordinators
and persons-in-charge of activities). Thus, it is desirable to limit the sub-project period to a maximum of
three years in future project interventions.

Separate Window for Arts/Social science/ Humanities Faculties
The discipline-wise analysis of QEF Batch 1 and 2 grants shows that only four grants were awarded to
arts faculties and departments, while the majority was won by science based faculties. This means only a
few grants were won by arts faculties where the graduate unemployment was relatively high. This may be
partly due to comparative disadvantages faced by faculties in project proposal preparation and
competitive funding. Hence, it is suggested to have a separate window for arts/humanities/social sciences
faculties in future project interventions.




                                                    33
4. Sustainability

4.1 Rationale for sustainability rating: It is likely that the policy reforms and achievements reached
during project implementation will be maintained by the university system if the quality enhancement
processes initiated under IRQUE are continued. The quality of undergraduate study programmes have
improved through project efforts as evidenced by project outcome indicators and feedback information
from university academics, students, project coordinators and non-academic staff. It is anticipated that
these new concepts and good practices would be incorporated into the regular activities of universities. It
should be noted however, that the regularity and quality of project monitoring varied from one university
to another. In this regard, it is essential that clear and strict guidelines on project M&E at the institution
level be provided at the beginning of the project. Further, it is desirable that representatives from outside
the university (e.g. members of the university governing council, representatives of the industry etc.) be
appointed to the PMC at the university level. It will, no doubt, improve the project implementation by
introducing outside views.

The lack of on-line monitoring system could be considered as one of the drawbacks of the M&E system
of the IRQUE project. As a result, the grantees were requested to submit progress reports on a regular
basis, i.e. quarterly, bi-annually, annually etc. Not only had this led to excess paper work by the project
personnel, but also resulted in some inconsistencies in the progress reports. Hence, it is strongly
recommended to computerize future project activities. In other words, a web-based tracking system for
accounting, procurement, and progress monitoring will facilitate regular and accurate project M&E.

Although the achievements across the various components of the project were uneven, the overall
expected outcomes of the project were achieved. Given the resource constraints at national level the stage
is set for another round of external support for HE sector development.

5. Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank

(a) Lending: The Bank's lending performance is rated satisfactory. The project was in accordance with
the country objectives vis-à-vis the higher education sector. The Bank made conscious efforts to consult
with the stakeholders from the higher education sector, as well as other ministries. The Bank engaged in a
fruitful dialogue with MOHE to jointly define the project development objectives and actions to achieve
them. During the IDA missions, the issues relating to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) given in the
PAD were reviewed and modified. Post review of procurement activities were conducted on a regular
basis by different agencies such as World Bank, Internal Audit of the Ministry of Higher Education,
Auditor General's Department and the PPDU. The PPDU as well as the World Bank implemented
mitigatory measures in case of deficiencies or non compliance to set procedures at the right time through
post reviews. Furthermore, issues arising from the post procurement review reports were discussed at
Mid-Year Forums, with the participation of project staff of universities to minimize errors.

 (b) Supervision: The Bank's supervision is rated highly satisfactory. The Bank worked closely with the
Borrower to support its efforts to successfully implement the project. Despite change in the Task Manager,
the dialogue during the implementation process was smooth and both parties sought and found solutions
to facilitate the implementation bottlenecks. The bank supervised the project regularly (twice a year) and
this intensive supervision was one of the major contributing factors in achieving the targets.

The Bank agreed to the request for project extension from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 for all
the components.



                                                     34
(c) Overall Bank performance: The overall performance is rated satisfactory for:
* Good supervision and extension of the life span of the project.
* Flexible response to the needs of the country and the education sector.
* Good team work and communication with the Government.
* Field visits and meetings with the stakeholders and the beneficiaries.
* Strong support in procurement and finance.

All these efforts created a positive relationship between the Bank and the Borrower that led to successful
project implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Borrower performance rated satisfactory.
