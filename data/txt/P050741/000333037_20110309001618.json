"Ratings for the Improving Relevance and\n            Quality of Undergraduate Education Project for Sri Lanka\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is essential\n            to rally the university community and the general public at\n            large around policy reforms in higher education by using\n            robust public awareness campaigns publicizing the impact of\n            investments in quality enhancement activities, and improved\n            student learning outcomes. Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) in project design should have sufficient details\n            on performance indicators (i.e. input, output and outcome\n            indicators) relating to various components and\n            sub-components. This is critical for the effective\n            monitoring and evaluation of projects during the\n            implementation. Similarly, the establishment of baseline\n            values and the projection of target values at project\n            inception are important. Frequent stakeholder consultation\n            involving university and industry can improve the quality\n            and relevance to suit the changing needs. In doing so,\n            industry sectors can provide continuous feedbacks to the\n            university community. This, in turn, will strengthen the\n            linkage between academic and industry."}, "docdt": "2010-12-07T00:00:00Z"}
